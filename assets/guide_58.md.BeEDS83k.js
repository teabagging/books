Discovering that one of its specific textual errors made my specific task impossible, I wrote the following.If Amazon let me increase my rating, at this point I would, but I maintain that it is unpolished and desperately under-edited..: end edit :.As a freshman engineering major, I have been compelled to use Technical Drawing for a graphics course. This has been a profoundly frustrating experience. It seems that the authors, in their zeal to attain unto the dry, lifeless style characteristic of most professional engineering publications, also unintentionally created a text which is superlatively unclear.I am recurrently astonished at the utter incomprehensibility of entire paragraphs. I will read a section, cynically assert that it communicates nothing, read it over a dozen more times, show it to others who in turn read it a dozen times, only to have my first conclusion affirmed.There are extremely blatant contradictions.Terms are used at the beginning of a chapter and not defined until the end.It speaks voluminously about how critical it is to follow the prescribed techniques, only to devote less-than-the-bare-minimum amount of space to the actual descriptions of those techniques.The review questions are frequently unrelated to the content they are supposed to be reinforcing, or are simply placed in the wrong chapter.This (expensive!) book is a conspicuous example of \\"writing by committee.\\" Technical Drawing may well be a decent-enough reference book - useful if you need a reminder about material you already know - but expect to get angry at it, especially if you're learning the information for the first time."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is loaded with technical information for the dratsman and designer. A must have for anyone who is in the mechanical technology field."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This text was the basic drafting manual that I used during my technical education; its use did not end with school, however, since I refer to it frequently in my occupation. It tells everything that needs to be explained and described in the general drawing problems that might be encountered in industrial practice. It contains excellent descriptions and illustrations for: Drawing Threads, Fasteners &amp; Springs Geometric Constructions Clear, Concise instructions in using Drafting Instruments, (before the time of Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Desing, in any case).

Readers will indeed learn about and develop precision drawing skills--whether drawing with instruments or computer.The true value of this book is in its ability to guide and therefore transform the natural artist's raw talent into that of a professional grade design artist--capable of rendering technical depictions, representations, or designs, at any time, with little effort, and without error. As with learning to walk, this of course takes time, patience, and practice.I have personally witnessed the struggles of many whom, having necessity to complete a course of study based upon this book, were ill-suited by their own admission for the discipline required of the eye, hand, and attention (or mind) as demanded by the capable sketch artist--to say nothing of the trained detail design drafter.If realizing the instructional value of Technical Drawing, 12th edition, seems to come at great pain and effort, the obvious question clearly becomes one of aptitude for drawing. However, while the aptitude for drawing is extremely beneficial, proficiency in technical drawing can still be achieved by sheer tenacity.Technical Drawing, 12th edition, as with previous editions, is therefore highly recommended for the tenacious engineer, designer and drafter. It has stood the test of time as a solid component of engineering design instruction in this nation's premiere academic institutions."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"When originally published, this decades old book had exercises dimensioned in inches only. When the authors decided to include some exercises with metric dimensions, they reused old drawings, converted the measurements from inches to millimeters, rounded off to one decimal place, and DID NOT CHECK FOR ACCURACY. Every chapter has exercises with inaccurately dimensioned drawings.My AutoCAD teacher has taught this class for 27 years. Years ago he wrote the authors with corrections. Nevertheless, each new edition reproduced the same errors. My instructor gave up trying to get the authors to correct their work.As an AutoCAD student, I find the sloppiness of this book appalling. Technical drafting requires a high degree of accuracy. The whole point of drafting is precision, whether you're building a house, designing a chip, or modeling an object. This is like a color theory book published with only three out of the four colors necessary for full color.I paid a premium for the latest edition, the 13th. Don't make the same mistake! Try to find an old edition, published by the original Giesecke, with dimensions in inches only. As my teacher explained in disgust, every new edition costs a lot more for no additional value. The 13th edition has full color photographs, and for that I paid an extra $25 over the 12th. One of my classmates has a 5th edition with only line drawings, no photos, no color, but IT HAS ACCURATE DRAWINGS. It would probably cost a lot less than the $80+ I paid for the 13th edition, too."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is an excellent reference for anyone needing an introduction to or a reference for technical drawing. Most of the content concerning machine component drawings are geared (no pun intended) more toward traditional methods for technical drawings (i.e. compass, ruler and pencil), but the methods given are well suited to modern computer-oriented methods of solid modeling. Engineers in the manufacturing industry will find it especially useful, as it can be a helpful reference for weldment drawings."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"The thing this book does best is demonstrate the inferiority of 2D drafting when compared with 3D modeling. In several parts, the 2D documentation of the parts glosses over some of the more complex implications, and simply leaves it to someone else downstream to figure out. If you try to build some of the example parts in 3D, you see that the dimensions in probably 40% of the parts I worked through simply don't add up.Shouldn't the book at least describe the concept of draft on example parts that are for the most part cast and forged parts? Some of the example parts become extremely difficult if you consider draft.Also there is the combination of some very dated material with some semi-modern entries, especially when covering computer hardware. This kind of thing is almost impossible to cover in a published hardcopy because the computer hardware has gone through two generations between writing and distribution of the book.On the plus side, it does have some nice examples, but this is far from complete if it is being used to prepare college students for jobs in the 2000's."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"The book arrived on time and for that I have no problem, the shipping service worked great.

The first being a fairly good book. I then read Diaz's account of what happened and found that it not only improved the Gary Jennings books, but it also highlighted that there is more than one side to this story. The Aztec, the many factions of Aztecs, the surrounding cultures (Mayans etc...) who allied with the Spanish, and the Spanish (with their different political and religious ties). Drama, heriocs, cowardice, indifference... all the makings of an incredible story, and all subjectively true (I'm sure most of the events are factual, they are all just subjective). This book is history told through vivid, first hand narrative. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This is an outstanding account of the conquest of Mexico. From the beginning of the book, readers are pulled into the incredible story of Hernanado Cortez and a small band of Spanish conquistadors, as they march relentlessly toward a showdown with the Aztec Empire. The author, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, wrote this book many years after the conquest, but his narrative is riveting and his descriptions seemingly unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"Recently, I went on a trip to Mexico to visit Mexico City and tour the state of Oaxaca. I checked this book out of the library in advance of the trip to gain a little background on the region. Unfortunately, this was during the holidays and a I had house full of company so I didn't get far into before I left on my trip. When I returned I purchased this copy from an Amazon book seller.This is the most authentic and interesting book I have ever read on Mexican History. Written by Bernal Diaz Del Castillo, a soldier who served under Hernan Cortes in the late 1500s - 1600s during all the Spanish conquests of Central America and South America, he provides an eye witness account of many of the significant events of the conquest. Even discounting the fact that he wrote this is his advanced years and has a bias towards the point of view of the Spaniards his book is far more accurate than anything else out there. I was pleasantly surprised by his writing style. His book is very readable and he is a natural story teller.Even the little I managed to get through before my trip brought everything to life. I could actually follow along the historical themes of the Diego Rivera murals in the National Palace in Mexico City. Seeing Popo spew gas and steam was much as Castillo described 400 years ago. And in visiting archaeology sites and small villages in and near Mexico City, Puebla, and throughout Oaxaca one can still get a feel for the vastness and sophistication of the pre-Hispanic cultures that thrived throughout the region. The abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables give further testimony to the thriving cultures that existed there and the diet remains heavily based on corn, chilis, and use of various parts of cactus plants. The ancient techniques for weaving, pottery making, wood carving and candle making are still in practice today, though perhaps as much for the touristes as other reasons. The Catholic influence is highly evident. It began with those early efforts of Cortes who \\"encouraged\\" the populations to embrace Christianity. There were so many churches, many heavily laden with gold.If you are planning a trip to Mexico (beyond the beach towns) I highly recommend reading this book before you go."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This seller was excellent to work with and did a great job, even Christmas wrapping it inside the brown shipping paper."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This is an excellent account of the Spanish invasion of the Aztec world. Obviously a lot of bias in favour of the spaniards occurs throughout the book but in general this is a good read of how Cortez and his men achieved what was an almost impossible task."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This is an excelent book, very interesting, especially when you read the beautiful selection of words chosen by Bernal Diaz, making it a true literary treasure. This authentic gem was left to us as a legacy of one of the most amazing pages of history. Despite of Bernal's kind language and despite of the false impression many would have of Hernan Cortes and his army, they were nothing but a group of bandits obsessed and full of lust for gold, destroying everything on their path with the excuse of &quot;sharing the scriptures&quot;. Somebody had mentioned that the indians were not as humble,peaceful and earth-hugging victims as we've always believed, but for all of those &quot;free-thinkers&quot;, remember that history is always written by the winners. Se&ntilde;or Bernal's version does not mention and subtly conceals the genocide afflicted by the spaniards, which does not compare at all to the religiously-justified human sacrifices the indians performed at the time. Anyhow, do yourself a favor, don't wait for the movie and procure this amazing book."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"I have never seen a book that loses so much with its translation.

Stay away !!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"Several decades ago, as a college sophomore, I was assigned to read Bernal D&iacute;az' work as part of a Latin American history course. The title did not give me much hope. I imagined having to force myself to sit at a desk night after night in order to finish the book. To my great surprise, once I began to read this incredible eye-witness account, I could not put it down. Still, some 38 years later, Bernal D&iacute;az' story, as one of the soldiers who accompanied Cort&eacute;s, remains forever as one of the best books I have ever read on any subject.Vivid, eye-witness description of the whole story of the Conquest of Mexico in 1519 will rivet you to the pages, if you have even the slightest sense of history or desire to imagine strange events in faroff places. Here is the tale of how the Spanish soldiers, led by Cort&eacute;s, despite tremendous odds, toppled an ancient civilization, destroying it utterly, and began a new society that would eventually become modern Mexico. Where else are you going to read words like these, describing the Spaniards' first arrival in Tenochtitlan, which would become Mexico City ? \\"When we saw so many cities and villages built both in the water and on dry land, and this straight, level causeway, we couldn't restrain our admiration. It was like the enchantments told about in the book of Amadis, because of the high towers, temples, and other buildings, all of masonry, which rose from the water. Some of our soldiers asked if what we saw was not a dream.\\" Alliances, intrigues, battles, retributions, strange gods and the clash of utterly different cultures fill this amazing book. If you have any fondness for history, if you have any curiosity about vanished civilizations, if you would like to ponder about Fate with more substance than usual (!), then Bernal D&iacute;az is your man. Do not pass this book by."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"Let me share with you one of the most beautiful reveiws of Bernal's epic, writen by the great Guatemalan writer and poet Luis Cardoza y Arag&oacute;n (from his book &quot;Guatemala: The Lines of Her Palm&quot;, translated into English by Michelle Suderman): I started leafing through The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico at my student's desk, at night by lamplight. I skimmed summaries, the odd page, then began my reading in an orderly fashion. Tirelessly, I penetrated further and further into the enchanted forest, mesmerized by the story and by this encounter with my warrior culture, with the conquest. I was entering a distant and fascinating world. I witnessed and experienced the legendary campaign. I saw and heard it. I smelled its odor of iron, gunpowder and tired bodies. I was awed by the descriptions of Tenochtitlan, the markets and Moctezuma's court. The blood looked fresh on the steps of the pyramids. As Humboldt points out, the exhilaration of a newly discovered world is better transmitted by chroniclers than by poets. My first contact with this work was positively prodigious. Exhaustion came after reading for many hours without being able to stop. Captivated by descriptions and memories, I kept going, reading a little more, just a little more. I finally left off when the light of the new day began singing in my window. This is the most comprehensive work on the conquest of America, though it speaks only of New Spain. It contains a wealth of information, and details of all orders, that we do not find in posterior writings on related events-not even adding them together. It was written in Antigua Guatemala, where D&iacute;az del Castillo took up residence in 1545 at the age of forty-nine, and where he died in 1584 after having lived there for about thirty-nine years. He was an old man when he wrote his Discovery and Conquest, nearly half a century after the siege of Mexico Tenochtitlan and the conquest of Guatemala. Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo's chronicle is the most important and engaging of all, the most truthful and comprehensive account of the conquest of America. He wrote it not only in his quest for truth, to refute the chronicles of Cort&eacute;s's chaplain, G&oacute;mara, and his followers, but out of a need to relive the conquest, out of the same hunger that engendered Don Quixote in Cervantes. Old wounds were opened as he wrote: he himself confesses that he slept with his arms loaded, and that in his old age, he slept fully dressed, accustomed to the exhausting days he spent in Mexico. He was twice conqueror, but the true conquest was the one he carried out seated at his desk, still wearing armor, but no longer wielding the saber.There are very close ties between this work and the author's life. There was nothing else he could have written. His heart was spilling over with it. Chroniclers would write of the Peru campaigns, campaigns against Turkey, Flanders or Italy, of strangers fighting strangers. D&iacute;az del Castillo wrote about his life and about the land where he placed it at risk countless times. That is what makes his work unique, superior to the writings of historians for the perfect spontaneity of his testimony. He is the unknown soldier, the sweating troops bearing their arms and spoils, walking alongside the chief's mount; through him, they were given a voice, immorality. Pen in hand, he became the great adventurer, with the same fury as when he wielded his sword, with the faith that made his companions envision St James slaughtering Indians in the name of the Lord. He left us the conquest, fresh and bloody, gasping for all eternity."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This story might have been rejected as too far-fetched if it were offered as fiction, but it is history. The fact is that Bernal Diaz was an eyewitness to the entire Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, led by Hernan Cortes. The tale he so eloquently lays out for us in these pages ranks with the most interesting historical epics of all time.Consider that when the Spanish arrived at the Mexican Gulf Coast in their galleons, the Aztecs had never seen ships, horses, steel swords, or even white men. In another bizarre twist, red-headed Cortes matched the description of a great Aztec god whose arrival signaled the end of their civilization. When word of this omen reached the ears of the great Aztec leader Montezuma in Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), he wept in panic. This arrival is comparable to a huge space ship landing on the White House lawn, and having an army of ray-gun-wielding aliens emerge to conquer us.As Diaz points out, Cortes was quite a leader and driven man. To prevent mutiny once he'd opted to pursue conquest inland, he destroyed his own ships. He then sets out, hopelessly out-numbered, to conquer the Aztecs. In the next year, his tiny army either wins over or defeats all comers--including a second arrival of Spanish intending to destroy him. He makes his way to the incredibly rich and magnificent city of Tenochtitlan, and then the excitement begins.Over the centuries, Cortes' brutal tactics have come under criticism. Conquest is rarely politically correct. We must remember the time and context, though. Cortes and Spain were spanning the globe in search of gold, but also to convert the masses to Christianity. They believed they were doing God's work, particularly after being introduced to the Aztec's practice of human sacrifice. Diaz does not attempt to justify the motives. He simply tells the tale, and what a tale it is. Most highly recommended. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"It is something of a rarity to find a book that comprehensivly discusses an historical topic and yet still maintains our interest. Bernal Diaz manages to do this. His account of the Conquest of Mexico, from the perspective of a common foot soldier, is more enlightening than the letters sent back by Cortes purely because he has nothing to justify. Bernal Diaz attempts to give us an accurate representation of the events that somehow led to the defeat of the numerically huge Aztec Empire by the small force of Spaniards. It is full of contradictions, full of internal tensions, and it is these factors that make the book so compelling. The motivation of the conquistadores is laid bare, but never explicitly; Diaz is careful to highlight that they were working for the greater glory of the Catholic church, but the promise of gold suffuses every word. Moreover, Diaz begins to establish the untrue cliches that people churned out about the conquest for centuries, whilst still manageing to undercut what he says by his uncertainty. He obviously holds a great deal of respect for the Aztec warriors, and demonstrates genuine fear. This is not an account of unlimited glory and genius leadership by Hernan Cortes. Diaz implicitly shows the flaws in the Spanish judgement and, even though he was embroiled in the events, Diaz helps us to learn the importance of factors outside the control of the Spanish that aided the conquest (disease, the thousands of native troops who fought with the Spaniards, the inefficient tribute network, cultural misunderstandings, etc). I would recommend Ross Hassig to anybody interested in Aztec methods of attack, and Inga Clendennin for more general information regarding Aztec culture. Miguel Leon-Portilla offers an invaluable indigenous account."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This work by Bernal Diaz, gives an eyewitness account of a world that will never be seen again. His style is hardly that of a professional writer but his attention to detail paints vivid images of the events that forever changed the face and personality of Mexico. It may be necessary to put aside any predisposition to make either lead character a villain or hero. This work shows both the humanity and ferocity of Spaniard and the native tribes of Mexico as they each struggle for dominance. It begins with expeditions into the Yucatan and leads to the union of the author and the army of Hernan Cortes. Although there seems to be some enhancement of his own importance to Cortes and the expedition, Diaz tells, from a soldiers perspective, both the marvel and the horror of two great nations as their cultural and religious beliefs fatally collide.One can see the shwredness of Cortes as he rallied one tribe after another to help him get to the Aztec Emperor. Observe the strategy used by both leaders as they tested each other's resolve in the months that Cortes approached and entered Tenochtitlan.Diaz descibes with intimate detail the great city, it's 20 story pyramids and magnificent palace. Even the physical appearance and the depth of Emperor Moctezuma's character are meticulously accounted.You can feel the desperation of the attack against and the near catastrophic escape of the Spaniards from the island city on &quot;La noche triste&quot;, as well as see Diaz's account of the apparently intentioned introduction of small pox to Mexico by a rival conquistador.Finally, after two years in a ruthless game of chess, the return to the climactic seige and clash of two great armies perhaps unequalled in size, in a single battle, in the western world until the U.S. Civil War. No writer of fiction could have imagined this both exciting and tragic account."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"Review by Tom rederiksen - http://members.aol.com/spdtom/index.html -AZTEC STUDENT TEACHER RESOURCE CENTER: Diaz is an accomplished writer and I was impressed with his attention to detail as it related to the daily life and inter-personal relationships between the Conquistadors. This is a fairly long book but reads easily and anyone that enjoys a good adventure or mystery novel will find this an interesting book. As there are precious few first hand accounts from this time period, this first hand narrative is a must read for anyone getting started in the study of the Mexican conquest time period. This book was written rather late in life by the author. Supposedly, Diaz read a copy of a book by Lopez de Gomara, Chronicle of the Conquest of New Spain, and was so outraged by references to &quot;Cortes this&quot;, and &quot;Cortes that&quot;, that the oldsoldier penned this classic. Were it not for the work of Diaz, the world would not have a comprehensive record of the conquest. A must read."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, Bernal Diaz provides in great depth the CONQUEST OF MEXICO and the fall of the Mexica(Aztecs). For anyone interested in Mexican History or the history of the Western Hemisphere in general, this is a must. The chapters are short and easy to read, as well as addicting, especially during the final siege of Mexico. This is a great book to read especially if you're from Zapotlanejo, Jalisco or from Norwalk, California. This book is a great stepping stone on the subject and one should also check out Letters from Mexico(letters from Cortes himself) and Broken Spears(the Aztec account of the Conquest). Orale!"},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"This is one of only two books that I always make sure to keep in duplicate. (The other is The Path Between the Seas about building the Panama Canal.) Not only do people refuse to return it (I live where they cannot go out and buy their own), but I might NEED it at any time...just so I can enthuse over it. I've read it twice, and think I may read it again soon. I DO read Spanish, but the English is OK, too, since the Spanish of Diaz is more difficult than what we use now and needed editing badly due to prolixity, redundancy, etc.Bernal Diaz was WITH Cortez for the entire campaign to conquer Montezuma's Mexico, and he wrote about it in his old age. You are getting an eye-witness account of one of the most incredible episodes in world history, and you'd better believe it's exciting, even nail-biting, to be there in person, so to speak. Historians will tell you that his memory was not perfect, but not that bad, either. He pretty much nails it."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"Forget political correctness and historical revisionism; read this with an open mind.

The best Hollywood screenwriters couldn't invent this adventure though I bet it's influenced many writers."},{"Title":"The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico","review":"Quite simply, this is an amazing read. An eyewitness account of the Spanish march to modern day Mexico, it spares few details.Of particular interest is the feud between the two Spanish camps early on and the manner in which it was resolved. Then to top it off, there is the slow and arduous march toward central Mexico, with alliances forged and broken, and diplomatic gestures galore. The account of the what is now Mexico City is breathtaking. Often times, I felt as if I were reading about some kind of world created in a J.R.R.

I've got to say, of all of Jessica's random guys, Nick is the only one I actually liked, in character and in story. He's a great guy, and I'm just disappointed we didn't get a better ending for his story (and here, my first ever fanficis born XD). I also enjoy reading about Enid/Alex, despite the minor role she plays, but she's finally starting to grow out of Alex, it seems, and that's great. And Celine's just a psychopath.Anyways, the whole book is just filler, IMO, the real action is in the books after this..."},{"Title":"Busted!

Unfortunately it proved to be not very useful for the following reasons:(1) There are several long 8va passages. Give me ledger lines any day! 8va's are like clef changes - hard to process on the fly. For intermediate players this may be okay since it gives them the option of playing the melody in the lower octave.(2) Key for Mendelssohn's Wedding March was changed from the original C major to A-flat (4 flats). Not only is the key more difficult, it doesn't sound quite as good.(3) The violin/flute part for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring only has the chorale melody. The triplet melody that this piece is best known for is in the piano accompaniment, which is okay unless you plan to play this piece solo.A much better collection is the Violin &amp; Piano Wedding Collection from Latham Music Ltd.

Great detail, easy to read, easy to understand."},{"Title":"Twilight Zone Collector's Edition (Trade Ins, 3rd from the Sun, Fever, and Prime Mover)","review":"A married couple that has grown old together and is still deeply in love is a tender, rare and precious thing. In \\"The Trade-Ins\\" John and Marie Holt are such a couple, although their bodies are failing. Technology has advanced to the point where they can trade their old and failing bodies for new models. Unfortunately, they only have enough money for one transfer.In a desperate attempt to make the rest of the money, John enters a poker game and is on the verge of losing all his money. For odd reasons, one of the players allows him to win the final pot that leaves him with his original stake. After some deliberation, Marie insists that John have the transfer done as he can then earn the money that she will need for her transfer. John has it done and he comes out a new, young and vigorous man. However, after he looks at Marie, he goes back and has the process reversed. The show ends with them walking away with their arms locked.The premise of youth regained is one that has been widely used in literature, especially science fiction. This episode emphasizes some of the major downsides to such a procedure, the expense and the dramatic psychological effect it would have on you relative to your loved ones. John realized that his vigorous body would reject his beloved Marie so he made the most loving and caring decision of his life.\\"Third From the Sun\\" is another episode that uses the premise of the fear of a nuclear holocaust, yet has an interesting and ironic twist. Scientist William Sturka works at a facility where weapons of mass destruction are created and Jerry Riden is a test pilot that has just flown a prototype of a space ship. They plot to steal the ship and take their families to another planet, so they concoct the premise of a card game to make their final plans. Their society is one of deep suspicion of loyalties, so they must plan in secret to avoid being discovered. Although they are careful, their actions arouse the suspicions of Carling, a security thug. They are able to make it to the space ship and after a brief battle with Carling and other security personnel, they manage to load their families and fly off to the third planet from another star, one the local inhabitants call Earth.The premise that societies on other planets face the same doomsday scenarios that Earth went through is a depressing one. With so many different levels of fear and paranoia in American society in 1960, this episode played well to the mass psychology of the times. Those of us that lived through it remember it well, the next generation has no idea about the things that we took for granted, such as learning how to \\"duck and cover.\\"\\"The Fever\\" is a very good episode, while it describes gambling fever, the same concept could also be applied to drugs. Flora Gibbs wins an all-expense paid trip to Las Vegas for her and her husband Franklin. Franklin is an extreme moralist, believing and stating forcefully that gambling is a sin for suckers. However, once he plays a single coin for another and wins, the slot machine has him hooked. His desire for gambling becomes an immediate obsession; he stays at the same machine and gambles through all the money in their checking account. All attempts by Flora to pull him away from the machine fail and even after their money is gone, the fever controls him. So much so that he hallucinates and sees the slot machine in front of him and taunting him. This unnerves him to the extent that he backs away in fear and falls through the window to his death.One of the most traveled paths to addiction is the one that begins with initial rejection of the vice with an initial feeling of superiority. The internal thought, \\"I can handle it\\" is generally false and often leads to the path of loosing control. Franklin is an unpleasant man, his initial treatment of his sweet wife is atrocious and the message of this episode is that a feeling of superiority is often the first step on a road to ruin.The casting of \\"The Prime Mover\\" was superbly done and the two lead males play their roles to perfection. Dane Clark plays Ace Larson and Buddy Ebsen plays Jimbo Cobb. The two men are partners in running a small cafe in Nevada and Ace is full of spirit while Jimbo is more relaxed in his approach to the world. The men share a room and Ace wants to marry his waitress but there is a chronic lack of money. When a car crashes, Ace is astounded to learn that Jimbo has the power of telekinesis as he lifts the car up and away from power lines.Ace immediately realizes the significance of the opportunity so Jimbo, Ace and the waitress head to Las Vegas where Jimbo manipulates the dice at the craps table to win a fortune. However, Ace is not satisfied with those winnings, his plans enter the realm of megalomania and are about to cost him his fianc&eacute;. Jimbo, being a practical and humble man despite his power, claims that it has been overused and has gone away, so Ace loses everything. Humbled, yet not bitter Ace realizes the error of his ways and the three of them go back to their cafe and their former life.The rags to riches to rags plot is well worn yet is superbly done here. The contrasting characters of Ace and Jimbo and how well they are played makes this story work very well. Ebsen is superb as the simple yet very wise Jimbo, loyal to his friends throughout and seemingly uninterested in personal advancement."},{"Title":"Twilight Zone Collector's Edition (Trade Ins, 3rd from the Sun, Fever, and Prime Mover)","review":"One of Rod Serling's favorite themes on \\"The Twilight Zone\\" was that of people being given a second chance. This is a strong element in most of the four episodes collected on this videotape in \\"'Twilight Zone' Collector's Edition,\\" although gambling is often part of the equation as well.Episode 96, \\"The Trade-Ins\\" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired April 20, 1962) features veteran actors Joseph Schildkraut and Alma Platt as John and Marie Holt, who visit the New Life Corporation hoping to translate their personalities into beautiful young, artificial bodies. However, they only have enough money for ONE operation. This episode is my favorite \\"Twilight Zone\\" love story, made all the more effective by the performances of Schildkraut and Platt. Just be forewarned, this is the best episode on the tape.Episode 14, \\"Third from the Sun\\" (Written by Serling from a Richard Matheson short story, First aired January 8, 1960) is about the end of the world (almost). The episode tells of scientist William Sturka (Fritz Weaver), who is convinced the world is about to end in a nuclear war. Along with test pilot Jerry Riden (Joe Maross), they escape with their families to a new planet. This is one of those episodes that is going to be more effective for those who were not weaned on \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" because most of us can see the twist coming at the end of this one. Yes, the spaceship used in this episode is the one from the classic 1956 film \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"Episode 57, \\"The Prime Mover\\" (Written by Charles Beaumont based on an unpublished story by George Clayton Johnson, First aired March 24, 1961) has Buddy Ebsen plays Jimbo Cobb the title characters of \\"The Prime Mover,\\" who runs a cafe, has psychokinetic power and when his partner Ace Larsen (Dane Clark) discovers Jimbo's power would allow him to manipulate dice, they head for Las Vegas. The pair win big, but Ace cannot stop gambling, despite the pleas of his girlfriend Kitty (Christine White) and Jimbo, who cares more about his friend than all the money in the world. Ebsen and Larsen play well off each other and the story takes the notion of compulsive gambling seriously.Episode 17, \\"The Fever\\" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired January 29, 1960) stars Everett Sloane as Franklin Gibbs, a tight-fisted man whose wife Flora (Vivi Janiss) wins a trip for two to Las Vegas. Franklin hates the whole idea, but when a drunk gives him a silver dollar and gets him to play a slot machine, everything changes. Not only does the machine pay off, but Franklin can hear the one-armed bandit calling his name and simply cannot stop playing. Sloane, who had starred in Serling's classic \\"Playhouse 90\\" drama \\"Patterns,\\" makes this one work with his performance as his character does a 90-degree turn and ends up losing absolutely everything. Neither of these last two are classic Zones, but they make a nice matched-pair."},{"Title":"Five-Minute Erotica","review":"A good collection of short sexy iterludes. No plots, no characterization -- just sex! Great for a quick \\"change of pace\\" from other reading."},{"Title":"Five-Minute Erotica","review":"You always know where a smut story is going to end up; you just don't necessarily know the path it will take. So, when you're promised a story will get you there in five minutes, there is no time, no time whatsoever, for anything but moving directly to the wham-bam. So, don't expect too much in the way of character development, backstory, motivation or setting. There is no time for intrigue, seduction, or suspense, no time at all for denouement and deeply meaningful epilogue. You won't even get clothing descriptions, unless it's a reference to something that's being removed. What do you expect in five minutes, after all?This book delivered completely.It works, and works rather well. This stuff is short and sweet, and you know what you're getting up front. The book reads fast, and you can wolf this whole thing down in less than an hour if you really get into it. Some stories here were achingly predictable and equally trite, but there were no bad stories, no turn-offs, nothing unsavory or offensive. This is outstanding bedtime reading, whether you're having one or five.Carol Queen's intro specifically says the stories are aimed at hetero women. I did not get that vibe from reading the stories. The author representation is 66% female. Interestingly, there are a number of stories by both male and female authors writing to the other gender's point of view; and they worked, for the most part.You've got 35 stories in 121 pages. For the smut-nerds out there, that's 3.45714 pages per story, with the longest story coming in at a whopping five pages and the shortest being Cecilia Tan's unfortunately introductory, numbing, strangely non-erotic, one-sentence one-pager writing exercise on seduction. There's a short--of course--introduction from editor Carol Queen. And there are little author thumbnail bio's at the end, which are interesting reading themselves.I don't really see this collection as an addition to your sex life, not unless you take these vignettes out for an emulatory spin. If so, I offer my heartiest approval and moral support. But, sitting in bed and reading these aloud; they just don't have the development and lushness of prose that would suit the charged reading of classic lyrical erotica. Save this for deSade, Pauline Reage, etc. Now, this collection as a personal warm-up to then attack your significant other? Yes, most definitely; I encourage this in all forms.And what of the content? Overall, it was pretty straightforward, with just a little bit of accessible fringe. There were a couple of threesomes, both of which were well done, one of them replete with interesting grammatical construction and evocative vocab. There was one spanky story. But no BDSM, no water sports, leather, latex, farther-out fetish play or anything too far from the \\"normal\\" curve. There are a couple of lesbian and gay stories, for good measure, but the content is overwhelmingly hetero.There are a couple of power-transfer-themed stories, including \\"Power Game\\" and \\"Captain, May I?\\" They're not bad, but relatively tame. There's even a delightfully naughty alien abduction entry, which I thought was quite enjoyable. There was a bit of the mainstream naughty romance novel in \\"The Fever.\\" \\"The Magician's Assistant\\" was very good, a quick study in reflection, with no real contact or action at all, just a mature and confident woman musing on the possible and the likely; I particularly liked this one. I also very much enjoyed \\"Restaurant Opening,\\" about a bored and under-appreciated wife who gives a delicious gift to another diner. Then there was \\"Subway,\\" about a quick and anonymous encounter in a temporarily stopped and pitch-black subway car, also quite good.But yes, there was disappointment, too. You know, despite this book's content and the fact that it's a paperback, this is no pulp book. But why does the presentation often strike me that way? There are paragraphs missing indentation, incorrect pronoun usage, verb tense inconsistency, inconsistent use of quotation marks, and more. My copy had over a dozen instances of dropped lines, the equivalent of a carriage return smack in the middle of a sentence.Where is the editing? The \\"For You\\" story has slushpile lines like, \\"...my hands take your soft blouse apart\\" when it's clear \\"my hands open your soft blouse\\" is meant. Then comes the nonsensical \\"...the tension becomes voluptuous,\\" and a passage talking about \\"...moving my wide-mouthed sucking lips...\\" I know what is being related here, but this is just awful. The \\"Under the Camel Light\\" story has a passage where the narrator says, \\"I straddled my legs...\\" What? The \\"Disco Nap\\" story notes an erogenous zone \\"...behind your kneecaps,\\" when \\"behind your knees\\" was the clear intent. All together this is nothing but bad editing followed by bad technical editing and proofing. This is shoddy publishing; Running Press, give me a call, and we'll talk competent editing services.Bottom line: This is a quick read, one story at a time, or the entire book in a single heady rush. There are no bad stories, and some decidedly more imaginative than others, all of which move more than quickly enough to seize and hold your attention. There are surprisingly frequent editorial mistakes throughout, but none of sufficient magnitude to detract from the varied and interesting erotic matter at hand."},{"Title":"Five-Minute Erotica","review":"Five-Minute Erotica is a book of 35 short stories. As are the stories, the cover is tasteful and quite sensual.

Mmmm. Get the book and I'm sure you'll agree."},{"Title":"Five-Minute Erotica","review":"This is good, it isn't overly racy...it is a little conservative and on the tame side, but also very polished and sophisticated.I think that experienced readers of erotic romance novels would not be satisfied with this collection as the stories are three to four pages each and therefore don't build to a suspenseful crescendo. For readers searching for a tasteful introduction to erotica, this has some beautiful work and there is something for everyone and every age between it's pages."},{"Title":"Five-Minute Erotica","review":"A very enjoyable book with bite size stories that don't waffle about with excess padding. The storyline is established and cuts to the action very quickly. It is a collection of erotic stories by different writers so each has a different style and feel about it. That is not a bad thing and on the whole most of the stories are excellent. The odd one, perhaps leaves you feeling a bit short, you feel they could have taken the bit in their teeth (or something else) and taken the story on a bit further, but on the whole it is very good. I found that it was a good book to open for a few minutes read to perk you up for the day. I particularly liked THE BOUNTY OF SUMMER by Carol Queen, that was very erotic story. I would highly recommend the book. Another book I would recommend that you have a look at, which has perhaps a stronger sexual content, is 100 PERCENT EROTICA by Suzie Van Aartman.

Not good, but not as bad as the rest. This book is simply terrible. I'm not sure what else to say about it that could accurately portray just how horrible it really is. The sex is not sexy. It's not erotic. The general idea of \\"sexy\\" in this book is using the 'c word' in a poorly constructed sentence or in a midst of purple prose or in a formulaic bland scene. The writing and prose is juvenile, boring and pathetic. If this were something someone posted online for fun, or fanfic, then it would be expected to be at such a substandard level.

I have to admit I was very intreagued and ended up purchasing four different books. This was one of them.Each story lives up to the \\"five minute\\" rule and were very easy to read. I liked some stories more than I liked others. Some left more to the imagination than others. On a whole the book was a really good read and there were no stories that left me feeling disappointed.I liked the variety that was offered by the books. From stories having only play to those that had full blown sex, and those that had both, each story was written well. There were no glaring errors. There was one story that I had to read parts of again as I wasn't sure what the author meant but in a book of over 40 stories that's pretty good going.For those just getting started with this genre this is a perfect book to start with.

My story was a happy one--many others are not so happy.I am not a professional writer--though many of the pieces which make up this work were submitted by professionals. I am one man who told his own story, part of the fabric of our community. If you are looking for a neat, easily packaged description of the greater gay and lesbian community, skip this book.It does not provide &quot;sound bites,&quot; easy answers or psycho-babble; instead it lets the community speak on its own behalf, and the landscape of today and the roadmap for tomorrow it presents is all the richer for it.

When I was a kid, my oldest brother, who was seven years older than I, had a huge collection of Archie comics, all from the mid 1960's through the early 1970's. He had them in a big box in his closet and I would go in and read them over and over. More than any other era Archie comic followed all the trends of the 1960's as they briskly came and went. From Elvis and hot-rods to The Beatles, miniskirts, Nehru jackets and flower power. Reading Archie comics in the 1960's is truly a time capsule of that era. This volume begins with an introduction by one of the icons of the 1960's, Frankie Avalon. Frankie's introduction is more an ode to the 1960's than it is about Archie comics, but it's still nice to hear from a guy who is so identified with one particular era. In all this volume has over a dozen stories ranging from 1961 through 1969 and it's so interesting to see how the gang has been transformed from the big-band, bobby-soxer era to the psychedelic 1960's over the course of over twenty years.My favorite stories in this collection include:\\"Too Close for Comfort\\" Jughead and Archie are making fun of Betty & Veronica's tight fitting Slim-Jim pants until a dunk in a park water fountain finds the boy's pants shrunk to a very uncomfortable level of tightness.\\"Bop that Beatle\\" is a Beatle-era story from 1964 as Beatle mop top wigs are all the rage. When Veronica sends one to Archie as a gift, he and Jughead think it's a pest and try to kill it.\\"Board Game\\" Archie tackles the era of beach parties and surfing. Reggie is showing off his surfer skills to the girls making Archie jealous. Arch tries a crash course at surfing with disastrous results.\\"Mini-skirt Madness\\" Yet another 60's icon is covered as the boys go ga-ga over the girl's new mini-skirts.\\"Flower Power\\" from 1968 has Juggy turning into a hippie. Interesting in that going Hippie was dealt with as almost a monster-like transformation and something to be shown off as Veronica wants to Juggy to the Country Club for all her friends to see.\\"The Time of your Life\\" shows true 60's influence as the gang plans a trip to a park for a picnic, throwing the park guards into a panic over what they think will be a marauding band of rambunctious teens.\\"Ding a Ling\\" from 1969 is yet another fashion-oriented story as Reggie is showing off his new Nehru jacket, beads, and bell he wears around his neck. Archie counters him by showing up to the big dance with a cow bell!Archie Comics has put out two volumes from both the 40's and 50's and I certainly hope they do so with the 1960's as well. To me it's the era that really reminds me of the comics. The ever-changing fashion styles and events always stayed current with the times. No era saw so many changes as the 1960's did and Archie moved right along and grew up as well."},{"Title":"Best of the Sixties / Book #1 (Archie Americana Series)","review":"An interesting transition takes place during the 1960's run of the 'Archie' comics series, namely a shift in its visual style. In the early 60's the artwork is still very much in the same vein as it was in the 1950's - each frame packed with detail and a overall high-quality, stylized look. From the midpoint of the 1960's and on the artwork seems to take a more economical approach with less detail, etc. that will come to define the look of 'Archie' comics in the 70's, 80's and on. With this point in mind this 1960's volume of the 'Archie Americana' series serves as an intersting example of the gradual loss of detail that the artwork took throughout the decade and on. The stories collected in this volume are also interesting in that for the first time 'Archie' comics refers back to real-life pop culture on a regualr basis. For example, the stories collected in this volume feature such cultural icons as, 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' Beatles wigs, Nehru jackets, the hippie movement, etc."},{"Title":"Best of the Sixties / Book #1 (Archie Americana Series)","review":"This book is a kid-safe trip to the Sixties, or at least the comics version of that decade.One writer compared Archie comics to an aquarium.

I do wish they had more stories from the early part of the decade -- the Kennedy-era artwork may be my favorite of all the Archie styles -- but once you get into all the Beatles lampoons and hippie references, the historical hilarity takes over, and artwork (though fine) takes second place to the plot. These old stories make a great cultural history lesson (although they often fall on the conservative side of the Generation Gap...) It's fun stuff, and arguably the creative peak of the whole series.I'd love to see more collections like this...

Where this book excells is in its characterization of the the high level command structure. While I was familar with much of this material I found this book helped me gain a far deeper understanding of the growth and transformation of the Army of Ohio into the Army of the Cumberland. Mr. Daniel also does a good job of weaving in plenty of first person detail to give this book the compelling human touch essential to any book's readability. Where this book falls short is in its operational details. The maps, what few there are don't really help the reader. The author also makes the case early on that he is not the big fan of George Thomas that previous AoC writers and biographers such as McKinney, Buell and Castel were. Yet Thomas comes off looking very good in Daniels' book. His only real dig against Thomas is that he was only the overseer of victory at Stones River and not the savior of that battle as other authors have claimed. Here is where the lack of operational detail bites Daniel. Thomas' key positioning of the Regular Brigade, his unbreakable reserve unit, followed by its nearly suicidal commitment at the key moment at Stones River, was the real turning point of that battle. The author provides a good description of the Regular Brigade's first engagement of Dec 31, 1862, at Stones River, but then omits their far more critical second action, ordered by Thomas, then attributes the Regulars total casualty figures for both actions to the less signifcant first action. John King is protrayed as the CO of the 18th US Infantry's three battalions when he was actually the CO the 15th US Infantry's one battalion. A better understand of the brigade level operational details might have led Mr. Daniel to some different conclusions. Still I am very happy with this book and consider it a neccessary reference for anyone seriously studying the Civil War's Western Theater."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"Daniel has written the definitive history of the Army of the Cumberland which compares favorably with Connelly's two volumes that deal with the Confederate Army of Tennessee. In the first section Daniel excuses General Buell for failure to take Chattanooga because the Confederate cavalary destroyed all of his supply depots. However Daniel is very critical of Buell in the Battle of Perryville for not coming to defend his left and for allowing Bragg to invade Kentucky. Daniel is also critcal of Rosecrans for leaving his right flank vulnerabale during the Battle of Stones River and for failing to destroy the Confederate army of Tennessee in the spring of 1863. Finally Rosecrans failed miserabely in overexending his forces during the Battle of Chickamauga which left them vulnerabe for a Confederate attack. Daniel believes that the final general of the Army of the Cumberland, General Thomas, had flaws in that he was too slow like Buell, but gradually improved over time. This is a crtical and very readable history of the Army of the Cumberland, but Daniel leaves out how regimental dynamics such as those mentioned in Gerald Prokopowicz's book impeded the Army's military effectiveness. Overall, I would reccomend this book for anyone who is interested in the Western theater of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"Ask any American to name a Civil War battle and the answer you will usually get is &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. The average person knows little about the Western theatre of the conflict which wascrucial in leading to ultimate union victory (not that the Eastern theatre wasn't also key!).The Rev. Larry Daniel's books on Shiloh and Soldiering in the Army of Tennesse are well done. In his latest work he chronicles the history of the Army of the Cumberland largest of the threemajor union armies in the Western Theatre (the other two being the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio).Instead of strictly battlefield accounts of such important battles as Shiloh, Stones River, Perryville, Chickamauga,Chattanooga and the Atlanta Campaign the author focuses moreon the personalities and conflicts among the commanders.Daniel draws detailed accounts of the five commanders of the Army of the Cumberland: Robert Anderson, William Sherman, DonCarlos Buell, William Starke Rosecrans and George Thomas.All of these men had major faults, enemies within the ranks and made mistakes. Nevertheless, the Army of the Cumberland fought well in several tough campaigns of the war.Daniel writes clearly and his prose is easy to follow. The book took years to write, is well researched though it does need more and better maps.This is a good book for a Civil War reader tired of the endless tomes on Virginia battles and longing to learn moreabout the western campaigns of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"A book by Larry J. Daniel is an event in the ACW community. He has an established reputation for scholarship and readability that some authors can only envy. A book on the Union Army of the Cumberland by him is a milestone. No real history of this army is in print. Except for some battle histories, the majority by Peter Cozens, the AOC might not exist in print. This book is a good start to correct a deficiency in ACW history.First, this is a readable book populated with very well drawn characters. Second, the battles and campaigns occur within the life of the army. All to often, an army seems to spring from battle to battle without an idea of how or why. We understand how the campaigns come about and why the battles occur where they do. Most of all, we come to understand the relationships between the generals. Thomas' reasons for refusing to replace Buell and the effect it had on him is an interesting and on going story. How this action and Rosecrans' habits echo through the army's history is one of the best subplots in the book. This is not the reason for the book but these two men have a major impact on this army.Objections, the maps could be better and more of them would have helped. The post Chattanooga history seems rushed; another 100 pages would have made this a better book. I would have liked to follow Thomas and the major elements of the AOC back to Nashville and seen them face Hood. These are \\"nits\\" and do not detract from this excellent book."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"Mr. Daniel, a minister, not professional historian has undertaken an admirable task in this book. He chronicles well the activities and history of the high command of the least known of the major Union armies in the Civil War. His work however gives the reader little insight and analysis such as that a professional historian can provide. In essence he has taken the time to place in one volume all the material available on his subject but has added little to these facts in good historical analysis. Unfortunately in some key places even his facts are wrong. His narrative on the \\"Fatal Gap\\" at Chickamauga is outright incorrect and must have William Starke Rosecrans and Thomas J Wood spinning in their graves! He gives weight to the clearly fictional accounts of Rosecrans verbal tirade to Wood in the Fatal Gap episode on 20 September from EV Westrate that were added to Tucker's Chickamauga as if they were fact. More modern research has clearly shown this episode to be false and Daniel has performed a disservice to the history of the Army of the Cumberland by blowing his chance to set the record straight on this key episode at Chickamauga. Finally, Daniel describes the model for his book as that of Thomas Connelly's Army of Tennessee classic which probably suffers from over analysis. In Daniel's case, his work suffers from too little analysis and it shows."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"A quite interesting topic, the Army of the Cumberland generally gets only passing attention in most works as its major battles, Stones River and Chickamauga, are covered. Here Larry Daniel provides an in-depth coverage, from its inception as the Army of the Ohio until its final battles at Franklin and Nashville. Generally speaking, like the Army of the Potomac, it was a poorly led army until after the ascension of Grant. Once Grant takes overall command, placing Sherman in charge, this Army performs well under George Thomas.After Sherman's victory at Atlanta, the Army of the Cumberland is detached to address John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee as it seeks to redirect the Federal advance into Georgia by itself advancing into Tennessee, but Hood's army is destroyed by Thomas at Franklin and annihilated at Nashville. The second largest Union Army when it was under Don Carlos Buell, this army served in all the actions in middle Tennessee and participated in Shiloh as well. The Cumberland army engaged the Confederates across five times the territory as the Army of the Potomac with one half to one third fewer men, yet its achievements in the Central Theater rivaled those of its eastern counterpart.This is a good work by Mr. Daniel, well written and well researched. He is not shy about delving into the politics, discord and poor leadership that prevented this army from achieving its full potential."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"This volume focuses on the origins, development, and maturation of the Army of the Cumberland. The author, Larry Daniel, notes that the maturing of the Army and its best commander, General George Thomas, went together. He observes (page xi): \\". . .George Thomas emerges as the catalyst that gave the army its lethal edge, but he is a flawed character who does not mature until late 1863.\\"The roots of the Army came with General Robert Anderson (after his surrender of Fort Sumter) and General William T. Sherman. Neither did well.Then, Don Carlos Buell arrived as head of this fighting force. He was typical of many generals of the era--slow and loath to be aggressive. His tour of duty came to an end after the battle at Perrysville.Then came William Rosecrans, quite capable in many ways, but also excitable and eccentric. He was also not terribly aggressive, although when he moved, he could be brilliant (e.g., the Tullahoma Campaign and his flanking poor Braxton Bragg out of Chattanooga). He delivered a flawed victory (but a victory nonetheless) at Murfreesboro (or Stones River), at a time when the Union forces were doing poorly alsewhere. In the process, he earned Abraham Lincoln's gratitude.After the debacle at Chickamauga and Rosecrans' dithering while under siege in Chattanooga, George Thomas took over. With Grant and his favorite lieutenant, Sherman, on the scene, Thomas and the Army of the Cumberland played a critical role, with their storming of Missionary Ridge.Later, with Sherman commanding the forces in the West, Thomas continued to lead \\"his\\" army and was an important contributor in the movement of Union forces toward Atlanta. After Atlanta, of course, Sherman divided his forces and the Army of the Cumberland, in essence, no longer existed as an independent force.This is a competently written and fairly thorough record of this Union fighting force. A good addition to one's Civil War library."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"I was very excited to start reading this book when I first got it. I knew very little about the war in the west and was looking forward to expanding my knoledge. The book started off with mass amounts of detail on the formation of the army, which although was a challenge to read I found interesting. The amount of reasearch and detail that he follows with about the high command of the army is amazing. With that being said, there were some problems. There were not nearly enough maps. Only 6 in a 400 odd page book, and not on troop positions became very confusing when he would elaboratly describe troop movements. I found it ironic that throughout the first half of the book he spends a great deal of time talking about the flawed character of Buell and how he was more of a mover than a fighter, when that's really how the book was. Daniels would spend pages and pages on how the armies got to a certain place, and then spend 3 or 4 pages on random scenes of battle, not giving a very good idea of how the battle unfolded at all. Having been to Shiloh, Perryville, and Stones river this book still left me confused on the battles. Although this book does help expand your ideas of the war in the west it leaves a lot of gaps that I'll have to fill with other books, and I don't really want to read the same stuff over again just to fill in the battles. I would recomend reading a different book on the western war before this one."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"In this book, Reverend Daniel contrives to shed light on the history of \\"Army of the Cumberland\\" claiming history writers have neglected it. He then wipes the \\"The Army of the Cumberland\\" a two-volume history by Thomas Budd Van Horne off the list as biased reporting.His rationale is that it does not engage in the gossipy, snickering and backbiting of the officers' corps because they were not \\"fraternal or solidified.\\" Or, it is not great reading and the real reason it is not acceptable is that it is an apologia for Major General George H. Thomas.In the second paragraph of his Preface, he lets us know that all efforts before his were attempts to 'vindicate' Thomas. Therefore in the third paragraph he decided that Thomas \\". . . is a flawed character who does not mature until late 1863.\\"Jeez! A guy whom early in the war defeats \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, saves his army not once, but twice, was undefeated in battle and destroyed two Confederate armies is flawed and requires 'vindication?' That sounds like something applicable to 'crazy' or 'drunken' generals.He criticizes Thomas Van Horne, Thomas's biographer, as an advocate of Thomas. If being an advocate is wrong, we must all take writings by Catton, Simon, Porter, Wilson, et al, not to mention Grant's \\"Memoirs,\\" as pure \\"hogwash.\\" The Reverend implies that only those who dislike or disapprove or are in some fashion alienated against the subject (as apparently Reverend Daniel is toward Thomas), are the only ones qualified to write about them.Reverend Daniel immediately dismisses all material about Thomas before his, as \\"grounded in postwar writings that cannot be proven by contemporary evidence.\\" Lets see, according to the good Reverend, every historian and would-be historian since 1865 is wrong about Thomas including Castel, McKinney and Buell whom he quotes extensively? I don't understand what \\"contemporary evidence is either.\\" Is that evidence not extant until the Reverend finds it? What is wrong with the sources quoted in Castel, McKinney or Buell? They are all immaterial according to the Reverend. He apparently dismisses all the material that Thomas gave to Van Horne for inclusion in his history. \\"Contemporary evidence\\" does not support them, but they were contemporary evidence. Much of Van Horne's work is taken from Thomas's personal papers, which Mrs. Thomas destroyed after the Generals death, and the O. R.'s. The Reverend claims since they do not now exist that they are also all irrelevant eg. \\"No contemporary evidence.\\" I wonder how he explains the Bible to his flock?He disposes of contemporary history writers by claiming they did not have the heart to dive into the National Archives because of the \\"sheer volume.\\" Nevertheless, the good Reverend has waded through this miasma of dust-covered material, no doubt turning himself brown in the process, to glean nuggets he claimed were hidden there. I failed to find little before which others have not uncovered.He then states that Thomas, along with Buell and Rosecrans, have 'solid' biographies which reverses what he claimed and dismissed (Van Horne and Cist) earlier in his Preface.The Reverend claims he has \\". . . stayed clear of battle minutiae that can easily be found in other works. . . .\\" However he has overly substituted the minutiae of the individual soldier, whose overall comprehension of the action swirling around him is limited to his immediate front. A private's overall knowledge of the tactics, strategy or battle plan, or of the ebb and flow of the battle is extremely limited to what he can see in his front. He can never see where they weaken the line and needs reinforcement or strengthening. As to social problems, he can only add one vote, yea or nay to the generally acknowledged racism existing. Morale is a nebulous feeling not necessarily shared universally. If the Reverend served any time in the military he would have found that the men griped about everything and they did not all share the same opinion. I'm sure it was the same during the Civil War. However, Reverend Daniel treats these comments as though they flowed from the lips of Aristotle, Jefferson, Napoleon or Clauswitz. This adds nothing to the understanding or analysis. As any good statistician knows, a sample size of one (1) defining a situation, morale, conscription, or emancipation, is not worth the powder to blow it to. . . . Heck. Probably just adds more to the price they pay the good Reverend for the book. Which today, may be what history writers and publishers are all about.He frets that \\"Thomas supporters\\" will think him too hard on Thomas. Well, when by the middle of the book there are included 50 plus derogatory or backhanded comments about one individual (Thomas), one must wonder why all the negativity?I'm not sure how Daniels reached the tortured rationale that the IV Corp was the heart of the Army of the Cumberland, but he erred again. It was not identified as part of the Army of the Cumberland at its creation coming into existence on October 9, 1863. It was a consolidation of XX (created January 9, 1863) and XXI (created January 9, 1863) corps. The XIV Corps, Thomas's old Corps was it's heart. So good that after Sherman secretly degraded it to Grant from Resaca to Jonesboro, he had to take it to protect him on his vacation from the war in Savannah.Well so much for the \\"Preface.\\"This is not a history of the \\"Army of the Cumberland.\\"It is a shallow review of the early history and some of its battles. Its primary focus is to denigrate George H. Thomas as an ineffective, slow, spiteful, insubordinate officer.In two hundred and fifty pages there are almost 50 demeaning references about Thomas. As others have done (See Creveld below), the Reverend leaps at the opportunity to repeat the Grant/Sherman aspersion about Thomas being \\"slow.\\" He repeats the slander that Grant/Sherman initiated to degrade Thomas's military performances. He repeats the story that Thomas was called \\"Slow Trott [sic] because of his performance, not true.\\" The derivation of the nickname is presented on the AOTC.net website [...], as are other nicknames associated with Thomas none of them derogatory.To quote a historian, Martin van Creveld, much of what we are given to believe is based on . . . \\"a sad testimonial to the readiness of many historians to copy each other's words without giving the slightest thought to the evidence on which they are based\\"The Reverend also adopts the silly argument (previously presented by others) that the Army of the Cumberland was slow because of its size. Now, with about 65,000 men, the AOTC was about 10,000 men smaller than the Army of Northern Virginia. That Army has never been accused of being slow. If size is some criteria of speed than the Army of the Potomac was a snail. No, size is not measure of an Armies speed or effectiveness. It's what the army's generals do with them that count. With two different armies, Thomas destroyed two separate rebel forces.The Reverend's negativity does not confine itself to Thomas alone. No officer in the book escapes his criticism. I'm surprised that these quarrelsome, egotistical, inept, envious, and covetous people won any battles.Why is Daniels so negative about Thomas? Is this a trick to create discussion where none exists? Is this a subterfuge to create a controversy to increase sales?Well, we'll have to wait a while for a real history of the Army of the Cumberland to appear. Walter Winchell used to do this much in an evening.To be continued."},{"Title":"Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865","review":"Larry Daniel performs a helpful service for students of the Civil War with this comprehensive history of the Union's Army of the Cumberland, from its initial formation and incarnation as the Army of the Ohio to its final dismemberment after the Battle for Atlanta.

It's a good indicator that the book is worth reading. And certainly it is. Wolfgang Wegener was a German officer at the Imperial Navy during World War I. He disagreed on how the naval war was being fought and expressed himself on papers sent to his superiors. One of the major ideas he had, was that Germany needed to get ports on the Norwegian or French coasts in order to avoid British blocade. The importance of his thinking is that it led to Raeder's planning before World War II. The main text is an essay published after the Great War on which Wegener critiques the way the Navy was (mis)used during the entire conflict; here is where he points out the requirements (a hold on Norway and France) in order to achive a victorious campaign in the future. This edition includes some papers written by Wegener during the First World War, which set the basis for his later work.

I got it for my father who is a helicopter pilot and he loved it."},{"Title":"Sky Ranch engineering manual: Operation, failure, repair, piston aircraft engines","review":"This book's main focus is how fatigue and stresses affect different piston engine components and how to determine which components are excessively worn and the symptoms of wear. If you're worried about ensuring that your engine makes it through TBO, then this book might serve you well.Some of the material is dry and might work as a sleep aid if you've been suffering from insomnia. You won't find this sort of detail outside of a mechanical engineering class and definitely won't find it in other powerplant publications. However, this book is not much of a reference for rebuilding techniques or procedures. Helpful sections include an explanation of different effects of oil types and viscosities. In short, the book is priced right considering the information it contains."},{"Title":"Exploring Microsoft Access 2000","review":"I found the book to be pretty detailed and the lessons nicely layed out and easy for students to use. The sreen prints were colorful but sometimes the content of the screens did not match the book. The lessons are available to download at the publishers web site. The content of the leasons, have you jump right into databases and some sudents got a little lost. I have still had a problem in obtaining any instructor support. Overall the book is one of the better instruction materials that I have used in the past."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"Mr. Murawiec's defense-department briefing on Saudi Arabia in 2002 helped inform the premise of a newly released novel set in this influentional, Middle Eastern Kingdom: \\"Saudi Match Point\\". The book examines in one of its plotlines what might happen if the U.S. were to seize Saudi oil fields.The novel is available at www.blacksmithbooks.com for ten dollars, which includes the cost of international shipping. It's a quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"Murawiec's book is simply an expanded rehearsal of the frivolous-but-notorious Power Point presentation he gave to the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board in 2002. He seems to have decided--correctly--that a book bashing Saudi Arabia will sell to a certain audience, so he sticking with it. But e's no more accurate the second time around.He repeats--with no factual support beyond \\"allegations\\"--that the Saudis have paid off bin Laden to stay away from fighting the Al-Saud. If that's the case, then the domestic war against terror within the country--with over 200 security people killed or wounded and over 100 terrorists killed--seems to indicate a bad bargain. Or, more likely, one that never existed.His prescription for \\"solving the Saudi problem\\" reads like a neo-con's wet dream: separate the oil-producing Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia from the rest of the country; put the control of Mecca and Medina in the hands of an undefined \\"Islamic College.\\" Nowhere does he seriously suggest how these might be done, nor the cost--to Americans and the West--of even attempting to achieve these goals.This is a very unserious book masquerading as a scholastic tome. It will appeal to those who are already on the same sheet and be dismissed by any with even a rudimentary knowledge of the country and its people."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"In this compulsively readable book, Laurent Murawiec tells us why the Al-Saud family are little more than \\"Talibans with oil and a good P.R. company.\\" Using striking examples and documented references, he zooms onto facts that have long been known to experts, but are not enough widespread. For instance, the late King Faisal used to give his every visitor a copy of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Senior Saudi clerics regularly issue fatwas that call for the killing of Americans in Iraq. 70% of the jihadis captured in Iraq are Saudis. Saudi madrasas and publishing houses produce school books and other literature that preach slaughtering Westerns as a noble Islamic act. Etc, etc.Murawiec is angry, but he gives us plenty of good reasons to be. He believes, however, that the free pass the Saudis have been given by the West is about to be revoked, by measures such as the Saudi Accountability Act of 2005, for instance. \\"Monitor their every outrage, scrutinize their policy, put their actions under the microscope. Look at international jihad, its funding, its logistics, its propagandists, its religious leaders and cheerleaders, the media, the recruiters, etc. Look at the Saudi element in each and every one of those aspects. Pin it down, publicize it, make a permanent stink out of it...\\"A good and useful book."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"This book is in a sense of confirmation of and elaboration of the thesis that the present Saudi Arabian regime is a corrupt, anti- Western, religiously fanatic one which suppresses its own people and threatens the fundamental interests of the world's democracies. This thesis has been developed by among others, Dore Gold, in 'Hatred's Kingdom' ,Gerald Posner in \\"Secrets of the Kingdom\\" and John R. Bradley in 'Saudi Arabia Exposed\\".Murawiec a career diplomat has however special insight into the processes of diplomatic corruption especially within the State Department. He cites the present ruler of Saudi Arabia Prince Abdallah's remark that ' taking care of career diplomats when they finish the service' is the best introduction and incentive to new diplomats as to how to act in regard to Saudi Arabia. Murawiec thus points to the tremendous amount of corruption done by Saudi money within the realm of the U.S. government.He is a strong advocate of a new policy toward Saudi in which the US would get tough with the Monarchy. It would insist on end to anti- Western and US propaganda in the schools, an end to the training of ' fighters' many of whom make their way into Iraq to attack American soldiers. It would insist on true reforms within the Saudi regime, and an end to its vast support network for Terror throughout the world.Murawiec believes the Saudis control over the oil market has led to a great increase in the poverty of the poorest nations. While he does not advocate, what might seem , the most logical step for stablizing world oil markets, the takeover of Saudi oil by a US led democratic coalition he does insist that the present situation is one which threatens to lead disaster to the world - economy as a whole.This is a timely wake- up text about a corrupt Middle Eastern regime which unfortunately has been corrupting US diplomacy and foreign policy for decades."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"Mr. Murawiec's book is a detailed account of Saudi practices and policies. He names names; provides dates; and gives a blow by blow analysis of why the House of Saud, the ruling oligarchy of Saudi Arabia is an avowed enemy of the West and of the United States of America.One can sense the frustration that Mr.Murawiec feels at the duplicity and outright evil machinations of the Saudis. This often comes out in a rather sneering tone in this book, which undermines the passionately real data that he gives over. It is one thing to castigate the al-Saud regime for financing and manipulating the terrorism of radical Islam all over the world, it is another thing to add the figurative \\"And I spit on you,\\" that Mr. Murawiec often implies.Nonetheless, this book is a complete and detailed list of the House of Saud's damning sins and manipulations. I would suggest that these other equally resourceful books should accompany any reader's analysis of Saudi Arabian history; goals; and political policies:Hatred's Kingdom : How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism - by Dore GoldThe Age of Sacred Terror : Radical Islam's War Against America - by Daniel Benjamin and Steven SimonAnd (really - it's a decent, factual book that pulls no punches yet does not villify Saudi Arabia),The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Saudi Arabia by Colin Wells"},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"The author lays out a great deal of densely-detailed information about the intertwining of extreme fundamentalist Islam, Saudi royal culture and arrogance, oil, politics, and influence-buying. He makes an effective, infuriating case for the incestuous relationship the House of Saud has with leaders -- male leaders -- of US government and corporations. Murawiec convincingly points out how badly that is going to bite us in our vulnerable national rump very soon, and that leading politicians from both parties have no investment in doing anything about the looming mess. (They have invested elsewhere, using money generously donated by the Sauds.)It is not 'balanced' or 'even-handed,' but frankly, I haven't seen a single book about Saudi-US relations, or Saudi royal leadership, which has anything positive to say. There may just be a very good reason for that. (After I read this I happened to pick up Jean Sasson's \\"Princess\\" about the appallingly restrictive lifestyle of even royal Saudi women -- hard to imagine two more different books with the same essential message and impact: at times both had me so angry I was nauseous.The style is choppy and occasionally hard to follow, probably due to the translation from French. I also got the feeling he had to work to make the book a little broader than his usual think-tank analysis, and as a result he has an odd mix of solid sources and rather lighter-weight sources. Bottom line, definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"Bought this because my best friend recommended it. It provided a very detailed insight into one of our so called allies."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"An ugly polemic. M. Murawiec does not do \\"nuance.\\" Saudi Arabia is bad, very bad, the kernel of evil, and all the Saudis wear the proverbial \\"black gutra.\\" In the entire 268 pages there is never the slightest hint that there is anything slightly positive about the Kingdom. M. Murawiec writes with all the simplicity of the early black and white westerns - there is only absolute good and evil - nothing in-between to cause the reader to actually think.Much is revealed on page 1 in which he states that \\"today's Arabia is the joint offspring of...\\" and proceeds to list five external factors, such as \\"a pro-Nazi Englishman converted to Islam...\\" and minimizes the dominant internal factors that actually created the Kingdom. He exerts much effort in trying to equate the Saudis, and Islam, with either Nazism or Communism, so that the Western reader will realize this is one more (perpetual?) struggle that must be undertaken. For example, he has a penchant for inventing such phrases as the \\"Saudi Islamintern\\" which he compares with the Soviet Comintern (p.33). He even has an entire chapter entitled \\"Islamists of All Countries, Unite\\" (p.95). He alternates the communist threat analogies with the Nazi ones: \\"He (Ibn Saud) found himself in a situation comparable to that of Adolf Hitler in 1934....\\" (p.170), or, if you missed that point, he entitles an entire chapter: \\"1939: Hitler and Ibn Saud\\" (p.173). M. Murawiec's purple prose permeates the book: \\"this crowd of debtors, courtiers, and profiteers, this demimonde of middlemen and shady entrepreneurs, swindlers, procurers, moneychangers, and flatterers, forms the concentric circles surrounding the kernel of the royal family\\" (p. 32).... No comparisons with Washington DC are considered.Has M. Murawiec ever visited Saudi Arabia? Has he even talked with one Saudi? It is unclear from the book, but the answer is probably NO. His real, quite limited knowledge of the Kingdom is revealed when he calls the eastern province not Al Hasa but \\"Hara\\", not once which could be a typo, but twice (p239) and (p241).In his \\"Conclusions\\" section, among other demands he believes it appropriate for \\"the West\\" to demand of the Kingdom, he states that \\"Oil is Saudi by accident. The use that has been made of this black gold mine is so contrary to the public good that the international community owes it to itself to take it away from this abusive owner.\\" Wow! And bring them civilization at the same time? The old imperialist drumbeat. We know what is best for these \\"natives\\" and ourselves.The best insight into M. Murawiec's mindset can be obtained in the Epilogue. For all these pages he indicates how absolutely evil Saudi Arabia is, yet when he is invited to a conference there, he is quite ready to put on the \\"feedbag\\" and go.It is an appalling commentary on the current policies of the United States that this author was actually requested, by Richard Pearle, to address the Defense Policy Board in 2002, where he gave an infamous presentation in which he advocated taking the \\"Saudi\\" our of \\"Saudi Arabia.\\" For an understanding of the dynamics of Saudi Arabia, the book is utterly worthless, for those seeking an insight of those who advocate endless war, the book yields rich dividends. To quote from an old Bob Dylan song, M. Murawiec is indeed a Master of War."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"As Patrick Claswon observed, Murawiec gave a 2002 briefing to the Defense Science Board that carried the provocative title \\"Taking Saudi out of Arabia,\\" in which he advocated extremely tough pressure on the Saudi government concerning the involvement of Saudis in terrorism. When it leaked to the press, the uproar was so loud that President George W. Bush personally called Saudi crown prince Abdullah to emphasize that he rejected the content of the briefing--a remarkable reaction to a think-tank study. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also weighed in with denunciations. Murawiec was promptly fired by Rand.With credentials like that, one would hope for much from Murawiec, and he does make some telling points. He nicely captures the Saudi ambition to dominate world Islam, including the depth of the rivalry between the Saudi Wahhabi clerics and Egypt's venerable Al-Azhar University.But, alas, he is no expert on Saudi Arabia. For example, while many complaints can be made about the Saudi government's encouragement of radical Islam, it is hardly the case that Saudi charitable organizations are under the same degree of government control that the Soviet Union exercised over its pet peace movements, as the author contends. There are many extremely rich Saudis who feel a religious obligation to fund Islamic causes and, while they certainly listen to government guidance, they are acting independently and out of conviction--which was hardly the way that Soviet peace groups worked.Another problem: Murawiec gets carried away in places, undermining the credibility of his account. It is quite a stretch to say that Saudi Arabia \\"has modernized nothing.\\" Besides the vast improvement in material living standards, the kingdom has extended education to women and has built a media empire, ignoring objections by obscurantists. And Princes of Darkness suffers from peculiar organization. After 145 pages about contemporary Saudi support for terror groups, we are suddenly transported back 200 years for a history lesson lasting eighty pages. Both the earlier part on support for terror and the later part on history also contain within them abrupt jumps from one topic to another.After the publicity coup from his Rand firing, Murawiec would have been the logical person to write a definitive book about Saudi connections to terrorism. Sadly, this is not that book."},{"Title":"Princes of Darkness: The Saudi Assault on the West","review":"I like the way he lies and cheats on you who only listen from one side.

It contains simple, classic recipes like sloppy joes, french toast, meatloaf, and deviled eggs, as well as guides for meal planning and how to stock your kitchen - both in regards to tools for cooking and basic staple foods.

(a great coming-of-age story.) This book is full of the immortal truths of English boyhood. It's also a good naval yarn. Jack Easy is the prototype for young seamen in the post-Trafalgar era. The book is actually quite funny, too. Marryat's characters are very well-drawn, if a little rough around the edges. This is a very good story, and Captain Marryat was quite a story-teller. There is truth in this book, and a hard-edged plot."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"Considering the era in which it was written, this book is remarkable! Fast paced, uproariously funny at times, &quot;Midshipman Easy&quot; is a delight to all who enjoy seafaring novels. True, it is far-fetched at times, but it was never intended to be a true grit novel. The satire involved gains perspective if you understand Marryat's position for naval reform after he retired from active duty as a British Naval Captain. Marryat's use of a black man as Easy's guide and balance is something else ahead of it's time and I applaud him for that. The real purpose of this book is to provide a good read and it does it beautifully. The best of his novels,although Peter Simple ought to please the Forrester crowd."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"Almost 5 stars.Mr. Easy's father is a philosopher, with a very naive view of human nature. This comic figure is the major influence in Jack Easy's life until he is convinced Jack needs to be sent off to school. There begins Jack Easy's REAL schooling in life, followed by his entry into the British Navy. After all, isn't everyone equal on the sea, which belongs to no man?!Marryat's major strength in this book is that he can make almost any situation comical. You may roll your eyes at some of his puns,(He must really have enjoyed them!)but you can't help but laugh!Although lots of sea interested people have reviewed this book, I would heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys a pleasant read and a good laugh. It's clean enough for children, interesting enough for dads, has adventure enough for boys, and stinging rebuke enough for moms.

Stevenson's Kidnapped."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"Marryat is a bit disappointing to me, after O'Brien, Lambden, Woodman, et al., but no doubt true to its time, when this story was a great favorite of young men who wanted to escape to sea. Mr. Easy has an entirely too easy time of life for a real midshipman under sail, full of successful derring-do without any visible training or sail-handling to it, but thanks really to his practical and experienced Negro servant! I can see how young boys might have enjoyed this fast-moving story of endless adventures when it was written 140 years ago, but for me it lacks grit, sweat, and tears (perhaps the very reason it successfully recruited boys into the navy, as Parascandola avers). Maybe this is a valuable historical document from a real sea captain, moralizing from an outlook lacking in the more &quot;politically correct, sensitive, and sexual&quot; attitudes of modern authors, but as the &quot;best&quot; of Marryat's novels, I'll pass on the others."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"This book's an odd kettle of fish. It focuses on Jack Easy, starting at his birth, following him through school and into the Navy. He joins to press his socialist philosophy of the \\"equality of man\\". The book was first published in 1836, when Karl Marx was 18. Zeitgeist, perhaps?In tone, the book's half nautical fiction along the lines of O'Brian, Forester, Pope, etc., and half 17th century romantic farce that sees a rival found out in women's clothing, diabolical happenings at a costume ball, the come-uppance of a conniving father-confessor, a hilarious three-way duel, and more. The situations will be all the funnier if you've read more \\"serious\\" nautical fiction before this.Oddly, even though the author was himself a retired British naval post-captain (who served under Cochrane when he was himself a midshipman!), there is relatively little focus on the nautical details, and a whole lot of focus on the characters. Sure, there's a gale (and quite a good one), and some beam to beam broadside action, but mostly it's about the characters. In every situation, there's little tension as we know our hero will make good a Hornblower-like escape by some indirect means.The author jumps in as the omniscient narrator from time to time. For instance, there's one chapter that's an odd repetition of an argument made in a previous book against overly harsh punishment in the service.The wisdom's along the lines of \\"spare the rod, spoil the child\\" and the character \\"development\\" sees Mr. Easy move from channeling Marx to channeling Ayn Rand. As the earlier positions are argued as hard as the latter, it's actually hard to see the author's position here, which is quite interesting.Overall, though, the book just doesn't hang together as a continuous, tense story about the sea, which is one of the main reasons to read nautical fiction. On the other hand, if you've run out of the better nautical fiction, this one's well worth a read. A more interesting genre piece from this era is Wilkie Collins's mystery \\"The Moonstone\\"."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"Great book in that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Great tongue-in-cheek view of life aboard a British man-of-war. Of course its not too realistic, which O'Brian attempts and Forrester accomplishes, still, a real hilarious adventure tale. Easy leads an unbelievably charmed life, to the point of delightful reading but not incredulity. Characters are real yet outstandingly rich and beautiful. Find yourself putting your head back now and then and laughing in a most horse-like fashion... In regard to sea stories of this nature, I put C.S. Forrester 1st (He is the master, and will always be 1st just as Tolkien will always be 1st for fantasy readers), Marryat 2nd, O'Brian 3rd (too much pontificating...) and Alexander Kent and others a distant, distant, distant 4th."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"While digging through the treasure trove of nautical fiction available, I found this gem.Written in the 1830s, this story is a sharp social commentary combined with the adventure of a midshipman in the Royal Navy. I found this a delightful observation of society, which from today is even more humorous than it might have been 200 years ago.The language isn't far off from today's (the sailing vocabulary hasn't -obviously- changed). A good read for just about any age. Footnotes (in the Heart of Oak edition) to help those unfamiliar with some 19th C. idioms or semi-obscure sailing terminology.If you haven't read Marryat's work yet, this is a good one to get your feet wet."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"If you like the more modern Patrick O'Brian novels you will most likely like enjoy &quot;Mr Midshipman Easy&quot; even more.

Despite the fact that the book was written over one hundred years ago, Marryat's creation is entertaining to this day. One thing that made it such a good book was Marryat's experiences as a participant in the actual war. Writers of other Maritime books do not have as clear an understanding of what life was like on the ocean because they were never there. While Marryat can describe life on the ocean well and tell an entertaining story, he cannot be counted among the great authors of the english language. His book is entertaining and exciting, but not outstanding"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"While awaiting O'Brian's next book, I discovered Marryat. Easy is the third of his books I have read, and possibly the most enjoyable for I was a midshipman myself at one time. Although the mid of 1808 and the mid of 1960 have little in common in terms of the Navies involved, they are of one mind when it comes to wine, women, adventure, and a questioning disdain for the rules. Although the adventures may seem a bit farfetched at times, who can say that in 1808 they were not every bit as likely to happen exactly as Marryat relates."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"British Naval life circa 1808 written by one who was there.Marryat was a midshipman at the time. O'Brien, Forrester,etc. base their stories on historical occurances, as doesMarryat, and many of their plots can be found here. Thedifference, of course, is that Marryat knew the men, andin some cases it seems it was Marryat himself, whose deedsare echoed in our favorate works of fiction.Marryat writes with great humor, and his prose style, whilesomewhat archaic, will be familiar to O'Brien's readers. Hehas some axes to grind that might offend the modern reader(anti-catholic bigotry, and a determined attack on theprinciples of human rights that drove the French Revolutionagainst which he fought) but taken with a grain of salthe can generate a humorous view of many institutions thatare above question these days.This volume is beautifully printed and bound, and well worththe hard cover price."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Easy","review":"Almost 5 stars.Mr. Easy's father is a philosopher, with a very naive view of human nature.

This is not a book to be read passively. It is, instead, a personal guide to leading a more enjoyable life by honestly identifying the things which really matter and choosing a path which will give those elements priority in our lives.By using a combination of inspirational stories, quotes, and writing prompts, the author gently leads the reader towards self-discovery. Although the title may invite comparison with Stephen Covey's best-selling First Things First, Conley-Weaver's book does not provide a structured blueprint for planning and organizing your days. Instead, it encourages the reader to use journaling as a tool to give voice to both the dreams and the demons that we may keep hidden to the world, so that we can come to a better understanding of our inner selves and then use that understanding to make choices that bring us greater happiness. Speaking of her own discovery of the power of journaling while she was still a child, Conley-Weaver writes:&quot;Writing gave life to the thoughts I wasn't allowed to speak. Writing made me feel better. Writing kept me from being completely numb.&quot;and later, as she grew older,&quot;Writing also helped me lead a simpler life. Through writing down my insights, I could see where I honestly wanted to aim my energies. It helped me settle down and heal so I could evaluate on paper the chaos of my life.&quot;I found I often made decisions for the wrong reasons. My choices were sometimes grounded in fear, sometimes grounded in routine, sometimes grounded in pleasing others rather than myself. By jotting down stresses and strategies, I was able to choose more positive uses of my time - not only to simplify my life, but also to amplify my blessings.&quot;What Really Matters to Me is divided into five sections: Acknowledging the Chaos, Accepting Responsibility, Writing Through the pain, Choosing a Simpler Life, and Enjoying the Simpler Life. Each section begins with the author intimately sharing her own, often painful experiences, as well as the experiences of some of her students, as they have made their own journeys. Each section ends with a series of writing prompts, followed by several blank pages for the reader to use the prompts to facilitate their odyssey towards self-discovery. The prompts invite the reader to dig deep:&quot;Start two sentences with &quot;I wish I could stop doing. . .&quot;&quot;If you woke up tomorrow without the stresses of today, what would you do with your day? List the reasons why you believe you can't make that day today.&quot;&quot;Write about activities you're involved in that you do not care about and are doing just to please someone else.&quot;The blank journaling pages are peppered with inspirational quotes from authors, philosophers, artists and scholars which acknowledge the wisdom of taking power over their own paths. By the end of the book, the reader has created a customized guide to assist them in achieving their goals. The steps defined in their journals will illuminate the path they need to follow to lead a simpler, more satisfying life. As Conley-Weaver writes, in closing her book,&quot;When you write in a journal, you can't help but simplify your life, because you'll be writing from an honest perspective. You'll become more aware on a regular basis of what really matters to you.&quot;"},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"The book is a little heavier on the fill-in-the-blank structure than others of its kind. Once I filled in the blanks, it left me asking &quot;Okay...and then what?&quot; There were no follow-up questions to help you explore any particular revelation any deeper and no 'summary' kind of exercises that tied a series of filled-in blanks together for a bigger picture. It felt like something was still missing."},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"This is a guided journal with writing prompts to get out all of the really important matters in your life. There is alot of writing space which can be looked as good or bad depending on personal preference. I would have preferred a little less space and more prompts. This journal is simple and easy to get through and at times more than just a book with blank lines running through its spaces."},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"Once I read this book I quickly ordered several additional copies to give as Christmas gifts. And they'll be presents I'll be excited to give - rather than the typical obligatory generic offerings. In my overly fast-paced, overly shoot-from-the hip decision making world I know I've become too self-absorbed. And it's because I make decisions without conviction, without much thought, and without direction. But up until now I just acknowledged these facts and continued down the same path. This excellent guide gently pulled me toward self-consciousness - introspection. It allowed me to hit the brakes and take a long careful and focused look at myself. I raised the binoculars and saw where I really wanted to be and traced out the path to get there. I go to seminars because I'm forced to by my job. I invaribly yawn. But this 'seminar on paper' is not written by the know-it-all drill sergeant who barks at you to sit back while he drives. This is a a self-navigating journal to discovery that gently and wisely helps you reveal just what the title states. I highly recommend this for anyone who puts or wants to put more emphasis on the quality of life rather that the quantity. What a gift this will make to loved ones!"},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"I found this journal very helpful because it provided insight into how our choices determine our quality of life. The author is very knowledgeable and guides the reader through the analysis of painful circunstances to choices for a more productive life.Anne Jones"},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"Robyn Conley-Weaver literally 'weaves' emotion and words. She inspires the reader by reminding him of his own power and once he recognizes that it is there within, she shows him how to use it to his best advantage. The stories and exercises in this book are magical. They will release you from whatever dark place you may currently find yourself. I highly recommend this book--even if your world is all rose color glass."},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"Robyn Conley-Weaver's book reminds me of the time I backpacked through Europe just after college. Sure I enjoyed the sights in Paris, Milan and Amsterdam, but if I were really honest with myself, I'd say the most important things I learned on the trip were about myself.WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME is both compelling and inspiring. A must read for anyone who has ever striven to be a better person--and it's a bargain compared to the price of a Eurail pass."},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"I came across this book during one of my more cynical periods. There are a zillion books out there on journaling, self-discovery, and self-help. Even Oprah encourages journaling. This one touched my heart and awoke something. Robyn shares some of her journey and offers ways for others to explore theirs. Introductions to sections offer insight and instruction. Prompts offer jumping off places. You have a choice about this journey. This offering will provide a sense of purpose and direction if you choose to allow yourself to stretch."},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"Robyn Conley-Weaver allows you to do what would have made my librarian from highschool cringe...write in the margins of the book! What a great idea it was to give the reader the freedom to jot down their thoughts and ideas! In today's fast-paced world it is refreshing to read a book about taking time out to focus on the things that are so easily forgotten in our day to day lives. I found What Really Matters To Me to be straight forward, easy to read and even easier to apply in my life which is over flowing with deadlines and to-do lists."},{"Title":"What Really Matters to Me (Guided Journals)","review":"I ordered 2 of these, each from different sellers.

For a book that talks about Mass Comm. theories, it still provides a solid foundation as far as the histories of many theories go, but much of Severin and Tankard's commentary on technology (specifically the Internet) is laughably outdated. It makes me wonder how much progress has been made in the field in the 12 years since this book's initial publication.Buy it if you must, but know that there are more up-to-date resources out there that deserve to bump this dusty tome from its revered position among college faculty."},{"Title":"Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, and Uses in the Mass Media","review":"It provides a thoughtful review of communication theories (both critical and effects tradition) starting with Shannon and Weaver to Internet studies. The book also provides a chapter in communication methods, media conglomerates, and regulations.

This is a very down to earth, real portrayal of what Dennis and Alice went through and I felt very connected to them.

I recommend this as a true love story and spiritual adventure."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"The moment I was introduced to \\"Twin Souls\\" I was introduced to Dennis and Alice. I have researched and followed them on many different links. I had to get their book! It was one of those you don't want to put down. I felt as if I were with them, along for the ride so to speak. I felt a deep connection with them and each of their journey's. At times I would say to myself I have had that experience, or I have felt that before with my twin soul. It has made me focus more on \\"naked time\\" feeling the energy run through my body and connecting my soul even more with my twin. Even just a kiss gives us that connection.This book is an eye opener, it helps you to believe that there is hope and that not only sooner but later you will have the love and peace your heart truly desires. It shows you that our lifes journey isn't always an easy one that you may not always be just where you want to be but you will get there with faith, guidance, hope and love. I love how they opened up about their past relationship, how Dennis lived in a motor home for many years, how he struggled but had faith that there was more out there for him!! That is true faith! I love how Alice spent here days helping others heal through her law firm, putting them first until she began to love herself.THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING BOOK ON ALL LEVELS!! I have already loaned it to a friend that is in need of inspiration and this is the book that will give that to her.Together Again will guide you if you are lost, inspire you if you feel you can't find love, confirm that with faith there is always a way and that with love anything is possible as long as you continue to follow your hearts desire &#9829;Thank You to the Authors Dennis and Alice best Jackson for sharing their inspiring journey with us &#9829; May all who read this be as inspired as I have been and may your journey be filled with love and peace &#9829;"},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"There aren't too many books available on Twin Souls/Flames, and Dennis and Alice Jackson have captured this niche with their book Together Again. I love how they wrote the book in the trinity of his/hers/ours. Dennis tells his back story with raw honesty and integrity, followed by Alice's account of her life as it leads up to meeting her twin soul (aka Dennis). The \\"ours\\" section blends both of their points of views as to how they met and the instant knowing that they had found their twin soul.Written as though you're sitting in their living room and they're retelling their love story to you, the emotions and warmth that come through about them and to the reader is captivating and endearing. The reader learns how to recognize if they've met their twin soul-what it feels like and the all-knowing that it is. It's affirming and quite simply put-You Know!The relationships that Dennis develops on his psychic/medium path add even more depth and understanding to his story. Alice's role as \\"seeker\\" of spiritual information is one that many will relate to, and Together they remind us that we will find love Again!Heather Hummel, authorThe Universe Is My Sugar DaddyThrough Hazel EyesGracefully: Looking and Being Your Best at Any Age"},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"It made me laugh, cry and really think about life.Twin souls is very powerful and has much compassion, It tells about their losses and their gains, I loved it as much as Love Story.

Lots and lots of agonizing details in telling their story how they met, but little else..."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"After reading just about ALL and any books or material even videos out there I think, that even slightly relates to or resembles Twin Souls and/or Soulmates and always having an affinity to the concept for as long as I can remember, I can tell you firsthand that this was one of the best written, true to life, no holds barred and no beats skipped story of two true Twin Souls. The journey that it takes to &quot;getting there&quot;, to be with the other half of yourself, the trials, the pain, the lessons and then the &quot;Gift&quot;, Dennis and Alice hold nothing back in this story. Another one of those &quot;can't put down&quot; books, I read it in 1 and a half days time. Reading their story reminded me of Kenny and Julia Loggins story from their book titled &quot;The Unimaginable Life&quot; another story of true twin souls, I would have to say that these 2 books, out of all of them, run nose to nose, in truth, honesty, and might I mention..that &quot;Naked Place&quot; that Alice and Dennis speak of in their book.For all who know and have belief, hope &amp; faith in meeting up with your twin in this life, I highly recommend this book. It's one that will teach you that giving up that hope and not working on YOURSELF and learning to love yourself and others unconditionally, is not ever an option, not when spirit is working in your life. :-) It's all about letting go and letting God. Thumbs up to the authors! A PERFECT description of what a Twin Soul relationship is, should be and feels like."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"The accounts of synchronicity in this book were wonderful. I appreciated the message. The best thing I got from this book was this:\\"In finding that other half, we enhanced the person we each had already become. That is an important part of knowing that you have truly connected with your twin soul. The partnership is not a completion, but an enhancement of who you already are. You are already perfect! Your twin soul brings to the relationship whatever energy is needed to empower you to create your own choices and realize your dreams, and is there to celebrate with you when they happen! Twin souls are mirrors of each other; they are not an exact duplication.\\"For co-dependents like myself, that was a groundbreaking way to view The One. I recently broke up with someone whom I believe, whole-heartedly because of past life experiences and synchronicities bringing us together, that he is my twin soul... but in reading that one, simple paragraph, I realized that although I was there for him in terms of enhancing who he already was, he was not really there for me. And this helped me a great deal in believing that perhaps, I still have a chance at meeting The One.The book also helped me to realize that until I learn to love and accept myself completely... and give up the control drama of \\"hanging on\\" to someone for fear of dying alone, that I will never be with The One, even if he enters my life and loves me... because my soul will not ever be evolved enough to accept the love that he has to give.Each individual story was great.. but after the characters come together, it gets kind of \\"dreamy\\" and a little too \\"fairytale-ish\\" for my tastes. Although there can be mutual respect, love, and understanding throughout a relationship, I don't believe that any relationship remains in that \\"dreamy\\" state without hard work to keep it that way... not even with The One.Some intimate details were a little too much for me, I certainly could have lived without the authors' reference to performing and participating in oral sex in public. It's wonderful for them that they felt that close and ecstatic about one another, but not appropriate information to share with the whole world, in my humble opinion.I would recommend \\"Only Love is Real\\" by Brian Weiss if you want an inspirational book about divine intervention in bringing two true soul mates together in this lifetime."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"Was drawn to the book while browsing. After starting to read, I couldn't put it down. A definite must have for those who love to hear about people finding their &quot;twin souls&quot;. Reading through the pages of Dennis and Alice's life up until they met was very inspiring. It gives hope to those of us who are still &quot;waiting&quot;. Also a great general read on following intuitions and life's path. This book gives so many confirmations for when you're feeling as if you're the only one with thoughts of &quot;I'm meant for something more&quot; and &quot;There has got to be someone out there for me&quot;. Beautifully written, I loved how Dennis starts out with his life story, then Alice tells her life story and they both come together in the last chapter together taking turns talking about their perceptions of the &quot;meeting&quot; and time spent together.

It is with great anticipation of waiting on the &quot;encounter&quot; and then, a awesome &quot;soul recognition&quot; or &quot;love at first sight&quot;. Something we all are looking to find in this life. Their story teaches us about true love. Real love which is divine love. This couple is &quot;a marriage made in Heaven&quot; or a &quot;connection for all eternity&quot;. Thank you for sharing your story with our universe. We are more enlightened for having read it, more inspired and more hopeful.

I have sinced been blessed to meet the authors and have never met 2 more spiritual souls who had the courage to follow their &quot;paths&quot; to each other. I can't wait for the next book!

It is a beautiful story of love and also a book that has so many answers. It taught me and touched me deeply. The way the story is written first Alice's story then Dennis was terrific....then the way they both wrote the last section together was heartwarming. They are both so open and honest in their writings......I felt like they were close friends when I was finished the book. I highly recommend this book to the romantics of the world and also for people who have an interest or curiousity in twin souls and past lives. A must read!! :)"},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"This book literally jumped off the shelf into my hands and I could not put it down until I finsihed it from cover to cover. It is a beautiful love story that shows how love surpass all bountries and survives. That love is everlasting with no end. No matter what you believe this book shows how truly special love is and how spirit will guide you to find that perfect love, if you just listen. Having found my own twin soul reading this book described so many thoughts, emotions, feelings that we had that very few ever understood. It was a great affirmation to me about finding my twin soul. Dennis and Alice beautifully put into words so many thoughts and feelings about love, twin souls and spiritual guidance. You feel their emotions and as though you are a part of their journey of discovery and understanding. What a beautiful gift they have given all that read their book."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"Dennis and Alice share their journey of re-uniting in a way that is so profound and inspiring you will feel as if you are actually there with them. I laughed,cried,blushed and fell in love right along with them. I was totally swept into their world of reuniting along with them and cheered them all the way!!

A love that is usually reserved for fairy tales and movies becomes a reality for the authors. This book is filled with intimate moments of hearts seeking one another, discovering that special bond that only Twin Souls can share. You can almost hear their hearts beat and their breathing as they take each step, drawing them closer to a reunion."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"In this chronical of Dennis and Alice's lifetime journey to perfect love, the reader almost feels like they are intruding on something too personal. Relating their stories of making their love connection in past lifetimes(not as lovers) and finally finding one another in this lifetime as twin souls, will touch the hearts of many, skeptics and believers alike. This is a text book for learning how to prepare for, and recognize your true twin soul. By sharing their own personal journey through the various layers of joy and heartache in their lives, Dennis and Alice's true gift to the reader is explaining the difference between a soul mate and a twin soul, leaving the reader with an unquenchable desire to embark on their own journey for perfect love."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Together Again&quot; the first time I read it. The second time I read this book, it only reinforced my belief that there is &quot;something&quot; much stronger than I that controls the forces of our universe. The unique style in which Dennis and Alice tell their story is not only refreshing, but taps into the very essence of making the &quot;impossible&quot; possible. This book made me aware of my own stumbling blocks and ill perceived obstacles in my life. Upon completion of &quot;Together Again&quot; after the second reading, an internl shift occurred and has now propelled me to change my own destiny, without the usual fear of the unknown. This book is a definite read."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"I picked up a copy of Together Again to spiritually discover the essence of the male-female love relationship in the New Age. I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed at the poor editing of the book and felt that 100 pages of this effort could have been deleted to the satisfaction of most readers. I could relate to Dennis and Alice's relationship through having felt metaphysical experiences in my own life. Together Again provided me New Age labels to help me define life on the other side. It also enabled me to rediscover spirituality, which had gone wanting in my own life. Hopefully, the authors will get a bonified publisher for their next work so that the reader won't have to trudge through superfluous sidetracks."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"Recently I searched for \\"Dennis Jackson\\" using Google. I did not know I would find this author; but when I did, I was curious about the book. Curiosity got the best of me, and I ordered the book from Amazon. I am a chronic proofreader and am fanatic about punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure. However, I became engrossed in this book to the point of overcoming my obsession with proofreading. What a beautiful story of two people willing to share their true natures! The authors' definition of twin souls differs from my own (i.e. two souls created at the same time and sharing many lifetimes together but not necessarily romantically involved). The two authors told their stories exceptionally well, keeping my interest throughout the book. I am definitely looking forward to their next book, The Psychic and the Lawyer."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"I had been wanting this book for quite some time now. I finally bought it! Let me tell you, so far so good. I just got it today and have already read a quarter of the book!!!! It's easy to read and to follow along. I'm hooked already and tempted to stay up all night just to read the whole thing!!!!I should say, I can relate to his story for I have found my twin soul (soulmate). So much of what Dennis has gone through (I have yet to read Alice's story), is similiar to my situation and helps me to understand my life.Maybe the book resonates more with me because I can look back on my life and see all the pertinent events that helped to lead me to my twin soul. There's no simple answers or steps to follow that could bring your twin soul to you. As they say, it always happens when you're least looking for it (which is also true in my case!) And remember, it may not even happen in this lifetime. Not everyone is always ready for the kind of unconditional love that comes with twin soul relationships!"},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"A good friend of mine loaned me this wonderful book after I purchased a few of the meditation CDs recorded by Dennis. I haven't met Dennis or Alice, but you can't help but feel a connection with these wonderful people after reading this book! :) They are very warm and open writers who have an inspiring love story to share. This book is for anyone who can relate to having a twin soul connection with a partner, or anyone searching for their twin soul. I am eagerly waiting for their next book to find out how they ended up back in Seattle after their move to Florida. I would love to see these authors put together a book of their poetry and a book on past life regression. Great read! :)"},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"I have to say I only read this because Dennis is my cousin. This book has made me think, ponder, wonder, and even ask questions. It is a wonderful love story. It shows that when you think that all is lost, there is the chance that you can have it all again. Love is the most important factor in life. Thank you for showing me that true love can conquer all. Even if you don't believe in people being &quot;Pyschic&quot;, this book is enjoyable to read.

Dennis &amp; Alice sound like wonderful people and I'm glad they shared their story."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"This book was truly exceptional. It was unique in that they each shared their own chapters on their own lives before merging together to share chapters of their unique love story. I felt as if I were on a magical carpet ride experiencing the same Desires of wanting to be with someone so much and receiving the soul truth that this person desired to be with me. This was the actual way it was for both Dennis and Alice. Their adventurous ways of starting slow with getting to know one another in a fun-filled flirty fashion to totally changing their lifestyles to ride cross country together to live in the same state made me want to cheer them on from the sidelines. To feel the Universal guidance throughout the book that brought them to meet and fall in Love made me feel so much more confident in allowing this same guidance to guide me to my true Love. I sighed many times in happiness as their love grew stronger and stronger and they settled into a brand new blissful world. I had sent the book to two other friends who too loved the book and felt it was very hard book put down. I plan to read it again and again and am eagerly waiting on the next one. I feel privledged having gotten to know them in person and just strive off their positive energy and love for one another."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"Together Again is a very inspiring, hope-giving book - very hard to put down. I completed reading this book in one sitting continuously. The special things that seemed to leap out at me - as maybe a message for me from this book - are to go with the flow and trust in the Universe; there are no mistakes - every event is a learning experience for the growth of our soul; there is no defined right or wrong; we should not be judgmental about self or about others; we should enjoy the ride/journey and savor every experience for what it is instead of worrying about the end goal all the time. I learned not to have any pre-conceived notions about the Twin Soul reunion. Just the knowledge that it is inevitable is enough for me. When the meeting can take place, I guess, depends upon how much work we are ready to put in for the soul's advancement to be ready in order to receive this great gift. Basically we are the co-creaters and have a say in every event of our lives. Together Again is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"As a person who was on the retreat where these lovely people met, I can attest to the total honesty and openness of this tale. I thoroughly enjoyed learning how the individual experiences of Alice and Dennis worked to bring them together in this life. It was also a joy to find out how their lives progressed once they were \\"rejoined.\\" I opened the book and read through the night, cover to cover. I look forward to hearing more."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"Having been an avid reader for thirty five of my thirty nine years, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone wanting to partake in a journey of the mystical, the spiritual, the heart. I could not put this book down until I had absorbed it, in it's entirety, and allowed the many lessons within to enlighten my intellect. I laughed, I cried and I felt as if I were right there beside both authors as they journeyed their way into each other's hearts. The decidedly unique style with which this book was written was a pure joy to experience and I thank the author's from the bottom of my heart for having the courage to share so much of themselves so as to touch us all with the beauty of their brilliant love."},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"I found this book to be very inspirational and enjoyable. This is a wonderful love story. Once I started reading the book, I found that I could not put it down until I finished the whole story.

The few moments I did need to put Twin Souls down my mind was preoccupied with what I had just read and couldn't wait to get back to the book to find out what would happen next. The stories of their personal growth to get to their point of &quot;readiness and openess&quot; is truly an inspiration. They have validated my own experiences and given me hope and encouragement.

In 2000, I was drawn to the back of a bookstore in Miami, FL, where I met Dennis Jackson and Alice Best for the first time! I was oblivious to the spiritual journey I was to embark upon by purchasing their book...I was 15 years old. Their story and personal journey mirrored in \\"Together Again\\", inspired me to seek my personal connection to the Universe - its never been the same since! In 2004, I had the pleasure of receiving a phenomenal psychic reading by Dennis and Alice which directed me to the path that brings me the most joy! I read many of the book they mentioned in their book and gained insights that helped in some seemingly dark times. I have nothing but appreciation for these two courageous and beautiful people...their book is truly an offspring of Love!I'll never forget what they wrote inside the cover for me...\\"Enjoy the Journey\\"! And I am!"},{"Title":"Together Again - Twin Souls Reunite in Love and Life","review":"I have been searching for some kind of truth in my own life, when I came across this lovely book.

I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful story. I have been reading all the books I could get on the subject of soulmates/twin souls but this is definitely my favourite. I recommed this book to everybody who is in search of their twin soul ( or is lucky to already be with him/her) but also to those who have a general interest to grow spiritually. What Alice and Dennis share with their readers comes truly from their hearts. The moment I put their book down I looked at their web-site which I also recommend especially for the list of further reading and tapes as well as the comments from people who had a reading done by them. I am now in touch with the authors and I was very happy to see that they took the time to write me a personal and not a standardized e.mail. I wish Dennis and Alice much sucess witn their projects and maybe I can assist them in finding a German translator for this wonderful book."},{"Title":"White Azaleas","review":"As usual Margery Casares has entwined you in her spellbinding imagination.

I had studied it in grad school back in the 1950s. I have enjoyed his thoughts on the Phantoms of Science,especially chapter IV in which he addresses questions about science and religion: \\"There can never be any real opposition between science and religion; for the one is the complement of the other\\". He is very realistic about other problems of designing honest research systems.His essay on The meaning and limits of exact Science is also very good.The man is not a good writer, but his depth of scientific knowledge is excellent"},{"Title":"Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers","review":"The author develops a series of ideas about ethical and moral issues in a very shallow unsystematic way. It's not really a scientific autobiography, more a collection of personal memories and opinions. The first assay is probably the only remotely interesting as it covers the first years of the development of the quantum mechanical theory, the rest is absolutely expendable."},{"Title":"Freshman Detective Blues, The","review":"That is the exact same question Jack, Eddie, and Julie in the book \\" The Freshman Detective Blues\\" had to answer when a skeleton was discovered in the lake at the Grizzly Creek Marina Resort at which they lived, and their answer to the question was \\"no one.\\"When Eddie and Jack found a body in the lake, all of their friends and family that lived at the resort became suspects in a murder case. With a little Columbo style detective work, Eddie, Jack, and Eddie's sister Julie work together to get the facts about was at Grizzly Creek Marina Resort nine years ago. They use the facts to find out who could've dumped a body in the lake.I personally liked this book but I was kind of disappointed at the same time. My disappointment came when the author left out gory details when talking about the bank robbery and when Eddie and Jack find the skeleton in the lake. So if you can do without too many details, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Freshman Detective Blues, The","review":"Have you ever been walking and found something really freaky on the side of the road? In The Freshmen Detective Blues that happened to Jack and Eddie were walking around this pond in the country by a forest where they fish and swim at looking for mysterious objects they people might have dropped or misplaced. While searching they discover mans' body attached to a boat motor. But the motor looked familar. It was a motor off a boat of the local marina. When they found that out they searched the logs and got some names of people who were at the marina that day. That's when the detective work comes into play. After days and days of searching they finally find the murderer. To find out I guess you will just have to read the book. I enjoyed this book because it ended a chapter in the middle of an event, making it so you had to keep reading on to find out the result of that event. It's very suspenseful and has a lot of good twists and turns."},{"Title":"Freshman Detective Blues, The","review":"I've been to all the lectures. I've read all the \\"classics,\\" from Catcher in the Rye all the way back to the Epic of Gilgamesh. Yet, I willingly blaspheme the literary world for the sake of this great tome. Possibly one of the best openings I've ever read (even better than \\"The Invisible Man,\\" and that opening's pretty sweet), it hooked me as soon as I finished the first paragraph. You can read the synopsis above to get the general plotting for this book, but I feel like it denies you the true treasure in this lost bounty: The Characters. Eddie and Jack are, quite possibly, the most vivid characters I've ever encountered. I can't tell you what it is in P.J.'s writing (I'll stab in the dark and say that perhaps it's the gimmicky, half-winking-half-serious prose), but these characters LIVE. They don't just sit on the page and rot, like a lot of characters do in so called modern classics (i.e. Vikram Seth's \\"A Suitable Boy\\"...). They jump up out of the book, and then start having adventures not even contained in the book. I don't know. There's just too much stuff in this book. Whether it's the awkward and forced anti-drug statement about the Bat-Brats (two twins who, thanks soley to their parents use of drugs in the 70's, are inexplicably evil... Ah, baby-boomer guilt...), or the totally hokey love story involving Wendy Westfall (she's so dreamy!), it is a must-read."},{"Title":"Mites:","review":"Walter and Proctor have produced a popular text for a general (scientific) audience. They deserve to be commended for challenging this group of minute animals that are mind-boggling not only in species variety but also in ecological diversity. The authors open numerous discussions on mites, which are often only passing topics in general courses in biology. Like all popular textbook efforts, there are always gaps in the material that reduce the quality of the final product. Notably, this book treats my favorite group, Unionicolidae, as though the year is 1980. It is unfortunate because recent research on the group would have enhanced their text considerably. Filling the gaps in our knowledge of this hidden biota is a lifelong pursuit, and books like this one help us to take stock of where we are as compilers of general knowledge. This book is a great starting point for researchers in the next millenium; and I hope it fills the authors' desires to stimulate interest in the mites among the readers."},{"Title":"Mites:","review":"The authors start off be railing against something they call \\"vertebrate chauvinism\\". OK, so just because Proctor and Walter didn't get their research grant this year, just because they are stuck in their bug period, just because the world at large finds apes, lions and Timothy Treadwell a trifle more interesting than ticks, we are VERTEBRATE CHAUVINISTS.Nice try, Walter.Next, we are treated to an extremely technical, non-popularized book filled with weird words no human vertebrate can possibly memorize. I feel sorry for the anti-chauvinists who have to sift through this at their evening classes.No, this is definitely not a good book, unless you're grandmother was a tic. Which she wasn't (trust me)."},{"Title":"The Macdermots of Ballycloran","review":"Anthony Trollope's first novel, and a good one. Set in Ireland in the 1830s, it tells the story of a proud but destitute family and their tragic downfall at the hands of a scoundrel. Myles Ussher is an English police captain sent to Ireland to help stop illegal whiskey making. Feemy Macdermot falls deeply in love with him, though he has no intention of returning that love. The locals hate him, and Feemy's brother Thady, when he learns of Ussher's merely using Feemy, kills him in a rage when he believes Ussher is abducting her against her will (they are actually eloping). A trial ensues and after some exciting intervals involving escapes, Thady is convicted and hanged.Trollope offers a sympathetic look at Ireland's troubles during this time period; indeed the \\"innocent\\" Feemy might symbolically represent that country while the unfeeling, spiteful Ussher is England. Trollope had spent a good deal of time in Ireland and knew the country and the people well; his use of Irish dialogue is natural and realistic. The trial scene is pretty exciting, and Trollope's broad humor is already clearly evident. The use of the dilapidated Macdermot mansion as the starting and ending point, with the main plot sandwiched inbetween as flashback, gives the novel a cinematic touch. The author would achieve greater novels as his career progressed, but this initial production highlights an auspicious start."},{"Title":"The Macdermots of Ballycloran","review":"Several years (and novels) before Trollope struck gold with THE WARDEN and the Barsetshire novels, he debuted with this account of a poverty stricken Irish landlord and his attempts to hold on to his estate and navigate the violent and seamy world or pre-famine Ireland. Thady Macdermot is the son of an Irish landowner who begins the novel trying to get payment from his various tenants and stave off a persistent creditor, while his mostly insane father increasingly accuses him of trying to sabotage his ownership of their estate, and his unsupervised young sister carries on a sexual liaison with a local police officer. As the story unfolds, we are introduced to several of the local tenants, who all have it in for this officer because of his constant raids on their illegal alcohol production, and are trying to enlist Thady's hesitant aid in \\"ridding the country of him.\\" Meanwhile, a parish priest, Father John, is actively working to keep Thady on the righteous path, and trying also to figure out how to separate Thady's sister, Feemy, from the illicit affair she has fallen into. Eventually the many conflicts erupt into an act of murder, and the final third of the novel follows the trial of the guilty party, including an in-depth analysis of the legal ramifications, as Trollope so loved to unfold.Down to its final grim death, the novel is one of squalor and depression. It is, however, to the author's great credit that even in dealing with such dark subject matter, he is able to infuse scenes of humor and liveliness throughout. If this is an impoverished people, they are still filled with life, and endeavor to live those lives and take joy in whatever they can. Be it a horse race, or the betting party preceding it - be it a local wedding - or just sitting on the porch imbibing illegal moonshine, these are characters as real as you and I. Trollope's great strength has always been in creating relatable characters with realistic dialogue, and his debut shows this was a natural talent!His descriptions of the land, its people, its homes, and its lifestyles come alive, aided by his many years spent living among them. It is noted that Trollope has not here written an English novel about the Irish, but has in fact written an Irish novel. As such, readers of his tamer and more socially acceptable novels may be shocked by the language, sexual themes, and violence on display here (including murders, hangings, and one shocking and graphically described hobbling). These are not English dames and gentlemen working within social norms to achieve love or prosperity ... these are people of the earth, sweating, fighting, and scheming to survive each day - yet described with passion and affection.The Worlds Classic edition features three deleted chapters, which help to elaborate on the legalities of the court case, and add a coda to the lives of the various characters. I found these interesting, but also felt they were wisely cut, particularly the final chapter - ending with the death, while tragic, has much more dramatic punch than tacking on a bunch of \\"here's what happened to this guy\\" narration.The edition also features an introductory essay that explores a little more in-depth the larger political ramifications of the novel, detailing how the characters of Feemy and her policeman lover, Ussher, echo the plight between England and Ireland of the day - of course I cannot go into depth here without giving much away, but suffice to say the parallels are quite interesting.In the end, have no doubt, this is a tragic novel - but Trollope's mastery of the Irish dialect and characterizations, as well as his trademark wit, make this vastly readable - quote an astonishing debut, even if the English readers of his day didn't appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Macdermots of Ballycloran","review":"Trollope was an unpromising son in a rather mixed family: father a failure as a lawyer, mother a success as a novelist and travel writer, a brother also doing well as writer. Anthony didn't amount to much when he took an assignment to central Ireland for the British mail service, but he grew in stature there, started a successful postal career and wrote his first published novel, printed in 1847.The novel did not yet establish him as a writer, but it was a start. Publishers may have liked the Macdermots, but the public didn't want to touch an Irish story. Too miserable, I guess. It dropped like a stone.It is the story of an impoverished Irish landlord family doomed to end in disaster. They built a house on credit and spend the next decades between hopeless collection of rent from destitute farmers and warding off the claims from the builder and his lawyer. Education level and intelligence are less than mediocre. There is no single person among the main characters in the novel that the author honestly likes. That is always a drawback in the way of public success.The family has a daughter who is in love with a Protestant police officer. That man is thoroughly unpopular as he puts people in jail for illegal distilling. He has no serious intentions with the Macdermot daughter. Trouble with her brother is unavoidable.Brother and sister are the central persons, but we can't quite adopt them as our main interest, as they are too daft and helpless to gain our full sympathy.A meddling priest tries to cool down the passions and to save his parish from dishonor and crime. He may be considered a hero of the novel. A social worker in the best sense, but not really efficient.The strength of the novel lies in the details of its cast, despite the lack of true sympathy on the author's part, and in folkloristic scenes such as a horse race, a wedding, a duel, and sessions of the assizes. A weakness is a certain lack of drive with the story line. Mr. Trollope wasn't good yet at pacing himself properly. One might consider the main plot too thin to be drawn out so long.I found this little mystery: the band plays 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' at the wedding. The book was published in 1847, but written a few years earlier. The story is set in the 30s. The song was written by a man who was born in 1836, according to wiki. So either he was a child prodigy, or the 1866 book edition that is the basis for this kindle version introduced a nice anachronism. Or wiki made a mistake about the song's origin.We are happy to know that Trollope went from here to the publication of uncounted successful novels, mostly set in England, and a few travel books.His heart for Ireland was not entirely large enough to be fully endearing. He always seems to accuse the poor of poverty. He will say things like:To be picturesque, poverty must be rural. Suburban misery is as hideous as it is pitiful. This was not warm love on behalf of AT, but maybe better some coolness than sugary sentiment.And now I am ready for St.Patrick's Ball."},{"Title":"The Macdermots of Ballycloran","review":"Trollope's first novel is an interesting if troubling study of the predicament of heavily indebted Irish landlords in the 1830s. The book's no-frills format, however, makes the act of reading a real chore, as it is set in courier in an ungainly 8.5 x 11 inch format. It is published by Filiquarian Publishing and distributed under the GNU Free Documentation license. I like the idea of making documents in the public domain widely accessible, but would it have killed them to set it in a more readable typeface?"},{"Title":"The Macdermots of Ballycloran","review":"I was so mad that Trollope let Thaddy suffer and suffer right until the end, with no turnaround, that I would have written him an angry letter (email?) if he were still alive. Feemy brought her suffering on herself, so I could take that. But Thaddy! How could you do that to Thaddy, Anthony? And how can Anthony make characters so real that I went to bed still thinking about Thaddy and finally had to rewrite the ending in my mind before I could go to sleep.While I was still expecting a turnaround for Thaddy I enjoyed the novel, especially the description of Mary Brady's wedding, which was Trollope humor at its best--just priceless. Also, he made me live in Ireland with those Irish people at that time in history and feel what they felt, and, although it was very sad sometimes, it was valuable to me. Father John was a dear, wonderful character--one of Trollope's best, and he wrote it as an English Protestant who did not share the anti-Catholic mania of many English Protestants of the time. He showed the hatred on both sides of the Protestant-Catholic divide quite well. George MacDonald does this very well in his novels, too.But it was such a shame that he let Thaddy down. I rewrote it mentally so that Thaddy has an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ in his cell the day before the hanging in which he is invited to receive God's love and comfort, and when Father John sees him the next morning, Thaddy's face is aglow, and he shares his experience with the good priest, and they are comforted together, for Thaddy has been told, \\"This day you will be with Me in paradise.\\" And then I slept well."},{"Title":"Web by Design: The Complete Guide","review":"Although there is a lot of information in this book if you're willing to pound through it, I wish I had never bought it.

Structured like a textbook, the last chapter of each section is a review with quizes and exercises. Various and important topics crucial to web design are discussed, and is written in a nontechnical language very easy to understand, although at times the information seems cursory. The conversational language the author uses detracts rather than enhances the text with the non-computer related analogies she uses. On the plus side, there are plenty and a wide selection of different web page examples with source codes. This book contains important basic design information of which every designer should be aware, but the size (it's big and heavy) of the book could be cut down by 1/3 and still retain all its informational content with examples. If you like an introductory web design book that speaks in a user-friendly voice this book might be worth looking through.

After reading it for a day, I wonder whether the author was plannig writing an sequel to make it complete. The book is a complete disappointment! It's shallow in every topic. For instance, the chapter on web graphic technology sounds like a paid ad. for photoshop. No real reasons were given on why photoshop is great compared to others, only a handful of quotations from other people. The book skips totally about other tools for graphic design. The chapter on web programming is impossibly pointless. It tries to cover a bunch of web languages in 30 pages, and over half of those pages are taken up by half-page sized screen shots that offer little information.The book is a complete disaster: it's incomplete, shallow, and full of useless opinions and quotations."},{"Title":"Web by Design: The Complete Guide","review":"This book seems at first glance to be a great book. The cover is magnificent, it has lotsa great info, and many examples of code.But when you buy the book, and actually sit down to read it, you discover that the first impression just doesn't hold up. First of all, the author, Molly Something, is completely obsessed with herself. The book contains tons of examples, links and images of herself. Even the examples have herself spattered all over them. The second thing that annoys me is that Molly obviously thinks she is in the front of web-publishing, pushing the boundries and making the best sites. This is simply not true. Although the book clearly shows a good path to follow when developing a web site, Molly isn't clever enough to use them practically, resulting in second class web-sites. The design-studio site is an example of this. Fair enough, but not in any means a great site. She breaks all the rules she has set in the book, like not keeping the colors consistant throughout the site, and having navigational icons without descriptions.The book has also tons and tons of useless code. It is just not interesting, leave it out!This is just some of the flaws in web by design. Most annoying is the fact that Molly has to have her life, thoughts and images all over the book, examples and tips. Pardon me, but I want to learn how to set up a style-sheet, not listen to how Molly used to be a party-girl, and how her old boyfriend treated her.The book does an ok job setting up a strategy for developing a web-site.

The author really knows her way on how to make even the simplest webpage have its own value to the point that it can make it to the market level.

Much of the book consists of examples - full pages of text in some gibberish (not real words) with a few HTML keywords, then the next page shows what it looks like on the screen. There must be 100 pages of comlpete gibberish. There is a big section of color pages in the middle of the book, (a &quot;Color Reference&quot;), but the colors aren't right-someone didn't communicate properly with the printer.

Enough said."},{"Title":"Zane's Chocolate Flava: The Eroticanoir.com Anthology","review":"Chocolate Flava, edited by Zane, is a collection of 25 erotic short storied from authors such as Victor DeVanardo, Eileen M. M. Johnson, Jonathan Luckett and of course Zane. This is a his-and-her collection of steamy stories that will provide both men and women a little erotic fantasy.The stories in this book were of adult themes with sexual explicit episodes that could be disturbing to some readers. If homosexuality bothers you, Chocolate Flava is not the book for you. There are heterosexual encounters and depictions of male/male and female/female homosexual encounters as well. In addition to the same sex issues, the stories contained twosomes, threesomes and all out-group sex. In some cases there were so many people having sex that if proved difficult to keep up with whom is having sex with whom.One of my favorites is \\"Selena the Sexual Healer\\" by Victor DeVanardo. The main charter is Selena, who has mastered the art of sex through her sexual research of cathouses of Havana, Japanese geishas and phone sex magicians. Selena was hired to prevent William G. Gaddys an anti-porn crusader from addressing the Congressional Committee on Regulation of Adult Entertainment. Selena, the high priestess of sex succeeds and has William raising money as a stripper for the Society for Sexual Liberation and Freedom and the Home for Retired Exotic Dancers.While the homosexual encounters were not to my liking, the reviewer enjoyed the book for what it was: a collection of sizzling, hot, and steamy, sexually explicit encounters, with no real story lines. So if you are looking for stories where the characters seek their pleasure at ultimate limits, this is the book for you. So be warned and read at your own risk."},{"Title":"Zane's Chocolate Flava: The Eroticanoir.com Anthology","review":"Zane handpicked some very talented writers in this collection.

Beginning with stories done by the ladies, next, the ones done by the men, and last but most definitely not least, are the sexastional tales done by Miss EroticaNoir! Chocolate Flava will give you a hard time choosing your favorite tale in each section. Maybe that was the plan though, to make every story your favorite story. Who knows? This is a fabulous read!"},{"Title":"Zane's Chocolate Flava: The Eroticanoir.com Anthology","review":"Can you say turn up the heat? This anthology ranges from the tamest erotica to the most explicit, featuring twenty-four authors who have challenged the African-American sexual revolution to the fullest. There is something for everyone, as the passages focus on many different sexualities and situations.Using a no-holds barred, in-your-face style, this can definitely be classified as \\"nasty\\". Without a doubt, there leaves little to the imagination. These authors have put together a package that captures the essence of what the true definition of \`getting busy' may actually be. Leaving plenty of room for questions, this anthology also provides some answers to things you may have always pondered, but never knew who to ask.CHOCOLATE FLAVA is definitely on the freaky side, and is not for everyone; especially children. Also, if you're not into challenging your mind or crossing boundaries, this anthology is not for you. Some of the stories are subtle, and definitely more interesting than others, but for the most part - expect sex, sex and more sex. On the other hand, if you're one of those folks who love to live vicariously through others, this may be the book you've been waiting for.Reviewed by T.

The Marry Widow, and a few others.The Marry Widow was an extremely well written story the author made you imagine this wife who had to deal with her husband infidelities at his funeral but when his mistresses contact her she finds her self in the middle of a sexual orgy.

Recently put an X in prison for molesting my daughters. I keep waiting for the plot to twist, clues are there. Almost finished reading...."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jack St. Bride is looking to make a new start in the small town of Salem Falls after being released from an eight month prison sentence for sexual assault; charges brought about by one of his students at the girls prep school where he taught. Jack is in the process of making a new life for himself with a job, a love interest, and some stability when his past is leaked to the town and he is thrown back into his nightmare as new accusations are brought against him.As usual, Jodi Picoult has created a suspenseful novel that leaves you thinking about it long after you've finished reading. One of the central themes in this novel is truth, and it is interesting to see how this works in with the dynamics of each family in the novel and their relationships with each other. Also worth considering after you're done reading is how some of the lies told were motivated by other issues than simply a desire to manipulate, and in our own lives, it wouldn't be a bad idea to stop and think about the person telling them before making assumptions. Also figuring prominently in the novel is the Wiccan religion which I think made it a bit more interesting than a straightforward court case; I loved how the modern day witchhunt is worked in so well with the Wiccan themes, as well as the location of Salem Falls and the quotes included from The Crucible. Another great novel by Jodi Picoult!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have yet to read a Jodi Picoult work I did not like. That being said, it was clear to me that this is an older work of hers. She was still working on refining her plots- specifically her subtlety in text, predictability, and omniscient narrative instead of writing in each character's account via their voice. I really enjoyed elements of the story, even if some of the main characters lacked a little depth. She has some unbelievable aspects in the plot as well, but it's suspenseful and definitely worth a read!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am a big Jodi Picoult fan each book keeps us wondering until the end. This book was OK... I don't think it was Jodi's best work and for one of the first times the ending was predictable."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"A beautiful touching, human book that keeps you on reading till the end. I love reading books of Jodi ."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have read at least three books from Picoult and have never been disappointed in her work. Most authors stick to the same subject but Picoult goes out of her way to make sure to keep things interesting and cover a variety of topics. I was impressed by this book and didn't expect it to cover what it did in the fact of the subject matter. It kept me reading and very interested and I thought the ending served as a cliffhanger and found it shocking if what I thought was accurate. I would highly recommend this book even to men. I also encourage her readers to keep reading the rest of her novels as they each serve their own surprise and appeal."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I don't know why people slammed this book, I loved it! I saw the Lifetime movie of it first and loved the story line, I bought the Kindle book and I am so happy I did. It is the first book I have read by Picoult and it won't be the last. Love the story line of the individuals in the book, love how the chapters are shorter. I was cheering for Addie and Jack all through the book and loved them both!! A great book!!!!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"If you have never read this author, You should invest some time with her books. She will have you thinking in depth about a subject from angles you may never have believed. I would strongly suggest picking up a book by Jodi Picoult"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"If you're looking for a Picoult novel minus the emotional tears you've found a contender. Like most of her plots this one comes with it's own twists and turns. You know that until the final page there's always room for a plot point you never saw coming. Picoult plays the reader by revealing critical information so slowly you're dying to have the whole picture. Right. Now.I'll admit this book starts a little slower than I expected. It definitly took about 50 to 70 pages (till the first twist happens) to really get hooked. What keeps you glued to the story is the need to find out if Jack really did it. I swear there were several points where I wanted to throw the book against a wall...\\"He couldn't have done it!!! Could he??? Ahh!\\"Mind you, my frustration was exacerbated by the fact that my assistant had just read the book...She knew the ending! You have no idea how badly I wanted to get the ending from her; how many times I begged for her to tell me if Jack did it! She's a woman of strength though, and managed to restrain herself from spilling the beans.I have a special place in my heart for the Salem Witch Trials. They were the focus of my minor in Women's Studies. Some really cray cray stuff. I loved the way Picoult picked and chose which parts of the historical situation she pulled out exact and which she remixed in a new way. The choice to include an actual Wiccian Coven in the book was very cool. The part they played; remixed and interesting.As much as I enjoyed the book a few parts didn't do it for me. It was actually the fact that she was a little grandiose in her characterization and motivations that the plot fell a bit flat. Some of the conversations were so dramatic as to feel forced. Like it was trying too hard; stressing too much. Plus the real bad guy never gets his due.3.5/5 Worth the addictive read...even if it doesn't work perfectly."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have never read a Jodi Picoult book before, but this one came highly recommended by a co-worker and a book club member, so I took it on vacation with me. I stopped reading this half way - I just couldn't take it once Jack got arrested again. Too predictable, too weird, too boring. The Hawthorn rip off was just so obvious. I thought I might pick it up again to finish it, but there are just too many other good books out there."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"One of the qualities I most value in the writing of Jodi Picoult is her ability to bring human relationships to realistic life. Her plotting is generally superb. Therefore, Salem Falls falls way short of Picoult's potential because of its predictability. Her prose is great, but the story is same old, same old. A guy falsely accused of rape, then it happens all over again. Some bored teenaged girls dabbling in witchcraft. So what do you suppose will happen? This book came highly recommended, but it's definitely not up to par. It's OK, not a bad read, but lacks the powerful punch of most of Picoult's exceptional work."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Another successful Picolut novel. Instantly drawn into the story, waiting for the first twist as Picoult always delivers (in my humble opinion). I figured out the 'draw' of the book not to far in to the story but still could not put it down.Salem Falls, a small New England town, where Annie Peabody owns and runs a local diner. Her father Roy is an alcoholic and has secrets. Annie has secrets. A stranger comes to town, Jack, and he has secrets. A young group of teenage girls, lead by Gilly, have secrets, too. Secrets mean the \\"small town\\" has calm no more."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is my first Jodi Picoult novel. I wasn't sure if it was a junior novel when I began reading it, but after awhile, it didn't matter. Salem Falls is a small town that thrives on gossip and drama. A mysterious stranger comes to town and everything starts to go downhill. One woman pretends her dead daughter is still alive, and the town teens are into Wicca. (kind of a cliche, imo...). The story is a page turner however, and the mystery comes alive. I do think the ending was a bit rushed and a bit of a let down after all of the build-up. I wish that the girls' reactions would have been explored further in the second half of the book. I am glad I discovered this author, and will read her other books. I do recommend this for older teens and think they'd really like the story."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jack St. Bride is starting over in a new town after serving 8 months in jail for a sexual assault he didn't commit. He hopes he can leave the past behind him, but it's impossible in a small town like Salem Falls, where word of his conviction spreads quickly. While he finds a special friend in Addie Peabody, who owns the town diner, St. Bride soon will find that supporters in Salem Falls are few - and he will soon face another accusation.This \\"Crucible\\"-inspired story gets a lot of things right - the different father-daughter relationships are interesting to compare; the flashbacks intertwined to show the characters' back stories without just spouting it all off in a boring fashion; the characters of Jordan and Selena are back, and since I was introduced to them in \\"The Pact,\\" it was nice to have familiar characters integral to this plot.Things working against the book - Jack's unwise and unreasonable actions getting him into trouble not once, but twice. Picoult has her characters do some unbelievable things to get them into trouble that makes the plot. Obviously there would be no plot if the characters didn't encounter an obstacle, but when they do ridiculous things to lead them there - that is weak, I think. And it is hard to sympathize with Jack for certain actions he takes, first as a teacher in Loyal and then when he wanders into the woods in Salem Falls. In too many instances, plot drives the characters, and it should work the other way around.Once the inevitable trial and courtroom drama began, I found the pages going by quicker and quicker as I was enthralled and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen. That is something Picoult is a master at - she knows how to write a page-turner, for sure. The ending was awfully easy, with a surprise twist that wasn't all that surprising to me. Some of the reviews on here spoil it, so be careful what you read here if you're planning to take on this book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book held my interest from the first sentence and was actually hard for me to put down. The characters' experiences provide different viewpoints on similar topics (false accusation of rape vs. reactions of rape victims). Presented in flashback form, characters are developed and their motivations become understood. Jodi Picoult is effective at adding to the layers of the story as well as in peeling back layers of characters' personalities.Look for clues throughout the book of Gillian's hate of her father and the early years of some older characters. Two things I found hard to believe were Jack's mother's turning against him so relentlessly and the fact that Jack could be so irresistible to teenage girls. Have read 2 Jodi Picoult books now (also My Sister's Keeper); have found them both excellent and will definitely read more."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Okay, finished a Stephen King book, and needed something for a x-country plane trip...Enter my wife (a huge Oprah's book club fan...sigh...) trying to force feed me some typical O stuff.

With the way Jodi Picoult worded his experience, I felt as though I was just as frustrated and trapped as he was. After being accused of raping a girl on the soccer team he coached, Jack spent 8 months in prison. When he got out, all he wanted to do was start over. He arrived in Salem Falls, Massachusetts and instantly got a job from the sweet owner of the town diner, Addie Peabody. There was an instant chemistry between them. Everything seems to be going good when all the sudden he's accused of rape once again. This is a great story that literally makes you unable to put the book down. The suspense is almost painful at times. All four hundred and sixty-four pages will have your undivided attention.Gillian Duncan is your typical malicious teenage girl with a crush who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. She is different, however, in the fact that she practices witchcraft. She decides to use her witchcraft to try to make Mr. St. Bride love her. Gillian is part of a group of friends who all share this particular interest. With her father, Amos Duncan, being the most powerful man in Salem Falls, she has been used to getting what she wants her whole life.In Salem Falls, there are many people who know exactly what they want and they ruthlessly go for it. While this great trial goes on throughout the book, there are also many little dramatic situations occurring on the side.If you want to find out what happens in Jack St. Bride's struggle for freedom against a town full of people who've had hard feelings toward him from the second he arrived, you must do yourself a favor and read this terrific story."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Salem Falls is the kind of novel that keeps you up at night, the kind in which you forgo sleep just to read. I love Piccoult manages to tell modern morality tales with such suspense. I liked the allusions to the crucible and to the Salem Witch trials. The characterization was excellent. This novel will have you question everything you know about the people in your life, about your neighbors and community members. Superb."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi Picoult has become one of my favorite author's after reading My Sister's Keeper. This novel, like her others, captured me from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. Like some of her other novels this has a little twist at the end which causes you to look at the story in a different way. I've managed to read all but 3 of her novels now. I'm not one to follow any particular author but Jodi's technique has me captured and I can't wait for her next novels. I find it had to believe that everyone didn't give this book a five star rating. Give it a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This was the first Picoult book that I ever read. While the story line was not necessarily new (trial,suspected rape, denial and more of the same)the web of subplots kept me guessing all the way to the end. There were times when the bad guys looked good and vice versa all while the truth was ignored. It probably happened someplace. Read it. I now am going to read her other novels."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have read every one of Picoult's books and am sad to find that the quality has lessened with every book. In fact, I think &quot;The Pact&quot; was the last semi-plausible and well-written book that she wrote.This newest book was so full of inconsistencies, errors in procedure (police and courtroom),and sloppiness. There were too many different issues covered and consequently none of them was done well. Picoult needs better editing and much better advice on the legal issues, and she needs to stop churning out books at such a furious pace and be more careful. Readers are not stupid--we know when something can or cannot happen. I, for one, do not like to have a writer make something up so as to manipulate the story. For example--the crime scene was not cordoned off until the next morning. As if that would ever happen, no matter how small the town. But it was written this way to facilitate the direction in which the author wanted the story to go. Shouldn't the action determine the story, not the other way around?The characters in this book lacked any depth and were like cardboard cutouts. I did not care about one of them with the possible exception of Addie.It seems as though Picoult is only concerned with the final product, not how the story is put together. I see a novel as a tightly woven tapestry, a blending of many elements into a wonderful entity. In this book, I see disarray and holes in the fabric of the story."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I must confess that when I ordered this book, I was anxious to read it and put Harry Potter Vol. #4 aside so I can read it. I love Jodie Picoult's writing, and was eagerly anticipating more of the same with this book. I found to my disappointment that it wasn't as riveting as The Pact or as enthralling as Keeping Faith. I am disappointed ~~ while the writing is always lyrical and riveting, the story holds no surprises for me.Jack St. Bride is accused of raping a girl in Salem Falls ~~ and Jordan MacAffee is his attorney again. Addie, the woman who falls in love with Jack, also undergo a personal revelation as well in this multi-faceted novel. There is a group of teenage girls who practice Wicca ~~ which is interesting. And there's the showdown, which Picoult is known for ~~ but if you're looking for a great Picoult book, I highly recommend The Pact because the courtroom scene there is wonderful! It is suspenseful and breath-stopping. But in this book, it's lackluster and disappointing.Please don't hesitate to read this book ~~ it is still a good read. It just isn't up to par to her other books ~~ and it could be the subject is familiar to me. What teenage girl doesn't fanastize about her favorite male teacher? And what woman doesn't shudder at the idea of being raped? Or being accused falsely of a crime one didn't commit? And reading about some of Jack's past helps give him a human face in the book ~~ it just didn't explore his personality like I hoped it would. It's almost as if Picoult is trying to write about rape, sex and its effect on women ~~ but something's missing there as it leaves me with more questions than revelations. This is a powerful subject but it misses the mark somewhere.It is still a wonderful book ~~ just don't get your hopes up too much like I did. It just isn't my favorite Picoult book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have to preface this by saying that I have read all of Jodi Picoult's books, and always wait anxiously for her next to arrive. She is an incredible writer, who always has compelling and interesting plots and characters, but Salem Falls was not up to her usual standards.It starts with a bang -- a brilliant Ph.D who landed himself in prison with false charges of statatory rape gets out and settles in Salem Falls, a quaint, nothing ever happens, type of North East coast town. I was immediately drawn to his character as well as that of the woman who \\"takes him in,\\" Addie. She is a woman tied to the past, and psychologically impacted by it -- afraid that those she loves will leave her, and unwilling to accept that those she has lost are truly gone. It takes her many years, for example, to accept that her daughter has passed away.Aside from these two likeable characters and some less visible ones, the main characters are four teenagers. One of whom accuses Jack of rape, puts him on trial, and has the whole town defending her. And this is where the book lost its draw for me. The punch of a start fizzled out half way through as I began to piece together everything I knew would happen next, and it did. The ending might have been a surprise, had I not guessed it at the very beginning. And had I not been drawn to Jack, longing for him to earn the respect he deserves, I might have given up.I suppose if I had never read Picoult, this one might have appealed to me. But my expectations were so high that this was a let down. All of her other books are incredible, this one, mediocre in my opinion. But I would still recommend it, just not before any of her other jewels."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"SALEM FALLS by Jodi PicoultJodi Picoult does it again with SALEM FALLS, a story about a man who is falsely accused of rape. Jack St. Bride was a teacher and soccer coach at a small town high school, when he is accused of rape and is sentenced to 8 months in prison. When he is released, he finds his way to another small town, Salem Falls, to start a new life, hoping that anonymity will give him the peace he is looking for.The wheels of fate start turning when he has to report in to the local police department and let them know he is a sex-offender. In this small town, gossip spreads fast, and soon the entire town learns who Jack really is. Only two people feel that he is innocent of the crime he was accused of back home: Addie Peabody, who owns the \\"Do-or-Diner\\" and her father, Roy Peabody. Both of them are dealing with losses that have greatly affected their current life, and in some way they can relate to Jack as he struggles to escape from his past.At the heart of this story is the theme of \\"the witch hunt\\", as the towns people watch Jack closely with condemning eyes as they wait for him to make his first mistake. He is then accused of yet another rape, this time accused by the only daughter of the richest man in Salem Falls. Jodi Picoult keeps the reader guessing, as even the reader isn't sure whether Jack is guilty or not. As with KEEPING FAITH and THE PACT, this book ends in the courtroom, and it is anyone's guess what the final verdict will be.This is yet another Jodi Picoult book that I enjoyed a lot. Although it took me a while to get into the story, as I had a hard time relating to the teens who practiced witchcraft, it all came together in the end. Highly recommended, I am giving this book five stars."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is the third Picoult novel I have read and I am hooked! Her books are engrossing and always make one ask hard questions.The story begins with Jack, a high school teacher, as he is falsely accused of having an affair with a student. On the advice of his lawyer, he plea bargains and does 8 months in jail for the offense. Throughout his incarceration his one ray of light is that he was innocent of the charge and vows to never put himself in a position to be vulnerable to another accusation.Unfortunately for Jack, he moves to Salem Falls, a town with a history of witchcraft and false accusations, and becomes the target of a teenage femme fatale bent on seducing him.The past has a way of repeating itself in Salem Falls and soon Jack stands accused of rape again.The brilliance of Picoult's writing is that one never knows whether to believe in the innocence of the accused character or not (the same theme is present in Plain Truth and The Pact). In fact, the final explanation in this book isn't totally revealed until, literally, the very last paragraph. One which will leave you gasping in disbelief.An Excellent Read!!!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book has a little of everything: romance, intrigue, witches and a courtroom battle.While I liked this book, I did find it to be somewhat predictable. I knew the ending before I reached it but Picoult has a way with telling a story.I found Jack to be an interesting character, a man with a past he cannot escape. His love interest, Addie, has her own haunting past. They were probably the most developed characters in the book. I found the teenagers to be a little too superficial, they just didn't come across to me as very realistic.I plan to read more from this author, especially her newer releases. For one of her better stories with a courtroom drama, try reading The Pact. It won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Salem FallsIn true Picoult style, Jodi has written yet another wonderful story combining romance and suspense. This author continues to be one of my favorites.Jack St. Bride find himself released from prison on a cold and blustery day with inadequate clothing and no place to go. A passing cab driver picks him up and with no clear destination in mind Jack finds himself in the small town of Salem Falls. Luck was on his side that day as he spots a help-wanted sign in a local caf&eacute; and Addy Peabody becomes his rescuing angel. Jack is determined to start a new life never imagining that he could possibly find love and happiness again.Salem Falls has it's share of secrets, lies and intrigue. Jack soon finds himself accused of a crime he didn't commit all because of the past that continues to haunt him. Mystery and a touch of the occult combine to keep the reader enthralled to the last page."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I was so keen to get started on this new Jodi Picoult, that I actually started reading it in the store before I bought it, so you can imagine my disappointment when I got down to the serious business of reading it! I found the story line predictable, the characters very flat, and overall, the whole novel was pedestrian. The &quot;made for t.v.&quot; version of Wicca that was presented in the novel did nothing to improve my view of the story, and generally, I would have expected better from a writer of this calibre."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Honestly, I have spent 434 pages in better company than this book. Picoult is heavy-handed and formulaic in a setting that has been overdone for years now - that of the quirky New England small town. Her slightly mad waitress is stereotypical and uninspiring. Her corrupt police officers make me crave another viewing of Fargo. Her portrayal of teenagers is laughably laced with outdated (even at the time of writing) pop culture references clearly written by someone twice the teens' age (although, being Wiccan and having been a teenager not long ago, I have certainly encountered their like). Further, there are times when she simply does not know when to stop using flowery adjectives to gild the wilted lilies of her characters. Her reference to someone's penis as \\"the plum-purple weight of him\\" made me cringe.The plot itself is a little more interesting. One of the few characters who actually engender some emotion - in this case, positive emotion - Jack St. Bride, is engaging, and one wants to see him through his struggle, which is described in admirable, if implausible detail. Even though his bad luck is literally unimaginable, the situations are painted vividly enough that we want to continue to follow them and learn more. However, the courtroom scenes are unrealistic and weak. Emotions which should be inferred simply from a given plot twist are overwrought with drama and laden with adjectives. The last page is predictable from halfway through.If I didn't like Jack St. Bride's character so much, I probably wouldn't have finished the book. However, there is enough juiciness and plot development to keep the reader engrossed, and despite the flaws in the writing, I got through it quickly and with some satisfaction. Don't read this if you are expecting great fiction. It is preferable to read this than to turn on a Lifetime special on the same subject - statutory rape, however. The book also appears to offer more information on Wicca than your average \\"Teen Witch\\" manual."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I swear, Jodi Picoult is a magic story weaver! I am so impressed with this novel and the fact that it completely surpassed my expectations, especially after reading the stellar Plain Truth. Salem Falls is so juicy and exciting, an intoxicating cocktail of everything I love in a suspensful, page-turning drama. And even though I had a strong hunch about the book's ending, it was no less exhilarating to watch it unfold.Salem Falls tells the story of Jack St. Bride, a former teacher who, according to him, was wrongly accused of sexual assault against one of his students. After doing his time in jail, Jack heads out to start a new life and stumbles into the peaceful, sleepy town of Salem Falls. But it doesn't take long before his past catches up with him, and Jack finds himself fighting another battle for his life. And at its core is a quartet of girls, best friends who are part of a witches coven -- and one girl in particular who has the power to destroy Jack St. Bride.A perfect blend of magick, power, desire and betrayal, with an explosive courtroom drama of an ending, Salem Falls will have any reader glued to their seats, feverishly turning pages. I loved this book and look forward to reading the rest of Jodi Picoult's novels."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"While this is not the best work of Jodi Picoult, it is undoubtedly better than much of what is on the market. The style is authentically Picoult as it contains the twist-and-turn, flashback and character development Picoult readers have come to expect. The first forty percent of the book moves at an unusually slow pace for a Picoult novel, but does in fact pick up toward the end.The story is set in, as usual, a New England town in New Hampshire. A man recently released from prison after serving a short term for \\"sexual assault\\" on a high school student of his lands in Salem Falls hoping to escape his old life and begin anew. He enters a romantic relationship, finds a job and settles down only to have his secret leaked by the police - the beginning of the end. From there he is accused of another sexual assault on the daughter of the wealthiest man in town and a trial ensues.Like Picoult's other work, she attempts to slip some red herrings in addition to legitimate clues into the plot. Hoping to keep the reader guessing to the end, I was disappointed at how predictable this particular novel was. I've read 5 other Picoult books and none have come this close to predictable. Reader beware, if you are familiar with this style of writing, plot development and suspense tactics and tend to speculate the ending of a book, this may not be for you. If you are looking for a nice, well-written, slightly above-average book - pick this one up. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I was disappointed with this after reading My Sister's Keeper (which I loved).There are too many plot holes in this story, too many inconsistencies. Like how the semen on Gilly's thigh was never explained - that's the most major one. The characters don't seem realistic. Addie and Jack's relationship annoyed me - the scenes with them seemed very contrived. The dialogue, most of the time, comes off as cheesy. Its the only way to describe it. Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy and cliched. The story only picked up its pace during the courtroom scenes (the best scenes out of the entire book) but still the ending was very unsatisfying as it did not explain a whole lot of things. And also, Picoult ends nearly *every* scene with a character dropping a one-liner. I found this rather irritating. Maybe its just me.Addie misunderstands Jack so many times and overreacts again and again -the reader can only tolerate so much up to a certain point. The worst scene, I think, was when Jack tried to clear out Addie's dead daughter's room to get Addie to move on. It was so unoriginal.The plot is not believable. It just doesn't work. The portrayal of Gilly was inconsistent and one-dimensional. Why did she try to poison her father? What would it have achieved? Why was she so angry at him in the beginning? Her motives were never clear from the start and Picoult does not satisfyingly explain them.I'll say one good thing though. She can write courtroom scenes pretty well."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult, but this was not her best. As another reviewer stated, there were no surprises. The book was pretty predictable and the ending seemed very rushed!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I rarely set aside a book without finishing it, but I am sorely tempted to stop reading this one. The writing is so-so (significantly more telling than showing), the plot fairly predictable, and the characters shallow. Worse still, it is boring.

I realize that I am staking my review next to the Amazon's #1 reviewer(!!), but I wanted to give other readers an alternate opinion."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I wasn't sure about the subject matter when I picked this up, but after just a few pages, I was pulled in. A lot of it reminded me of the movie \\"The Craft\\", and I don't think the characters and subplots were as deep as some of Picoults other novels, but it was still a good read, one I would recommend. The author has a way of making situations real, and attacking issues in our society today, and this novel is a great example of that."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"If you have not read this book, please be aware this review contains information you probably don't want to read...I just finished the book and I am left with a question and some ideas. First of all, I don't think Gillian is as one dimensional as some of the reviews make her out to be. I agree with an earlier poster that says that if you re-read the language on the last page it answers several inconsistencies. It could explain why Gillian tries to poison her dad and why there is semen on her leg (if you remember, he ran after her when she wasn't in the house). However, I can't quite decide if I am making these facts up and fitting them where they don't belong. Any ideas???"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Salem Falls is yet another great work by Jodi Piccoult. Her magical storytelling ability doesn't fail to bring yet another story and another set of wonderful characters to life.Set in the small town of Salem Falls, New Hampshire this story is a lesson in people. We come to know and love Jack and Addie and Roy, and come to loathe other characters. Her development of them is exceptional, and truly enjoyable. The story has wonderful twists and turns keeping you guessing the entire length of the book. Just as you begin to believe one thing, something happens to turn that upside down as well.If you enjoy Jodi Piccoult's novels, or enjoy wonderful suspense with great character development, Salem Falls is a great novel for you. Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it back down.

Keep trying Jodi!!!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi really outdid herself with her newest novel, Salem Falls. I have read all of her books and this one ranks right up there with The Pact. It's addictive, shocking, won't-let-you-go reading, and you won't be able to put it down! I read it in two days, and after I was finished, I was compelled to read it over again to look for the clues I missed! You won't be disappointed with this book, and my only advise to you is this...do NOT read ahead!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"A display of her books in the local bookstore led me to give this immensely popular author a try. I did not expect great literature, but I hoped for some diversion and a clever plot that would keep me turning pages. What I got was 400+ pages of cardboard characters, dreadful dialogue, a central romance without chemistry, wince-worthy metaphors that would not pass muster in Creative Writing 101 (\\"He felt as though he had been asked to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear\\") and a hackneyed plot devoid of any suspense or originality. The book culminates in one of the most ludicrous descriptions of a trial ever written, with a key witness interrupting the proceedings not once, but twice, to distribute homemade goodies. Remarkably, the judge not only fails to stop this nonsense, but devours the food with relish! The author does achieve the rare feat of simultaneously suggesting that most men are sexually-abusive beasts AND that women, especially young girls, can't be trusted when they make accusations of abuse. Last but not least, any reader who doesn't see the \\"surprise\\" twist at the end coming for several hundred pages has not been paying attention! Avoid this one."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Let me start by saying I love Jodi Picoult books. This one was a little less appealing. The beginning was fairly good, but the middle parts seemed to drag on. The ending was a little predictable, which was disappointing. Usually, there is some twist at the end of her books, but I didn't see that in this one. It was still a good book, and I enjoyed reading it. If I were to recommend a book to someone who had never read Jodi Picoult, it would not be my first suggestion, though.

I bought a copy of \\"Salem Falls\\" and once I'd read a few pages, I realized I'd read the book some years earlier. Despite knowing what was going to happen the entire way, the story still captivated me a second time.Most people know of someone in their community -- a teacher, coach, minister, etc -- who has been charged with sexual assault. Salem Falls creates a real situation where we see how this affects the accused and the accusers as well as family and friends. How it can tear apart a community. The characters were well-drawn and the plot believable.This is an interesting read.

Jack has been recently released from prison after serving time for a crime he didn't commit. The false accusation and conviction destroyed his life and teaching career. When Jack tries to pick up the pieces and start a new life in a small town, the residents learn of his \\"crime\\" and the accusations and outright attacks begin.Picoult's characters are always fascinating and multi-level, which is why I enjoy her books and she presents all sides to a story, lending credence to her characters' motivations. Her books make me think and there are never clear-cut answers.I was shocked by one of the accusations as I felt I knew the characters well and was very disappointed, questioning why she would try to destroy Jack's life. However, as this is a tale of a witchhunt and the frightening results of people banding together in unity whether right or wrong, I guess it makes sense. I just get angry when events occur that I know are not right!The end wasn't a huge shock as there were hints throughout the book, but I have to say Picoult's way of revealing the truth was astonishing and packed a heavy punch. It also added some humanity to the tale and if not some compassion for one of the characters, at least a deeper understanding of the driving force behind her accusation."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I read this one at work and couldn't put it down.

Jack is released from prison after serving time for statutory rape. One of his students had accused him of having an affair with him, and the plea bargain he settles for seems to confirm his guilt. Once released, he wants nothing but to start a new life far from the community that put him behind bars. Settling in Salem Falls and accepting a meager job at a diner, Jack soon learns that his past will always follow him, no matter how discreet he tries to be. When rumors start to spread in Salem Falls, he immediately becomes a pariah, and a target of violence. He also becomes the target of Meg, a teenager with some serious issues, straight out of The Crucible. When Jack does not respond to her advances, Meg will do whatever it takes to make him pay, including turning his life into a scene from the Salem witch trials.This book had everything a Picoult fan could expect: a budding relationship between Jack and the diner's proprietress, an alleged violent crime, a thorough criminal investigation, and a dramatic trial. I loved the trivia aspect, how Jeopardy shaped Jack's life and how knowledge was his savior. I really liked the incorporation of witchcraft in the plot, both the scheming and spell-casting of Meg and her friends (think \\"The Craft\\") and the use of quotes from The Crucible and references to the Salem witch trials.

Picoult is a master story-teller, and in this I give her top marks. She knows how to create characters that come alive and crawl under your skin, to the point where, if I had to put the book down for any length of time, they would stay with me in my mind and I would be vividly picturing what might happen next.As a few other readers have commented though, the ending - in terms of who &quot;wins&quot; at least - is a bit predictable. However, there were always little niggling details that I kept turning over in my mind: &quot;But what about...?&quot; Even if you do have some sense of how things will turn out, there's always enough to make you want to keep reading. In fact, when I still had 180 pages to go, I simply lay in bed all day until I finished it (lucky I'm on summer holidays).I'm not convinced that Jodi Picoult could ever win the Booker Prize with this novel, but it's still a great read. If you haven't read any of her other books, this is as good a place as any to start."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I picked up this book in desperation because I had nothing to read.

It was for our bookclub and everyone in the group (12 of us) felt the same way. I'm squeamish about reading another book by her again. It read like a soap opera to both myself and my bookclub.

I was in the mood for reading someone new, so I headed for the P's in the fiction section.Ugh! What a disappointment when I began reading the cover blurbs! Then I picked up Salem Falls. Witches! That was all I needed, so I headed for the checkout. Yes, I also bought the Writer's Digest.I must be honest and say that I needed a year to finish this book. However not because I found it unreadable, but because Ms. Picoult strikes a bit too close to home in her descriptions of how modern men must interact with teenage females. One of my male friends was falsely accused by his ex-wife of raping his step-daughter, and the next six months of his life were absolute hell. Reading the first half of this book was very discomforting.For her accurate portrayal of Jack's paranoia after his first conviction, I give Ms. Picoult five stars. However, Salem Falls is far from being a perfect book and the reader cannot analyze the investigative and courtroom procedures too deeply. Conversely, Ms. Picoult makes suspending belief easy, offering the reader a surprise or a new angle every ten paragraphs or so.Looking through descriptions of her other books, I do not find anything that particularly interests me, but for readers of this genre, you are in good hands."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I was surprised when I read the reviews for this book & alot of people were slamming it & saying it wasn't one of Picoult's best. I thought it was beautifully written. Yes, there were some factual errors, like when it flashes back to November of '98 & Jack refers to Catherine as Brandi (Chastain) & Catherine says \\"Maybe, but I kept my shirt on,\\" a reference to Brandi tearing her shirt off after scoring the final Free Kick to win the Women's World Cup, which didn't happen until July of '99. But errors like that don't make the feelings you experience through this book any less potent. When it flashes back in time to when Jack is the soccer coach, you really feel the power of how far he has fallen in just a few months. The man's life has been stolen from him, & the realization hits that it could happen to anyone, at anytime.You also grow to love the side characters as well. Addie's Father, Roy, who is truculent & drunk all the time at the beginning, sheds his demons by the end & it's hilarious when he brings in muffins for the court during the trial, b/c food is the best way he knows to give support. I think Jordan's son, Thomas, also shines in the book. He is sneakily funny, & the way he yearns for Chelsea reminds us all of our 1st crush, where we feel like we can't breathe around that person or act like ourselves. We've all been there. Plus, I liked the sense of mystery surrounding it all, the factor of \\"What really happened in those woods?\\" I found myself really disliking Gillian & her friends for what they did, but a story always needs a good foil like that. I thought the courtroom scenes were intense, & you find yourself really hoping that Catherine Marsh steps up & makes the 1st allegation right in the end. To the people who said that they saw the surprise ending coming from the beginning, Kudos to you, b/c to me, it was a shock. All in all, a very beautiful book, haunting, sad, & thrilling, all at the same time."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"My goal is to read all of Jodi Picoult books. I have read Salem Falls, The pact, My Sisters Keeper, etc. I found Salem falls to be really interesting and I just could not put the book down. I usually love to read book that deal with historical fiction but these type of books are really good to read. I love to read the court cases and how they go. I love how they always have twist and turns and how she really entertains you with her characters. I really think Jodi Picoult is one of the best writers for whom I have read from!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Salem Falls, New Hampshire in the year 2000 is the site of another witch-hunt. Reminiscent of the witch-hunt in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1690's, Picoult's modern day occurrence deals with the false accusations of indecent behavior of a teacher with a minor.Jack St. Bride is new in town, just released from jail after serving a term for the false accusation of having had an affair with a student. Many people find him intriguing and others see him as a threat. One girl is just in dire need of attention and excitement.Excellent character development and psychological intrigue fill this outstanding mystery to the brim. Mix in witch craft and romance and an exciting court case, and you have this successful, hard-to-put-down novel."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"THis book kept me guessing and on my toes i didnt know what would happen next i just new that i wanted the main character, Not to end up in jail (spolier alert) in the end i was surprised by the last line of the book.... so i highly recommend this read"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"One of Jodi Picoult's best books ever. Intriguing, well written and it will hold your attention until the very last page. Be prepared for an ending that you may not expect!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodie, this time delves into to occult practice of wican and shows what can happen when teenagers get in over there heads. Gets you thinking, especially when the main character is truly innocent"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Loved this book.Have read many of her books before and was as happy this one as all the rest"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"She is such a great author. I can not put it down. I can not wait to she puts out her next book. Impressed"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"One of those books you don't want to put down. Picoult is a fantastic writer that always manages to keep my attention with her story lines."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I liked it, Jodi seemed to go back to her older writing style that I enjoyed from &#34;Plain Truth&#34;. Would recommend it."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"The author is very talented and writes her novels extremely well.Her books are filled with suspense and keep the reader captivated and on their toes, for me that is the ideal reading material....The only thing I would have to knock was the very end of the book, I know that isn't a very good sign (and I do hope it won't put you off reading it) but I just thought the end of the book was completely unexpected and I would've appreciated it more, had there been some subtle indications of the ending through the book which would have not lead the ending to be so utterly surprising and almost out of place, even though it was dealing with the topics touched upon throughout the book, it did leave me feeling a little disappointed."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Great author. My 18 year old loves her books and we recommend her books to everyone. we learn life lessons in each book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"good reading...jodi picoult is inspiring author ive read many of her books...i will continue to buy her material very interesting..."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book kept me up well into the night reading... Love the way Picoult always teaches you something new in her novels, in this case about Wiccan.I really enjoyed the characters in this book, had trouble understanding Jack's mother though or why he'd want to bother visiting her after the way she treated him!The only flaw was Charlies storyline was completely predictable, right from where he was sitting drinking with his old football coach and it was obvious where his story was heading. Well actually it was probably obvious from when we first meet him in the novel in hindsight, but i didnt pick up on it at first.The reason this is getting a 4 star from me and not a 5 (Picoults books usually get 5 stars from me) is because of the abrupt ending. Picoults usual twist at the end just isnt here. I d never ve guessed she d end the book like this because she's not usually that predictable.On the whole though, I really enjoyed this book, lots of amusing bits too, like when Roy brings everyone Muffins and Matt refuses to eat one on principle. Love it! Matt was quite likable in this story too, even though he was working for the prosecution. His love for his daughter Molly would melt the hardest heart.There are quite a few father daughter/mother son relationships in this story each of these relationships has a story in itself. Amos and Gillian, Charlie and Meg Roy and Addie Jordon and Thomas and Jack and his mother.Strange that the fourth girl in Gillian's circle is not really brought into the book more, to the extent that I cant even remember her name! Gillian, Meg and Chelsea all play a large part in the story.I dont think ill ever stop reading Picoult, as long as she keeps writing, ill keep reading."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book follows the typical Picoult format...bouncing back and forth with stories all coming together at the end.Picoult is famous for the \\"shocking ending,\\" but in this case, I felt it was oddly predictable, yet totally random and pointless."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"First, I enjoyed the book and it was one that I didn't want to stop reading once I started. The premise is one that I love, the innocent man fighting to prove his innocence. The book starts strong, making us feel for both Jack and Addie. We see Jack as a kind, sensitive man who due to his good looks and profession (teacher, coach) is the kind of guy schoolgirl dreams are made of. It turns into a curse when accusations are aimed at him and he's forced to into a corner.Addie has a tragic past that she can't or won't forget, and when Jack walks into her life, the two are drawn to each other.The first half of the book sucked me in, but the second half focused on other characters, with Jack and Addie turned into almost secondary characters, even though it is their fate that is going to be decided at the end of the book. For me, that made the book less compelling. I wanted it to stick with Jack and Addie's pov, but instead, we see most of the rest of the book through the defense attorney's eyes."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I'm a big fan and have read a bunch of books by her - 19 minutes, Plain Truth, Vanishing Act, The Pact, and My Sister's Keeper. I loved those books. Is it me, or does the majority of her books have some type of court room scene?Salem Falls, I couldn't get passed page 51. It seemed that every chapter she added new characters that would confuse the heck out of me.....and the story was so slow and I just didn't like the character of Addie........and found Jack's character just too hard to figure out. And wayyyyyy too many characters to keep track of -This won't deter me from Jodi's books, but I'm hoping I don't cross another bad one......I do NOT recommend this book - it was terrible.....sorry Jodi."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have read most of Picoult's books and this one started off quite strong only to finish off in a weak manner. There were inconsistencies and things that were not realistic. And every character was not developed as well as they usually are in her books. Not a bad read, but not groundbreaking!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Overall, I enjoyed listening to the audio of this book but often found myself impatient with it too. There were a few too many coincidences, a few too many flashbacks, and a few too many details that didn't quite ring true. For instance, when we flashback to Jack's prison experiences and then to the circumstances of his first rape conviction, it made sense to the story. But by the time we flash back to his college days, then to his pre-teen days, and finally to the day he was born, I had had enough flashbacks. Similarly, I didn't believe some of the shenanigans in the courtroom would have been allowed or the attorneys would have sat quietly through some of the arguments/testimony. I also thought the author relied on coincidences too often--or were we supposed to think it was witchcraft that brought Jack to the exact spot where Gillian and her friends were celebrating that night? I did enjoy the book but I think it could have been more effective if it had been tightened up a bit. But the reader did a good job with the narration--I especially enjoyed the voices she did for the teenage girls."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have read 3 of Picoult's novels and there is an ongoing court case/trial theme in each one. This doesn't bother me too much, but I do find myself wanting to skip pages sometimes just to see the end result.This book in particular was o.k. It was a bit hard to believe in some aspects that **SPOILER** Addie was gang raped, and then falls for a convicted rapist (albeit he was innocent of course.) I also knew, just from warning signs, that Gillian was having an incestuous relationship with her father. You don't really find out until the last paragraph of the book, but to me that fact was very predictable. I do wish that the author would have elaborated a bit more into what happens when Jack goes to NYC to see his mother. Does she forgive him?After finishing the book, some questions went unanswered and I was left with more questions."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"When it comes to teenage behaviors, adult conditions of misery and marvel, tangled with history, Jodi Picoult is absolutely the best of the best. Young girls meddling with Witchcraft reflect the witch hunt the adults of Salem Falls are on to rid it of a convicted child abuser. Of course, nothing is as straight forward as it seems in a Jodi Picoult novel. One thing you can count on is a fascinating read from start to finish.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I liked this book. I didn't feel anything in particular about Jack, but I knew he was innocent from the beginning. I wasn't really sure why needed to know his mother's background story, but I guess some pages needed to be filled in. I agree with other reviewers, that some of the courtroom tactics were unbelievable. I understand that Gillian was being abused by her father, but I don't see any relevance to her falsely accusing Jack of rape. That confused me. But, all, in all, I thought it was a good book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is my second Jodi Picoult book. I first read the Plain Truth and I really enjoyed it. Salem Falls is not as good, but I did like it and it was an extremely quick read. I must say that it was predictable and many reviewers find Picoult formulaic in her writing. But since this is only the second novel of hers that I've read I won't say that--yet. She does know how to put together a good story that moves along at a decent pace. Sometimes, that's all I want!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I was pulled into this book by the very first page. It kept me interested all the way through. Fab endding too. All around terrific book.A+++"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is the first Picoult's that I picked and I will start collecting her books :)"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am a big fan of Jodi Piccoult's books - I have read every one except her newest - and I will read that one soon.Salem Falls is not a terrible book, but it certainly isn't one of Picoult's best. I felt that a number of story lines were predictable and I just didn't get wrapped in and invested in these characters.I wanted another \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" or \\"The Pact\\", where I couldn't put the book down. This is a good and iteresting read, but could have been better."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I really love reading Picoult books - I love the switching between viewpoints and the exploration of rather dark subjects. The idea behind this book - witches starting a \\"witch hunt\\" and the terrible nature of rape - was very good. But overall I was left unsatisfied. The twist is obvious from 1,000 miles away and it is disheartening that no one discovers it during the book or even takes the time to put some mild clues together. I am happy for Jack and Addie, but feel too that their ending is unrealistic. Perhaps if Jack had been convicted, and then exonerated when the twist was discovered I would have felt better about reading the book, and enjoyed the ending/resolution to a dark tale."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I've been enjoying reading Ms. Picoult's books - this is the latest one that I've read. An interesting read, it might make you look at your own opinions of the book's subject, and I'm sure you'll wonder why the characters are behaving in the way they are behaving - would I do that? I like all of this author's books that I've read so far and plan on reading more."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I finished Salem Falls in two days and am mad at myself for not reading more slowly so I could savor the quality of the writing and the intriguing plot which is absent in so many modern fiction novels. However, I just couldn't put the book down and just had to see it through its many twists and turns.As an avid reader and huge fan of Jodi Picoult, I highly recommend this novel and believe its is one of her best (along with \\"The Pact,\\" \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" \\"Plain Truth\\" and \\"Nineteen Minutes\\").Jodi Picoult is a phenomenal talent. She is not afraid to take risks in her writing, to approach current events/topics and especially controversial topics that other authors would find too challenging to take on. Her books, and this one in particular, lead the reader through an emotional and intellectual journey whereby the reader is forced to confront both or many sides of a particular issue and examine things from multiple perspectives that he/she may not have wanted to acknowledge. For example, in \\"Salem Falls,\\" the reader is exposed to the difficult topics of rape and sexual assault; being falsely accused of a crime; trust; taking the law into one's own hands; witchcraft; death of a child and incest, to name a few. However, these topics are not merely discussed, they are disected and experienced from various viewpoints until everything comes together in the end. But, as with Jodi Picoults other books, the effect of her story and writing does not end simply because there are no more pages left to read. Rather, the reader is left with so much to think about and dicuss afterwards, that her books will never truly leave you.I can't recommend this book and her other works highly enough. They would all make remarkable book club selections and are wonderful to share with friends and family of all ages."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I'm not going to bother writing a detailed summary of the plot - just read the reviews before and a head of me. More of less, a previously convicted sexual offender moves to a new town, looking for a new start, only for the same thing to happen again. The story involves the offender's new girlfriend, the accuser and her family, his lawyer (a wonderfully developed Jordan McAfee) his old accuser, the police - just about the entire town.To be certain, I hugely enjoyed reading this book - I read it in less than a day and a half. Picoult always impressed me with her ability to developed a variety of characters in a way that doesn't seem confusing nor redundant. We learn everyone's stories at just the right time in just the right way. On a side note, while you read this, look out for her metaphors (or are they analogies?) - they are hugely creative, beautiful and powerful, all in one. Additionally, some of her characters are just so wonderful and amusing - in powerful and quirky ways - that I'll be seeking out other books with them in the future.As a female, I always give the victim the benefit of the doubt. It might not be the most honest thing to do, nor the most just, but it's how I think. Curiously, \\"Salem Falls\\" made me doubt this conviction of mine. I found myself feeling more for Jack than the victim (who, at the same age as I, annoyed me to no end). It was an interesting conflict (there's a psych term for it, I know) which I will certainly think about further.On a completely different note, I was a little annoyed on the fact that \\"Salem Falls\\" made a fairly weak stand on the idea of rape and sexual assault. I wasn't sure whether the moral was that some times bad things happen to good people, or just the opposite: some times good things happen to bad people. It's clear that Picoult warns readers not to judge others and to understand, but other than that, it's a little foggy. The idea of justice is foggy as well - yes, in some ways, justice is served. But in other ways, there are a huge number of simply atrocious and life altering crimes that no one ever gets punished for. I understand why Picoult didn't develop those ideas further - the book was already pretty long - but it made me think about what the court decision exactly meant.Another thing that I feel like I should note, however, is something that occasionally bothers me with Jodi Picoult's books. She tries very hard to create diverse and interesting teenage characters - ones that are different from the flat and uniform personalities in most TV shows. And, for the most part, she succeeds. However, in \\"Salem Falls,\\" I felt that she strayed from her normal portrayals. The male teenagers were sex obsessed while the female teenagers (with one exception) came off to me to be very self absorbed and superficial, following their \\"leader\\" even thought they knew the difference between right and wrong. None seem to truly change, which contrasted hugely to the development of the older characters, whose ranges of emotions varied hugely.There were also some loose ends left to tie up - the novel seemed to end very quickly. The court decision is made and then just a few pages later, it's over. I'd wonder what happened next to the characters - plenty is implied (in a very creepy and well done) manner, but it is still odd the way the end plays out. I suppose, Picoult did that deliberately, as a stylistic choice, but I felt a little abandoned at the end, like I had followed her story and her ideas for the past four hundred pages just to be ignored.All in all, I'd recommend the book. It deals with touchy topics, be warned. But it's never graphic. Occasionally, however, the crimes (rape and the such) are described in detail, simply because it is a court room drama in the last third (half?) of the novel. I'll admit, it did make me a little uncomfortable, but that could just be a personal issue. Again, reader this book if you ever get the chance. It could just help you understand both sides of justice."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Salem Falls was a very interesting book to me because of the believable characters and some things I am not familiar with such as jail and witchcraft. Unlike some books that start out slow, this one got my attention right away and kept it throughout. The main plot involved a girls' soccer coach who just got out of jail for accepting a plea bargain and served 8 months for raping a girl on the team. His life was basically ruined. He tried starting over in a small town and had to deal with another rape charge that a girl involved with witchcraft made against him. I enjoyed trying to anticipate how the defense attorney would defend Jack, who was a nice guy charged with sexual felonious assault. Jodi makes the trial so interesting by adding humor into it as well as just the suspense of wondering how it will turn out and who the jury will believe. The bright spot though was Addie, a diner owner who gave Jack a break and the benefit of the doubt. She hired him as a dishwasher and they respected each other's privacy which gradually developed into true love and admiration.The author used flashbacks to go into the background of some of the characters which I found to be interesting, except for Jack's mother. I didn't really see how that added to the story, but still found it interesting. I liked how the verdict turned out, but the ending was a shock to me. I wasn't expecting that at all. I would say a main theme of the book is not to prejudge people--that everything is not always as it seems to be as the defense attorney pointed out to the jury and how much damage lies can cause. I liked this book very much!Karen Zemek, Author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Imagine being falsely accused of rape. Then imagine serving your time and embarking on a new life in a new little town...only to be accused again.That's what happened to Jack St. Bride, the beautifully written protagonist of this novel. A young teacher at a posh girls' school, Jack was accustomed to his popularity among his students...until one day when the accusations of one ruined his career and almost his entire life.Then Jack stumbles upon Salem Falls, a tiny community where he takes a job as a dishwasher at the Do-or-Diner. Run by Addie Peabody, a haunted woman in pain of her own, the diner is a local gathering place for all ages...including the teenage daughter of a rich drug company owner, used to getting her own way. Just as Jack is beginning to get settled, finding some support from Addie and her father Roy, he finds that lightning can, indeed, strike twice...The biggest draw to Picoult's novel was, in my mind, the concept of being caught in such a horrific situation. We all like to think we know evil when we see it; but what if we're wrong? Not only that, what if our accusations can mean the difference between a man's life and death? Similarly, we all want to think that we could never find *ourselves* in such a situation. Surely, our friends and family would stand behind us all the way. But would they? Picoult provides intriguing material as readers push through to a conclusion that will be undoubtedly painful, no matter what the jury decides."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have not been disappointed, yet, with any of Jodi Picoult's books. This one is no exception. Told through various character's point of view, this story weaves in and out of present and past and shows the main characters plight at trying to beat the system. This book really makes you wonder how many innocent people are wrongly convicted. The only complaint I have is that I wish we had more of the back-story on other characters. Maybe a second book?"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Sent timely and in brand new condition. Matches the rest of the set I have. Great transaction!

I am sorry I purchased the book. It was a waste of my time and money."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I was a little bummed when I was reading Salem Falls. I love Jodi Picoult. I have read several of her books. I, like many others, was very disappointed in the book. It was not her best work. The four girls in the book are not even interesting. You can guess everything that happens. When I ready Change of Heart, My Sister's Keeper, Nineteen Minutes, Handle with Care, and Mercy, I read them in less then a week. With Salem Falls, I just am not even interested in it. I do like how descriptive the book is, like all of her books, but Salem Falls is just so uninteresting. I can not even finish the book.

I also saw the ending a mile off. I found the characters flat, and started skimming before the book was half-way through."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book was a great read, until the last chapter. Before gettting there, I did not like the doubts thrown in about Jack, after we were lead by the author to believe in him. The ending is horrible, not because of anything horrible that happened, but because it is not clear. You are left with an IDEA that MAYBE you understand. Maybe some readers like this, for me, it diminishes the experience of the book. I don't want to &quot;make up my own ending&quot;. I can do that by reading half a book. I've asked others what they thought the ending meant but I can't find anyone who has read it. I'm just chalking this one up to a loss of about six hours of my life and keeping the writer and her style in mind as things to avoid in the future."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"\\"Salem Falls\\" is readable, likeable and decidedly unspectacular. Picoult masterfully weaves a suspenseful plot, yet the entire novel somehow manages to disappoint. Perhaps it was her somewhat flat portrayal of Jack, the main character. Despite having a rather intimate understanding of his situation, I found him to be a listless and uninteresting character.Or perhaps is was the rather trite manner in which Addie, Amos, Gillian and many of the other characters were crafted. Many of the images and characterizations seem overly dependent upon a twenty-first century sensibility. I often distrust novels in which the character portrayals are laced with media references and clich&eacute; images of current fashion and I found the four young girls to be very much to that effect. References to Alanis Morissette and electric blue nail polish may not withstand the test of time.On the other hand, I appreciated Ms. Picoult's lack of negativity toward Wicca and her openness towards the possibility of magic. Although the love interest sub-plot did not work for me, those moments of \\"magic\\" rescued the novel from becoming overly trite and predictable.Such assets and flaws aside, I'll admit that read the book happily eagerly to discover the outcome. One cannot help being drawn into the story. It was simply a \\"fun read\\"."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Much like Perfect Match, Picoult has written a real page turner with controversy and plausible characters.This novel centers around Jack who has been convicted of a crime and is trying to start over. Unfortunately he is accused a of a second similar crime in his new surroundings. The dialog is well crafted and does not cause you to read the same line three times to understand. The prose is smooth and the story moves along at a swift pace.Picoult develops her characters so you identify with them and have a vested interest in them. The plot is a little weird including some witch practice by teenagers. But unlike others who have reviewed this book I do not think it is far fetched. If you have been in the high schools today you will know it happens every day.Main guy Jack is the subject of a trial for the allegations. Trial scenes are well crafted but not too in depth. Read this book for the action. It goes fast and is very entertaining."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Not unlike her previous novels, Jodi's newest, &quot;Salem Falls,&quot; is spectacular. From the first page, I was hooked...I read and read and read! This book is definately one of my favorites and is a MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi Picoult has created a most realistic story detailing the aftermath of a man convicted of raping a young woman, and a community's reaction to learn that this man has decided to settle in their town.Jack has just been released from prision, as has taken a minimum wage position at a diner following his arrival in Salem Falls. He's expecting the fall out and hatred from the community, but not the love he finds in his new boss...This is anything but a superficial story. Picoult delves into complex issues concerning trust and predjudice, the guilt that can overshadow a man who has merely been accused of rape, the complexities of the lives of teenage girls, and the trauma that accompanies sexual abuse. The author effectively supports both sides of Megan's Law, and gives us insight and understanding into all sides of a no win situation.If you're looking for some light reading, this novel is not the best choice to pick up. I was, however, mesmerized. Caught in Salem Falls late into the night, unable to set it down."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Jodi Picoult. It was fantastic, so the other books must be just as good and better, according to some peoples reviews. I found this to be a suspenseful book, a real page turner. I could NOT put it down. I was up for six hours reading till the end. It is a pretty quick read, but the story moves along nicely. The relationship between Jack and Addie is a bonus to this otherwise courtroom based drama. There are just two things wrong with this book. First of all, it is unrealistic in some points. Jack must be a very handsome man to be attracting all of these teenage girls. First Catherine and now Gillian. That is highly unlikely. Also, the story is not wrapped up. I wish we could of found out what happened to Jack and Addie (marriage?? romance??) and to Gillian. Otherwise a great book! Must read! This book would make a great movie!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"A friend of mine passed this book on to me knowing my daughter was appearing in her high school's fall play of &quot;The Crucible&quot;. The similarities with this book are there - girls flirting with witchcraft, an anti-hero who becomes isolated in his own community yet at the center of the story, a justice system that shows itself to be less than ideal.Without giving too much away, Jack St. Bride is a convicted sex offender who, upon moving to Salem Falls, has to report himself to the police under Megan's Law, an actual statute. Unfortunately for ol' Jack, even if he is a decent soul on the inside and innocent of the original charge, his charm and boyish good looks, ala a young Redford, make him a marked man. He gets a job in a local diner and begins an affair with Addie, the female owner. Still, things would have been ok if it weren't for a sweet young thing named Gillian, who not only poisons her own father with pills from his own pharmeceutical company, but then seduces our anti-hero Jack, to boot! And just to compund matters, Jack, inadvertently, runs into a group of the local gals running stark naked around a bonfire while celebrating a witch (wiccan?) festival. One thing leads to another and guess who is accused of Gillian's rape? And this is only half of the story. The trial consumes us the rest of the way. Arthur Miller would have been proud.I liked the setting and the way the story unfolds. It would have been so easy to allow the witchcraft element to take over, but instead, it remains as a mist that envelopes a story that turns into a mystery, a romance, and a court room drama. The characters however, outside of Jack and Addie, are somewhat cardboard. Jack's own mother is too stereotypical and the attorneys and the private investigator read like I could have written them. Still, to my mind, it is the relationship between Jack and Addie that saves the day. It is somewhat tender and, at times almost innocent. I would have given this book another star except that it seemed, because Jack and Addies's relationship is done so well, as the story unfolds, it can't quite make up it's mind whether it is a love story or a court room drama. Still, if you're heading to Nags Head or the Cape, this is a good one to take with you."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have not been impressed with Jodi Picoult's past work, but Salem Falls kept me on the edge of my seat. I found the novel to be suspenseful right up until the very end, when the verdict of the trial was released.Picoult mixed emotions well and really helped her characters display the true meaning of love, trust, and support. She made me feel as if I were suffering all along with Jack and I was so happy with the outcome of the novel, although it was a little predictable."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jack St. Bride comes to the small, sleepy town of Salem Falls pretty much by accident, freshly released from prison. He gets a job at the local diner run by the strange, mysterious Addie, and finds himself quickly falling in love with her. They both have secrets in their past that almost undo them.A group of teenage girls who flirt with the occult through spells, fires, rituals..suddenly accuse Jack of a horrible crime. No one knows what really happened that night in the dark woods, but Jack is thrown in jail again. The fact that he has already served time for an..offense with a minor does not help matters much. Addie is determined to find the truth of his past, and his new lawyer, Jordan McAfee, tries to find the truth of his latest dilemma.The story moves quickly, at a rapid pace that sometimes hinders the story. It seems that Jack and Addie form a bond of love stronger than the time frame allows. Jack seems to have a problem with being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Teenage girls seem to be strangely attracted to him, no matter where he goes. These things add up to the story ringing a bit false at times, but that is the only bad thing I have to say about it.Picoult writes her novels well, with storylines that are easy to get pulled into. Here, as in 'The Pact', we end with a courtroom drama that intrigues simply to see what comes of it. Picoult is able to hold the suspense through the end, leading the reader back and forth over what kind of man Jack may really be. While it is not one of her best works, it is worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Although the writing is beautiful and the book a good read, I expected more than the trite and predictable plot twists. There are NO surprises here; the book has the feel of a &quot;wanna-be&quot; Oprah book. This author can, and has, done so much better."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book grabbed me from the beginning. Jodi Picoult took a difficult topic and sensitively showed both sides in this novel. She shows how events can be distorted and how circumstantial evidence can ruin a person's reputation. The ending was not much of a surprise which is why I only gave it four stars. Still I think it is one of her best."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Of all the JP books I've read I found this the worst - she takes a potentially interesting subject and turns it into sensationalist trash. Yes the current atmosphere in which males in responsible positions can have their lives ruined by an excusation of sexual abuse is worth exploring but given Jack's behaviour I couldn't help but think he brought on much of his own troubles. What sensible male teacher would do the following: get his teenage pupils to reenact a battle dressed only in swimwear and sheets? Keep a girl student's bra which he happened to pick up? Take a female pupil to get birth control pills because she asked him to? Move to a small town where it is almost certain that his past will be widespreadly known given that he has to register with the local police as a sex offender? Hang round sports fields giving advice to female students on how to play (and this is AFTER the lies of one teenage girl have landed him in jail!) Wander around in the dark woods after he has been beaten up by angry locals? In the end instead of this being a story about how public hysteria about child abuse can ruin an innocent life this turns into a story about a man who is understandably suspected of sexual abuse because of circumstantial evidence, much of it due to his own stupidity. As usual she tries to incorporate too many elements - teenage witches, incest, a woman who acts as if her dead daugher were alive, an alcoholic father, multiple romances, courtroom scenes, prison scenes etc etc.The court case at the end was a complete damp squib - when a character suffers as Jack has I personally felt the need for him to be totally vindicated in a sensationalist way rather than an ambigious verdict which leaves doubt one way or another. As for the 'surprise' ending - as others have said it was hard to see that coming!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This story was riviting! Although I don't subscribe to Wiccan beliefs, this subplot added considerable depth and interest to the story. The trial captivated my interest, although the explanation of the DNA evidence was a bit too technical and confusing for the average reader to understand. I found the story hard to follow at times, especially in the beginning when I wasn't yet familiar with all the characters, because the scenes were very short and switched frequently between the parallel storylines. Rape was presented in a very sensitive manner from both the point of view of the victim and of the accused, and the two powerful themes of the story, that love can redeem a man and that lying has serious consequence, came through loud and clear. Kudos to the author for another wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I'm not sure I will ever feel as satisfied as I did after reading My Sister's Keeper but nonetheless...A man tries to begin his life again in a new town after being falsely accused of rape and spending 8 months in jail. Small towns being what they are, it's not long before his secret is found out and Jack becomes the target of another young girl looking for an outlet for her \\"growing pains.\\" In comes the Wiccan \\"coven\\", or a teenage group of girls consisting of a leader and her 3 followers. It is they that accuse Jack of rape for the second time.During his time in Salem Falls, Jack falls in love and makes enemies, both of which are aspects that add to the appeal of this book. The problem is that the ending is so very predictable (unusual for Picoult) that I could've writteni t myself.Not a bad read, but not her best."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I picked up this novel for two reasons. 1) I have previously really enjoyed Piccoult's novels and 2) I am Pagan.In terms of rating this book against Piccoult's others, I found it to be in the middle. Her characters were interesting, though the young teens engaged themselves in somewhat unrealistic behavior and language. I found there to be many cheesy cliches and dialog that left some to be desired.However, the end of the book was riveting. For the last 50 pages or so, I could not put it down. It was not that I did not know what would happen, I was just waiting for the \\"Piccoult-style\\" WAY for it to happen. She is a master at building her plot and twisting endings. I have never read a book before where the last sentence completely changes the entire novel. So if you are one of those people that like to read the last page- don't! It will hit you from left field.From a Pagan perspective, I found some of the information right-on accurate but also found some to be somewhat stereotypical. The \\"witch\\" who works for the Wiccan Rede that stands trial is absolutely ridiculous. Her \\"protection spell\\" she casts in the witness stand is stereotypical and frankly unnecessary. Any protection spell she may have felt she needed would have been cast in the privacy of her own home- not performed like a weird seance in front of hundreds of people. That was outlandish.Overall, this is why I give the book a 3/5. Whether Piccoult meant to or not, she fed into some of the stereotypes of Wicca and did not tap into the beauty of the earth-based religion at all. However, I enjoyed the building of her story line and also the way she explored sexual abuse/rape and recovery."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I was hoping for more from Jodi Picoult after reading her other books. This is a pedestrian plot with unremarkable characters and an outcome that is predictable. By the time I waded through to the end, I was skimming the pages to finish it. I didn't particulary like or dislike any of the characters and I found the plot lacked believable substance. I should have foreseen it when a recently-released prisoner was picked up by a cab driver and taken to an idyllic destination where he immediately melded into the landscape. I know that Picoult can do better and I am eagerly awaiting her next effort."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I've been reading reviews on Jodi Picoult's books so I decided to begin reading some. I started with My Sister's Keeper and Salem Falls. I enjoyed both of them, but liked Salem Falls better. Talk about bad luck... Jack St. Bride was wrongly convicted of having an intimate relationship with a student of his; who was under age, and was sent to jail for eight months. After coming out of jail, he ends up in Salem Falls a quiet town that is basically run by Amos Duncan who runs the pharmacutical plant in town. Unfortunately, he runs into some bad luck in Salem Falls when Amos's daughter Gillian accuses Jack of raping her. From there it's a tale that is sort of a cross between Charmed meets Law and Order SVU. There are so many complex, interesting characters in this book that I was enthralled by all of them wanting to see what was going to happen with everyone in the story. Jodi Picoult has a way of grabbing a reader's attention with just the first few pages. I can't wait to read more of her books."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I really enjoyed this book the more I got into it, finding it hard to put down.Jack St. Bride just got released from prison, and with nowhere to go to, finally reaches the small town of Salem Falls where no one knows him. He finds the Do-Or Diner, where Addy has owned the restaurant for years. Jack immediately hits it off with Addie there, and feeling he needs a job not knowing his prior history, she hires him on as a busboy.It isn't long though until Jack has to report to the officer in the county there, and it is then his history comes out to the whole small town including Abby. Abby, having had experiences in the past, is suddenly wary, but then chooses to believe the best about Jack. The whole town goes crazy with stories though, and many want him out. When a teenager and her friends hear this, they want Jack out, planning a terrible act to ensnare him, and get him accused of rape once again.Well of course, this whole saga comes to a trial in the court, with all sides of the story. But as Jordan, the defense attorney uncovers more and more facts, he can see right through Gillian as a terrible liar, and realizes Jack's innocence. Matt, the prosecuting attorney of course, does whatever he can to throw Jack behind bars for good, but as the story unfolds here, a whole different story emerges and the truth does come out.Abby is deeply in love with Jack. She always was since first sight, and eventually the two may get together depending on the outcome of Jack's trial-which remains to be seen until you read the book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I adore Jodi Picoult. I have a very hard time putting her novels down. Her writing is mesmerizing, usually. I didn't find that to be the case in Salem Falls. I could not like nor related to Jack, the main character. He was too remote and distant from the reader. I felt like I was on the outside looking in at him. It was an unpleasant feeling.Also, I was more than a little unhappy with Picoult's depiction of witchcraft and paganism. I am a practicing pagan and I found that her explanations of how magick works and what paganism is very informed. However, her representations of pagans - 4 lying, scheming, teenage girls and 1 typical pagan/hippy hybrid - to be lacking and insulting. You can do much better than that, Ms. Picoult."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"For many people, the small town of Salem Falls is nearly an ideal place to live. But how much of that idyllic view is based on maintained appearances, facades, convenient fictions, and close-mindedness? Innocent people can be made to suffer when illusions and deceptions are substituted for actuality. That is the author's story.It all seems so innocent, normal, and decent in this small town: teenage girls giggling, awakening to their attractiveness, and having crushes on teachers or coaches; high school football players with a swagger of invincibility, picking the prettiest girls; the town fathers maintaining community order and morality, rooting out deviance and deviants; and the legal system providing official enforcement of community standards. On the other hand, where does a handsome, young teacher, accused of predatory behavior, turn in the face of unexamined assumptions of community goodness? Where does a teen-age girl turn when \\"selected\\" by the football stars against her will as an object for gratification? How does anyone who is \\"different\\" withstand the morality police, rumors, and vigilantism? Are the most self-righteous hiding the worst of transgressions? If truth cannot be discovered in a court of law, is it forever lost?The book is an interesting look at the consequences of illusions, deceptions, and morality held to excess. Unfortunately, the characters are not as compelling. They remain somewhat distant and in some cases are exasperatingly inconsistent. Basically the book is a good, it not disturbing, story."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"\\"Salem Falls\\" is readable, likeable and decidedly unspectacular. Picoult masterfully weaves a suspenseful plot, yet the entire novel somehow manages to disappoint. Perhaps it was her somewhat flat portrayal of Jack, the main character. Despite having a rather intimate understanding of his situation, I found him to be a listless and uninteresting character.Or perhaps is was the rather trite manner in which Addie, Amos, Gillian and many of the other characters were crafted. Many of the images and characterizations seem overly dependent upon a twenty-first century sensibility. I often distrust novels in which the character portrayals are laced with media references and clich&eacute; images of current fashion and I found the four young girls to be very much to that effect. References to Alanis Morissette and electric blue nail polish may not withstand the test of time.On the other hand, I appreciated Ms. Picoult's lack of negativity toward wicca and her openness towards the possibility of magic. Although the love interest sub-plot did not work for me, those moments of \\"magic\\" rescued the novel from becoming overly trite and predictable.Such assets and flaws aside, I'll admit that read the book happily eagerly to discover the outcome. One cannot help being drawn into the story. It was simply a &quot;fun read&quot;."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as My Sister's Keeper or Vanishing Acts. Maybe it was the subject matter and the blatant rip of The Crucible, but are teenage girls really that eager to incriminate male teachers/coaches? Jack St. Bride has the rottenest luck of anyone on earth to be wrongly accused not once but twice. The sad truth is that innocent people do sometimes get railroaded, and that was well captured in this book. I just found 400 pages to be a bit long. It was well researched--the author did her homework on technical details such as DNA testing and forensic science."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Huge fan of Jodi Picoult, a magnificent author that grabs the reader from the first page. Her depiction of Wicca was accurate and respectful, and as in all of her books, her knack for suspense and characterization was great."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"ThisThe Crucible (Penguin Plays)re-make is probably my least favorite of her books. Probably because it is the most unbelievable. I mean how could someone be convicted once for a crime he did not commit and then nearly be convicted of the same crime again? It's just ridiculous.I guess it's nice that Jordan McAfee is back in it - that's one of the redeeming facets. It also follows her same courtroom formula."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I really enjoyed this book. My favorite is The Pact, but this is my second favorite of her's if not equally as good. Every day I was looking forward to making time to read this book and I couldn't put it down. It makes you get really into the characters and trying to figure out what happened. Like The Pact, it keeps you guessing up until the end. You think you know what happened, but then, maybe not. Character development was excellent, as usual. Unlike The Tenth Circle where rape is seen exclusively from the victim's side, this book gives an interesting spin from multiple viewpoints and really puts the word \\"alleged\\" into perspective."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Picoult never ceases to amaze me. This book captured all my attention as I read it in one 13 hour span. I couldn;t put it down, however, I wished the ending would have given me a little more closure."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"My daughter is a Jodi Picoult fan who felt sad because she believed she had read all of this Author's books. To cheer up my daughter, I embarked upon a search in the hope of finding a book by the Author that my daughter may have overlooked. Not knowing the names of the Picoult titles my daughter had read, I did an Amazon search of all Picoult's books, copied the list (with reviews) and emailed it to my daughter for her perusal. To my delight and my daughter's amazement, an unread title leapt from the email attachment - Salem Falls. This book will be slipped into my daughter's Christmas stocking and she, \\"can't wait\\" to read it! I remember being her age and feeling the same disappointment when exhausting a favourite author's offerings. So on behalf of my daughter and myself, \\"Thank you Amazon\\"! I know she will relish every word."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"When I sat down to read Salem Falls, I wasn't really sure what to expect because I hadn't read many of Ms. Picoult's other works up to that point. But, what I discovered once I started reading was an excellent new twist on Arthur Miller's famous play, The Crucible.Now, I know this was the intention and that it's no big surprise that I recognized the parallel right away. But, what I also noticed was how unforced the connections seemed to be. There are so many times in modern novels where a classic work is used as a basis and the prose feels strained as a result. That was not the case with Salem Falls - At least it wasn't for me.I felt myself really entering the world of Salem Falls. The situations that Jack St. Bride was faced with were completely heart-wrenching and I destroyed several fingernails while \\"waiting\\" for the final verdict to be read.I will say that the \\"shocking plot twist\\" at the end of the story was really not all that shocking for me. I felt like I could see Ms. Picoult leading up to it throughout most of the story. But, I read a LOT so maybe I'm desensitized to \\"whodunit\\" moments at this point? Either way, I can't think of a single thing that really disappointed me about this book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"While I appreciated the careful and thoughtful character portraits, I thought the plot was somewhat unbelievable. Overall I was disappointed in Salem Falls after truly enjoying most of Picoult's novels."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi Picoult is one of my new favorite authors. She certainly knows how to write a page-turner and how to straddle the line between \\"serious\\" and popular fiction. So far I have read Plain Truth, Harvesting the Heart, My Sister's Keeper, and this novel, Salem Falls. My favorite is a toss up between this and My Sister's Keeper.The reviews on this book are mixed, with some readers like me loving it and others accusing it of being predictable and unbelievable. I, personally, didn't find the book to be predictable or unbelievable at all, though I could understand how one might perceive these flaws in the book if he or she were reading from a very cynical point of view. Actually, if it is a fact that such cynicism does indeed pervade our society so often, the argument of the novel's predictability is weakened. If cynicism is the norm, then the logical prediction would have been that Jack would be convicted, he and Addie would have broken up, etc. (In my opinion, if any one of Jodi Picoult's books is predictable, it's Plain Truth, not Salem Falls. Then again, I was trying to figure out Plain Truth's ending from page one, whereas I simply allowed Salem Falls to unfold before me as I immersed myself in its characters and story instead of trying to dissect the plot from the beginning.) I found Jack to be both a believable and sympathetic character. Just because a man is highly educated doesn't mean he can't also be naive - intellectual and emotional intelligence are two unique entities. Though such a heart of gold, a childlike innocence, is rare in an adult in this often cruel world, it does exist, and Jack won me over with this precious quality."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi Picoult has woven a tale about another cast of characters for her readers' enjoyment. She carefully tells a story in parts concentrating on each character then moving to another part. Her technique keeps the reader hanging in suspense until the conclusion."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi Picoult pulls out all of the stops in her novel, &quot;Salem Falls.&quot; Jack St. Bride is a handsome young man who was imprisoned after being unjustly convicted for assaulting a female student. After his release from prison, St. Bride comes to the small town of Salem Falls to start a new life.St. Bride takes a job as a dishwasher in a diner, where he falls in love with the owner, Addie Peabody, another tortured and lonely soul. Can Jack and Addie look forward to a bright future together and at last escape the demons of the past? Alas, Jack's tragic history follows him to Salem Falls, threatening to bring him down once again.Picoult's novel is a lively mix of intrigue, courtroom drama, and romance. Picoult brings her characters to life, including the intelligent but unlucky Jack St. Bride, the tough but warm Addie Peabody, and the manipulative and scheming Gillian Duncan, a teenager who wants to hammer the final nail into Jack's coffin. There are many subplots along the way, as well as a number of flashbacks. There are so many secrets and revelations in &quot;Salem Falls&quot; that it begins to resemble &quot;Peyton Place.&quot; Unfortunately, all of this weight ultimately drags the book down.In addition, Picoult inserts unsubtle references to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's &quot;The Crucible,&quot; making her point that too often, people hastily condemn others on the basis of rumor, innuendo and unfounded allegations.In spite of its occasional heavy-handedness, &quot;Salem Falls&quot; is an engrossing page-turner. You will care about the characters and you will be anxious to learn the ultimate fate of Jack St. Bride."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Like &quot;Plain Truth&quot; I couldn't put this book down. Jodi Picoults writting grabs ahold of you at the beginning of the book and doesn't let go until the last page.

The last line of this book is haunting and beautifully written, it leaves you saying &quot;...WOW, I can't believe it...&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I loved it. I'm not one to try to analyze a book, so I did not see the ending coming. Having worked in a diner in my younger days, I could truly picture the characters interacting. I have since read three more of Jodi's books, but this by far is my favorite."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Though I liked this book, I was disappointed that the book took so long to get going. As you pick up this book, Reader, don't give up hope, it keeps getting better and better...and then it is over and you want more."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I personally find this book very interesting and I keep wanting to read more. I can't stand the characters and I think it's a good thing becuase I wait for them all to be shot down in their own ways. I can't compare this to Picoult's other books, but I certainly liked it. I always enjoy a little witchcraft in a book and that's one reason I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Picoult's most recent work has all the ingredients that make up her novels: many characters, those who shouldn't be falling in love falling in love with each other, a little bit of conflict, and of course the climactic court case.Picture it: a man just recently released from a wrongful prison sentence enters the sleepy town of Salem Falls to start anew. Enter a woman he falls for, the teen age girl that falls for him, and trouble ensues. Many of the turns to this novel are predictable: the townspeople reaction to Jack, Addie letting go of her daughter, Jordan and Selena, etc. There was some foreshadowing of things not spelled out, such as the relationship with Gillian and her father Amos.Being somewhat educated in the area of Wicca, I felt that Picoult gave this religion a fair representation."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I did not understand the ending of this book. Did it infer that incest was going on ? Why were there so many exclusive father- daughter relationships? I think Jodi Picoult failed to adequately explain the DNA findings (especially the origin of the semen) for the ending to work."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"The book gets off to a slow start, but when the pieces start to fit together, you can't put it down. I especially loved the trial. My eyes crossed a little when they got to the DNA explanations, but it could've been that I was scanning ahead for the verdict. The ending was a little abrupt, but mostly all right. You'll really love it!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book will keep you turning the pages. The body of the story is well composed. The closing seemed a bit rushed but overall it reads smooth and flows together nicely. It makes you want to read her others!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I just loved this book and can't recommend it highly enough. It's a beautifully written exploration of small town life, grief and recovery, and the healing power of love. It's also a first-rate page-turner filled with explosive secrets and unexpected twists. Perfect for solo reading and endless book discussion--don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is the second book by Jodi Picoult that I have read. I became a fan after reading My Sister's Keeper.Her writing style is what keeps the book interesting from beginning to end.The characters are believeable and she doesn't bore you with details and facts that do not enrich the story.Each chapter leaves you wanting more and will keep your interest to the very last page."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have read most of Jodi Picoult's books and could not wait to sink my teeth into this one. It was very difficult, for one, to get into the story. The book jacket tells you most of the story without turning a page. Secondly, I was really not interested in the characters. They seemed to be just that, superficial. Lastly, too much of the story was unbelievable."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult. She recently appeared at a bookstore to discuss this book, and I found her to be very animated and down to earth. I thoroughly enjoyed Salem Falls, even though I found it a little wordy at times and the ending disappointing (it seemed a little flat). It was refreshing to see &quot;the other side&quot;-that there are some women who do lie about getting raped and innocent people do go to jail. And yes, it IS possible that the police would not have cordoned off the crime scene until the next morning. I know someone who was accused of assaulting a young woman who was well known by the police as a pathological liar (she had accused several men in her small town of rape). Such women make it difficult for women who are truly raped. As we see in Picoult's book, Gilly is a disturbed young woman who, unfortunately, may never get the help she needs."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Piccoult's new novel is another page-turner with plenty of twists and an old friend. Jordan McAfee has returned to us from THE PACT to direct the legal drama that ensues after a group of teenage girls accuse Jack St. Bride of a crime that is so damming to him, that at times I had to put the novel down because the injustice was not to be tolerated.Salem Falls is a sleepy little town in New Hampshire that is about to be awakened by a group of teen-age girls who have formed a wiccan coven of witches and decided to prey on the innocent, or not so innocent. That is the question and you will be left wondering till the end.There is a line up of vivid and amusing characters to support the accused, all with stories of their own neatly entwined within the main plot. This is what I enjoy the most about this author's books. Not so much that she does it, but how she does it, making her books a mad, page turning frenzy till the end, at which point I sit back with a smile, knowing I have read another great book. Kelsana 5/07/01"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Another great read by Jodi Picoult! Picoult captures the reader's attention right at the start. We are introduced to Jack St. Bride as he is finishing his term at 'The Farm'. Secondly, we are acquainted with Addie, a vulnerable woman of many losses. The reader will eagerly be turning the pages to find out what happens to each of these people as their paths intertwine.The story is set in the quiet and ordinary town of Salem Falls. For Jack St. Bride, Salem Falls means a new beginning and for Addie it means stability and the bridge to the past. Could history repeat itself? For Jack St. Bride it sure did. Accused for the same crime twice ~ it will be Jordan McAffee that assists Jack during his trial. Some may remember Jordan as the lawyer from Picoults previous novel, 'The Pact'.Picoult is the master of creating suspensful stories that immediately capture the reader until the very last page is turned.

Despite having a rather intimate understanding of his situation, I found him to be a listless and uninteresting character.Or perhaps is was the rather trite manner in which Addie, Amos, Gillian and many of the other characters were crafted. Many of the images and characterizations seem overly dependent upon a twenty-first century sensibility. I often distrust novels in which the character portrayals are laced with media references and clich&eacute; images of current fashion and I found the four young girls to be very much to that effect. References to Alanis Morissette and electric blue nail polish may not withstand the test of time.On the other hand, I appreciated Ms. Picoult's lack of negativity toward wicca and her openness towards the possibility of magic. Although the love interest sub-plot did not work for me, those moments of \\"magic\\" rescued the novel from becoming overly trite and predictable.Such assets and flaws aside, I'll admit that read the book happily eagerly to discover the outcome. One cannot help being drawn into the story. It was simply a &quot;fun read&quot;."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"It pains me to rank this book with just 3 stars because I think so highly of Jodi Picoult. She is a kind, generous, and talented author who always finds time for her readers.But this book just isn't up to the quality of writing of which I know she is capable, like &quot;The Pact&quot;. (I sound like a teacher, don't I?) The bare bones are there--it is a page-turner, for sure-- but it seemed as though I were on an out-of-control train.The writing is formulaic, the plot is a tired one, the book skitters from one topic to another, and the ending is both rushed and predictable. It seems as though Picoult could not decide whether to write a police procedural, a trial book, or a romance. Consequently, all three are intertwined and leave the reader wanting more of something.The courtroom scenes were not at all believable. I think that it is a rare writer who can write courtroom scenes that are both realistic and interesting because trials can be very boring and tedious.To her credit, Jodi did give the reader a true sense of how lies and connivance can ruin someone's life...and how eager the public is to believe anything bad that they hear."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am a new reader of Jodi Picoult's books and I am never disappointed.However, I have to say that Salem Falls is by far the best I have read so far.A captivating story of a small town in New Hampshire, the story line follows a convicted sex offender, a group of teenage girls, and all of the things that can happen around them in a small New England town.Addie, a diner worker and main character of the story, is a fascinating figure and is somehow wound into all of the different story lines.Without giving much away, a series of riveting court scenes kept me absorbed, and the jaw dropping end me left me wanting more- the perfect way to end a book. I am still thinking about it weeks later!Thank you Jodi Picoult!! Keep your wonderful stories coming!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Maybe it's the audio CD narrator alternating between sickly sweet mooniness, to out-of-place scorn, to stilted cardboard cut-out attempts at male voices, but I can't believe this is the effort of an award-winning writer. She apparently doesn't even know that \\"The reason is because\\" is improper English. The events in this \\"story\\" are so ridiculously improbable, she destroys her own credibility. The writing is at best, specious. At worst are lines like \\"throw away his freedom like an extra stick of gum\\", and sappy offerings such as \\"his name rolled around her mouth like a butterscotch candy\\" - I won't torture you by quoting descriptions of gratuitous teen (and adult) sex, or the occasional, oddly-placed crudeness. Hyperbole and melodrama reign supreme here."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"As an English teacher I am always looking for new books to read, for my students to read, and to supplement my lessons. I have found it!!I have been teaching \\"The Crucible\\" for seven years and am always incorporating world news with the story. I have FINALLY found a piece of literature to also use in my lessons.Jodi doesn't suck the reader in the first few pages; she does it in the first paragraph. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read, but especially to those who love studying the Salem Trials of 1692."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is my first Picoult, and I must say that expected a lot more from this book from the reviews, so maybe my disappointment was due to having such high expectations.That's not to say it's not well written and a page-turner, because it is both, but the story gets too complicated with too many storylines running in parallel and a few twists and turns too many to be believable - I do think that suspending disbelief is crucial to really enjoying this book. While it never actually got boring, it did drag on longer than I thought necessary."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I read this book in bookclub. As soon as I finished it I handed it over to my mom to read. It grabs you right from the beginning, and is hard to put down until you are done. Not a great book, but very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I have only just discovered Picoult's book, I am not usually a fan or courtroom style books, but I find Picoult enormously satisfying. Her ability to slowly reveal layers of information and have contrasting plot devices makes her books immensely satisfying.This is a modern retelling of the crucible. Jack McBride comes to Salem Falls - (I suppose a reference to the fall of Salem in the Crucible) anyway, he has come to start a new life after being falsely accused of rape. Only he is treated suspiciously by the town who find out who he is. In the meantime he has struck up a friendship with the eccentric Addie who runs the 'Do or Diner'. Only there is a group of teenage girls in town who are determined to make trouble - one of the them the daughter of the richest amd most powerful man in town.I just find Picoult so satisfying - the contrast of McBride's previous false rape complaint with this one. The contrast of the girls Wiccan spells with what actually happens. The towns peoples surface virtue which conceals a blacker less appealing violent undercurrent - even the contrast of original story of teh crucible with the seemingly non-malevolent Wiccan spells of this book.I will definitely be looking out for more Picoult books.A. Woodley"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book except for the very ending. It seemed too rushed after the length of the rest of the novel which is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Also, there was a glaring editing mistake (which drives me crazy) when she said someone's tumor was healed and it was actually a stroke. Considering the amount of detail she went into for the rest of the novel, this was a pretty obvious error. After finishing the book, the parts involving Jack's mother and his time as a child did not contribute anything to the book either. She could have left those parts out and concentrated more on the ending. The only other thing that bothered me after reading it, was how can one guy be so magnetic to little girls. Maybe I didn't have cute enough teachers growing up, or the flirtationous that these girls had, but I can't picture doing the things they did in the novel and it hapening to the same man twice! If however, you ignore these few inconsistencies, you will enjoy this book, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Very early on I knew what would be revealed on the last page. Yes, I took genetics in college. And despite some overly \\"feel good moments\\" I think a lot of the events were realistic. Teen girls with crushes on an older man/teacher/coach? It happens. Teen girls drawn to Wicca? Sure. A man accused of something terrible he hasn't done? That's been known to happen too.But I think the most interesting questions rise out of the sort of incidental information Picoult gives her readers. Why is it important for us to see the scenes we do of Annalise McBride, Jack's mother? What about a person's past? Is it fair or right that some crimes go unpunished?For the most part, I'd say this is a well written book. I don't fault Picoult for failing to \\"surprise\\" me. While I already knew where she was going, I certainly enjoyed the trip. But I think the best parts of the book (and the reasons I will suggest my friends read it) are the issues and questions that are raised--subtle and not. And while I would not classify it an \\"issue\\" book, I think the characters are so well developed their problems become our own."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am a huge piccoult fan and I really really loved this book. I thought it was really well written and Picoult always has a wonderful surprise at the end of her book. Great read...one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi Picoult does a good job of creating characters and making you want to read about them. She did that in Salem Falls with two of her characters, Addie Peabody & Jack St. Bride. Her third main character, Jordan McAfee, an attorney who has been in her other books, comes off as \\"not so bright\\" in Salem Falls (we have to be reminded that he is a good defense lawyer).The problem with Salem Falls is that there are just too many unrealistic behaviors/scenes in the book - from terrible courtroom scenes to teenager relationships/remorse to an alcoholic father miraculously being able to function.If you suspend belief in reality, this book is a good beach/vacation read."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I knew halfway into the book how it was going to end and hoped that I was wrong, that the writer wouldn't be that silly. But she did it.Lots of inconsistencies throughout, but the most ridiculous parts were the antics in the courtroom during a serious trial. First we were led to believe the judge was a no-nonsense kind of woman, but then she allows Roy to bring in muffins and sandwiches before giving his testimony.Also unrealistic was Addie living there quietly and peacefully with two of the men who had raped her. I didn't care much for Jack or Addie and found it hard to sympathize with Jack."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Jodi is a twisted, facinating writer that delivers every time and knows how to grab a reader. They are dark at times, but in this world very believable. This ended bitter sweet such as all of her books do!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"All Jack St. Bride wanted to do was find somewhere quiet to start his life over; somewhere people wouldn't know who he was or what baggage he brought with him. Unfortunately for him, a small town is not the place to do this. In a small town people come together to protect their own from outsiders at ANY cost.Gillian Duncan has everything a teenage girl could want - her father is the wealthiest man in town, she is pretty, and has a bunch of girlfriends. She is also carrying around some heavy secrets, such as...she's a witch. One night when her and her friends are celebrating a pagan ceremony things get very out of control. When the dust settles Jack St. Bride is accused of felonious sexual assault on Gillian Duncan - the second time in a year he has been accused of this type of crime! Jack adamantly denies this charge, as he had with the previous one, but no one believes him. How will he ever get out of this situation? How many times does lightning strike the same place?I had started reading this book in hardcopy about two years ago, but I didn't get very far - for reasons that I can't remember now. Once I started listening to the audio book I quickly fell into the story. The story jumps back and forth in time between Jack's youth, his first charge of sexual assault, and the present (the second charge). It was relatively easy to follow these time shifts because Jack's life is so radically different. One of my favorite characters was Jack's lawyer, Jordan McAfee. His perception of Jack from when he first comes to town, to representing him as his lawyer and flip flopping as to whether he believes him or not mirrored many of my own thoughts. If you have read The Pact, another Picoult book, you might recognize him as the defense attorney for Chris.The ending will absolutely blow you away! A traditional Picoult book with that hook ending that you never see coming, but once you read it, you recognize all the signs that were pointing there all along. Amazing!4.5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"It's an amazingly touching story. What to do with a wrong ID, pragmatic legal solutions?"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"A plot that illustrates just how prejudiced and closed minded people can be. Jack's naivety during his time as a teacher at a girls school frustrated me...I wanted to shout \\"don't do it\\" at him. On the other hand naivety isn't a crime so you just had to keep reading to find out whether justice was upheld.I liked Jack, Addie and Roy but the other characters although necessary, I could take or leave. I think that was the intention though, for us to focus on mainly Jack and Addie and the hurdles they had overcome and the inner strength they both had. The court case and events surrounding it were compelling and although you hope that truth will prevail...you're just never quite sure whether it will."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am enjoying a summer of reading all of Picoult's books. This one was very good. A couple of times I became impatient with details, but overall I enjoyed my reading time."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I am in the process of reading all of Jodi Picoult's books. (I only wish I had read them in the order in which they were written.) Salem Falls was a page-turner! I enjoyed the story and the characters. I suspected the ending, but kept myself from peeking and just enjoyed the unfolding of the story. Ah hah! I was right! I just ordered another 6 of her books. Now I will have them all."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Well, \\"Salem Falls\\" definitely isn't one of Jodi Picoult's best. I read this just after I read The \\"Tenth Circle\\" and maybe I didn't enjoy it because the storylines of the two novels are similar in that they concern a teenager making false rape accusations. Of the two, \\"Tenth Circle\\" is by far the better read. To me, \\"Salem Falls\\" was far-fetched, pushed the clumsy, witch-hunt theme to within an inch of its life, and was peopled by characters that it was difficult to relate to, apart from Jack, the main character. Jordan Macafee, the lawyer from \\"The Pact\\", returns in \\"Salem Falls\\" and defends Jack on the rape charges. I found Ms Picoult's writing style in this one quite stilted and whilst it was very readable, as her novel's always are, it is not one I particularly recommend."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is my second Jodi Picoult Novel and like the previous, I enjoyed this one very much. Ms. Picoult has a knack for making a place and characters come alive. One can easily visualize the town as well as each character.The tie in to The Crucible was uncanny. I have always been fascinated by witches and Ms. Picoult did a marvelous job researching this topic.This is a well written, well researched novel and a literary joy. I highly recommend it.Linda BilodeauAuthor: Stepping Through Seagrass, The Olive Branch A Tale of Resistance."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I'm still on a mission to read every single Picoult book I can get ahold of, but I didn't finish \\"The Pact\\" because it started sounding too much like Romeo and Juliet. However, judging from a scene in this book, it looks like this was the introduction of Selena and Jordan so I may give it another try. I'm pleased to say that my detective skills don't suck as bad as they did with the second Picoult book. I'm starting to guess right at the endings to her books, and excuse me for sounding childish, but I knew it! I knew it! On that very last page, I knew that was the reason Giliene did what she did and where her anger really lied just from a poison scene that was never explained in the beginning of the book.This book is basically about a man who went to jail for statutory rape initially and was watered down to a misdemeanor but still served eight months. After being released, he goes to another town to start his life fresh, but as with all alleged rapists, he has to be put on a sexual offender's list. In a small town that knows everyone's business, it wasn't long before the townspeople found out, and here comes the drama with yet another young girl who has a schoolgirl crush and accused him of rape. The details of their encounter are foggy for quite some time in the book, which will keep you guessing and interested.Cons: Had this been my first book of Picoult's, then the details of rape and examination would've been interesting to me, such as they were in \\"The Tenth Circle\\" but it was repetitive because I'd read that previous book already. Girl cuts hair. Exam with the light. Same procedure. It was like I was reading the same chapter twice on those scenes, and I don't necessarily know if that was the best move to make, especially for a continuous reader. The charts within the story were unnecessary for me, and I was about as bored reading the scientific information as I was with that one book she had with the comic strip drawings. Neither was necessary for me. If one of the forensic scientists would've said \\"The DNA doesn't match perfectly,\\" that would've been fine for me and I could've saved myself several pages. However, for someone who is interested in that type of thing, this will be right up their alley. I had to laugh when I read the word \\"phat\\" because that is pretty much played out slang to say now, but maybe during that time, it was normal to say. My friends and I never really said it unless we were talking about Phat Farm clothing though. The stories about witches was waaaaaaaaay too far-fetched for me. She lost me immediately with that, but because I am a Picoult fan, I gave it a shot. If I'd have been on the jury, I'd have said Jack was guilty for Jordan even going on a limb with that story. But I guess Picoult wants to pick unpopular topics and make them interesting. Also unrealistic was the father who barged into a trial that was televised offering sandwiches and muffins, and the judge just letting that go by. (Note: I didn't think calling her a black b---- was necessary either, but I might be a little more sensitive on that subject than Picoult's regular readers. She could've been called tough, but I'd rather have not used that particular choice of words for my own personal reasons. But this is HER story, not mine, so I sucked it up and continued reading.)Pros: I respect Picoult a great deal for always playing Devil's Advocate and potentially making her readers see the OTHER side of the story. Instead of saying \\"Oooh, rapists = bad,\\" readers got to learn some backstory on the events that took place. Instead of saying \\"Oh, witches = evil,\\" readers learned more about the actual practice of pagans. Even issues involving alcoholism and not being able to deal with death are brought up and makes a reader potentially see the other side of the story. On top of that, I am so frantic whenever I read about Selena because she is entertaining and one raw sista. I love it! I can't believe she managed to be so low-key in what sounds like a predominantly white town and how nobody seems to understand the connection between her and Jordan, but to each his own. Overall, I liked this story for Jack's past and present issues, and I learned some great Jeopardy trivia throughout the book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This was one of my favorite books of the summer. :) It was mildly predictable, but still a great read."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This book was riveting from start to finish. This is just my second Picoult novel to read, and I'm definitely hooked. This story made me think about how we all judge people, perhaps without knowing all the facts.

Wrongful accusation of rape by one of his love-struck students landed him in jail. After his release, Jack attempts to make a new start in the small town of Salem Falls. He is required by law to register himself as a sexual offender, and he discovers that there are no secrets in a small town. He begins working in a diner for Addie Peabody and soon they form a romantic attachment. He catches the attention of the daughter of the town's wealthiest citizen, and when she accuses him of rape, the nightmare starts all over again. As always, Jodi Picoult writes an interesting and original story. What keeps this from being one of her top-level novels is that the characters are not as compelling as in her other books. Although her plot builds suspense, I found myself not as interested in the fate of Addie and Jack as I usually am with Picoult's characters. Despite this flaw, it is still a good read."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"This is the story of Jack St Bride, who just spent 8 months in jail having been accused of raping one of his students. Jack moves to Salem Falls, where he falls for the owner of the town's diner. In this small town, people are quick to point the finger at Jack and to make it clear that he is not welcome in the community. Things turn sour when a group of teenage girls, daughters of influential men in the community, turn their attention to Jack and try to ruin his life once again.This story follows the same pattern of previous books by Picoult such as my sister's keeper, the pact or plain truth. Picoult fans will recognise the character of Jordan McAfee from one of her previous books.This story is well-written and addresses some challenging issues. I've enjoyed most of Picoult's books so far and read this one in a couple of days, so I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Excellent reading - Jodi Picoult makes you want to stay up late at night to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

You still keep wanting to hear how it turns out. Modern men listen up and take note . . . it seems that most of them that I know have except for the character in this book."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"One again Jodi Picoult manages to weave a plot of vulnerability, superstition, and the never-ceasing power of love.Upon arriving in the small town of Salem Falls, Jack St. Bride is alone, untrusting, and longing for a new life to fill the emptiness that has become him while wasting away in prison. He stumbles into the Do-or-Diner where the young owner Addie, offers him a job on the spot. When Addie offers him this job, she has subconsciously offered up her trust, and from there, the plot unravels.Addie has lived in Salem Falls her entire life, and has indeed suffered the drawbacks of small town living. As a rape victim and single mother, she too makes her way through life longing to place her trust and hope in someone.When a young woman in Salem Falls accuses Jack of brutally raping her, the small town is enraged. Jack St. Bride has ruined exactly what their small town stands for--safety--and the citizens of the quiet, close-knit community will go to extremes in order to ensure that their town's reputation is safe.Readers are in for a truly shocking and genius end that only Picoult could deliver. Perhaps after reading Salem Falls, you too, will question the age old cliche of small-town security...."},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"In Loyal, New Hampshire, teacher Jack St. Bride cared so much about his students, he tried to be there for them. However, good intentions and deeds do not go unpunished as Jack learns when he is arrested, tried, and convicted for sex with a minor. Jack insisted he was innocent and so did his victim, Catherine Marsh, whose diary hung Jack.After eight months behind bars, Jack settles in Salem Falls where his Ph.D. in history makes him qualified to wash dishes at the local diner owned by Addie Peabody. Jack reports to Detective Saxton as required by state law of any sex offender. Over time, Jack and Addie begin to fall in love, but lightning strikes again. Four teens accuse Jack of raping Gilly Duncan, daughter of the town icon. With his past and the evidence against him very solid, Jack appears to be heading for his second pediophile conviction even if it seems more like a modern day witch-hunt.SALEM FALLS is an exciting legal thriller that focuses on whether an accused person with a previous conviction for the same crime can receive a fair trial. The story line is fast-paced, as Jack seems like an ordinary person caught in maelstrom of his own making or just bad luck (read the book if you want to know). Addie is a great heroine, but three of the accusers sans Gilly fail to come across as genuine. Still, Jodi Picoult provides her audience with a well-written tale that leaves the audience thinking about the varying degrees of justice.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Salem Falls","review":"Our book club chose Salem Falls as one of our selections.

He goes to work in a diner, working for a woman named Addie, who was also raped as a teen, got pregnant and lost her daughter at a young age and is still grieving. I found it unrealistic that everyone that knows Addie accepts as \\"normal\\" that Addie talks to her deceased daughter, and of her daughter, as if she is still alive, even setting a place for her every day in the diner. A predictable romance develops between Jack and Addie.A sub-plot about teens involved in witchcraft wasn't my cup of tea either, but teen readers will like it.

It seemed to be an amicable solution to everyone's problem. Still, Molly can't help but hopes that the man she secretly loved from afar for so long would someday love her back. Nonetheless, the fantasy would end in a few months unless Molly could somehow turn their fictional arrangement into a real, loving marriage.Kaliq Bin Shalik had always admired his lovely personal assistant, but had always been too wrapped up in his work to pursue a more in-depth relationship with her. Now, as Molly confides her dark secret, Kaliq realizes how much this lovely young woman means to him, and how much he wants to protect and provide for her even if it means raising another man's child and facing the wrath of his own father.

Any how, the story is a bit outdated today but the story is well structured and well written. 4/5"},{"Title":"The Literary Enneagram: Characters from the Inside Out","review":"I have two bones to pick with most Enneagram books, training programs and articles, and it&#8217;s the same trouble I have with most poetry and fiction. The first bone is that they try to rouse me from my complacency chair by describing a type instead of showing them. I don&#8217;t budge, for the most part, because I don&#8217;t often care what others are said to be, when I have no context in which to put them.They want to explore what is felt without letting me get involved. For instance, all Enneagram books say that a Seven will make boring things less boring, and Sevens have a propensity for multi-tasking. All panels of Sevens say the same and that Sevens don&#8217;t finish what they start. Yawn, this Seven, who finishes every single thing I start, says. Not one describes a scene of a garage lit by one light at pre-dawn with me doing the rumba as I trod the treadmill listening to a Gypsy Kings CD as I practice flamenco hand movements. So when I read Bridget Jones&#8217;s Diary describing my Seven personality in The Literary Enneagram I discover that perhaps my own relentless pursuit of activity is indeed a way to allay my anxieties. And my fear of missing out on things keeps me from fully enjoying the fun as I have it.Searle digs deepest to find the accurate Seven, getting me involved with perceptive and contextual introductions. The title of the book did intimidate me. I missed out on having great literature forced into my education, if you can call what I had an education. I have tried to make up for the gaps by trying to tackle Hardy, Shakespeare and D.H. Lawrence on my own so I won&#8217;t be such an .... I&#8217;m happy to report that after reading the first chapter, I understood Les Miserables without a hitch and even understood the inner critic of old Javert without referring to any Cliff Note.The second bone I have with most fiction and poetry, Enneagram books is that there&#8217;s hardly any fun involved. No pizzazz, sensuality, hot fudge sundaes. Why do I have to know about all that pain? Some of it is okay, but hey! I just don&#8217;t buy into the approach that for full understanding to take place, I must suffer. So I&#8217;m happy that Searle includes fun and sexy examples of exploring the psyche.As in &#8220;The Taming of the Shrew&#8221; where a Six, Kate is tamed by an Eight, Petruchio. Following the arrows of stress and comfort, Katharina was forced to let appearances (type three) be damned, be publically humiliated (a 6's worst fear) in order to merge (the nine position) with her husband and find peace for her troubled and belligerent station (six). Petruchio&#8217;s arc, i.e. transformation of character, is seen as his desires to get a rich wife (typical low-down eight behavior) uses an irritating know-it-all obnoxiousness (five stress point activated), but he gets his heart opened in the process, (the eight&#8217;s heart opens at the two) He actually falls in love with Katharina.This may sound complicated, as I refer to Enneagram numbers the way an astrologer refers to asteroids and quincunxes. But reading the first chapter is to have the basics under one&#8217;s belt. There&#8217;s history reaching back to Pythagorus, description of the nine types, concepts of wings, the Hornevian Triads, Stress and Security Points, and much more.The setting of literary examples is a concept someone had to develop, and I&#8217;m glad it was Judith Searle, because her compassion for people&#8217;s struggles is so wonderful. It could have easily been a book that showed characters&#8217; hateful sides, which lends itself to richer adverbs and adjectives. Throughout the book, the reader is simply placed in a character&#8217;s world through their hearts and through their challenges.Finding literary examples to describe one&#8217;s own type would be enough. But to proceed to the other types is to find gold. I had the enthralling discovery that Shakespeare is as accessible as Gary Larson&#8217;s &#8220;The Far Side.&#8221; But seriously, when we speak of Enneagram types in these dramatic ways, ways that reveal the inner dialogue, we speak of healing, cleaning up the past and loving those whom we once feared.Authors who could have had no exposure to the Enneagram, &#8220;validate the system.&#8221; The intricacy of one personality type expressed in one great piece of literature would be coincidence, but Searle brings up dozens of books where the characters follow not only their own number&#8217;s path, but bring in the side number, expresses stress points and one of the three different subtypes. The Literary Enneagram is elegant in its delivery of humanity.Searle does for the Enneagram what, dare I say, Dr. Frankenstein did for the monster. Not that animating dead body parts is my point - she just enlivens them. There is no end to studying Enneagram with this approach. To see the shadow monster in a character who has our Enneagram DNA is thorough and satisfying. To see Dr. Frankenstein&#8217;s bully (8) and know that his heart point is the Nurturer (2), then that scene where he nestles a kitten is not far-fetched.We are allowed to enter the mystery of each point through the heart of the characters Searle selects. Freed from having to learn about the types by being told about them, we enter through their fears, self-esteem and anger. We&#8217;re talking lower chakras - the way we humans express ourselves in this lifetime on earth.The set-ups are compassionate, as in democratic, &#8220;to suffer with&#8221; compassion. We enter through the heart of each literary stranger with empathy. We understand them, and in turn understand and love ourselves. As we develop Ennea-eyes, our awareness, perception and of the fragile and X-rayed character becomes closer. To read this book was to have my heart opened, broken and remain open still."},{"Title":"The Literary Enneagram: Characters from the Inside Out","review":"I first learned about the enneagram in a weekend workshop at a Jesuit school in South Dakota. It was entertaining...and then it was amazing when my number came up. That was it. I have since purchased a few books on the subject and was not impressed because they seemed shallow and reminiscent of pop astrology until I found \\"The Literary Enneagram\\" at a bookstore in Ashland, OR. I love to read and though I've not read all the books used to characterize the enneagram personalities, Judith Searle gives enough of a character pullout to fulfill the demonstration of a particular enneagram characteristic. The use of the characters and their plights help flesh out what these perspectives mean to particular types and the choices available to them. I have found this book very readable and happily constructive."},{"Title":"The Literary Enneagram: Characters from the Inside Out","review":"This excellent book offers an in-depth look at the enneagram and the nine enneagram types as seen in literature and film. Great for getting beyond a superficial look at the types, especially for the literarilly-inclined. I must admit that I'm not generally a reader of Great Literature--being more of a film buff and reader of non-fiction. But I'm very interested in life themes and the enneagram and know of no one who does a better job exploring such themes than Judith Searle."},{"Title":"The Literary Enneagram: Characters from the Inside Out","review":"I love how Judith Searle has expertly defined character development using enneagrams. This book has good information on to write into complex characters."},{"Title":"Explaining Consciousness","review":"This collection begins with an essay by David Chalmers defending the view that no reductive, materialistic account of consciousness can ever be successful.The rest of the book is made up of over two dozen responses to Chalmers's essay--some supportive, some critical, and some derisive. These responses are written by some of the biggest names in the field, and are followed by a concluding essay, again by Chalmers, in which he tries to defend his own views against what has gone before.Because of the variety of viewpoints (materialism, dualism, mysterianism) and approaches (neurophysiology, analytical philosophy, quantum mechanics), this collection provides a wonderful introduction to some of the most important aspects of recent work in consciounsess studies. Just check out the table of contents.As a reductionist myself, I found Patricia Churchland's argument particularly hard to counter, and I think that anyone, regardless of their perspective, will find food for thought in Mark C. Price's wonderful piece.All in all, the best introduction I have ever encountered to the philosophical study of consciousness."},{"Title":"Explaining Consciousness","review":"Daniel Dennett's physicalist model of the mind (having its basis in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Neural Networks) claims to explain everything about the working of the mind. Can everything mental be explained by this model? i.e, can all mental properties be reduced to the four entities that constitute the physical: (1) Mass (2) Space (3) Time (4) Electric Charge ?Not everything has been explained by this model, sayeth David Chalmers. In a famous paper published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies in 1995, Chalmers argued that the \\"Hard\\" problem of consciousness remains untouched by physicalist models of the mind --\\"Why does the performance of [brain] functions result in experience?\\"In other words, why do experiences such as the \\"sweetness of sugar\\", or \\"smell of mothballs\\", or \\"blueness of the sky\\" arise out of the firing of neurons? Why should \\"experience\\" arise out of a physical system at all?Chalmers got 26 responses for his paper, and he even responded to all the responses in a subsequent paper. This book contains all these papers on the subject.The \\"Hard\\" problem of consciousness has been around for a long time. Frank Jackson, Sydney Shoemaker, Joseph Levine have all pointed this out before, and Chalmers has merely highlighted the problem. But he has done a pretty good job of it, for even Daniel Dennett is having a \\"hard\\" problem being able to sleep nowadays!I dropped a star because Chalmers' idea of including \\"experience\\" as a fundamental entity is not covered well or convincingly."},{"Title":"Explaining Consciousness","review":"To get the most out of this book you probably want to read Chalmer's \\"The conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory\\". That's the book which sparked this collection of essays. You will find a diverse and interesting bunch of opinions on the mystery of consciousness in this collection. At least one of the views should appeal to you whatever your own preference and there is much food for thought, A classic addition to any serious philosophers shelf."},{"Title":"Explaining Consciousness","review":"This book was just about my first taste of the consciousness wars. Or no. I&#8217;ve been reading about consciousness for about ten years. But it made too much sense to me. My retinas see you, my visual cortex sees my retinas, but who sees my visual cortex? Where does the buck stop? Because the buck does stop. Once it hit me that vision is vision, something you wouldn&#8217;t expect from a brain of mere structure and function, electrons moving around, drugs being administered, I embraced magic, and demanded that we are souls, things beyond law. A point-of-view can be such an amazing thing to have that I can even slip into the thought, &#8216;Only one POV can exist, they&#8217;re so unbelievable.&#8217; But as Smith said, &#8216;There&#8217;s no such thing as a leaf, there are only leaves.&#8217;This book is a delightful bunch of mental flowerings. David Chalmers is the nuclear furnace sun around which the rest of these characters orbit. Although it can seem like some are in different galaxies altogether. His explanation is &#8216;Information is phenomenal.&#8217; He deftly eludes every attack the others come up with, although this book is not the final round. He admits that his theory is probably wrong, but says this type of speculation is just what we need. My problem is, &#8216;Info is phenomenal, but where does the subject come from, you need a subject for anything phenomenal to be noticed.&#8217;(...)Chalmers is a true scholar and looks like he reads everything written about the subject. If you can&#8217;t afford the book, there are hundreds of online papers he&#8217;s collected.

Randomly insulted by Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged and later running into Ford Prefect, Arthur and his hitchhiking friend hop upon a sofa which materializes from the eddies in the space-time continuum which dumps them onto the Lord's cricket pitch two days prior to Earth's destruction. Ford employs his knowledge to the Somebody Else's Problem field to gather that Slatibartfast has hidden his craft, the Starship Bistromath, in plain view. Once together, the three witness Krikkit robots descend to murder the people on the ground and fly off with a wooden wicket of the Ashes.The Starship Bistro harnesses \\"all the ship's computation... done on a waiter's bill pad\\" (41) which is just at erratic at the Infinite Improbability Drive. Meanwhile, Marvin pivots around himself in the mud on the mattress-inhabited planet Squornshellous Zeta. Having his leg stolen for the use as a Key in the Wikkit Gate by a hoard of robots, the thieving robots further collect random bits of seeming rubbish so that they can unlock their planet of Krikkit in statis, something which Slartibartfast, Ford, and Arthur are trying to hinder.The Krikkit race, as xenophobic and wantonly destructive (but also \\"whimsical... ordinary people... charming, delightful, intelligent\\" [73]) as they come, had been sealed off from the rest of the universe when they had discovered that their normally blank, dull, drab, dreary, matte sky actually held other lifeforms, which they deducted from a crashed spacecraft and the construction of their own craft within one year. Having spewed death across near space, their isolation was eventually their punishment... except for that one craft and its horde of robots.Inexplicably, Arthur is materialized to a spacious cave which houses a 50-fooot statue of his self and one angry, angry ugly alien who posits that Arthur had killed his reincarnated being many, many times over; once a fly, Arthur killed him; once a rabbit, Arthur killed him; once a newt, Arthur killed him... and so on. Even more inexplicably, he soon found himself with the ability to fly and finds atop a mountain \\"a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in a baggage-retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his personal time-scale\\" (102). Oh, one hell of a party also shows up, a party which had been going on for four generations before being crashed by Slartibartfast, Arthur, and his boozer friend Ford.------------I wonder if this story made any sense to anyone. It felt like one disconnected scene, mildly amusing at maximum, after another disconnected scene. Stringing together random silly subplots doesn't make the greater plot more cohesive. From witty (Hitchhiker's Guide) to absurd (The Restaurant) and now at random--I suppose the \\"everything\\" in the title of the book applies to the \\"everything\\" which poured forth from the mind of Douglas Adams. Trillian, seemingly forgotten for two whole books, makes a late yet awkward appearance to simmer things down. I kept rhetorically asking myself, \\"What, what, what did I miss?\\""},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Of the five books in the trilogy, this is by far my favorite.Mainly because this the only one to have an actual plot. The other books, as great as they are, are mainly really more collections of somewhat random events, drawn together by the vague plot of 'the ultimate question for the ultimate answer' and so on.Though, of course, you really have to read all the books to get a sense of what is going on anyway."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Still funny after all these years. There seemed to be much more plot in this when compared to the \`Restaurant at the end of the Universe'As expected there are some great scenes, funny lines and amazing inventiveness.

It is very consistent and there were several \`laugh out loud' moments for me when I read this and I had a virtually permanent smile on my face. It is quite surprising at times and it isn't at all predictable.TO get so many laughs out of cricket is a considerable achievement."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This is not a book you'll read for the plotline, but if you're a geek like me, you'll love the references and ideas that are displayed throughout the book.

Unfortunately, even after sticking the rabbit bone in his beard to emphasize his words, everything didn't go quite according to plan. After rejoining with Ford, they fall into an odd situation with a velvet paisley-covered Chesterfield sofa which put them back at Ending Day on Earth during a Cricket match. Don't ask how. In short, meeting with Slartibartfast, they are forced to be part of a mission to save the Universe. Do our heroes manage to do so or fail miserably and still somehow fix the mess? Read and see!Douglas Adams has a wonderful style of writing. Everything flows together, even explanations being set apart in their own chapters. And you can't help but love the characters, everything is so well written. He describes things in such a way to make it comical with odd metaphors. The character's reactions to simple matters leading to frustration is so funny, like Arthur's confusion of Ford using a whelk in a metaphor,\\"...we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova.\\" Its small things like this that makes this such an enjoyable read.This trilogy of four books (yes, there are four) is very original. Technically, it would be a Science Fiction but it's certainly different from others. Not only is the storyline itself out there, but the characters and even their names! Like take Wowbagger for example, he's an immortal being, become bored with his fate so he comes up with a purpose...to insult the Universe. Alphabetically of course. He leaves our awakened hero stuttering after calling him a \\"jerk\\" and a \\"complete kneebiter\\".As you can tell, I love this series. It's bizarre, and it's a great read.

Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker series is, first and foremost, about social commentary and his incredibly sharp wit. Life, The Universe and Everything dosen't really push things forward too much, and almost could be considered filler, but it's filler with fun, and makes for a bit of a lighter and sillier read then the previous books. A great time killer."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This is a great read. I would highly recommend that anybody with an interest in science fiction, social observation and satire, or both to read the entire Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy (which is composed of five books). The story is excellent and should be enough to keep anyone interested. The comedy in the series exists at many levels, leaving you to find something new each time you reread it. The fact that Douglas Adamins himself reads his works on this CD set makes it a bonus which shouldn't be turned down. Douglas Adams may be dead, but you can own him forever in mind and voice.My complaint about this representation of &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; is technical. Each CD in this set has *ONE* track, making it nearly impossible to stop and restart later. You are forced to use the fast-forward button to skip through minutes of audio instead of just being able to punch the track selection buttons. It is annoying beyond explanation. You would thing anybody who produced Audiobooks would know that you are expected to break your material up into tracks. That is the main benefit over casette tapes!That one technical rant aside, I would highly suggest anybody with an interest in HHGTTG to get this. If you are a HHGTTG collecter, you should especially pick this up if just for the Douglas Adams narration factor.Anyway...

The difference in this one is that Arthur is finally starting to actually do things. rather than jsut standing around saying what. In this one we get to see Arthur and trillian save the universe, and we learn to fly, which was my favorite part of the novel. The key is to throw yourself at the ground and miss. I enjoyed it. I am in the process of reading the entire trilogy, but I am putting it down after each book because, not being a fan of Sci - Fi, I do get a little tired of the names and ridiculous situations.

After being stranded on prehistoric Earth, Arthur and Ford find a rip in the space-time continuum that catapults them through time to one day before the Earth's destruction. Luckily, however, they are rescued by an old friend, Slartibartfast. Once aboard Slartibartifast's ship, Arthur and Ford find out from Slartibartfast that the people of Krikkit are out to destroy the Universe. Their motive: they are sick of looking at the sky above their head, which, according to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is the \\"...least interesting sight in the entire Universe.\\"When Arthur is diverted while teleporting to a strange planet, he discovers that he is inside a giant mountain dedicated to the people he has killed. However, these thousands people are, coincidentally, all the reincarnations of the same being named Agrajag. This being was finally going to get his revenge when, accidentally, Arthur killed him yet again. With his last ounce of strength, Agrajag managed to set the countdown for the demolition of the mountain. During his escape, Arthur tripped and, while falling, his attention was drawn by a bag on the ground, which he recognized as his own. He then realized that he was hovering a few inches off the ground and had successfully thrown himself at the ground and missed, and was in fact, flying. Arthur later meets up with Slartibartfast and Ford at the Universe's largest party in search of Trillian. Upon finding her, the head out to Krikkit to try and stop them from using a small bomb that will destroy the entire Universe.Adams' writing style is extremely humorous and descriptive. He uses many literary devices such as simile and personification. Adams colorfully describes a strange being out to kill Arthur Dent, \\"Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a fish in a privet bush.\\" I thought that the book was great and lived up to its legacy, the same wacky adventures and all-out mayhem in the previous books is all here. For all of those who couldn't get enough of the craziness of the first two Hitchhiker's books, this one is a must read."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Another winner from Douglas Adams. Arthur Dent, I increasingly believe, can perhaps best be compared to Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit, from J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books. He is a basically very humdrum guy, who gets pulled into this kaleidoscopic world of adventure through no wish of his own... In this book, at any rate, the references to the game cricket went mostly over, or perhaps under, my American head, but most of this book has to do with the insanity of war, which of course is a pretty universal message.The White Robots of Krikkit sound a lot like the stormtroopers from Star Wars, but it's probably better to compare then directly with the Nazis from which those stormtroopers themselves were in all likelihood derived. The theme is of how most people from the planet Krikkit want to enjoy life, listen to music, have their own little farm to raise a family on, etc, while the warlords that run their government are constantly trying to get them fanatically worked up to go forth and conquer the universe. Trillian gets some of her first real character development in the whole series, or at least a few solid lines, when she is the one to piece this simple fact together, along with some other, less simple facts. Again, a very cool book, and one which makes you think in a good way about some really important stuff."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I think that this is one of the funniest books I have ever read.

By the end of the book, Arthur, Ford, Slartibartfast, Trilian, and Zaphod not only discover the gruesome origins of the game Cricket, but also manage to save the universe.Possibly the funniest part of the whole series of books comes in chapter sixteen. Arthur encounters a beast named Agrajag who is convinced Arthur has murdered him in all his previous lives. The scene is not only hysterical but it also sets the stage for one of the biggest themes in book five: &quot;Mostly Harmless.&quot;The bit about Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was really funny too.Adams was at the pinnacle of his comedic powers in this book.

We find him traveling to several exotic locations and times on a quest to save the universe from a violent band of cricket robots. This was by far the best of the series that I have read so far and remains faithful to its Futurama-like roots. The chapter about the reincarnated alien that was on a quest for revenge against Arthur Dent had me nearly crying from laughing so hard.

Out of the first four books of the \\"trilogy in five parts\\" (I haven't read the last one yet), this one is by far the least engaging. As short as it is, it took me three days to read it because I found it difficult to absorb. There is a mere skeleton of a plot line, which might have taken all of five pages to tell if not for all of the meandering and weaving around the story line. Much of what happens throughout the story has little to do with what the characters set out to accomplish. I know that this is characteristic of the Hitchhiker series, but at least in the other books, the meandering and going off on tangents leads to a funny occurrence, or is at least humorous in itself.

I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under 12 and even at this age it could be slightly daunting. To understand this third part of the series you must read the previous two.

I was also very dissapointed with the humor. While it had it's monents, LUE had less humorous portions and most of the humor seemed very out of context and had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also very anti-climactic, not having a cliffhanger like the previous boooks.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was one of my favorite books for a time, and still holds a special place in my literary tastes.

Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"One of the better installments in the Hitchhiker's Guide series, this one has a much-improved plot over the first two, which is simultaneously self-contained (if you take for granted the opening set-up) and plays an important role in the wider story of the series.Adams does continue the somewhat strange practice of throwing in random bits that aren't so much \\"science\\"-fiction as just pure nonsense--Agrajag's ongoing reincarnation and coincidental persecution at the hands of Arthur, for instance, or Arthur's learning to fly, or Thor. But as silly as some of these elements are, they are done much better this time around, and actually relevant to the story (both in this book and in the series as a whole). In general, there are far fewer disconnected episodes here in which it seems that Adams is just ranting; instead, everything fits naturally into the story, a clear mark of good plotting. That's not to say that there aren't any plot-holes, or that the story doesn't take completely wild veering turns, but that suits the nature of the work just fine.This book continues Adams' trademark off-the-wall humor, but in new even wilder forms, and to great effect. The main self-contained story about the planet Krikkit is great, and all of the side-stories tie in quite nicely, with the one exception of Zaphod's endless sulking, which does grow tiresome after a while. Another sub-plot involving the longest party in the universe excellently brings the various characters' storylines together toward the end. And of course, everybody loves Agrajag."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I couldn'd ask for more, to me this was the funniest of the hitchhiker's trilogy"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"When I finished this book, I hardly understood what had happened. All I know about it was that it involved the evil robot inhabitants of the planet Krikkit getting sick of looking at the sky, so they decide to destroy it. And naturally, Arthur, Marvin, Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod are the only people who can stop them. However, I found myself laughing quite a bit. Since all the previous books in the series were completely random, I didn't expect this one to be any different. Of course, I was right, but perhaps this one was a bit too Random."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I just reread this after rereading the other two books in the series. This was still very good, but I didn't like it quite as much as the first two books. I thought it dragged in places despite being a short book, and I wasn't terribly satisfied with the ending.However, it's still very good, and obviously a must read if you already read the previous books."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe and Everything was interesting to follow the first two. The main theme is obvious same the universes, unlike in the other books it was kind of hidden under what was going on in them. The book was great with the whole time traveling. Plus you get to see what happens to every character one at a time then they all come together at the end to complete a nice third book.I would have to say I like this book for the plot twists. Also I like how it flowed with the other books nicely unlike some, trilogies if you will, done have a lot to do with each other just the characters. You find out more about the white robots and cricket....This book, its great... sorry but I believe it is. It doesn't follow the typical style of book writing most people are used too. But I loved the couch (you'll see why if you read the book), also that poor rabbit... so sad. This and many other interesting twist's and turns await you in this book."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This audiobook is absolutly awesome! The title says it all. This is Alice in Wonderland of the 21st Century. The book is very funny, yet fast paced with plenty of action. I am not going to give you brief content of the plot, read it for yourself. Just take my word for it - the book is awesome. It is the second book in the series, and it is every single bit as good as the first one. Douglas Adams reads it himself, and he is a wonderful narrator (unlike Stephen King, who is a horrible narrator yet still insists on reading his own books). This was very enjoyable. It's aweful that Douglas Adams died so young. I enjoyed his books so much that I take it as a personal loss."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"On the series in general: If you are looking for a series that will always make perfect sense, I urge you to avoid the Hitchhiker's Guide series. If you are looking for something unusual or bizarre, well then this is the series for you. This series has some of the most hilarious quotes I have ever read.On this book in particular: In Life, The Universe and Everything, the craziness from the first two books (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Restaurant at the End of the Universe, respectively). I liked books one and two better, but this one was still good. It could drag at times, but most books do. The plot(I use the term loosely) isn't very obvious, a nice change from some books where everything that happens seems predictable. Trust me, predictability is not going to be a problem here! The characters are all very different, even odd. Together they make up a cast of characters that any Sci-Fi fan should like. You've got the human in over his head in a galaxy that he can't understand, eccentric aliens, time travel, space ships...you name it, its here."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I love the audio books read by the book's own author, and this is one of the perfect examples why. When you hear all of the inflection and personality that Adams put into each character, you know what he meant by each line, by each character. It is lovely to hear him giving life to his own creation, and it is nice to still be able to hear his voice in this way. We all miss you, Mr. Adams!!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I really and truly love Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I recommend the books to almost everyone I know and I haven't let anyone down so far. I will still certainly recommend the books in the series to just about anyone - but this one in particular was not quite as good as the first two in the series.I'm not sure what it was about this book that kept me from getting as into it as the first two. The plot was a bit more scattered for me which probably makes the main contribution to my slight disappointment. Not that the other Hitchhiker's Guide books are not scattered - this one just had a different feel.I am curious to re-read the book though. When I started reading the book, I got through the first several chapters and my kindle wasn't able to save the last read page. I went back through and re-read the chapters I had already read and it was way more hilarious than I had thought the first time around. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up with a much better rating once I give it a second read.Anyway, I most certainly recommend the book - just read the first two books first. They certainly would give a much better introduction to the characters than this installment."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Not nearly on the same level as the first two books. The plot seemed to be thrown together, the humour forced, and the characters flat. Marvin would really be depressed reading this one. Still, it had it's moments and is worth a read just to complete the series, if for no other reason."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I cannot tell you how happy I was to find my dear sad friend talking to a mattress. And how great was his story about his speech for the bridge? Classic Marvin. Sometimes I wish I had a Marvin but then I realize that I would be depressed all the time. Also, he probably makes a lot of noise when he walks and my downstairs neighbor would hate that.On to the book itself, I am constantly amazed by Mr. Adams's imagination. I thought J.K. Rowling was good. This man was a God! Conversations with him must have been unreal. This book went in so many directions and so many random places that my head is still spinning.I'm quite intrigued by the Cathedral of Hate. What if this were true? What if we are always killing the same soul? :S I'm still killing bugs though. There are limits. And the never-ending cocktail party? How boring. I can only be around people so long. I was ready to kill people after the 5th encore at a Sonic Youth concert.Final thought - it's been 5 years and Arthur is still wearing his pajamas. When will he get to change clothes? They must be ripe by now."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"There are moments in this book that are as funny as the two previous books, but not as many as I wanted. Overall, it's a very good book, well worth a read, but not before you read what came before it.I have never finished a book before and thought, \\"I sure wish there hadn't been a plot.\\" Not that I want a different plot, but that I want no plot at all. That's essentially how Adams strung together his witty observations for two books, and this book suffers greatly for having a story structure to constrain the author's imagination. The basic plot is that the residents of Krikkit have been trapped for billions of years in a time warp as punishment for attempting the most polite and amiable galactic annihilation ever conceived, but now some of their robots are trying to free them, and Arthur Dent and his buddies have to save the day. There are arbitrary video game style elements (collect these four items in these four locations, then put them together and fight a big boss) and a tacked-on anticlimactic conclusion and a lot of flying around that should have been whimsical but was somehow dreary instead. The book as a whole is awfully dreary - with an actual quest beyond \\"get to the next location where Adams can write funny jokes for you,\\" Arthur Dent brings the reader down almost as much as a minute-long conversation with Marvin.Still, I have to give the book at least three stars for its analysis of restaurant mathematics. For ten years, I have thought myself clever for observing that restaurant math is more difficult than calculus because no one can split a check and no one brings small bills, but Adams not only beats me to the joke by twenty years, he enriches it to talk about how the number of people in the party is never definite, and no one is ever at the door at the time of the reservation, and I feel completely outclassed. My hat is off to you, Adams. The book is mediocre, but the restaurant math issues are sublime."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"In reviewing Douglas Adams' first two Hitchhikers books I said they were perhaps the only books I'd read where I wouldn't change a thing; not a sentence, not a comma, nothing. In the case of Life, The Universe and Everything I can't make such a bold statement. Make no mistake, Douglas Adams could probably write a book on changing your oil and make it humorous but there's a difference between humorous and hilarious. The first two books are hilarious. This one is just a bit less so. I had the feeling that Adams began the series with a head full of brilliant ideas and now we've gotten to the ideas and plots that didn't make the cut in the first two books. Now mind you I'm rating this book on the Douglas Adams scale which reaches a much higher level than your average writer.Life, The Universe and Everything starts up where The Restaurant at the End of the Universe left off, with Ford and Arthur stuck on prehistoric Earth. Here is where the first problem occurs. Arthur has always been the main character of the series but he's far less interesting then the supporting cast including Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the Robot but those two really get pushed to the side. Even when Zaphod appears he seemed like a watered down, less interesting version. I would go even further and say that unlike the first two books Adams spends far less time on developing any of the characters. An argument could be made that the first two books established the characters but to me it felt like the author was just coasting.After escaping from the past, Ford and Arthur naturally find themselves embroiled in a plot that threatens to destroy the entire universe. It seems that millions of years ago some happy, carefree life forms on planet Krikkit discovered that the universe contains intelligent beings besides themselves and in the all time greatest surge of xenophobia decide to wipe out every other living sentient being in existence. Before you can say Kumbaya the Krittets have traded in their folk songs and campfires for warships and very nearly succeed in their plan of universal genocide before being imprisoned in a slo-time envelope. Between their imprisonment and the present day the Krikkits have only experienced five years of actual time, more than enough to develop a final universe ending doomsday weapon. Now someone is trying to break them out.The idea of the Krikkits being so incredibly, mind bendingly motivated that they were able to rapidly advance their technologically and challenge the rest of the universe was awesome. Unfortunately things turn out not to be as they seem and this is where I kind of wish Douglas Adams hadn't taken the story where he did. The conclusion of the book is far far far from poor but given the sheer perfection of the first two books I couldn't help but wish it had been slightly different. It also features a tacked on ending disconnected from the rest of the book as if it suddenly occurred to Douglas Adams that he forgot to put in the obligatory \`almost finding the secret of the universe' so he quickly slapped something together.There are no weak links in the Hitchhikers chain but some are stronger than other and I did have a feeling that Douglas Adams creativity tank wasn't at full capacity when he wrote this one. I still highly recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I am a new fan of the Hitchhiker series, and I'm about halfway through the 4th book in the \\"trilogy\\". Adams uses the same techniques and humor that made the other books in the series so great, and I would say overall this is a very good book. However, I found this book to be my least favorite in the series - there doesn't seem to be as much action and humor in \\"Life, the Universe, and Everything\\" as there was in the first two books in the series. The story line was good, but not as compelling as the other story lines. Don't get me wrong, the book is very good and I would recommend it to anyone, but it seems to have suffered from the \\"middle child syndrome\\". I'll give the book 3 stars out of 5, although compared to most sequels, the book is still very, very good."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"These books are incredibly fun, a little mind-bending, and a richly entertaining peek into a world free of Klingons and Storm Troopers and other people bent on ruining the fun. Yes there are villains, but they're more of the Snidely Whiplash variety, and generally undone by their own foibles, not photon torpedoes. It's a far gentler, less dystopian view of the universe, and such a better place to be."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This book lacked something that the previous two books in the series had. It felt as though, at times, Adams was being clever simply for the sake of being clever and not because it an unusual turn of phrase or quirky scene was required. It left the whole thing feeling flat and forced in parts. It had its moments, of course it did, but it lacked something special that \\"Hitchhiker...\\" had and this one does not. It left me feeling disapointed, and I can only hope tht the remaining two books in the series can recapture the magic that this book lacked."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"The beginning of this book has a passage that is without a doubt the funniest thing that I have ever read, and will probably never be equaled. I've read it so many times that I can recite it nearly word-for-word, and yet I still have trouble getting the words out because I'm laughing so hard.This isn't my favourite of the trilogy, but, as they all are, it is eminently and endlessly readable."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I've slowly been working my way through the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series over this past school year. Science-fiction is not a genre I typically like, but this series seems to be written for readers like me. It focuses more on humor and ridiculousness than it does on the fantastic nature of futuristic events. The main story of the stolen Heart of Gold ship and Arthur Dent's reluctant traveling through time and space is not nearly as interesting and enjoyable as Adams's small side notes and descriptions. In this book, the pieces are weightier than the whole.Here are a few tidbits:\\"He just won an award at the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute Awards ceremony [for]..the Most Gratuitous Use of the Word \`Belgium' in a Serious Screenplay. It's very prestigious.\\"\\"...pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of perspective and soda.\\"\\"It's all right,\\" she said in a voice that would have calmed the Big Bang down.Life, the Universe, and Everything was a quick read and a good distraction, but I was impatient for its end. I'm sure I'll finish the series, but it may be a little while before I get to it. I know that these books are beloved by many, and I want to understand why. If you have an answer, please let me know."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Throw yourself at the ground and miss. If you can't, don't whine about it.Unfortunately the third Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book is nowhere near as entertaining as the first two installments. The tone of it changes considerably to somewhat this side of maudlin, apart from the odd entertaining piece like the flying, and insulting the galaxy in order, or a bit of Clockwork Orange inspired cricket."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I have never reviewed a book that I have not yet finished. I respectfully admit that a book review should remain within the privileged realm of those whom have actually completed the book. However, the fact that I have picked this book up at least a dozen times and find it very hard to complete (considering I am a very quick reader and could probably finish War and Peace during a few bathroom visits is testament to the fact that I am having a very hard time with this book). I loved the first Hitchhiker's book and am just as passionate over Restaurant at the End of the Universe which are probably among my top favorite books of all time. I admit there are a couple of serious chuckles along the way but,WHAT HAPPENED? The genius is still there to be sure and I'd like to think I can follow the plot but there just doesn't seem to be any reason to want to follow along. It's not exactly \\"Vogon poetry\\" but compared to the brilliance of the first two, I am disappointed. I really want to like this book more and really hope that it gets better."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"As is to be expected with any Douglas Adams novel, there are moments of laugh-out-loud sheer silliness and enjoyment. And while \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" has those elements, it also seems to take a detour from the previous two Hitchhiker novels. Readers follow the expertly inept Arthur Dent on an often maddening race through the galaxy to save the universe, with varied results.\\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" left the band of characters dispersed and lost in time, leaving the reader to wonder how this series would carry on for several more books. The third novel picks up with Arthur and Ford Prefect reunited and able to hitchhike their way back to England days before it is to be destroyed. There they encounter Slartibartfast who takes them on a whirlwind tour of history, real-time arguments, and mathematics in an effort to save the universe. Inevitably their paths cross with those of Trillian and Zaphod Beeblebrox, as they try to prevent the Krikkit elders from detonating the supernova bomb.The narrative chapters are interspersed with historical accounts of the Krikkits, as well as tips from the Hitchhiker's Guide, but these detours far too often interrupt the story at hand, rather than add to the narrative. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, as well as some very clever turns of phrase, but \\"Life\\" is a bit of a hodgepodge disappointment after the first two."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? Nothing. So I will simply repeat what others and me have already said, I LOVE THESE BOOKS!!! Thats it, I strongly believe that these books rival the Harry Potter series and are, quite possibly, better. Please buy these books. Please. Oh, and bring your own towel."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I cannot stop laughing while I'm reading the book. It's very fun and comic story in universe that no one think like that.Get it and read. you'll also fally into its magnificent story."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Like the first two parts of Douglas Adam's five-part trilogy, this book will make you laugh like a hyena in heat. Actually it won't do that, but it is very funny. The book starts with the hero living in a cave on earth in prehistoric times. The book ends with this hero saving the universe. Though this is a monumental feat that the hero accomplishes (he actually does it twice), the plot in this story is not as well developed as the plot in the first two books. It does seem as if the author is working a bit too hard at extending the story. But I am glad he did because the book is uproarious (I think that word means funny).Like my reviews for the first two books, this review will include my favorite characters and a reason or two for why I like them.Wowbagger- This is the alien who spends eternity insulting the entire population of the universe. At least he has a goal in life.Slartibartfast- Nothing really special about this guy- but he has a cool name.The Talking Mattress- A whole chapter is devoted to the talking mattress, and it is my FAVORITE chapter in the entire series. Actaully, the mattress isn't one of my favorite characters, but I appreciate him for giving Marvin (my favorite character) a chance to have a conversation.The Citizens of Krikkit- Who believe in peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms.Put all these characters together, along with the regulars mixed with Douglas Adam's brilliant writing, and it makes an excellent book."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe & Everything is the third installment in Douglas Adams' inaccurately named \\"Hitchhiker's Trilogy.\\" The story picks up with Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, stranded in Earth's prehistoric past, escape via a spacet-time eddy (which oddly enough, resembles a sofa) and arrive at Lords Cricket Ground two days before the Vogon attack which destroyed the Earth. A group of robots who resemble cricketers arrives, launching a plot by the people of the planet Krikkit to destroy the Universe. Arthur and Ford are reunited with Slartibartfast as they work together to save the Universe. Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian and Marvin the Paranoid Android return, although in smaller roles than in the two previous books. Another interesting character is Agrajag, who has lived many lives in many forms, only to be killed each time by Arthur. Agrajag's hatred for Arthur is so great that he has built a \\"Cathedral of Hate\\" dedicated to his murderer, against whom he seeks revenge. Life, the Universe & Everything is my next-to-least favorite book in the Hitchhiker's series, but it is still good enough to be regarded as a respectable entry. Also check out the radio version--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Tertiary Phase. It's a great audio adaptation of Life, the Universe & Everything featuring many of the original cast members of the first Hitchhiker's radio series. But I recommend you read the book first."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"\\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" is the third volume in Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker trilogy, which consists of five installments (!). It is kind of obvious that readers who have reached this level in the series like the characters, the plots, and Adams' sense of humor -- otherwise the reader should have stopped before.Those who reach \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" won't be disappointed. The third novel has the same appeal as the two previous books. As a matter of fact they read quite one singe novel, because there isn't much of an ending the first and second one -- and a possible conclusion is reached here.The main innovation here is the importance of the British game cricket. Adams has found another meaning for this game, and it is hilarious most of the time. New characters and more confusion are developed again, but, unless the two other books, they lead to an ending. Not that everything is connected and tied in the end, but the bring more sauce to the book.It is curious to think what Adams has done for the fourth and fifth book, since the story sort of concluded here. As long as he has kept the sense of humor, the absurdity and the criticism to the contemporary society they books are still worthy reading."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"For me, the most memorable of all the components in The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As with everything in the series I often had to remind myself that the plot doesn't have to make sense. Once I got past the foolishness of it all I realized that there were moments of warped verasimilitude after all if only I'd look.But I didn't look. I read it for the scenes of mindless humor instead. That's the way I think it should be read. I will never forget Ford thinking that he is a lemon and entertaining himself by jumping in and out of a lake that thinks it is a gin and tonic. (At least Ford thinks the lake thinks it is.) Or when Arthur realizes in horror during his encounter with Agrahjag that he still has a rabbit bone in his beard (the bone being a remnant of one of Agrahjag's past reincarnations)."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Although the plot has it's down sides, you really don't even notice it compared to the humor.The plain dumbness makes the whole book hysterical."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"With the exception of &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; this is, in my opinion, Adams' most talented work.

I always hoped, however, that Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series would at least make the trip enjoyable. This book however, makes me regret that I held up my thumb in the first place.Life, the Universe and Everything deviates greatly from its predecessors in the Hitchhiker's series. The change was not what bothered me, though. This book was an enjoyable read, it just lacked the wit and humor that Adams delivered in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The storyline was cumbersome and did not flow as well as the previous two installments did. At the beginning of the book, we find Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect still on prehistoric Earth, until a time portal transported them to a Cricket match, just two days before the destruction of our planet. From there the plot goes off in hilarious Adams fashion. Except this time, I feel somewhat empty from it.I have two major problems with this story. The first and most important is that our main characters are rarely together. I miss the camaraderie that was present in the first book. There is also very little of the classic British humor that permeated the other books of the series. Maybe because most of this story was centered around Cricket, and being American I am somewhat ignorant of the game, the jokes weren't as funny for this hitchhiker. The book did still make me laugh in some places though. I thoroughly enjoy the Agrajag sub-plot, as it poked fun at previous storylines and contained hilarious inside jokes for readers of the series. But beyond that, the majority of the story becomes routine, even for Adams.I enjoyed the story, but it didn't provide the humor and wit to escape the somewhat discombobulated plot. Hopefully for this reader, the next time I dare to stick my thumb up to become an intergalactic hitchhiker, the trip won't be as troublesome."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This third book in the trilogy started to lose me. Adams tried to have a plot where the first 2 books didn't really have any, but it doesn't succeed. That could be forgiven were it as funny as the original Hitchhiker's Guide but it isn't. It didn't really start getting funny until about the last 70 pages and then the ending petered out, like he just decided to stop writing one day. The rest of the book is a lot of jumping around in time and space and a lot of decidely odd, but not necessarily funny names to deal with. All the characters are back but rarely together at one time. Zaphod completely disappears for dozens of page, Ford has become belligerent and annoying and after 3 books we still know virtually nothing of Trillian's personality. This book needed more work on character development and funny dialogue than all the cumbersome names."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"life, the universe, and everything is the third book in th Ultimate Hithhickers Guide series. the book staerts off with arthur dent waking up from his cave on prehistoric earth (read the last 2 books too understand why he is here). his long lost friend Ford Prefect comes back after 5 years and tells arthur about his adventures. well apparently, there were some \\"eddies\\" in the space time continueum. they finnally had a chnace to get off at prehistoric earth. the go forward in time, and end up on real earth. these people from krikket attack the earth, and thats when ford and arthur meet up with slartibartfast. they go on his ship, and learn that they, and only they, can save the universe from these terrible kriikit robots. it turns out that the krikkit epople are at the party, and they have to teleport down. instead of arthure geting to the party, he ends up inside a mountain were he meets this creature who he has seemed to kill every time it reincarnates. ironicly, arthur kills him again, and starts to go outside, were he sees the mountain crumbling. on his way down, he trips, falls, and starts flying. he flies further, and is hit in the back bye a huge floating party. he is dragged into the party, anyway, to make a long story short. they end up saving the world from krikkit robots, and the story leaves off with arthur spending his spare time flying around and learning to speak bird."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Authur Dent and his alien companion Henry Ford are stuck on prehistoric earth.

Arthur comes across best in this one, but it ends once again with the gang dropping him off. Don't try it. It's not healthy."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Perhaps it was the fact that there was a real plot to this story: trying to save the universe from a bunch of singing idiots. Or maybe, after writing the first two Douglas Adams simply went dry. The highlight of this book is Arthur learning to fly."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I read the trilogy 20 years ago in high school and I remember thinking they were the funniest books I had ever read. Now that I'm 36 I decided to pick them up again for a good read. Either I must be getting old or I have lost my sense of humor (and I love good British humor). The first book is pretty good, it had some good laugh out loud moments. The 2nd book is where it started losing me. Mr. Adams writing style got to be a little irritating. He would end a chapter and start a new chapter that had nothing to do with the previous chapter and you would have no idea what he's talking about, but it would take a few pages to tie into the \\"sort-of\\" plot he has going. I found that to be a little annoying. By the 3rd book I was about ready to tear my hair out in sheer frustration with the story. I didn't really find it very funny and the plot started to get even more convuluted. The 4th book of the \\"trilogy\\" (now that's funny) I found to be a little more interesting but still not all that funny.That being said, I am really looking forward to the movie. The trailers make it look to be quite a humorous ride."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This book is so cool and it is one of the best of the trilogy. The only book that is better is the first book of the trilogy. Adams did a good job of using random events to make up a story that is really funny.The book is about an alien race called the Krikkits. The planet Krikkit maintains itself within a dust cloud. Krikkit's sun is the only visible thing in the sky. You are not able to see any other thing from within the dust cloud. The people of Krikkit had never thought of &quot;What was out there,&quot; because they already knew that there wasn't anything.One day, a spaceship crashes onto Krikkit and the people of Krikkit decide to see whats out there. They find out that what they thought before was wrong as they saw trillions of stars when they exited the dust cloud in one of their homemade spaceships. They saw it and they automatically became homicidal xenophobes. Their new mission was to destroy every other thing in the known universe. While our heroes are the only thing that can stop them.I give Life, the Universe and Everything *Falls off the Empire State Building and suddenly sees a big floating five and starts to fly* FIVE STARS!!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Anyone who has followed the Hitchhiker's series this far, understands the trade-off Adams made to write these books. They are hilarious, imaginatively diverse, and exceedingly satirical; but to be all that, Adams also had to sacrifice seriousness and some aspects of morality. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and its successor The Restaurant at the End of the Universe both exhibited Adams' command of this trade-off, and therefore provided astounding novels to the relatively specific, if underdeveloped, genre of sci-fi/comedy. Life, the Universe and Everything, however, tries to live up to these same expectations, but fails for many reasons.First off, and most apparent, the third offering in the five-part trilogy is not nearly as funny. A lot of the situations seemed contrived; not to mention some species and characters that didn't possess the idiosyncratic charm that the first two possess. The plot, admittedly, is more epic and complicated than the other novels, and for this reason Adams deserves much applause; unfortunately, it is never developed to a satisfactory extent. I would have gladly settled for a simpler story, if it were presented more coherently and with more insight into a decidedly abrupt climax.Ultimately, this novel feels as though it was written, if not by a completely different writer, then at least in a completely different setting. Down to the most minute of characteristics--maybe it's the witty banter of its predecessors, or the eccentric commentary of the Hitchhiker's Guide--Life, the Universe and Everything does not live up to the example set by novels one and two. Adams seems to have approached the topic with greater gravity, as though he loved the previous books and characters so much, that he was determined to one up them with all his skill. And because of this, rather than succeed at the task, the whole book becomes so much more serious. One wonders what would have happened if Adams hadn't been as omnipotent in the preparation of this novel; would Life, the Universe and Everything match the tone and success of the original two?And so after reading Life, the Universe and Everything, one sees how Adams ignored the pact that made a divisive chasm between humor/imagination/satire and serious art. He tried to bridge the gap, and in the end it failed. At this time, I look forward to the fourth book in the series, but I pray that Adams assumes his original approach to the Hitchhiker's Guide, or I may never make it to the fifth. Certainly, the first and second novels in the series were worth all of the applause attributed to them. I can only hope that Life, the Universe and Everything is the outlier in the series."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"The Kricket Planet have been locked up for years trying to get the three pillars and the Golden Bail so they can have the key. Once they get out they plan to destroy everything that is not Kricket. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect set out to relieve the Universe of this disaster. Along the way they run into some former past and a dangourous enemy. I personnaly would not reccomend this book. The book was slow and hard to follow, though as I read through it, it got better. I just wish that it would explain more of what happened and that the story would be a little bit more adventurous."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Having laughed my way through the first two books, it was with the oxygen bottle and tissues that I entered the third Hitch Hikers' book, \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\". I would not agree that it has lost some focus, but it certainly has shifted it to more fundamental aspects of life we hold dear, such as cricket.In some ways, this volume delves into a somewhat darker side of Adams' imagination, or at least makes it more obvious and clearly visible. This dark side also achieves new heights in sheer weirdness, which is sometimes genius, but sometimes merely silly. For instance, Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged has a magical sense of timing in his quest to insult a universe that he no longer finds any joy in. His response to those who questioned his quest's technical feasability: \\"A man can dream, can't he?\\" I love the guy! However, this is counter-balanced by some pretty silly stuff, too. At the end of it, even the silly stuff is just plain old fun: pointless, stupid, and really silly, which is everything fun should be.At times, the book does fall into the danger of repeating itself at times, or repeating sections of information again. While not a very common thing, it happens enough to be noticeable. If I can notice it, most people would probably see it like a 300m neon sign advertising McDonalds in Bombay.Overall, in this book Adams turns his comic eye to more fundamental issues of life, I think. This he started in the second book, \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\", but it really hits top speed in \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\". Issues such as reincarntion and coincidence come up, (remember those petunias that thought, \\"Oh no, not again\\"?). Also the way we see our world around us is also poked and prodded via the people of Krikit and their unique response to the wider universe. I really think this book delves a bit deeper than the previous two, which has taken awhile to realise.While the book is not painfully funny, it still retains a similar humour that is distinctly Adams. In some parts, it may seem a bit out there, but it is also truly broad in its scope, (from reincarnation to bistro billing is pretty wide in range).I liked the book a lot, but I cannot say that I loved it like the other two. That said, it is certainly an enjoyable book and a view of a deeper Adams. It is well worth the read. Though, I didn't need that oxygen bottle."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe and Everything, book 3 in the hitchhikers trilogy (which actually has FIVE books)was quite different than the first two. While the first books had lighthearted yet well developed plots, the plot in LUE (Life the Universe and Everything)was darker, less well developed and very unorigonal (I mean come on, saving the universe is so passe). I was also very disappointed with the humor. While it had its moments, LUE had fewer humorous portions and most of the humor seemed very out of context and had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also very anti-climactic, not having a cliffhanger like the previous boooks. Overall it is a dissapointment compared to the rest of the series but is neccessary to read to get the whole plot of the series. I recommend it to only those who are going to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"if you've ever wondered what it would be like to be a lemon, or how to fly, or how to make a mountain invisible by painting it pink and putting a sign on it that says &quot;someone elses problem&quot; than you HAVE to read this book. my favorite book in the five book trilogy, it has the adams tough and a large glubbering matress."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"All who have read the original Guide the following series must admit that Life, the Universe and Everything rivals the great HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy. If you enjoyed the zany fun of the Guide you will find it hard to keep away from this book."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Adams continues his thought-provoking laugh-fest in this third book of the five-book Hitchhiker's series. This book addresses, well...life, the universe, and everything. It is filled with the same colorful characters, scarcastic (but witty) English humor, and subtle analysis of human life that he began in the first book. Reading Adams' work has done me an immeasureable amount of good, and I strongly encourage others to read this series. It is one of the few pieces of literature on the market that truly allows the reader to laugh and really _think_ at the same time."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Amazing! Adams does it again in his third novel! Arthur and Ford are stuck in Earth's past! Zaphod and Trillian are running scared!

The 3rd of his 5-book saga about Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillian and Marvin is superb. TONS of laughs. I whole heartedly recommend this and all of the other books in the Hitchhiker's series"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This book was a rather entertaining book by its principals and characters alone. It's about these ignorant people on their little secluded planet called Krikkit who don't know if anything else is out there. Eventually a ship crashes and arises the curiosity to see what is going on out there. They finally see and the result isn't to their liking so they plan to destroy it... all of it. But best of all, it isn't going to take a super hero to stop these evil plans, as the main characters who have beef with the universe ARE MORONS!! I'm not much of a reader so I wasn't able to relate it to any other books I've read. For the most part though, I thought this book was hilarious. Some of the crazy ideas and actions and even the thought process behind the characters is just wacky. It just seems like Adams sat around thinking of another way to make this whole story crazier and even more out of whack than ever seen before. The brilliance in his 'irrational' ways make this quite the ride for the reader. If you like crazy little things that collaborate and come together to make one blob of a plot that somehow, to someone, makes sense, this is the amusement you've been looking for. If stupid or crazy humor isn't to your liking, this book isn't recommended. Else, this one is in the cart, right?? Look up there, and click the 'ADD THIS TO SHOPPING CART' button at the top right."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Of all of the hitchhiking books, I thought that Life, the Universe, and Everything was the worst of them. I can say that it was fairly entertaining, but it was definitely not the best book in the world. I enjoyed Douglas Adams's other books much more than I did this one. This book lacked plot, theme, and revolved around random comments and jokes (that were not very funny). In the other books before it the jokes were much more funny, and fit into the story line better. I am somewhat disappointed in this third book in the marvelous series: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"In my opinion, the third installment of the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy is the most well-rounded of them all. It is perhaps the most outright hilarious of the five novels, and actually has a very entertaining plot. While some elements are connected to previous novels (most notably Slartibartfast and Ford and Arthur's exile on prehistoric Earth), the book can basically stand on its own, something I couldn't necessarily say about the first two.Agrajag is one of my favorite parts of the entire novel, as is Arthur's learning how to fly. Unfortunately, there is very little of Marvin, which is particularly depressing seeing as how he's only in the last chapter of the fourth book and entirely absent from the fifth). Basically, what we have here is all the zaniness of the earlier books without the aimlessness.I feel that this book had an ending satisfying enough to complete the &quot;Trilogy,&quot; and am curious as to why Douglas continued the series. However, I'm glad he did, because the final two books are my favorite. Still, if you want to capture what I feel is the quintessential essence of Adams, then this is the quintessential chapter in the Hitchhiker's Saga. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This is the third book from the famous 'trilogy' (actually consisting of five books) written by his high majesty - Mr. Douglas Adams. Quite an interesting read after all, with no similarities to other famous books. The writing style of Douglas Adams is something that has been (and surely will be) one of the most popular topics when people sit around the table. There are numerous famous citations from his books that act (and will surely act) like pieces of wisdom for rebellios generations. Here is one of my favourites: 'Sounds bad. With little more of luck I hope I will be drunk enough, so that I don't notice it.'This book is somehow innovative from the previous two, mainly due to the fact that it has a plot and after finishing it you have a story in your head, unlike after reading previous two. Is this bad or good - everyone decides for himself. I like it. The story is about our guys Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent, Zaphod Beeblebrox and the girl Trillian being lead on a mission by the old man Slartibartfast to save the Universe from being distinguished by the people of Krikkit who are as funny as well as every other character in the book (including the thunder god from the Scandinavian mythology - Thor). You will get an alternative look to the popular english sport game cricket after you finish the book.There are a lot of funny tales that are not directly connected to the main story but add additional absurd humour that sometimes made me laugh histerically while reading. One of my favourite was about Zaphod getting drunk on his ship and Trillian leaving him, as well as the one about the poet Lallafa and his famous poems that after time travelling was discovered were used for marketing purposes and that changed the past so that these poems had never been written. And not to forget Wowbagger who insists on insulting every living creature personally.I had great fun while reading this book and am quite enthusiastic to read the forth and fifth part of the 'trilogy'. Douglas Adams proved once again to me that he is unique and his stories are unpredictable."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I have no idea why no one seems to give this book good reviews! It is uber funny, just as much as the first two. I liked the exclusive terms for the actions of matresses and the whole Agrajag thing, which was honestly the funniest thing I have ever read! As for the Krikkit peoples, this line is one of Adam's most memorable, besides the number 42: &quot;It's got to go.&quot; Also, I have established Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged as an all time favorite literary personality, because, well, seriously people, his dream is to insult the universe! Original. Personally, I don't see what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This is my third hitchhiking trip, and although my thumb is getting sore, I have no choice but to keep on truckin'.Coming from the larger part of the world, where \\"krikkit\\" is a national obsession, I found this one particularly clever, even though the aficionados will shudder at the abuse of the hallowed ashes.Always willing to throw a stinging barb here and there, I also loved the immortal Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, who is on a quest to personally insult every individual being in the Universe - in alphabetical order.Add in the flying lessons, the many-times-reincarnated Agrajag (not an Arthur Dent fan by any means), and of course my favorite robot Marvin, and you have an easy reading fun hike across the galaxy, with less of the sci-fi stuff, and more of the humor.There's less Zaphod Beeblebrox than usual, but as he spends most of this story in a drunken stupor while Trillian flirts with the God of Thunder, we won't bother him at this particular time.Sticking my sore thumb out now for the next adventure in hitchhiking - see you there!Amanda Richards, March 12, 2005"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"It is some time after the second in this great sci-fi/comedy series. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are marooned on Earth during the caveman times. It seems they will die in this time period, but this suits them. But suddenly there appears a travelling couch that whisks them away to save the Universe from an evil race of aliens bent on universal destruction. While the first two books are excellent comedy gems, they consist of no real plot. This book does, and also maintains the deadpan humor and absurd realities. It's barrells of fun and a great, quick read. When the book needs to be suspensful, it is. When it needs to be funny, it's hilarious. This is Douglas Adams' very best work and this book is the best in the series."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"With the exception of &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; this is, in my opinion, Adams' most talented work. The story is amazing, but definitely not for skeptical readers. To fully appreciate his books you should not be asking questions such as &quot;What does an italian restaurant have to do with mathematics?&quot; In short: a great book for those who do not think long and hard about every event in the tale."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"After being marooned on prehistoric Earth for several years, Arthur Dent and his alien chum Ford Prefect are rescued by the sudden appearance of a runaway sofa, which transports them millions of years into the future to a cricket game in England, a mere days before the Earth is due to be demolished by the evil Vogons. From here, the duo are reunited with their old friend Slartibartfast (from the first book), with whom they must embark on a mission to save the Universe. And yes, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian, and Marvin the paranoid android all have roles to play, too.... Book 3 in Douglas Adams' &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; series, &quot;Life, The Universe, And Everything,&quot; is certainly an amusing, occasionally hilarious entry in the zany intergalactic adventures of Arthur Dent and friends. Unfortunately, it falls short in comparison to the briliantly funny pair of books, &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; and &quot;The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe,&quot; that preceded it. This may be because Books 1 &amp; 2 were adapted from Adams' hilarious BBC radio play that started the whole &quot;Hitchhikers&quot; saga, while &quot;Life&quot; is a &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; work that's not based on any previous material. Therefore, Adams' writing style for &quot;Life&quot; feels very different from the first two books, and doesn't flow as well. It's still funny, it's just not AS funny. The jokes are more fragmented, and Adams breaks apart *many* of the sentences that the characters speak in Book 3, which gets tiresome after awhile (ex: &quot;The difficulty with this conversation,&quot; said Arthur, after a sort of ponderous look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, &quot;is that it's very different from most of the ones I've had of late.&quot;). Therefore, some of the jokes miss the mark. Also, there's less excerpts from the Hitchhiker's Guide book itself, so often quoted in the first two books, so that's missed as well.And yet, &quot;Life, The Universe, And Everything&quot; still has some great comic moments, such as Zaphod Beeblebrox's drinking binge, Arthur's encounter with the creature Agrajag, the chapter on how to play Brockian Ultra Krikkit, and a pretty outrageous dinner party in space that Arthur &amp; the gang crash. Overall, &quot;Life, The Universe And Everything&quot; is a decent entry in the &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; saga, and it's funny enough for me to give it a passing grade. Thankfully, though, Douglas Adams gets things right back on track with the brilliant fourth book, &quot;So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish&quot;...."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe, and Everything is rather different from the preceding two books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy. It's quite funny, particularly in a few rather memorable sections, but it is not consistently funny from beginning to end. Parts of it were so unspectacular that I barely remembered what I had just read, and one aspect of the concluding scenario is still rather incomprehensible to me, a case of deus ex machina I just can't place in the context of the whole story. All of our favorite characters are back: Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian, Marvin the woefully depressed android, and even Slartibartfast; unfortunately, they are rarely together, and I sometimes lost track of Zaphod in particular after reading a number of chapters that ignored him entirely. Much of the action is also rather contrived, such as the sudden appearance of a couch on prehistoric earth upon which Arthur and Ford travel forward in time to the last two days of earth's existence. On several occasions, characters seemed to zap to another place and time by no discernible means. The game of cricket is particularly important here, to the point that I really wish I understood what the sport is all about, but I admit it was a clever plot device to tie the sport to a particularly nasty, universe-threatening planet ten billion years in the past. The planet of Krikkit, you see, set out to destroy the rest of the universe because its people basically just wanted to be left alone. Throughout the novel white Krikkit robots appear out of nowhere to seize special items needed to unlock their planet from the Slo-Time envelope established around it at the end of the Krikkit Wars. This is a bad thing because the people of Krikkit still want nothing more than to destroy the entire universe. In a rather murky way, Arthur Dent is called upon to save the universe, and that is also not a particularly good thing.There are a few highlights to the story. The subplot involving Agrajag is particularly good. In the course of Arthur Dent's journeys through space and time, he has been responsible for the deaths of a great number of creatures-insects, flies, at least one rabbit, etc. Quite coincidently, as Arthur tries to argue, every single one of these creatures was Agrajag in his multiple reincarnated forms. Naturally, a body develops a hatred for the brute who keeps killing it time and time again, but Agrajag has gone so far as to build a veritable shrine to the entity he hates most in the cosmos, complete with a gigantic statue of Arthur Dent simultaneously killing him in a great number of his past life forms. I also particularly enjoy Adams' take on learning to fly; it takes a special knack, one which consists basically of throwing yourself to the ground and missing-the easily distracted Arthur Dent is a natural at it.Overall, the plot just meanders too much to suit me. Transitions of characters from one time and place to another make very little sense, major characters are abandoned for too long at a time, and the plot is not laid out neatly enough for it all to make sense to me. On the whole, much less seems to happen in this book than often happened over the course of a few chapters in the first two books of the trilogy. This is still an entertaining read, but even the comedy lacks some of the satirical and witty zest that typified Adams' earlier successes."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"So far I have read the first 4 books, and they have many many problems with words missing, wrong, bad formatting, etc. It looks like they scanned the documents in with some character recognition software and then didn't proofread it (or even run a spell-check). I would like to know if I can get a free update if/when the publisher releases a corrected copy? First-time readers will be very disappointed. I know the books well enough that I (almost) always knew what the words were supposed to be, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Though many criticize this book for not being as strong as the first two, this is an excellent book. For starters, this book has some of the most memorable moments of the entire trilogy: Agrajag(a brilliant idea to have, absolutely hilarious), Arthur learning to fly(another wonderfully hilarious idea to have flying actually just \\"Falling and missing the ground\\"), Marvin's conversation with Zem, Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged's quest, and Slartibartifast's new ship. The novel shows some of the character's personalities very well and develops them further(particularly the poor, neglected Trillian). Ford is wonderfully displayed by showing that he doesn't care about saving the universe when he can attend a party. Zaphod's drinking habits was a very nice little section. Marvin's unhappiness was further displayed by showing it infecting an entire army of robots. Arthur is still as dumbfounded by everything as ever, but at least shows some guts and sensibility. And I've always been a big Slartibartfast fan, and thought it was nice to see him back. I particularly likes his dialogue in this novel, where he will begin a very short sentence and after a large amount of description he will finish it. His \\"Bistromathic\\" ship was a funny idea also. The book adds well to the series and provides the major events for the next books(So Long, thanks for All the Fish = God's Last Words; Mostly Harmless = Arthur, Ford, and Trillian's final resting place). It's an excellent read and rests well in my heart because it was the first book in the 5-part trilogy that I ever read(I didn't understand much of it, but loved it anyway). And I believe this is the only Adams novel that a character from another SERIES of his novels comes into play(The Thunder God in this may very well be Thor from \\"The Long, Dark Tea-time of the Soul,\\" which also got its title from this book!)"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"And it's a real shame given the potential of the first two books, which are both fun, quick reads. As the featured review states, this title is less focused on the sci-fi and philosophical underpinnings of the first two books. Instead, Adams here maintains sequences that hinge on bizarre chains of events and silly, ponderous exchanges between characters who have less and less of an idea as to what exactly is happening around them. These felt a long 200+ pages indeed.The bon mots and clever passages are fewer and further between than the previous two installments. In fact, much of this book is rather uninspired and infuriating... the Krikkit robots, the Bistromathematics, the reincarnations of the hapless multiple-murder victim Agrajag, none of the set pieces gave me more than a brief chuckle. Much of what aims to pass for characteristic Adams whimsy feels perfunctory, and the string of coincidences that form the crux of the plot are truly slapdash.The highlights for me here are Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged's perpetual misanthropy and what amounts to the only real meat of the book--the story of the reason why the ultimate question and answer of the universe are (putatively) mutually exclusive. Thus leading to \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\\". But nothing here matches the humor of, for instance, the truly inspired chapter containing the Hitchhiker's Guide's entry on The Universe in \\"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\".When Adams is working with less inspired ideas, his inability to write characters as anything but vehicles for punchlines and guttural confusions is trying. Vonnegut, while a weak painter of convincing personalities, instills a sense of humanity and pathos in the proceedings that eludes Adams. Some sense of feeling and sympathy, perhaps, plays foil to the general absurdity of exposition and content in Vonnegut. This is why he's a better read if you're comparing the two as I feel prone to do, and one of several reasons I'm not too concerned with making it through the fourth and final book in this series."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"In this book, the charachters are here, there and everywhere, frantically zapping back and forth in time and space,and yet the book appears to proceed in a much more sluggish(must we say squornshellous?)way. Still the book has its good moments, the Agrajag diversion, the \\"Bistromatic\\" departure, the Krikkit night, and the all too true-to-life story of \\"The Reason\\" (or the way to deceive people whit apparently sound but really senseless phrases).But trying to squeeze \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" in a single novel has not resulted in a very coherent story. The effect is uneven, like in the Squornshellous episode, when the evocative description gives way to a seemingly Infinitely Prolonged linguistic tour-de force that at the end gets tiresome. Oh,well,the satire is there, and so the delicious absurdity of the exchanges between Ford and Arthur.I would ive it Three and a half."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe and Everything (LTUAE) is a great book for people (or aliens) of all ages.

LTUAE is a very funny book that will make you keep reading, and reading, and reading . . .In my opinion every book I've read by Adams Has failed to let me down. They are all very funny. The only bad thing about LTUAE is that it is hard to follow and anything can happen in a minute, so i do not recomend this book if you like to speed read."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"It's been a pleasure once again to read about the adventures of the always ignorant Arthur Dent, party-seeker Ford Prefect and universally cool guy Zaphod Beeblebrox.This part provides a nice mix of interstellar adventures, English cricket (not to be confused with the destructively peaceful people of Krikkit), random verbal abuse and an excellent floating party.Douglas Adams provides to be still witty and entertaining. I'm glad this is not the end of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"The first two books in the Hitchhiker Trilogy are among the funniest, most entertaining books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. This, the third, is also enjoyable along those lines but not as good. Certainly it has its share of funny moments and clever writing, but it's not up to the level of the first two books (especially The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, still the funniest book I have EVER read.) Thankfully, the follow-up -- So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish -- is back up to the stellar level of the first two books. All in all, this is a good and entertaining book but slightly slow at times and perhaps a bit overlong. You'll have to read it after reading the first two, and you'll enjoy it, but don't expect a classic."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This is the second in the Hitchhiker trilogy. Having already the 3rd back in June, this cleared up a couple of burning questions such as 'How did Arthur Dent learn how to fly?&quot;. As always, Adams is truly entertaining in his narration, weaving of unlikely events into a cohesive story line, and cheeky turn of a phrase. Now, I'm hunting for the first of the three to properly finish the trilogy in a sequence Adams would appreciate."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This was the third book in the trilogy, and it lived up to the expectations placed upon it from the previous books. Some of the concepts (Cricket for instance) may be lost on an American audience, but make it funnier for other audiences. A great read."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Brilliant. Witty. Biting. Absolutely Hilarious. The Hitchhiker series is not to be missed; they are the funniest collection of books ever written. I don't think I could decide which one in the series is best, as they're all great. I'm not much for fiction, but I couldn't put these books down. Buy them all!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"All in all I enjoyed this book. Like Adams other works it's as off-the-wall and funny as anything else. Indeed, the core of Adams works are the hilarious little asides that seemingly go nowhere and yet find there way into an integral part of the story in later chapters. If anything the only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that this novel had a plot."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Douglas Adams' out-of-this-world characters and mind-blowing plot twists make this one of the most hilariously side-splitting sci-fi novels I've read."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This is a very good book but it did not live up to the standards of the two that came before it. It is a good way to end an excellent series."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I thought this one fell seriously short of the othes. Very sad considering the other books that Douglas has written"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, The Universe And Everything is just an ok book. It just didn't grab my attention and hold it. Anyways the book is basically about 5 individuals that go out to save the universe from killer white robots that plan to destroy it. the 5 individuals are Zaphod Beeblebrox a two headed alien, Trillian a space cadet, Arthur Dent a time traveler, Ford Perfect his friend, and Slartibartfast the vice president of the Campaign for real time. The thing i don't like about this book is it jumps around a lot and you sometimes can't tell if they traveled in time unless you read the reread the same lines to get an understanding."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"When I was in elementary school, this was a common series read by the male nerds and geeks in my school. After reading it, I can now see how much it shaped their speech patterns and writing styles. I found myself smiling as clouds of nostalgia unexpectedly overtook me while reading the series. I was also surprised to find phrases original to this series that have worked their way into the American culture. For example, in order to understand people who speak other languages, the characters in this series simply put a \\"Babelfish\\" in their ear. In real life, Babel Fish is a language translation program available on the internet. Since the book it appears in was published in 1979, there's no question of which came first.LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERYTHINGIf the answer to the life, the universe, and everything is \\"42\\", what is the question? Unfortunately, the trilogy ends without an answer. In fact, I was glad the trilogy had ended once I finished this book because, frankly, nothing much happened in the last book of the trilogy. The only thing of much significance is that Arthur is threatened assasination by a creature that is killed by Arthur upon each reincarnation (as a flea, rabbit, petunia, ant, ant, ant, etc.). Oh yeah, Arthur learns how to fly (by missing the ground) and finds a flying perpetual party that's been going on for generations.This series is bizarre comic sarcasm at its best. A smile automatically paints itself on your face as you begin to read. The series reads like a highly improbable dream sequence. I sort of wonder if the author had any conclusion in mind when he wrote it or if he just let the story write itself (not unlike a dream). This third book in the \\"trilogy\\" seems to meander along in the beginning with no purpose. I thought that perhaps Douglas Adams wrote such a boring third book so that no one would ask him to write a fourth one with the same characters. Then I discovered that this \\"trilogy\\" actually has five books in it. His books always pick up a little in the end."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"For those of you wondering, Adams' method of writing is this: take the most absurd and irreverend random notions as well as strange stories that lead nowhere and throw them together with oddjob plots that makes you wonder what on earth the point of this whole trip was in the first place, vomit them forth with obnoxious cynical insanity and refuse to apologize along the way. The meaning of life is (Spoilers). Flying is just the art of throwing yourself at the ground and missing. The most efficient form of fuel in the universe is the illogic contained within The mathematics of an Italian restaurant. Huh? Exactly. This is the third book in the five part Hitchhikers' \\"trilogy\\", and anyone who read the first two books will notice a big difference between this book and those. The difference is, more or less, the first two books didn't have much of a plot, and were just the random exploits of a confused Englishman hitchiking through the galaxy. This one actually attempts to have a plot, which is its main downfall. But dont let that stand in your way: all of the hitchhiker books are about unabashed insanity, and the author makes no quams about it. So if your worried that it doesn't make sense, its not supposed to. The universe is, after all, infinitely improbable."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I thought that even though I love this series, this wasn't my favorite of the books. A lot happened that was similar to the other two books which is kind of upsetting. The guys are in trouble, you think they're going to die, Arthur gets hysterical and pessimistic aaaand then they're okay. In the next chapter the same thing. DOn't get me wrong, I think it's hilarious and I constantly find myself laughing out loud but it was a little lacking in any real plot. I guess while reading the first two, I was excited for this would actually take them, and it's not taking them anywhere so I must accept that it is what it is.. and I can't call it, what it's not."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"&quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; is the third book in the five-book series, and it feels that away. It is not quite as great as the first two, but still enough to be good. The puns are great, as Dent and Co. go up against the evil Crikket aliens. Brit-isms abound, and some great moments of humor here, but doesn't get you rolling around in the seats. 42!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Well, I didn't much like this book but then I read the Brititish version and it was much different! And better! Tons of swearing which was changed for Americans is intact! Yay!

There was definitly some funny moments in the three books, but overall I found the humor to be to absurd and abstract to be taken as funny.If you like &quot;Monty Python&quot; material then this book and the first two may be for you. If your like me and you only find &quot;Monty Python&quot; to be moderatly funny, then these books may be something to skip.In summary: I found this third book of the &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; adventures to be like the first two installments - sometimes funny and interesting, but mostly dull and abstract shtick that simply isn't my style.These books aren't bad, they just aren't all that good either. The second book in the series - &quot;Resturaunt&quot; - was the best."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This book was terrible, absolutly terrible, the humor was bad, the story very boring.

I have yet another 20 pages to go with this one, but I'm not expecting anything grand to happen. The lack of effort or failure to create even more abstract views is painfully obvious here. Honestly, I've done nothing but glaze over the pages, and not a single word has caught my eye for more than a millisecond. The only saving grace of this book is where Ford jumps in and out of a gin and tonic - but other than that, this book is a complete bore! The only reason I continue is for clues I might need for the next book in the series, which I allready own.I'm hoping this next one ain't this bad. The reason Douglas got 2 stars is just praise for the first 2 books, which I can't see myself reviewing anytime soon."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Arthur Dent, Ford Perfect, and a few of their--for lack of a better word--friends find themselves in a mission to save the universe from the crazed genocidal world of Kirkkit (homophone intended).

Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"I'm a latecomer to the \\"Hitchhiker's Trilogy\\", and just finished the series. \\"Life, the Universe, and Everything\\" is a bit less funny only because the humour and style is the same as the previous books. And seems to be less \\"meat\\" in this one. Still, in with all the silliness there are comments about war and xenophobia, as well as the reasons for space travel. Considering how many lives and how much money are sacrificed or spent by the human race on these issues, a topical but funny book about them is welcome relief: laughing a bit instead of crying is allowed.I have no idea why they changed the cover. The original cover with an eyeless green monster sticking out its tongue made much more sense."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe, and Everything is one of the best books in the Hitchhiker's Series. However, you must read the 2 previous books in the series in order to understand this book.The story continues on from where the Restaurant at the End of the Universe left off. Arthur Dent is stranded on prehistoric Earth, and is very bored, so he decides to go insane. Just after he announces that, his best friend Ford Prefect suddenly appears and stops him from making this decision. Ford pulls him through an eddy, or time portal to Lord's Cricket Ground 2 days before Earth is to be demolished by the Vogons. During the middle of a cricket game, a group of white robots suddenly appear and steal the Ashes, or the trophy given to the winning cricket team. Luckily, Slartibartfast lets the two hitch a ride with him and help him chase the robots. He tells them about planet Krikkit's history. The Kirkkiters were once peaceful creatures. They thought they were the only beings in the Universe because their sun was blocked by a dust cloud, so the sky remains dark all day long. That is, unitl one day, when a spaceship crash lands on Krikkit. After the residents learn about other races besides themselves, they decide to murder all other races in the Universe.So will the universe end, or will Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and Slartibartfast save the Universe? The answer: hard to say, because remember that things don't always end happily in this series!I recommend this book to everyone who loves comedy or science fiction."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Adams continues to produce laughs here, but this volume begins to repackage material from the first two books. You have the same type of jokes, situations, randomness and plot twists here from the previous books. While those things were hilarious the first time around, they lose some of their impact on the second and third helpings. Fans of the series will enjoy this volume, but I found it to be less satisying than the first two novels in the series. While I've enjoyed the journey so far, this book does not motivate me sufficiently to read the rest of the series. I can only recommend this book if you loved the first two."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Doug Adams could please us in his sleep. The brilliance of the series is in its self-propelling, self-perpetuating idea that time, space, organic life forms, and furniture are one and that the universe is not only infinite, but can be infinitely boring and absorbing at the same time.On this hike, we find Arthur Dent descending into madness induced by solitude and boredom on a prehistoric Earth. Not for long, as Ford Prefect and Slartibartfast soon catch up with him--one with party fever, and the other an itch to save the universe from the curse of the planet Krikkit and its belligerent dwellers. Zaphod, Marvin, and Trillian are all crucial spokes on the wheel rolling to the inevitable, but always fun, climax in the race to save life, the universe, and everything.Adams seens to loosen the reins more and more with each book--which produces lots of smiles and chuckles--but at times, seems to take too many liberties with the space-time continuum. This leads to some rather cacophanous character juxtapositions--such as the exceedingly and strangely somber Slartibartfast and...well, everyone else. But nevermind all that, keep on hitchin'!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This was an amazingly fascinating book that captured my attention. This book is just as great as the first, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys humorous science fiction. This book was definitely a page-turner, because it has such an addictive plot. The plot was unbelievable, but unbelievable in a way that it was awesome. There were many surprises around every corner. An example of this a the constant appearance of a large white ship, filled with white Krikkit robots, preceded by a noise that sounds very much like one thousand people saying \\"whop\\" at the same time. Life, the Universe, and Everything is pure genius and by far one of the most interesting books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Douglas Adams is the greatest writer in the history of literature. That is my opinion and not only am I sticking to it but I believe it to be demonstrably true. So you now know how to contextualise my review.The Hitchicker's Guide To The Galaxy, a trilogy in 5 parts, is not just comedy, just science fiction or indeed just anything else that you will have ever read.If you are unfortunate enough to have seen the film then please dispense with any preconcieved ideas regarding these books. The film was an odd hybrid of Men In Black and Douglas' work.I always wondered how this book would \\"translate\\" into the US market. The humour and the subject matter is often quite distinctly English in nature e.g. Cricket, Campaign For Real Time (Based on the nerdy enthusiasts at CAMERA, the Campaign For Real Ale) not to mention Arthur's inherant Englishness. From many of the reviews here I suspect that many of the subtelties of the plot/ideas are lost much as they might if DNA had been from the US with his books being read by a UK audience.So my advice would be to first read everything Winston Churchill wrote, 5 decent books on cricket (autobiographies rather than fact books), anything by P.G Wodehouse (to get a sense of DNA'd comedic predecesors), read the online version of The Sun newsapaper (to understand where the journalist character came from in book 4)plus watch everything Monty Python have ever made. Inadequate but essential preperation.Then get the 5 book Omnibus and read all five books. The fifth is the only weakness due to DOuglas's being in a rather dark place at the time he wrote it. The other 4 are pure genius. Funny, informative, ironic and occasionally silly but in a very intelligent way.The test of how well you are getting it is to read the biscuit/train station story that Arthur tells to Fenchurch in book 4. If tears are flowing down your face then you have \\"got\\" it. If you think it is a bit silly then you are not sufficiently attuned to the English.Douglas' death is a huge loss to the world of literature and the world in general. He was a voice of sanity in a mad modern world.So long Douglas and thanks for all the fish"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"in the beginning of the book,arthur wakes up in the cave, were he was left off at in the end of *resturant at the end of the universe*. after a long 5 years in the cave, he goes outside once again to a surprise. he sees his long lost friend,Ford Prefect, sitting on a rock. he insists that there is some sort of eddie in the space time continueum, and that they might just have a way off of prehistoric earth. after they go forward in time to the present (or close to it) earth is attacked bye some people from the planet of krikket. well after all this stuff about saving the world, arthur is stranded alone on a planet, meets his worst enemy, and learns to fly. he finnaly meets up with everybody else ford once again, trillian, slartibartfast, and zaphod.in the end of the book, arthure ends up on a planet where he learns to speak bird, flys some more, and just hangs out. this is sort of an alternate ending, but you would hace to read the book to understand. i highly recoment it to anyone interested in Douglas Adams' writing"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Written by Douglas Adams, \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" was first published in 1982 and is the third instalment of his legendary five-part \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" trilogy. It opens around five years after \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" finished, but follows up on what has happened in the previous books - as a result, it's the wrong place to start !! The series started life as a radio show, before becoming a book, a television series, a play and a bath towel. Douglas Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952 and died in May 2001.Recent years haven't been kind to Arthur Dent. Having seen his home flattened by bulldozers, he barely escaped with his life when the Earth was demolished by the Vogons - officially to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur was rescued by Ford Prefect, a roving reporter for \\"The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". The pair were later picked up by an old school-friend of Fords, Zaphod Beeblebrox - the two-headed, three-armed, renegade ex-President of the Galaxy and owner of the most powerful and unpredictable ship in the universe. Having met Slartibartfast, the man who designed Norway, and eaten at the restaurant at the end of the universe, an unprogrammed teleport sees Arthur and Ford landing on...a prehistoric Earth.As the book opens, Arthur has been living alone in a cold, damp, smelly cave for five years. Living alone in what would become Islington roughly two million years later, he hasn't had any company since the surviving Golgafrinchans went on holiday about three years previously. Ford, having spent the last three years in prehistoric Africa, is now responsible for the giraffe and returns just in time to save Arthur from madness. He has detected eddies in the space - time continuum, which he suspects may provide the pair with an escape route. His suspicions are proved correct : the pair catch an over-active Chesterfield sofa which carries them forward through time and deposits them at Lords Cricket Ground - just two days before the Vogons are due to demolish Earth. The arrive just in time to see England defeat Australia in a very important cricket match, a spaceship containing robotic 'cricketers' arriving to kill people and steal the Ashes (the 'trophy' being played for) and Slartibartfast trying to stop them. Slartibartfast kindly agrees to give the duo a lift, meaning they won't have to hitch a ride with the Vogons again. However, he seems to expect them to help him save the universe - a task that involves them discovering that cricket is actually derived from Krikket and that robotic cricketers are generally best avoided. Ford, on the other hand, aims to be exceedingly drunk and would rather visit Eccentrica Gallumbits - a very capable lady of negotiable affections.This is an extremely silly and very easily read book - though it probably does assume a certain awareness of cricket. Hugely enjoyable and definitely recommended - though only after having read the previous two instalments !"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Worth buying if only for the SEP ('someone elses problem') field, the Bistromathic drive and Agrajag - 3 examples of just how freakishly gifted Adams was as a humourist.There is a definite change in tone with this installment of the trilogy as things become a bit more plot based with less emphasis on the guide.This one is right up there with the 1st 2 books."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"This book is the third book in a series of five.

The third novel in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is funny, imaginative and very clever.Arthur Dent is stuck on prehistoric Earth. Every morning he wakes up with a scream as he realizes that he \\"is in the middle of Islington, and there is no train due for 10000 years.\\" Just as he decides to go mad, Ford Prefect arrives, and tells him of his adventures in Africa. Arthur, who had just sworn to go mad, is in luck, because a few minutes later he is chasing a couch around prehistoric Earth, and then, suddenly, winds up in the middle of a cricket match. As the story progresses, old characters return, like Slartibartfast from the first novel.Slartibartfast explains that Arthur must help save the universe from the \\"ancient horror\\" that is the Krikkit battle fleet, which had been locked in infinitely slow time for the past 2 billion years and is now back, looking to exterminate all differing life from the galaxy. In Life, the Universe and Everything, Arthur learns to fly, gets in a fist fight with a thunder god, meets the individual that he had been accidently killing all his life, travels to the planet Krikkit, gets insulted, blown up, and all sorts of other crazy and laughable events.Douglas Adams is, as always, clever and very witty. While his humor may not be laugh out loud funny, its a very pleasant, ironic humor. Adams style of writing is blunt and easy to understand and makes for a good, albiet short, read. Without a doubt, this book is one of the top two in the Hitchhiker's series, beaten by, perhaps, only the first novel. This clever, imaginative satire should definitely be part of everybody's reading list."},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Life, the Universe and Everything, by Douglas Adams, is a story of unmatched proportions, tying in satirical humor with an amazingly complex storyline. The people of Krikkit have been looking at the same features every night in the sky, and are sick of it, simply because there are no features. Krikkit is located inside a dust cloud, and when a mysterious spaceship crash lands on the planet, it puts the people in a sense of panic. They find out there are things out there, and don't like it, they enjoyed their solidarity. It is now that they must destroy the entire universe, and regain that piece of mind.It is Arthur Dent's job to make sure that none of this happens. Arthur is a human who was rescued from earth, just as it was about to be blown up by blood thirsty mongrels, named Vogons, to make way for a hyper space bypass. Along to help Arthur is the man who rescued him, Ford Prefect, Tricia McMillan (Trillian), the ex-president of the galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox, and a handy man from a planet factory, Slartibartfast.In this story, the 3rd in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series, it starts out on prehistoric earth, and through the marvels of time travel, Arthur Dent is teetering on the edge of insanity, while living in a cave where his house will be located in another couple billion years. In the mean time, Ford Prefect has decided to resort to animal cruelty in Africa, until he decides that it is time to try to find a way back to their time. Along the way they meet up with Slartibartfast, who tells them of the pending problem. The people from the land of Krikkit are about to escape from a \\"Slow Time Envelope\\", which is supposed to only open when all other life in the universe has disappeared. It is now their job to try to keep the inhabitants of Krikkit from attacking the galaxy, and restore peaceful life to all of the people of the universe. Can Arthur do it?

We begin finding Arthur and Ford separated from Zaphod and Trillian. This foursome is a big part of the comedy in the first two books, so their separation leaves one without some hoped-for humor. Then we find Arthur and Ford separated on prehistoric earth for a number of years. This giant time lapse takes the reader out the normal, regular interaction with the characters that you're used to for no explained reason. It's seems that their lives suddenly get boring for a few years, then pick up again. This tempo change was distracting for me.With these negatives out of the way, much praise still has to given. Maybe it seems like I've criticized the book to be worse than my 4 star rating, but the shortcomings are vastly outweighed. The whole planet Krikkit plot is very intriguing: the slow time envelope, the seemingly unrelated cricket game on earth, the small bomb, and Slartibartfast's help. Adams contributes the expected doses of satire and irrational twists to this book, giving it the same funny and unique signature as the first two books. I've read this book a number of times. It's a quick read, just like the others in the series-go for it, it's fun!"},{"Title":"Life, the Universe and Everything","review":"Douglas Adams has done it again.

Author Mike Weiss' book is one of the few that ticks down the seconds to the double killing and, though no one knew it at the time, to a social uprising that left much of the city in ruin. That Harvey Milk was the city's first openly gay official sparked a fury in the city's dense homosexual population and ignited speculation that White's motive, in part, was his acknowledged anti-gay position. For many, that two men were gunned down for such a hallow reason was perhaps only a small part of the complete story, and Weiss' book mercifully does not blame White's crime solely on homophobia. Instead, we get a picture of a professionally and financially desperate man whose act may have been largely to avenge his not being reinstated to his job after he resigned. San Franciscans literally exploded, however, when what they perceived as an open-and-shut case of murder warranting a death sentence was deemed by a jury to be voluntary manslaughter, and the protests in the city's streets came to be known as the \\"White Night Riots\\" with property damages in the millions. For all practical purposes, the city's nightmare ended with White's suicide after his parole from prison after just six years. This nuts-and-bolts synopsis is greatly detailed by Weiss' vivid reconstruction of the personalities and politics that were on a collision course, and his work emerges as an informative commentary on a major event in the city's rich history. Additionally, while there have been some books written about both Moscone and Milk, few (if any) have been done about their killer.

The work is divided into four periods which have become standard designations: from the Ascension of Jesus to Gregory the Great, \\"creative beginnings,\\" (30-590); from Gregory the Great to Gregory VII, \\"expansion under Franco-German preeminence,\\" (590-1073); from Gregory VII to the Council of Trent, \\"luxuriant growth,\\" (1073-1545); and from Trent to Vatican II, \\"unification and regulation,\\" (1545-1963). Each period is introduced with a concise summary followed by Dr. Klauser's discussion. Four appendices are included and the translator has added a page of citations to supplement the 57-page bibliography.Of particular interest to the reader, Dr. Klauser does not hesitate to point out misdirections the Church has taken such as development of the cult of the sacrament playing out \\"the misuse of the mass as a devotional exercise in front of the monstrance\\" (p.139). In another example he discusses the shocking revisions to the liturgy brought about by Vatican II (p.153-159). In all, an easy (although scholarly) and informing read, laced with history and enlightening asides."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Philosophy","review":"I have been teaching intro to philosophy for five years, and Maritain's book is the best I have ever seen. In the first four chapters, Maritain lays out the development of philosophical thought from various schools of thought around the world in ancient time, through the pre-Socratics and through Aristotle. Then in the next four chapters he shows what philosophy is, how it is related to the special sciences, to theology, and to common sense. That is all part one of the book. In part two of the book, he examines and explains each of the main divisions of philosophy inluding: logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of nature, epistemology, ontology (to which he devotes four chapters), and the philosopy of art (i.e. ethics).The chapter on the relation between philosophy and the special sciences (i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) is by itself worth the price of the book. Maritain does an excellent job showing that philosophy (per se, not de facto) is a science, and that by its very nature, the science of philosophy should govern the special sciences. Maritain here provides the antidote to the 'scientism' that is so prevalent in academia. Here we learn why ontology is not at the mercy of the special sciences, and thus why we need not be reductionists, physicalists, or eliminativists. This was standard fare many years ago, but has largely been lost in the aftermath of positivism. Ironically, if I had to pick any one book that I think would be most helpful to the Western philosophical community, it would be Maritain's _An Introduction to Philosophy_. So many of the debates in contemporary philosophy are founded on errors that are pointed out in this intro book."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Philosophy","review":"In November 2005 Sheed and Ward reprinted Jacques Maritain's An Introduction to Philosophy. This primer, which Maritain first published in 1931, is a bit different from standard introductions to philosophical thought such as Will Durant's Story of Philosophy, Bryan Magee's Story of Philosophy, or Frederick Coppleston's exhaustive multivolume History of Philosophy. Maritain's focus is to explicate a particular view of the endeavor of philosophy and to point out the cornerstones of his thought.To start with, Maritain is a Thomist, following in the intellectual traditions of St. Thomas Aquinas, who in turn draws upon Aristotle. Maritain's approach in this book is to first trace this history of philosophy up to Aristotle. For this, he posits primitive traditions, discernable from both theology and a reasonable induction from historical evidence, which contain wisdom that is common to all mankind globally. He seeks remnants of these traditions in pre-Greek Indo-European civilizations: Persian, Indian, and Chinese. After surveying these, he proceeds to Greek thought: the pre-Socratics, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, and finally Aristotle. Maritain sees the ancient Persian, Indian, Chinese, and pre-Socratic Greeks as derived from healthy primitive traditions (although in corrupted form). The work of philosophy, in part, is to recover the ancient wisdom and ground it in a system of reason and dialectic.Upon stating in brief form what he sees as Aristotle's achievements are, Maritain changes his method. He does not follow, as most historical texts would, with a discussion of late antiquity and modern philosophers. For example, do not get a sketch of Descartes in historical context. Rather, Maritain discusses the structure of philosophy as a body of knowledge. That structure is itself determined by Thomist philosophy. Maritain discusses the boundaries of philosophy -- how it is distinct from the empirical sciences, for example, and how it relates to them. He contrasts the Thomist view on philosophy with alternatives in modernity. He then gives an account of the fields of philosophy:I. Logic (a sort of preamble to philosophy proper)II. Theoretical philosophy (speculative, related to understanding of the world)---1. Philosophy of mathematics and nature---2. Epistemology---3. Ontology and metaphysics---4. Natural theologyIII. Practical philosophy (related to human action)---1. Philosophy of art and technology---2. EthicsWalking through these fields (philosophical categories which themselves follow from his Thomism), Maritain points out both the Thomist and Aristotelian positions, and the modernist positions, which are usually contradictory extremes which the Aristotelian mean reconciles.It's a very rigorous and systematic book with a good deal of common sense. It explains a lot of Thomism in a very detailed way and makes an excellent reference for those looking to understand this point of view. Thomism can be a bit dry. Maritain goes a long way to guiding the reader to see motivations and connections. For example, one can struggle Aristotle for years and not find as clear an explication of metaphysical terms such as essence (being inasmuch as it can be understood), substance (being inasmuch as it primarily is), and act and potentiality (being inasmuch as it is the subject of change and motion). For anyone interested in Thomism, this book is a find."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Philosophy","review":"If one needs an introduction to the field of philosophy, they could no better than to start w/ Maritain's text. Concise, insightful, and clear, it summarizes the aspects of philosophical inquiry in less than 200 pages.

Well-grounded thinking is required to combat what has been called &#34;The Dictatorship of Relativism&#34; by Pope Benedict XVI. A good basis in philosophical thinking is a must. Maritain browses over the history of philosophy in his work - a good start for further investigation on philosophical thinking."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Philosophy","review":"Although concentrated on Western philosophy, this book will bring a good basic understanding of philosophy as a whole"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Philosophy","review":"This book is not an introduction to philosophy as such, but rather to the philosophy asserted by its French author, Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), who converted to Catholicism in 1906 when he was in his mid twenties. Originally interested in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza (1632-1677), then in the philosophy of Henri Bergson (1859-1941), the author became a devotee of St. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274) two years after his conversion to Catholicism, and eventually renounced his previous interest in Spinoza or Bergson.It is no coincidence that Maritain advocates Thomism, the philosophy and theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas is a doctor of the Catholic Church, specifically known as \\"The Angelic Doctor.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia states that doctors of the Church are \\"writers [who] have received this title on account of the great advantage the whole Church has derived from their doctrine.\\" In fact Thomism was so valuable to the Catholic Church that in 1879, just three years before Maritain was born, Pope Leo XIII ordered that it be taught in all Catholic schools as official Church doctrine. This order was issued in an encyclical titled \\"Aeterni Patris\\" (\\"Eternal Fathers\\"), about which the Catholic Encyclopedia writes that \\"Its purpose was the revival of Scholastic philosophy, according to the mind of St. Thomas Aquinas.\\"The Catholic Church exercised editorial control over the content of this book. In 1917, as Maritain finished a year lecturing at the Petit S&eacute;minaire de Versailles, he was commissioned by the Church to write a series of philosophy textbooks for Catholic secondary schools, colleges and seminaries. One result was this book, which received an Imprimatur from the Church -- as must all Church textbooks. The word 'Imprimatur' is Latin for \\"let it be printed.\\" An Imprimatur is granted by a Catholic bishop to indicate that the text has been thoroughly reviewed by a Church panel and deemed to contain nothing contrary to Catholic faith or morals.Therefore the title of this book is misleading, because it has been translated into English without qualification as \\"An Introduction to Philosophy.\\" In the context in which this book was originally published in France in 1920, as \\"Introduction g&eacute;n&eacute;rale &agrave; la philosophie,\\" it was assumed that the reader was a Catholic student, and that he already knew the philosophy in question was Thomism and that it was official Church doctrine. Hence there was no need to add any qualifier to the original title in French. But for us in the English-speaking world 85+ years later -- and many of us will not be Catholic, and will have no interest in becoming such -- we cannot assume knowledge of the context and purpose of this book.However, the problems with this book do not end with the title. The book's manner of exposition itself is offensive. In Chapter One, Egyptian and Semitic cultures are needlessly denigrated as \\"scornful of human wisdom and the achievements of pure reason.\\" Buddhism is unnecessarily attacked as \\"cowardice\\" and \\"an intellectual plague to humanity.\\" Hinduism is \\"counterfeit.\\" Chinese culture and history is \\"diseased.\\" Zoroastrianism is a \\"failure.\\" It is only in ancient Greece, and ancient Greece alone, claims Maritain, that \\"the wisdom of man found the right path.\\" The Greeks are \\"the chosen people of reason.\\" Having read this, how can one expect Maritain to do justice to those with whom he disagrees?This book lacks critical reflection about its subject matter. Maritain lauds Aristotle (384-322 BCE), claiming that \\"he founded for all time the true philosophy.\\" Aristotle \\"saved whatever was true and valuable, not only in Plato, but in all the ancient thinkers of Greece.\\" But to my knowledge Maritain says nothing of Aristotle's claim that the Earth is the center of the universe, or that rocks have an innate desire to move to the center of the Earth. And nowhere does he appear to discuss the limitations of Aristotelian syllogistic as a vehicle for mathematical reasoning. How can a syllogism demonstrate that 1 + 1 = 2? These are serious, long-recognized problems for Aristotle. Maritain discusses none of them, to my knowledge.This book ignores significant facts about its subject. What about those ancient Greek philosophers whom Maritain does not cover? The Hellenistic philosophers? The Stoics, Epicureans, Cynics, and Skeptics? The Megarians, who developed a propositional logic long before George Boole did in the 19th Century? Maritain remarks tersely that they \\"in essentials would deform philosophy.\\" This is needless insult for legitimate, Socratically inspired philosophical traditions which have much to offer. How can we trust someone like this to speak with authority about philosophy as a whole?This book misrepresents its subject. For Aristotle, theology is not a separate discipline from philosophy. But we are never told this in this book. For Maritain, contrary to Aristotle, philosophy is subservient to what Maritain calls \\"supernatural theology.\\" Maritain had converted to Catholicism, had embraced the official philosophy and theology of the Church, was on faculty at a Catholic university, and intended this book for Catholic students. It received an Imprimatur from the Church. He obviously is not talking about Hindu, Jewish, Islamic, Protestant, or even Orthodox supernatural theology. In other words, for Maritain the Catholic Church ought to have absolute veto authority over all philosophy, as the Church did in fact have veto authority over the content of Maritain's book. This is an extremely controversial claim with which probably the majority of philosophers disagree -- including Aristotle himself. Ignoring these facts, Maritain asserts without argument that philosophy must reject \\"as false any philosophic affirmation which contradicts a [supernatural] theological truth\\" -- i.e. alleged truth, as to assume it's true is to beg the question.Maritain calls such alleged truth \\"science\\" -- a use of the word completely alien to modern ears and again seriously misleading. Maritain means \\"science\\" in the medieval Scholastic sense of the Latin word \\"scientia\\" and the Greek word \\"episteme,\\" i.e. a system of allegedly self-evident axioms plus the theorems derived from them by means of Aristotle's syllogistic. He does not mean \\"science\\" in the sense of empirical conjecture, falsifiability, and probabilistic reasoning which we in the 21st Century call genuine science. \\"Certain knowledge of causes is termed science,\\" writes Maritain, contradicting hundreds of years of experimental scientific practice which has provided us with probabilistic, but not certain, truths about the universe that were unimaginable to Aristotle or Aquinas. Indeed, this conflict between \\"science\\" as understood by the Church, and science as practiced by scientists, led the Church to burn Giordano Bruno at the stake in 1600 for heresy, to condemn Copernicus posthumously in 1616 for heresy and ban his writings, and to imprison Galileo for life in 1633, as well as condemn him for heresy and ban his work.Perhaps we can excuse this book's hostility to other traditions, and its lack of critical reflection about its own tradition, by attributing it to the prevailing prejudice of French Catholicism 85+ years ago. But it is not 1920. And this book has been translated into English and republished for a wider audience, among whom will be many who are actively offended or misled by the content of this book.In summary, this book is misleading and offensive. It ignores certain significant and relevant facts, while misrepresenting others. It needlessly insults other cultures and religions. It does not even attempt to give an unbiased account of philosophy. Nor does it appear aware of the limitations of its own prejudice. I find it useful primarily as an antiquated Catholic account of the history of philosophy. If you want to get an idea of St. Thomas Aquinas's philosophy, without Aquinas's logical rigor, then this book might be useful, but only if you can put up with the author's unwarranted prejudice, his explicit hostility to other traditions, and his lack of critical reflection about his own tradition. Maritain is no Aquinas, and this book is no state-of-the-art introduction to philosophy or its history. It is an 86-year-old French Catholic textbook, written under contract with the Church in the wake of a 19th Century Papal encyclical, exclusively advocating a 13th Century worldview which contradicts modern science.

The dialogue is convincing, the action pell-mell, and the plot suspenseful. Dizon is at his best conveying the ethnic patois of the combatants, and, from various clues, it is clear that he has \\"been there, done that.\\" His choice of title is also intriguing, the tiara of the chief protagonist -- an English princess (and most decidedly not the one who arrogantly dismissed the Irish as p*gs) who does a Patty Hearst when abducted by the IRA - becomes instead a crown of thorns as her fame and status as royalty become a burden. While varied in style, Tiara is conceptually solid, and a timely and valuable book."},{"Title":"Tiara","review":"Tiara is one of the most original novels on Northern Ireland written in quite some time. Based on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, it borrows from the Princess Diana tragedy in a what-if scenario, then takes a dark turn into the shadowy world of terrorism that brings us right alongside modern day headlines. Its politics, its characters and its storyline are controversial and intriguing, turning this into a first-rate page-turner.The fact that the author is able to pack so much action and detail into a 107-page novella is no mean feat in itself. The downside is that it doesn't allow for quick reading, forcing the reader to spend time digesting both the multi-layered subplots and dialogue. The cast of characters and the different organizations may also require a certain amount of flipping back pages, but all in all, it is like a carefully textured rug that is well worth the time spent. It's definitely one you will want to read over again just to relive the moments and also to come across a different perspective on the message and meaning.Princess Jennifer is a widowed member of British royalty who pursues a vision quest in attending the negotiations at Stormont leading to the GFA in NI of 1998. She becomes a fantasy object to Berlin Mansfield, a terrorist who finagles his way into the peace talks to meet the Princess. Unknown to both of them, she is also the target of the Ulster Defense Association, a loyalist gang intent on holding her hostage to stop the negotiations. She is kidnapped by the UDA, and Mansfield offers his services to the rival IRA to try and rescue the Princess. CIA agents Jon Stevens and Slash Scimitar are in NI on a mission and end up helping the British track down both Mansfield and the kidnappers. Eventually the 'black knight' rescues the Princess, and we end up on a different track on this rollercoaster that eventually hurtles us home safely into the Good Friday Agreement.Tiara's Jennifer is a knock-off of Princess Di, reminiscent of the guess-who characterizations employed by Mario Puzo in The Godfather. She's a statuesque, emerald-eyed blonde whose philandering husband buys the farm in a boating accident, leaving her with her own unique title (the Princess of Edinburgh) and position as heiress to the throne of England. She buries her grief in British philanthropy, drawing her into the centuries-old debate over the Troubles in Ulster. She becomes a crusader for the quest for self-governance, and in doing so becomes a target for the Ulster Defense Association, a loyalist terror gang. They kidnap the Princess in a last-ditch effort to derail the talks, and we see a reenactment of Lady Di's car accident become a segue into her capture. Her celebrity catapults the incident into international headlines, and at this point the story escalates into a tale of romance, intrigue, revenge and murder between the UDA and the rival IRA.The antihero is Berlin Mansfield, the bastard son of an Irish prizefighter and a German noblewoman. As a chemical engineer and hacker in his University days, he joins the Baader-Meinhof terror gang to avenge the murder of his father. After the reunification of Germany, he flees to Syria to complete his terrorist training before going on to infamy and fortune in Rwanda. We are introduced to him after he double-crosses a gang of anarchists in an attempted bombing near Buckingham Palace. Here he develops a fixation on Jennifer and begins negotiating with an IRA chieftain to join their Sinn Fein entourage at the peace talks in Belfast. The Princess' kidnap results in the IRA, while handcuffed by the ceasefire, sponsoring Mansfield as he musters a gang to rescue the Princess. Meanwhile, SAS Major Mark O'Shaughnessy develops his own fixation on Mansfield (reminiscent of Les Miserables), and is determined to destroy the Golden Terror regardless of the cost. Mansfield eventually recovers Jennifer, and it leads into a Patty Hearst scenario as she falls in love with her rogue. Jennifer remains with the Mansfield Gang, getting a first-hand view of the liberties and excesses of the government against its Republican citizens before being re-rescued by their pursuers.CIA agents Jon Stevens and Slash Scimitar are the heroes of the tale, originally sent to Ulster to establish a connection between Muslim terrorists and the IRA. They are sent to the Europa Hotel in Belfast on recon and wind up in the thick of the kidnapping incident. Having opened up a motorcycle shop on the West Side, they become objects of interest to both the UDA and the IRA, allowing us a bird's eye view of the community as a result. They are enlisted by Major O'Shaughnessy to help rescue the Princess, and become tangled in the skirmishes between the UDA kidnappers and the Mansfield Gang. These guys are James Bond gone bad, hard-drinking gun-runners from the CIA's Paramilitary Division in Bosnia trying to redeem their careers in an improbable scenario as the tabloids' mysterious American Mercenaries. Jon and Slash will earn their place among the memorable figures in spy fiction with their hip dialogue, street-wise approach and gangbuster tactics in saving the Princess for a not-so-storybook ending. This dynamic duo certainly does more than its share in bringing this tale to a level well above the droll fiction we've seen in the Irish genre over the decades.Although the IRA and their counterparts, Sinn Fein and MADD (Mothers Against Drug Dealers, or Evil Mothers), remain shadowy figures in the novel, the conflicts within the UDA are most noteworthy. Elderly bosses Jimmy \\"the Bull\\" Doherty and Delmore Merrick struggle to maintain control of their politically-savvy kidnap team under street tough Baxter Cody. Along with fraying political connections, they eventually lose their most deadly assassin, Shannon Blackburn (my vote as the scariest villain of all time), as well as their control of East Belfast in the changing times ahead. The subplot provides us with an insightful look at NI in its arrival into a new century amidst its traditional values and mores.Not only are the intricacies of the politics both authoritative and well done, but the internecine struggles between the factions in the UK are highly interesting and informative. The cast of characters is most entertaining, and you wish it was longer just so you could read more about them individually. There's quite a few heavy feminist statements that weigh heavy on the mind, and the overviews of the daily hardships on the Irish people is well portrayed. This is a great story that would make an even greater movie. C'mon, Hollywood, don't miss out on a chance to make up for the garbage you foisted on us in 2007."},{"Title":"The Continuing Revolution: A History of Physics from the Greeks to Einstein,","review":"Agassi trained in physics and then studied logic and scientific method at the University of London with Sir Karl Popper. This book consists of a series of dialogues between the author and his son Aaron on the history of physics. The book demonstrates Agassi's &quot;view that scientific activity is an endless dialogue,with problems and proposed solutions which are criticized as unclear, or as unsatisfactory, or as false. Science is and has been a continuing revolution&quot; (8). The author does a good job of presenting the conceptual problems and solutions that led to the Copernican and Newtonian revolutions. He also covers some of the advances that created doubts about the magnificent Newtonian edifice and led to relativity theory, which is briefly discussed. The book provides an excellent starting point in physics for the non-scientist.

I wish my father would have had such a discussion with me using this book. But my father--despite what he likes to say and think--cannot tolerate the heady, authoritatively dangerous mix of awe and rebellion characteristic of this book. Were i to have a child, i would however try and show a lot more affection without dominance of his or her mind, space, or being. The book seems to miss so many opportunities to just say once that parental love is vastly more important than 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th century scientific principles. Also the father seems to dominate his son's mind, which is probably alright, but again it would be better if dad could somehow be a little more genuinely understanding.A book similar to this one, despite its strange fondness for the U.N., in presentation is Sophie's World (1996) by Jostein Gaarder.

The connection to John Smyth?The magazine he edits is called Grace magazine.While trying to clear his name, John begins to talk to his pastor friends, they in turn talk to others and a list is formed of possible missing persons. Eventually the truth is found out.... But the outcome? I cannot tell. You'll have to read the book."},{"Title":"Who's Grace? (John Smyth Mystery Series #1)","review":"I do agree with the reviewer who spoke of the book being confusing as it moved between scenes w/o warning -- nothing to break off from one scene to the next.Imagine, if you will, being on an airplane at a distance where plots of land are matchbook-size and people are matchstick-size figures. You are quite tired as you peer out your window of the plane and see what appears to be one matchstick figure aiming an object at another figure, the second figure, limbs jerking then falling, mouth agape. You then look around inside the plane to the other passengers to see if anyone else might have seen what you just have or perhaps it's just your very tired mind. That's what happened to John Smyth, the main character in \\"Who's Grace.\\"She's been identified as 3 different women - Grace Drummond, Gary's wife. Grace -- a prostitute. Grace Hutchinson -- another Grace who's been missing.John Smyth who saw what he saw from the airplane, is being questioned as though he was a suspect. David, the street person is being questioned as though he was suspect. Gary Drummond is being questioned as though he was the guilty party."},{"Title":"Who's Grace? (John Smyth Mystery Series #1)","review":"This book really frustrated me. The idea was good, the writing was pretty good, but I still didn't enjoy it. First of all, Coggins spends too much time cutting back and forth from one scene to another. There is a difference between being surprised and being confused. You would be reading one situation with some characters and then, without warning, you're in a completely different situation. If the characters had been well-defined, that would not have been a problem, but they were not. So I spent a lot of time trying to figure out who was doing what.The characters were one-dimensional. There was no depth to them, and that made it difficult to sympathize with them. All the non-Christians use stereotypes to refer to the main character, John Smyth. But by not developing the characters, Coggins is the one who trivializes Christians. There is a femi-nazi in the book who actually makes libelous statements at a public rally. One would think that a person in her position (the leader of an anti-domestic violence group) would have more sense. In fact, if she had been written with some depth, rather than relying on cookie-cutter stereotypes, the book would have been more interesting.She was not the only poorly written character. The two main police officers cannot be civil to each other to save their lives. Again, their animosity was oversimplified. And the list of bad characters goes on and on. There's the head of the mission who shares a prayer request with a creepy reporter and a Pastor and his wife who evangelize every person the meet, and so on.I won't get into how the murder is solved, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who still wants to read this book. But suffice it to say, I was disappointed. If I was not the type of person who pretty much always finishes a novel that I start, I would not have read this book to the end."},{"Title":"Estimation of the Time Since Death in the Early Postmortem Period","review":"This is a terrible book. It is a hodge-podge of different methods of estimation of the time since death compiled by european professors... The methods described are useless, and highlight that this is an art, rather than a science. For example, the incredible number of nomograms attempting to describe all sorts of conditions a body may be found in, emphasize that judgement and experience are the ultimate determinants of the estimate of the time of death. As a forensic pathologist who does more than 400 cases a year, I know a little bit about the subject. Stick to rules of thumb such as the ones in Spitz's book, and spend your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Estimation of the Time Since Death in the Early Postmortem Period","review":"The only serious attempt to scientifically address the problem faced by forensic pathologists and to answer the questions that are frequently asked of the examining pathologist by the court.The fact that many factors affect the rate of change post mortem is no surprise. Unfortunately this makes for turgid reading. Spitz's rules of thumb are no more than common sense and good for armchair forensic detectives (such as the previous reviewer?). Knight and Henssge are very respected pathologists in their field; although their book is not particularly user- friendly, anyone with a professional interest in this topic should at least be aware with it."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"History is written by the victors. Getting an accurate assessment of the death of innocents during and after World War II is a difficult subject. This book is a perfect example.What the book (and even the summary here) fails to mention is that Hoess' \\"signed confession\\" claimed that four million people were killed at Auschwitz. The review here says two million. The Auschwitz museum itself now (as of 2002) says slightly less than one million (revised down from the original \\"over four million\\" that the Soviets tortured Hoess into claiming). I doubt a word of this \\"memoir\\" was written by Hoess. Google around - the British officer who witnesses the torture of Hoess has gone public. This book was written by those seeking to begin painting a picture of the history of the era.The claim that 15,000 people per day were burned in open pits (at Sobibor, Treblinka, Chelmno, and Maly Trostenets) is absurd. Talk to a modern crematory employee or Google it. Open pits? You might - MIGHT - burn 50 people in a day with dedicated effort and lots and lots and lots of fuel (gas). 100 would be near impossible - 15,000 is an absurdity.On the other hand, it's overwhelming documented that 300,000 people were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto alone. Over 1 million (1.2 million) Jews disappeared from Europe during WWII into ghettos, deportations, \\"resettlement\\", etc. They're gone - no question that they were murdered.On the other hand, the hyper-focus on the holocaust is also a cover for the murder of German civilians 1944-1948. Google \\"Eisenhower's death camps.\\" Over 1,000,000 German POW's (regular soldiers - students, workers, farmers, drafted into their country's military) never made it out of US POW camps. Over 3,000,000 never returned from the USSR. About 2,000,000 civilians died in the \\"expulsion\\" from what had been German towns for 600 years before the war (Google the term \\"expelees\\"). The hyper-focus on the murders committed by the Nazis is absolutely used as a cover for the innocent German civilian and non-war-crime soldiers killed by the Allies and Soviets.What all this proves is that the maxim \\"history is written by the victors\\" is true. More questions than answers exist on the topic of WWII related crimes against humanity. This book brings us no closer to real answers."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"There is another autobiography of Hoess titled \\"Commandant of Auschwitz: The Autobiography of Rudolf Hoess\\". I would be interested in reading that account but am curious how that could differ from \\"Death Dealer\\". Given the circumstances the man at the end of his life did not have a whole lot of time to write different autobiographies. My guess is the two books are essentially the same.As for Death Dealer itself it is not often one reads an account of the concentration camps from the \\"other side\\". I had read other summaries that portrayed Hoess as a mid-level cold-hearted bureaucrat whose account of his SS career was pretty much emotionless and he treated his activities in the same manner an accountant or a department store manager or a mechanic or (pick a career) would describe their career. I thought before reading the book that whatever one may say about him he would at least not grovel for forgiveness and would defiantly flip his middle finger at the world before climbing the steps of the gallows. After all, when he wrote his memoirs in 1946 and 1947, there was little suspense over what his fate would be. So sugar coating his past was not going to change his future.Although there may have been some shred of decency in the man one could not escape the feeling that he recognized himself as a war criminal only because his captors called him a war criminal. In other words his \\"mea culpa\\" would probably not score high on the sincerity scale. The victorious Allies were the new authorities over his life and if they considered him guilty and a war criminal then he was guilty and a war criminal. Whether he personally thought so or not was not relevant. And that was pretty much how he conducted his life. Whoever his authority was pretty much controlled his life. He was the commandant of the most notorious of all Nazi death camps because his superiors made him the commandant. He killed because he was told to kill -- just as he was to die because he was told he had to die.He admitted the horrible conditions of Auschwitz -- and other camps. It was not Hoess' fault. His superiors -- starting with Hitler and Himmler -- put impossible demands on him and did not provide adequate resources. The conditions were horrible and only got worse as the war progressed due to the lack of resources due to the stranglehold the Allies put on Germany. It was not Hoess' fault. The inadequate resources included inadequate officers, staff, and guards who committed many atrocities for which he had little or no control. It was not Hoess' fault. The inadequate resources included inadequate building material, latrines, barrack space, food, water, sanitation system, and medical supplies. It was not Hoess' fault. The concentration camp administration reflected the ideals of Thomas Eicke, the founder of the concentration camp system. It was not Hoess' fault.Although the man blamed others for the nightmarish hell of Auschwitz and other concentration camps he accepted responsibility because it was engrained into him that the commandant is responsible for all activities within the concentration camp.This may be as close as one may come to reading an account of the \\"other side\\". Although one's opinion of the Holocaust may not be altered by Rudolf Hoess he does share insight that one normally does not see about this dark chapter of the history of humanity. Most people know what it is like to be over tasked and under resourced. But most people do not know what it is like to be over tasked and under resourced in his particular career field."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Hoess reveals how a family man who loved horses could himself survive in charge of the Auschwitz complex. Is an authentic read as Hoess blunders here and there with a faulty memory and shows self doubt as the date of his execution nears. Holocaust deniers will find no comfort in the book, although it has to be said that Hoess left the camp in 1943 and that prison memoirs are always suspect to some degree. Hoess seems to have realized all along that a death sentence was certain. The argument that he admitted mass gassings in an attempt to obtain a lighter sentence is unlikely. But you have to read the book to get a feel for this particular nazi whose only aim was to please Berlin."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"While my rating this book five stars does not indicate I enjoyed reading of the mass murdur of 2 million innocent people, it simply means I acknowlage the author's accuracy on the most part. Hoss was history's greatest mass murdurer, appearing quite calm throughout the book and never renouncing his political views or fascist ideas. The one sign he had any regrets was just before he was hanged he uttered a vague sentence of asking for forgiveness. This shows how Nazis viewed the mass murdurs as a &quot;Solution&quot;; to them, Jews were not humans, just a germ that must be exterminated as quickly as possible so as not to spread a disease. It is impossible to imagine what the world would be like today if Himmler, Hitler and Hoss had acomplished what they had set out to do; and, through it all, he retained a sense of moral, bidding his children to take care of &quot;dear, darling mommy,&quot; and requesting his wedding ring be officaly delivered to his wife. One request I was particularly disgusted with was his request to be killed by a firing squad rather than the less dignified hanging he eventually recieved. This represents how he thought he, a mass murdurer of millions, thought he deserved a better death than the thousands of Jewish children he had starved to death or buried alive. A truly evil and pathetic man."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Rudolph H&ouml;ss is known today as the largest mass murderer of all time. He successfully killed about two million prisoners at his concentration camp in Auschwitz. His memoirs tell the story of what his life was like before, during, and after his involvement in the Nazi army and concentration camps. It starts with a brief summary of his childhood, which answers some questions about how he ended up where he did. Throughout his memoirs, scenes are described so vividly that you can picture like you were there next to him, witnessing these events firsthand. The editor, Steven Paskuly, does a great job piecing his notes together and describing specific events through footnotes. The memoirs written by H&ouml;ss and edited by Paskuly do a magnificent job depicting what life was like for Rudolph H&ouml;ss and what exactly occurred at the concentration camp.H&ouml;ss' memoirs are intended to show readers his entire life. The book starts out talking about his childhood. Rudolph was raised Catholic by his mother and father in Baden-Baden. It was because of the strong emphasis put on faith by his father that he later stopped being Catholic. After his parents passed away, he joined the army which would later lead him to become a camp officer appointed by Heinrich Himmler. After being assigned to Auschwitz, it took H&ouml;ss awhile to get used to the Final Solution of exterminating all Jews. It also took him awhile to get used to seeing the physical and mental state that the prisoners were in. After some time, he familiarized himself with the gassing chamber which is how he killed most of his prisoners. Once he stopped feeling sympathy for the prisoners he killed, he exterminated the prisoners left and right and it didn't faze him anymore.The information that comes from this book is firsthand accounts from H&ouml;ss himself. Paskuly is trying to portray H&ouml;ss as the killer that he really is. H&ouml;ss tries to explain his actions by saying that it was all because of the orders he received from Himmler.By reading these memoirs, a better understanding is formed about the concentration camps. The reader can understand that the prisoners there were absolutely helpless and there was no chance of them escaping without getting killed. If they tried to work hard, their bodies would not be able to support them due to the lack of food and water. The way in which the officers treated them was terrible; beating them for everything they did wrong. It also helps the readers understand that even though the officers, such as H&ouml;ss, claimed that they didn't want to carry out the harmful actions but did anyway. He wanted to make it seem like he was innocent when in fact he was really a murderer.Death Dealer is a must read if you want to find out more of what occurred at the concentration camps in Auschwitz. Not only does it provide details of what happened at the camps, but it also gives descriptions of each officer and the different roles that they played. Rudolph H&ouml;ss and Steven Paskuly did a perfect job in providing clear details of the torturous life the prisoners led and how the officers handled the pressures of keeping up with Hitler's standards."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"I have read many books about Nazis and the holocaust, but this one is unique in that it is one of the few written in graphic detail by an SS man himself. I think Hoess definitely had qualms about his role, but was too much of a bureaucrat to openly challenge the regime. His credibility has been doubted, since he was often inconsistent about the number of deaths while at Auschwitz. I don't think Hoess was personally a cruel man; he seemed to have taken a dispassionate role in his work. He did emphasize, before his execution, that he still considered himself a National Socialist, and acknowledged his guilt for taking part in the Final Solution. Hoess seemed to place all the blame on Himmler. Hoess, in the first third of the book, wanted to portray himself as a normal, decent family man who simply ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. In short, this book conveyed a very powerful message and warning, despite some of the irrelevant personal details about Hoess's life. Especially interesting are the profiles of various SS members at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"A terrific book about an extremely disturbed yet meticulous mind. Rudolf Hoess was just one amongst the many who were perfectly ordinary human beings; but having an extremly dark and evil side to them. For a person to destroy thousands of people during day and then tell stories to his children at bedtime and kiss his wife goodbye and then return to destruction again does speak of a motivation that is far beyond comprehension of most of us. Whether it was circumstantial or of an inner voice; it takes a lot for a man to be at the helm of an operation to destroy more than a million fellow human beings without as much as batting an eyelid. Perhaps this was what made Hitler stand out from any other human being born on this earth since its creation; his ability to sway people and convert the most ordinary human beings into cold blooded killer machines. Humanity will never pardon or forget the evils of Hitler; but that apart he was the only individual who was gifted with the power to enthrall people to such an extent that the line between cruelty and evil was forgotten. And Rudolf Ferdinand Hoess was one amongst the thousands who was himself a victim of Hitler."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Death Dealer : The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz by Rudolf Hoss is a disturbing yet necessary insight into the mind of one of histories most prolific mass murderers. As the Kommandant of the Auschwitz death camp, Hoss was directly responsible for the murder of millions of innocents. Given his experiences and the fact that the memoirs were written after Hoss had been sentenced to death for his crimes, one would expect that the book would be a plethora of excuses as to why he did what he did.Surprisingly it is not. Hoss has attempted to explain what he did and why he did it. While it is difficult to say anything commendable about an integral part of Hitler's Final Solution, Hoss does a more than credible job describing the hows and whys. That does not mean that there is no rationalizations. Far from it, especially when it comes to the genocide of the Jews. Hoss makes no bones about the fact that the Jews were the enemy of the German State and as such the Final Solution was justified. His failure to explain why he feels that way is disappointing. He comes close to stating that the genocide was a mistake. However, he attempts to rationalize his participation as a humane act. While this seems amazing, his argument is as follows: that the death were rifle with diseases and hunger that were killing the inmates. He unsuccessfully attempted to gain provisions and food to help the plight of the inmates. Given that failure, and the inmates inevitable and horrific deaths, the gas chamber was a more humane way of dealing with the \\"problem.\\"What becomes clear is that Hoss cannot accept has role in such a crime. What was necessary to better understand Hoss as a third party questioner like Geta Sereny (See Into the Darkness about the Treblinka Kommandant). With this limitation the memoir is a very worthwhile read. Hoss' story is a must read for anyone who wishes to understand the ununderstandable. After finishing the memoirs one does not fully understand the monster inside Hoss, but one does better understand how the Final Solutions could have been accomplished."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"I found \\"Death Dealer\\" to be a most intriguing book. You not only get an inside view of the happenings and horrors of a nazi concentration camp, but you get an insight into the man who ran it in his own words. When you have finished reading \\"Death Dealer\\", you may be left with more questions than answers on the man, not the Kommandant of Auschwitz."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"This book has proven to be an invaluable addition to my study of the Shoah. I believe that Hoss was unusually truthful in his writing and that makes him even more unnerving. His forthright narration of the events of his life is most useful, but perhaps his ability to rationalize absolutely anything in support of Nazism may be the most important aspect of the book. It was very good also to find the minutes of the Wannsee Conference included, but being written in typical oblique Nazi-speak, more information from the editors about the real meaning of the minutes would have been helpful. The book should be a requirement for anyone attempting to understand the Final Solution."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"The story of a bureaucrat who had no regard for human life. Despite his claim of trying to better the lives of prisoners, he reigned over a hell on earth. The lack of emotion in his description of the process of extermination of people from all over Europe is sickening. This book is not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Primo Levi, in my opinion, is one of the more powerful moral philosophers of our time. If you have not read &quot;Survival in Auschwitz&quot; and &quot;The Re-Awakening,&quot; you are cheating yourself. Levi's book &quot;The Drowned &amp; the Saved&quot; is the single best book I have seen on the Shoah. And Levi's introduction to Hoss's book gives this work the framing it deserves.Levi begins by pointing out that when one writes an introduction to a book, the writer usually admires the work, or the author. Even if the book is poor, then at the very least the writing style is commendable. Levi then concludes that &quot;Death Dealer&quot; is poorly written, the author is an officious braggart, who blatently lies; and his lies are painfully transparent. &quot;Reading this book,&quot; Levi says &quot;is torture.&quot; So why should anyone read it? Because to best understand the beast, look in the belly--the mind--of a beast.Raul Hilberg, the holocaust historian, makes a point of saying he never asks the &quot;big questions,&quot; because you will always be disappointed with the answers. So he only asks little questions. Don't ask &quot;why did you personally send three &amp; a half million people to their death?&quot; Instead, ask &quot;where did you come from? How were you able to physically do what you did?&quot; While there certainly are questions about Hoss's candor in this memoir (he wrote it in a Polish prison, while on trial for war crimes by the Polish Government. The outcome of Hoss's trial was not a mystery to anyone--least of all Hoss), Hoss is who he is: a competent manager, totally devoid of any insight whatsoever.According to Hoss, one of the big turning points of his life happened during his prison years in the Weimar Republic. Imprisoned for his role in a political asassination, Hoss &quot;discovers&quot; that some people are just plain no good, no matter what you do for or to them. To illustrate this point, Hoss describes how an imate in a neighboring cell described a burglary, when the inmate bragged of not only killing the parents &amp; servant, but also killed two small children. Hoss describes himself as being so outraged, he wanted to kill that other inmate--only the bars of his cell prevented him. On another occasion, entertainment troupe presented a show for the inmates, including a woman singer. Hoss was so moved by the beauty of her voice, that the walls of the prison fell away--then, as soon as she was finished, Hoss quotes another inmate murmuring to his neighbor how the inmate wanted to steal the jewels the singer was wearing. Again, Hoss was outraged: That inmate, at a time of transcendent beauty, could only think of stealing. Incorrigible. Nothing to do with those kinds of people--which is why the camps were necessary. Everybody that was sent to Auschwitz was an irredeemably bad person, according to the Kommandant.Now, if we are to believe the helpless rage of the imprisoned Hoss over the deaths of babies &amp; imagined thefts of singer's jewelry, what are we to think of the countless children and innumerable &quot;thefts&quot; that occured under Hoss's own command? Nothing--that's what. Because Hoss doesn't see the contridiction.Hoss writes of an Auschwitz that is a summer camp for poor people, with a scarcity of supplies due to factors outside of his control--and yet through heroic efforts of administration on his part, the camp functioned. Meanwhile, out the other side of his mouth, Hoss can't help but brag on the numbers of &quot;enemies&quot; who perished inside the camp. Hoss saw himself as fighting a war, a war against the internal enemies of the Reich, of humanity.To the extent there were &quot;problems&quot; at Auschwitz, Hoss sees himself a victim of poor administration by his superiors. The camp is flooded with more &amp; more prisoners, but less and less supplies. Not surprisingly, Hoss neglects to mention that he and his family managed to live very well on black market proceeds from supplies stolen from the prisoners.Poo Hoss is also cursed with incompetent subordinates, such as SS Captain Karl Fritzsch. Hoss dismisses Fritzsch as having &quot;limited intelligence.&quot; Moreover, Fritzsch constantly issued orders that were the &quot;opposite&quot; of Hoss's own views. Fritzsch also threatened &amp; treated the prisoners badly, to the point the prisoners were afraid of Hoss: &quot;When I tried to learn something from the prisoners directly, I always found resisitance and evasive answers. The terror that was instituted by Fritzsch in Auschwitz could not be gotten rid of!&quot; Poor Rudolf. Hoss has the temerity to conclude &quot;Just think how much better Auschwitz would have run without people like Fritsch.&quot; Just think!Hoss [...] prides himself on not showing emotion, no matter what happens around him. He lies without seeing how foolish his lies are. He is just following orders, because there are real enemies out there--and it is Hoss's job to do what is &quot;best&quot; ie what he is told..........No doubt Hoss also held an unquestioning belief that the Jewish and Roma populations had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction in violation of then current international treaties, justifying invasions of their lands."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"To read this is both fasinating and horrific. I couldn't put it down, I cried, I was angered, and I even laughed at his blatant lies. He was more worried about where he was going to get construction items than he was in the millions he let die. Following orders was his oath...what happened to common human decency? Hoess claims that he was not allowed to think about saving anybody's life but to the total destruction of not only the Jews, but other races as well. This story was written by a Nazi insider...shame on those who say the holocaust never happened. He had too easy a death, he should have been put through the same horrors he put innocent people through...good riddance to him and his kind."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"There are number of editions of SS Kommandant Rudolf Hoess' memoirs out in a variety of formats. The best one is DEATH DEALER: THE MEMOIRS OF THE SS KOMMANDANT AT AUSCHWITZ edited by Steven Paskuly, translated by Andrew Pollinger. Pollinger is a concentration camp survivor and Paskuly \\"teaches German in the Buffalo Public Schools.Even if this book has a foreword by Primo Levi, it's certainly modest in its origins given the importance of its subject matter.Where are all those Oxford dons? Instead, we've got a book edited by a high school German teacher!The proof, however, is in the pudding and Mr.Paskuly proves himself to be a careful, scholarly editor. Considering the fact that SS Commandant Hoess oversaw the murder of 1.1 million Jews by his own count, would Mr. Pollinger's translation of his memoirs be slanted? It didn't appear to be. I compared it to another translation and didn't see any significant differences.Hoess' memoirs were written while he was in Allied captivity. Those who seek to deny that the Holocaust took place vigorously try to dismiss Hoess' memoirs as the result of \\"torture\\". Some even suggest that they were dictated by the NKVD since Hoess was transferred from British to Polish custody at a time when Stalin controlled post-war Poland.While it is certainly good to be cautious about any document dictated in captivity, a careful reading of Hoess' memoirs doesn't support the assertion that torture influenced what Hoess wrote. For one thing he complains about how some of his captors treated him. In fact most of the information available about his alleged mistreatment at Allied hands comes from his own memoirs. No NKVD officer would have let something like slip by.It's also significant that Hoess ignores the Soviet estimate that over 4 million people were murdered at the Nazi concentration camp he commanded. He estimates that 1.1 million were murdered, an estimate which most historians agree is accurate. Why would any Soviet officer worth his salt let something like that by?The tone of Hoess' memoirs also strikes me as appropriate for an SS officer. He brags about being decorated by the Fuhrer for his tireless work. He describes his personal revulsion while observing mass executions at the gas chambers. And, on every page, he weaves into almost all his words his belief that he was just following orders. He repeats the old SS motto, \\"Fuhrer! You command and we obey!\\" Indeed, the SS dagger he carried had the SS motto \\"Loyalty is my honor\\", and the same thing appeared on SS belt buckles.Maybe he saw that as a defense? A lot of other Nazis did.There's another tone which underlies his narrative. Raised a Roman Catholic, he clearly seeks to confess and unburden himself of his transgressions, no matter how massive and horrible they were. Yet another reason to consider his memoirs genuine.It is also significant that his observations coincide with those of other SS such as Dr. Johann Kremer and SS Corporal Pery Broad. They also coincide with those of such suvivors as Filip Mueller (EYEWITNESS AUSCHWITZ: THREE YEARS IN THE GAS CHAMBERS) and with the physical evidence of the camp itself. Those are well described by Professors Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt in AUSCHWITZ.Hoess didn't have access to any of his records when he wrote his memoirs and this is where Mr.Paskuly earns his editorial spurs with thorough annotations explaining some of the glitches and mistakes Hoess makes in his memoirs. He forgets some dates and gets names wrong, that sort of thing. The notes really help and the overall impression I had was that Hoess' memoirs were genuine and were substantially accurate making this a very valuable book for anyone interested in the Holocaust.DEATH DEALER's value is further enhanced by its appendices. The most interesting and valuable of which (to me at least) were the minutes of the Wannsee Conference of January 20, 1942. Even this is enhanced by an introductory note quoting Adolf Eichmann's testimony at Jerusalem on July 24, 1961, about how he rephrased the finished draft of the conference eliminating such blunt terms as \\"killing, elimination, and annihilation.\\" (pp. 371-372)If you're interested in the Holocaust, you need this edition of this book. I gave it five stars."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Death Dealer is a very high quality piece of literature, detailing a horrible man's life, which is very interesting. Quentin Reynolds of the Saturday Review voices that it \\"is a great if grisly historical document, which not only includes the unforgettable self portrait by H&ouml;ss but candid pictures of some of his more spectacular and abominable fellow criminals. It is not for the squeamish, this book, but it is for the thoughtful.\\" I also agree it is not for the squeamish, especially if you find any piece of Nazi writing offensive. Simply put by Phoebe Adams of The Atlantic, Death Dealer is \\"[A] gruesomely fascinating book,\\" an opinion in which i thoroughly believe in. This work by H&ouml;ss gives the reader a very detailed view into one of the biggest murderers in all of history. It also includes the minutes of the Wannsee Conference, where the Final Solution for the Jewish population was determined by SS and government officials. The book also includes backgrounds to important SS officers like Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler, the rules and regulations of Auschwitz, and pictures detailing H&ouml;ss with Himmler, the gas chambers, the crematories, and hangings.I would highly recommend this book to anyone studying Nazi history, or anyone with an interest in Auschwitz. This book is not for everyone and takes a mature reader to finish and to not get angry about. It offers great historical information about high ranking officials that were part of the Nazi control, and information that is needed to fulfill the need or want to learn more about the inner workings of the Nazi's reign. H&ouml;ss did a wonderful job outlining the major aspects of his life and sharing them with the reader."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Hoss was told to write his life story while in captivity at the end of WWII. I felt it is an interesting story that reads easily, the reader will feel that Hoss is a personable fellow. The real clincher is that the man was a monster. It is readily seen that Hitler, Himmler and the high echelon of the Third Reich were perversed by their absolute power. The smaller minds that fell under their spell and power became puppets. Some felt the same perversness of power, others came under the total fear of Himmler. Hoss was both. Hoss set up Auchwitz and supervised every aspect of its' operation. He relates to his actions the same as if he managed a plant that stamped out car bumpers. Amazing, he oversaw the merciless murder of milllions of human beings. Right before his execution, Hoss wrote loving letters to his wife and children. This showed the sickness of the Nazi mentallity, that a man could endorse the separation of families and their wholesale murder, then go home each night to the loving embrace of his own family. Death Dealer is a definitive study of the motivations and mentallities of a corrupt people and what motivates their weilding of power."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Rudolph H&ouml;ss, Auschwitz Kommandant, wrote his memoirs while in prison awaiting trial and then awaiting execution for War Crimes. Captured shortly after the war working on farm under a different name Rudolph H&ouml;ss, probably the main Kommandant the German Concentration Camp Auschwitz (he was not the only one) explains to the best of his ability how he became the Greatest Mass Murderer in history. He says it is basically all about following orders. Rudolph H&ouml;ss is a perfect example of the Yale University experiment on how far does a human being go when under the gun in following orders. Rudolph H&ouml;ss's thinking, his point of view as a soldier of the Third Reich following orders is made perfectly clear to the reader and as a result the reader gets a stimulating view of, not only Rudolph H&ouml;ss's perspective on life and death, but also in following orders given by superiors without question, without even thinking. \\"I don't think, I obey.\\" The reader is also rewarded with probably the most detailed review of the workings inside the Auschwitz Death Camp: the staff: block leader, Kapo, guard, Kommandant, etc.. We are also presented with valuable detailed information about the different categories of prisoners: the Jehovah Witnesses, Gypsies, Poles, Russian POWs, Jews and non-Jews, the Politicals homosexuals, prostitutes and Nazi's who do not follow orders or even those who make mistakes or show compassion. We also are treated to precise details of the operation of daily camp life: life and death struggles, hunger, disease, medical experiments, and forced labor; and of course the workings of the killing machine: the gassing and the ovens, the smell of burning flesh. This read is a must for anyone who is even remotely interested in the Holocaust, Concentration Camps and of course Justice, if one can believe that there is justice in the world or is it only from the victors and the exploiter's point of view? The book is also a perfect review, nearly identical to COMMANDANT OF AUSCHWITZ: The Autobiography of Rudolf H&ouml;ss, R. H&ouml;ss, 1959. Death Dealer provides extra goodies."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"This memoir is amazing, because it shows how someone so ordinary- maybe not much different than others in society, can sink to the depths of atrocity and assist with organized murder. Hoess matter of factly states everything he did, which was quite a bit. Hitler, Heydrich and Himmler may have been the architects of genocide, but it was mechanics like Hoess and Eichmann who allowed the Holocaust to happen. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Remarkable primarily in the fact that it exists at all, and frankly recommended solely on that basis. The memoir of SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Hoess will disappoint those used to the dramatics, overarching moralizations, and lurid examples of grisly sadism generally a mainstay of books on this topic (and seemingly promised by the foreward and cover blurbs). Hoess was largely a narrow-minded bureaucratic functionary, and as such transcendant revelations about his role at Auschwitz Birkenau are not forthcoming.Technically, the translation is quite sloppy in places, and there are numerous quite inexplicable German misspellings throughout."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Other reviews have adequately described the uniqueness of this diary. I want to comment briefly on its contents.What I found fascinating was Hoss' description of the petty rivalries various bureacracies within the Nazi regime had for each other, and their competing aims. These rivalries are very matter-of-factly explained, even though they involved the intentional murder of millions.For example, Speer and his war production needs placed significant demands for slave labor. This collided with Himmler's orders to kill all the Jews. So there was constant tension between finding sufficient slaves from the \\"prison\\" populations, keeping them healthy enough to be useful slave laborers, and yet also satisfy demands for more numbers of Jews killed. The Nazi doctors, meanwhile, had their own concerns -- they did not want to certify borderline Jews as \\"healthy\\" for slave labor, and then find their limited medical sources \\"wasted\\" on treating sick Jews that were going to die and were not particularly useful to the war machine anyways.The banal nature of this testimony -- by supposedly \\"educated\\" European bureacrats as they efficiently calculate planning and other material needs of a large sophisticated war economy -- is simply stunning.I also found his first-hand accounts of the final phase of the war to be interesting -- the trail of tears of millions of displaced German civilians, slave laborers, soldiers and of course Auschwitz 'death marchers' all converged in a mad rush through the snow to escape the marauding Russians, all while Allied bombs fell overhead.The personal details, as Primo Levi notes brilliantly in his introduction, are scary for their apparent lack of self-awareness and intense need for projection and/or denial.Hoss was a skilled cog, indoctrinated into a propaganda machine that emphasized country, loyalty and moral and racial superiority. His defense of anti-semitism (the Nazis got it wrong in its execution, but not in its ideology) remains one of the more chilling aspects of his \\"confession.\\"Recommended."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"I have read many books on this subject, in an attempt to get inside the mind of the people who perpetrated this crime. Not the far removed bureaucrats in Berlin who gave sweeping orders, but the men who pulled the trigger. Men who had families. Men who saw the faces of women, children, and old people and said, I will do it! The conclusion I draw is they are average people driven by an idea, that is justified through re-education and indoctrination. Like most ideologies that categorize a group of people as outsiders, or dangerous for the society as a whole, it becomes easy for the perpetrators to carry out these acts with little remorse. Once they cross that threshold (point of no return) all of the mechanisms go into a smooth motion. Read \\"Hitlers Willing Executioners\\" or the testimony of Einsatzgruppe Commander Otto Ohlendorf, and you will get the idea. Hoess was training for the priesthood (if you can believe that) before he found his calling in the SS. Either way this story has played itself out time and again in Cambodia,Bosnia, Rwanda, and the Sudan. The one important thing Hoess did is to come clean in the end. To all those who deny it happened (Ahmadinijhad)or that it was carried out by heartless rogues, think again.

Rudolf Hoess was history's greatest mass murderer, the architect and SS Commandant of the largest killing center ever created, the death camp of \\"Auschwitz\\" (located in Poland), whose name has come to symbolize humanity's ultimate, abject descent into evil.The Psychopathic God: Adolph HitlerResponsible for exterminating over 2.5 million people (primarily Jews, as well as Gypsies, Homosexuals, and Russians), he was a mild-mannered, happily married man who enjoyed normal family life with his five children despite his view of the crematorium chimney stacks from his bedroom window. At peak efficiency, Auschwitz had the capacity to murder 10,000 people in 24 hours, as Hoess would testify during the War Crimes trials at Nuremburg after World War II.New Beginnings: Holocaust Survivors in Bergen-Belsen and the British Zone in Germany, 1945-1950Witness after witness, as well as mass documents produced irrefutable evidence of the crimes committed, and no witness was more shocking than Rudolf Hoess, who calmly elucidated how he had come to exterminate 2.5 million people. He further expounds upon this in \\"Commandant of Auschwitz\\".Rudolf Franz Hoess was born in 1900 and joined Adolf Hitler's Gestapo (the \\"SS\\") in 1933. In 1934 he was attached to the SS at Dachau. Then, on August 1st, 1938, he was adjutant of the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp until his appointment as Commandant of the newly built camp at Auschwitz in early 1940. This was located near the provincial Polish town of Oshweicim in Galacia.The Dentist of Auschwitz: A MemoirIn May, 1941 the SS Commander Heinrich Himmler explained to Hoess that Adolf Hitler had given the orders for the final solution for the Jewish question. The \\"Final Solution' was Hitler's plan to implement Aryian racial purity and rid the continent of any contaminants of Germanic, pure blood Nordic origins, particularly by killing Jews. Hoess details in his book how he converted Auschwitz into an extermination camp and installed gas chambers and crematoriums.Inside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of AuschwitzAuschwitz became the largest killing center where the greatest number of European Jews were slaughtered. Detailed in this story, Hoess explains how after an experimental gassing there in September 1941 of 850 malnourished and ill prisoners, mass murder became a daily routine.By mid 1942, mass gassing of primarily Jews utilizing \\"Zyklon-B\\" gas commenced at Auschwitz, whereupon extermination was conducted on an industrial scale with 2.5 million innocent men, women and children were eventually butchered through mostly poison gassing, but also through barbaric methods such as starvation, disease, shooting and burning.Five Chimneys: The Story of AuschwitzAt Auschwitz \\"so called\\" camp doctors i.e. German physicians and scientists performed vile and potentially lethal medical experiments on concentration camp inmates, tortured Jewish and Gypsy children and many others. \\"Patients\\" were put into pressure chambers, tested with drugs (lethal gasoline injections), castrated, sterilized, frozen to death and exposed to various traumas. In late 1943 Hoess was appointed chief inspector of all German Concentration camps and worked hard to improve the efficiency of them all.Doctors from Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on HumansAt the end of W.W. II, with Germany's eminent collapse, Hoess describes how he fled at the approach of the Russian Red Army and went into hiding in Germany under the name \\"Franz Lang\\". He was arrested by British military police on March 11, 1946. His wife had told the British where he could be found, fearing that her son, Klaus, would be shipped off to Russia.Handed over to the Polish authorities, he was tried in 1947. While awaiting sentencing, Hoess penned this book. He was sentenced to death, and was returned to Auschwitz to be hanged on the gallows outside the entrance to the gas chamber.The Scourge of the Swastika: A History of Nazi War Crimes During World War IIwrote that four days before he was hung, Hoess sent a message to the state prosecutor. His emotionless veneer cracked as he sent the following message to the state prosecutor stating: \\"My conscience compels me to make the following declaration. In the solitude of my prison cell I have come to the bitter recognition that I have sinned gravely against humanity. As Commandant of Auschwitz I was responsible for carrying out part of the cruel plans of the \\"Third Reich\\" for human destruction. In doing so I have inflicted terrible wounds on humanity. I have caused unspeakable suffering for the Polish people in particular. I am to pay for this with my life. May the Lord God forgive one day what I have done\\".The execution was carried out on April 16, 1947. Although never executed, compare Hoess's aforementioned statement with the following. William Calley, the convicted commander of an American fighting unit that on March 16, 1968 entered the South Vietnamese hamlet of \\"My Lai\\" and massacred 400 unarmed women children and old men during the Vietnam War, had this to say about his guilt and conscience. This is quoted out of his autobiography.Lieutenant Calley: His Own Story\\"As a professional soldier I had been taught and instructed to carry out the orders that were issued by the superiors-my lieutenant, my commanding officer, the captain. At no time did it ever cross my mind to disobey or to refuse to carry out an order that was issued by my superiors. I felt that they (Charlie Company) were able to carry out the assigned task, the orders, that meant killing small kids, killing women, because they were soldiers, they were trained that way. I feel that we carried out the orders in a moral fashion, and the orders of destroying the village, of killing the people in the village, and I feel we did not violate any moral standards.\\" Was Calley a sociopath like Hoess?Hoess was also following orders, issued by Adolf Hitler. Were was his conscience? What happened to God's commandment \\"Thy Shalt Not Kill? Where was Hoess and Calley's guilt? Another mass murderer, Ted Bundy, a sadistic monster and mass manipulator whose grisly killing spree left at least 30 innocent young women dead, had this to say about guilt: \\"Guilt?The Only Living Witness: The True Story of Serial Sex Killer Ted BundyIt's this mechanism we use to control people. It's an illusion. It's a kind of social control mechanism-and it's very unhealthy. It does terrible things to our bodies. And there are much better ways to control our behavior rather than the extraordinary use of guilt. Now, some people could listen to what I just said and say \\"see, he's a sociopath.\\" or whatever term they use. I feel sorry for people who feel guilt.\\" Killing another human being is wrong any way you look at it.On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and SocietyWhether it is done on a mass scale such as was done by Hoess and the Nazi's during the Holocaust, or by a serial killer like Ted Bundy, or even using the excuse of a \\"Holy War\\", i.e. flying commercial airplanes into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11th, 2001 and killing all those innocent occupants of the Twin Towers in N.Y.C. Regardless, Hoess's book is an examination into the mind of a cold, sterile killer, a deed that history, or myself will never forgive nor forget. Do yourself a favor, read this book objectively and pray that this never occurs again for eternity's sake!"},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"If this is really the memoirs Rudolf Hoess...it was extemely informaive and a refelection on the evil stream of personalities that were responsible for one of the worlds genocide.

One currently offered has some extra parts that may not really change the context of the book but will shine some more light on the unclear situations. It's not a masterpiece but a relation of events that really gets down to the basic facts and realities of concentration camps and mass murder. One constantly may have to refer to appendixes due to the fact that Hoss (unconsciously or not) is trying to defend himself; that's why information given by him may be distorted a bit from the truth. This book provides very interesting insight on the mentality of the hard-core SS officer as well as on the gears of Nazi war machine. Putting aside his excuses and explanations even if they are convincing one will see a human nature being ruled and overtaken by natural instincts and hate.

It is an interesting study into the nature of an unremarkable, ordinary human who is able to rationalize 'death' as a simple job. That's the terrifying message of this book.I purchased this book following my visit to Auschwitz last Summer. I wanted to get some insight into the history and management of that awful place which led me to the purchase of the Hoss memoirs. Auschwitz, like Hoss's commentary, was so ordinary in it's architectural structures that I felt intimidated by the mundane nature of the place. If you relocated one of the barracks to a simpler setting, it wouldn't have neen noticed. That is scary !"},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Rudolph H&ouml;ss, Kommandant of Auschwitz Death Camp from May 1940 until November 1943 (returning during the summer of 1944 to supervise the annihilation of Hungarian Jews), was captured by the British too late for the Nuremberg Trials. He was consequently handed over to Poland where he was tried and eventually hanged for \\"Crimes Against the Polish People.\\" Crimes against Jews were not mentioned, and lest any reader think this was implied: it was not. Polish-born Jewish people were/are not considered Polish by Catholic Poles, and their extermination was not considered criminal.Although it is possibly true that H&ouml;ss's initial confession (to being ex-Kommandant of Auschwitz) was forced from him by British soldiers getting him drunk and beating him, most of this book was written by H&ouml;ss under relatively calm, comfortable conditions in a Polish prison at the suggestion of a prosecuting lawyer, both during and after the trial. He wrote with relish, not forgetting to praise his Polish captors for their kind and considerate treatment of him - no doubt brought about by his having supervised the murder of possibly a million Jews. (Figures vary, those given today by the Polish government being higher than those estimated by some others. Adolf Eichmann's calculation was the highest - he was apparently the only person who held lists - and the Jewish people have not ventured to supply an official estimate - for them it is impossible, as hundreds of thousands were simply gassed or burnt directly upon arrival, without being registered at either Auschwitz l or II (Birkenau), and new-born babies were thrown by SS into pits of fire before anyone knew about them.H&ouml;ss was not a literate man, and sometimes it is difficult to follow his line of thought. The translation does not help much, as it is clumsy and German words are often anglicized - annoying in the extreme - as though American English is the only language recognizable to readers. Zyklon B becomes Cyclon B, sounding like a cycling vacation. The numberednotes are astonishingly inaccurate:Gustave M Gilbert (Note 7, p. 164) is referred to as the \\"court-appointed psychiatrist at the Nuremberg war crimes trial.\\"G M Gilbert was not a psychiatrist. His qualification was a Ph.D in Psychology from Columbia University. After WWII he was appointed Prison Psychologist of the German Prisoners, and also participated in the Nuremberg Trials as the American Military Chief Psychologist. This is utterly different from being a Psychiatrist. (See Leon Goldensohn, \\" The Nuremberg Interviews\\", Pimlico 2006, and any other of numerous sources including Gilbert's own \\"Nuremberg Diary.\\")Note 3, p. 148, referring to \\"Action Reinhardt,\\" is confusing and incomplete. Aktion Reinhard(t) is generally known as the Code Name for the systematic murder of the Jews of Poland carried out at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka in 1942 and 1943 as part of the \\"Final Solution.\\" For some explanation of H&ouml;ss's (and the editor's) lack of knowledge, it is worth reading pp. 208 and 289 in Roderick Stackelberg's \\"The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany\\", Routledge 2007.In Appendix II, page 363, under the date September 5 1944, the information is almost totally incorrect: Anne Frank and her family arrived from Westerbork, not Westerbrook. Anne's sister was Margot, not Edith, and it was Margot who died of typhus at Bergen-Belsen. The cause of Anne's death - also at Bergen-Belsen - is uncertain. Her mother was Edith, and she died at Auschwitz, cause uncertain. Mr Frank, the father, survived the war.It is inexcusable that this book could have been proof-read, edited and published with all these errors. It indicates a total lack of respect and simply a desire to make money from sensationalism. It also casts doubt on the accuracy of the rest of H&ouml;ss's \\"Death Dealer\\": Are translations accurate? Have items been added or omitted, simply on an editor's whim or because of laziness? This book is supposed to be history, but falls so far short that I am no longer surprised at people who deny its truth. For myself, however, I do not deny its basic truth. Plentiful errors aside, all the horrors within H&ouml;ss's tale certainly occurred. There is too much corroboration from too many other witnesses, and cross-referencing invariably turns out to be accurate.H&ouml;ss's personal \\"memoirs\\", his account of the Final Solution, his profiles of the camps and descriptions of various SS members, his thoughts and final letters to his family are undeniably fascinating, even while they are chilling, angry-making and horrifying. All of it reads like a very long, peevish grumble, and that is the only amusing aspect of the book: everything that went wrong was someone else's fault. Brutality towards prisoners occurred because his staff were inefficient and disobedient. If we read this in conjunction with Danuta Czech's \\"Auschwitz Chronicle\\" (Henry Holt & Company 1989), on June 17 1941 we find that \\"Kommandant H&ouml;ss selects 10 prisoners ... and condemns them to starve to death [in the bunker of Block 11] in retaliation for the escape of [one prisoner].\\" On 24 June 1941: \\"Kommandant H&ouml;ss chooses 10 hostages ... in retaliation for another prisoner's escape and condemns them to starve to death ...\\" Entries like these make it evident that, even while writing at his life's end, he lied about almost everything, as well as complaining about almost everyone. This daily barbarity ceased when H&ouml;ss temporarily left Auschwitz in November 1943, and was replaced by Arthur Liebehenschel whose threats against those committing random acts of brutality were immediately heeded. Of course the daily gassings continued almost unimpeded, while Kommandant and others watched impassively. H&ouml;ss also comments on the \\"attitude\\" of the Sonderkommando, young Jews condemned to send their fellow Jews to their deaths and then incinerate the corpses, writing about how \\"unmoved\\" those \\"Jews\\" were. Any human sensibilities on his part would have told him that these children, for children they were, knew they would be shot on the spot if they displayed emotion. They were determined to live, to tell their story, and indeed two of them did survive.H&ouml;ss's lies throughout the book are mostly transparent and unintelligent. And, as Primo Levi writes in his Foreword, \\"... we are stunned by his obstinacy in lying until his very last breath.\\" He claims remorse, saying he felt \\"cold shudders\\" upon learning \\"of the horrible tortures ... that took place in Auschwitz and in other camps.\\" This, from the man who with a frozen, impassive face watched hundreds of thousands of naked men, women and children pushed and shoved into gas chambers, year after year after year. The man who chose random prisoners to die by starvation.One issue in particular grabs the reader's attention. In summer 1941, Himmler summoned H&ouml;ss to a private conference during which he told him that Auschwitz was to be the biggest and finest killing centre of the Jews, saying that \\"The Jews are the eternal enemies of the German people and must be exterminated ... \\" and plenty more. One wonders just why the Jews are \\"the eternal enemies\\": much further on in H&ouml;ss's memoirs we find out that it is because they (the Jews) wish to integrate with the German people! This must be prevented at all costs! Towards the end, while waiting for his death sentence to be carried out, he writes, \\"Today I realize that the extermination of the Jews was wrong, absolutely wrong. The cause of anti-Semitism was not served by this act at all, in fact, just the opposite.\\" The mind boggles at the \\"CAUSE\\" of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is actually a CAUSE to which people dedicate themselves?? And then one remembers that Rudolph H&ouml;ss came from a Catholic family, that he describes his father as a \\"fanatic Catholic\\", and the penny drops. Anti-Semitism has indeed always been a \\"cause\\" of the Catholic Church, no less now than it was then. And it has been tremendously successful. Its indoctrination of most of Europe's population, picked up with glee by civilian administrations, led to the murder of more than six million Jews, and continues to this day, resulting still in almost-daily, random attacks against Jewish people. Poland still persists with its anti-Semitic radio station, and the Vatican raises no objections.This book at last solves an issue that has always caused puzzlement: The white vans marked with the Red Cross symbol, used daily to take people to gas chambers and to remove corpses. I had innocently imagined that the Nazis simply painted Red Crosses on white vans to fool their victims. Not so. H&ouml;ss, with something that reads like shame, admits that these were indeed Red Cross vans. The German Red Cross was fully involved in the destruction of Europe's Jews, and was forced to disband after WWII. It has since become apparent that the International Committee of the Red Cross was also involved. Careful searching of relevant literature states the case clearly and consistently.The book concludes with three horrifying and intensely depressing Appendices: The first describes the \\"Incident at Budy\\", which can lead to nightmares. The second consists of excerpts from Danuta Czech's immaculate \\"Auschwitz Chronicle.\\" The third is the Minutes of the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942, a conference set up to discuss the decision already made: its protocol, its secrecy, and the \\"best\\" and \\"most efficient\\" methods of annihilation.All-in-all, an amazing book containing a plethora of information. It is unfortunate that the editing is poor and the Notes are inaccurate. This evidences a carelessness and disrespect that the Shoah does not deserve."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"This is the story about how badly the Germans hate the Jewish people. They hate them so much, that its OK to persecute them, beat them, drive them out of their homes, force them into boxcars and transport them to an extermination camp where they can be gassed and burned. Its so sick that a race of people like the Germans expended so much energy in an effort to exterminate the Jewish people. The memoirs of Hoss show how these Germans were cold and cruel to the Jews, how they treated these souls and turned them into disease bearing animals. Hoss claims he was just following orders from Himmler and the others and that he did nothing wrong because if he disobeyed the orders to exterminate the Jews, he would have been done away with as well. Hoss details the extermination process and gives numbers in the hundreds of thousands of people that were exterminated at Auschwitz, the number one killing center of the German government. Hoss explains how the transports of tens of thousands of Jews from all over Europe were tricked into believing they were getting a shower and how people were ignorant of their fate until the very end. Hoss profiles other high ranking SS officers and takes no blame for the horrible atrocities that took place while he was camp commandant. This book profiles the sickness of the German government and of the German people themselves, how could the German people claim ignorance of the stench of burning flesh. After 9/11 I was in Whitestone Queens miles away from the inferno and I could smell the burning flesh of 3,000 souls, imagine 300,000 souls, this book shows you the sickness of these people and of their mindset"},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"When I first read that Rudolf Hoss' memoirs were being published, I approached the situation with a certain amount of caution. Rudolf Hoss and his memoirs has been the subject of much scrutiny and speculation over these last few decades. It was suggested, a few years after the conclusion of World War Two, that Hoss had been &quot;encouraged&quot; to confess and indeed admit his guilt in his memoirs. Historical documentation has proven that Hoss was physically abused for a prolonged period of time after his arrest. A few authors, most notably David Irving, have suggested that his memoirs are indeed tainted. The original manuscript contained several different styles of handwriting, some of which was in English (!). That said, I read the Hoss memoirs with a certain degree of suspicion. I suspect that most of the memoirs are accurate and true, but I would not hesitate to speculate that they might have been doctored. Why they would have been doctored, I'm not sure. Perhaps to guarantee his execution or for post-war purposes unbeknownst. Parts of the text of this book seem to be translated rather poorly as well. The German to English conversion did not always seem very faithful, and in a few instances awkward and incorrect (it makes me wonder what the editor was doing!).

Sadly, even when a person like H&ouml;ss who truly believed to be a decent human being, places before your eyes his dark side, in an attempt to explain why he became what he became, you still can not understand which is the side of the conscience that shuts down to consider normal the destruction of other beings, just because a leader or a newspaper says that we shall hate them.The world is so estrange that right now, after the Jews suffered such terrible prosecution and destruction, many of the now citizens of Israel do not have any inconvenience to kill, humiliate or exploit their fellow neighbors and bothers of Palestina, just because they are afraid of them. H&ouml;ss was also afraid of the Jews but such fear does not justify his actions. Why do we still believe that fear is a just cause for our abuses is something that neither this book nor any lecture about political struggles will show us.

Hoess explains very clearly the history, structure and mission of the camps (not just Auschwitz) to include just about every aspect, from blockleader, Kapo, guard to Kommandant, even discussing the pros and cons of using dogs as guards. His descriptions of the gassing process are spellbinding and shocking all at once, you feel almost obcene while reading them as if you were the one looking through the peep-hole in the door as these poor peole die...it is that vivid. He describes the architectural concerns that were taken into account while designing and building (book contains diagrams and photos as well) the crematoriums. He does not deny his role, but he does fall back on the old &quot;just following orders&quot; excuse, and saying that he was betrayed by the higher up in the Nazi party. He describes some unusual things in this book, for example, he tells of how well his children got along with the inmates, asking for cigarettes to pass out to them, he speaks of the most daring and ingenious escapes that he witnessed while while in the camps, he speaks of the difficulties that could be avoided by fooling inmates into thinking up to the last moment that they were really only going the shower, not an execution/murder, he recalls some of the most haunting words and deeds of prisoners just before the doors to the gas chamber were closed. There is one recollection that really disturbed me, it concerned a young girl who somehow survives the Cyclone-B gassing under a pile of fellow prisoners, is revived, given food and clothes only to be discovered by a guard and executed. Hoess describes fellow SS personalities from Himmler down to common guards. There are lots of other things of intrest in this book, too many to list. Hoess claims that he was beaten into his confession, yet he provides astounding details when finally given the chance to speak. He tried to change his name and hide after the war, that alone should tell you he knew he had done wrong. He does admit to being the largest mass murderer in history in this book. This is disturbing book, it will stay with you a long time after you are finished reading."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"There have been several reviewers asking the who and why and how questions relating to the question of those that commit Genocide. This book by no means answers all of these questions. There are strong arguments that there are no real answers to the atrocities that were committed, and by what means the thousands that were needed to implement them did bring themselves to do so. This book is interesting as it is a first person account of the man who supervised Auschwitz, a man considered the individual to have supervised well over 2,000,000 murders.The only reason this lacks a 5th star is that there is some question as to whether or not everything Rudolpf Hoss wrote is 100% accurate. As this man was heading toward his death, it is generally felt that what is written represents his true feelings and thoughts about what he did.This memoir/diary was written during his incarceration prior to his eventual execution, over a period of time from October of 1946 to April of 1947.This is not a pleasant book; the pictures that are a part of it were even more horrific for me, as they accompanied the text of the man who created the situations that are depicted. This work is also difficult as you read of a life that starts in no remarkable way, yet leads to this individual becoming one of the key players in the actual implementation of The Holocaust.The horror in the tale is the manner he carried out his tasks. He did not place any distance between himself and the day-to-day activities. He was fully immersed in them, and in many cases was there designer. He was central to the methods developed for the methodically efficient killing, the gas to be used, and disposal of victims.When you get to the end you will understand more about one mind that participated in an unthinkable act. Your questions may not be all answered, but you will have gained a valuable insight into the mind of one of the perpetrators of this 20th century slaughter."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"This book provides a first hand account about the youth, carrier and the personal participation in the Holocaust, extermination of gypsies, russian prisoners and other human beings, of a man that was Kommandant at Auschwitz, from 1940 until 1943 and then Chief of the Department of Inspectors of the Concentration Camps.Rudolph H?ss, a man with a psychopathic personality, tells a gruesome, personal and detailed tale about the inception of Auschwitz, the logistical problems of its expansion, the gassings, his quarreling with other camp commanders due to their unproficiency, with the detachment and the normalcy of a bureaucrat, all of which not only makes a case study in the psychiatry of mass murder, but also recalls the concept of the banality of evil, elaborated by Hanna Arendt in her book about Adolph Eichmann's trial ( no surprise here, since these two fellows used to cooperate in their endeavour).The reasons given for their participation in the crimes committed, reveal the danger of a totalitarian or fanatical education, not only for the feeble minded, but also for \\"normal people\\" without a clear perception of the distinction between evil and good, from an ethical standpoint. Reading this book we confirm the distinction made by the scholars between the psyche of a serial killer (an intimate act) and that of the mass murderer (ideologically driven detachment).H?ss tells us about an infancy without real love, and how he couldn't relate with affection to his parents, sister, and then his wife. After he marries, his real dream is to have a farm, but the opportunity is given to him to enter in the S.S. by Himmler himself. In Auschwitz, he claims never to have mistreated personally any prisoner and that he always behaved in a professional manner. However, his detached or impersonal fight against what the S.S. taught him to be the COMMON ENEMY, involved a participation in the first experimentation of Cyclon B in order to find a more expedient and humane manner to kill hundreds of thousand faceless human beings. And we must believe H?ss when he tells us that the methods of shooting all the poor devils or gassing them with carbon monoxide, were in fact burdensome, logistically complicated and not that \\"human\\".Regarding his personal attitude towards the gassings, we get a perverse but fascinating explanation of how difficult it was for H?ss to bury all his human inhibitions, so as not to give a bad example to the other \\"employees\\" of Auschwitz. In order to better understand, I have selected this paragraph:\\"On one occasion two little children were involved ina game they were playing and their mother justcouldn't tear them away from it. Even the jews from the Sonderkommando didn't want to pick up the children. Iwill never forget the pleading look in the face of themother, who certainly knew what was happening. Thepeople in the gas chamber were becoming restless.Everyone was looking at me. I had to act. I gave thesergeant in charge a wave, and he picked up the screaming, kicking children in his arms and brought them in thegas chamber along with the mother, who was weeping inthe most heart-braking fashion. Believe me, I felt like shrinking into the ground out of pity, but I was notallowed to show the slightest emotion. Hour upon hourI had to witness all that happened. I had to watchday and night, whether it was the dragging and burningof the bodies, the teeth being ripped out, the cuttingof the hair; I had to watch all this horror..... I alsohad to watch the process of death itself though thepeephole of the gas chamber because the doctors calledmy attention to it. I had to do all of this because Iwas the one to whom everyone looked, and because I hadto show everybody that I was not only the one who gavethe orders and issued the directives, but that I waswilling to be present at whatever task I ordered the mento perform.\\"The fine foreword by the italian writer Primo Levi, himself a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, refers to the two main reasons to bring out and divulge this book after so long. The first, to neutralize the efforts of the revisionists. The accurate description and details given by H?ss, confirmed by his testimony at Nuremberg, by the survivors and material evidence, prevent the possibility of denying or downscaling the gassings at Auschwitz. The second reason is to present, in graphic manner, the ultimate consequences of accepting blindly a totalitarian ideology."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"On April 16, 1947, Rudolph Hoess, the infamous Kommandant of Auschwitz was hanged in his former concentration camp for, \\"crimes against the Polish people.\\" While awaiting trial, Hoess, who knew he would pay for his crimes with his life, sought to renew the spiritual connection he had eschewed as a youth. Accordingly, he recounted his time in the SS for his captors. His story is also that of the darkest side of the Third Reich.The book begins with a discussion of the, \\"final solution,\\" of the Jewish Question. He tells how he was ordered to establish a camp at Auschwitz for the purpose of eliminating, \\"enemies of the state.\\" Details of camp construction and experiments to find the appropriate gas he describes without emotion. Yet he relates questions asked by young SS soldiers and inmates as to how small children could be an \\"enemy.\\" His \\"party line\\" response fooled some, but never himself.Hoess also describes the victims he tried to destroy. Jews had \\"strong family ties;\\" gypsies were, \\"childlike;\\" the Jehovah's Witnesses were worthy of emulation. The SS was challenged to have the same devotion to the Fuhrer as they had to Jehovah. In chapter 22 he describes the gassing process as only he could do. His primary concern was to dispatch his victims quickly and efficiently without displaying emotion that would affect young guards. Here, he admits, he hid behind an iron mask. Particularly interesting is the story of a young, extremely attractive, Jewish girl who fought back even as she was undressing for the gas chamber. Resistance was rare but in this case, effective, very effective!The book describes his early life and the events that caused him and many others to blindly follow the SS motto: \\"Fuhrer, you order. We obey!\\" Hoess gives a detailed description of the hierarchy of the SS. Men, who had been portrayed as super-human, are shown to have been far short of that ideal. Alcoholism and suicide rates were high; competence was low! Still, operations continued despite all difficulties because, \\"Orders were orders!\\"Death Dealer is a first person account of the operations of the most infamous death camp in history. After sending an estimated 2.5 million people to their deaths, the Kommandant, ended his life by doing one decent thing: he left his memoirs so no one could deny this ever happened. For that, the world owes Rudoph Hoess, the Kommandant of Auschwitz, a debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"This book shows how a blind adherance to 'doing one's duty' can lead to horrifying results. The calmness in which Hoess relates his story is disturbing. Regardless of whatever was in this man's background that led to his beliefs and actions does not lessen the lack of morals and ethics exhibited by him, unless a person's actions can be merely attributed to his upbringing.Unfortunately, the real value of this book is not recognized by recent events in Bosnia, Palestine, Israel, and other parts of the world. 'Ethnic cleansing' is a term I detest. Why not call it what it is, mass murder with a capital 'M'. There is no room for euphemisms when it comes to millions of people being slaughtered.A disturbing book indeed, but one that should be more widely read and understood. None of us should ever forget what happened at the hands of the criminals that ruled Germany at that point in history. I only wish the lessons that we could have learned from it all would have been better learned.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"This book is by far the single most important book about the Holocaust. Rudolf Hoess wrote these memoirs while he was drying off in prison after his capture by the British. Voluntarily, he wrote in detail about his life, as well as some pretty nasty occurances which occured in Auschwitz. Hoess was the type who denied personal responsibility with all the atrocities which occured in Auschwitz. He himself said that he never personally had anything against the Jews and he never killed one--let alone tourtured one--yet he authorised the murder of some four million inmates. His memoirs, aside from the odd bout of denial of responsibility, are a rare piece of information into both the nature and workings of the Holocaust and they serve as a terrific example of how one stupid man let his family-oriented sense of obeying orders and duty get the best of him. Everybody should read this book, for inside it are the writings of the first Kommandant of Auschwitz: one who watched millions of innocent human beings dissolve in the gas chambers, burn in the crematoriums, and their teeth melted into gold bars. His greatest crime of all was the submission into the workings of this terrifying regime, while forgetting all human nature and feelings, and acting only on behalf of orders and a sense of duty. I repeat, this is a must read for everybody, whether or not they are interested in the Holocaust, for it also serves as a very big lessson to never, ever, no matter what, let a senseless killing of people take place again. If we do not learn from this, and such a thing happens again, then there may be not a single survivor to live and tell the tale."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"My opinion is based on the comparison with the orginal publication in German, which I purchased in 1960 to provide essential information for the subsequent psychiatric evaluations of several thousand Holocaust survivors."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Torture, death, &amp; the atrocities of war are not easily swallowed or digested by those who were neither there nor on the receiving end of the realities, but one has to read the words of Rudolf Hoess and belieive them to be what they are -HIS BELIEFS. Too many historical biographies of the SS leave one with the taste of the writers interpretation of the person, and we are all left to wonder about truths, half-truths, desires &amp; perceptions. Some even take their word as gospel. History becomes anything the writer wants it to become for whatever reason he feels he needs to express the information. This book gives one the reality of Hoess according to Hoess - and a foundation for our own interpretations of his psychological make-up. I am an American of Polish descent, having many friends &amp; family (both Polish Roman Catholic &amp; Polish Jew) personally affected by this man during WWll - and it was like a breath of fresh air to hear his side so that I may put the pieces of the puzzle together to get a more complete picture of what was really going on. I try and live my life as non-judgementally as I can, believing understanding is far better than blame - and understanding how this man was raised gives me greater insight into what he had become. Like many who found this book hard to read, I found it easy - for it was his perception of the truth. I may not like his &quot;truth&quot; and I may not agree with his &quot;truth&quot; - but I am not in a position to deny it.

He also provides glimes into his childhood, his experiences in WW1, joining the Nazi party and his years in prison- plenty of imformation for pyschologist today to peek into the mind of a mad man. In short Hoess writes with the manial coolness of a real life Hannibal Lecter."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"I give this book five stars because of its historical value. This work not only gives insight into the mind of the leader of perhaps the greatest death factory ever built, but also allows a clearing-up of some errors that have accreted in the decades since that horrible time.Hoess rejected God and the Church (p. 52-53, 57, 59, 72, 192), having rebelled against his father's wish that he become a priest. Like Himmler, he became an Artaman (pp. 202-203; a communal movement resembling the 1960's US communes, albeit Teutonic-centered) before switching to Nazism for his substitute religion.Hoess wrote: \\"Until the beginning of 1942 the main body of prisoners was Polish.\\" (p. 128). Many Poles were murdered secretly (the cause of death listed as natural), \\"...because of political and security reasons...\\" (p. 224).During the Auschwitz Carmelite convent controversy, attempts were made to belittle the victimhood of Auschwitz Poles through the premise that they, unlike most Jews, were not generally killed upon arrival at Auschwitz. Hoess, in contrast, rejected any such dichotomy (if anything, praising the slow-death genocidal methods--as perfected by the Communists): \\"The Gestapo delivered the prisoners to the camps to be exterminated. It made no difference to them whether it happened by firing squad, gas, or by the horrible conditions in the camps. It was part of their plan not to improve conditions in the camps...Thus, the concentration camps were changed deliberately, and sometimes unintentionally, into large-scale extermination centers. The Kommandants received extensive composite reports from the Gestapo about the Soviet concentration camps. Escaped prisoners had made reports about the conditions and organization of these camps down to the smallest detail. They emphasized that by using forced labor methods the Soviets were annihilating entire nationalities.\\" (pp. 168-169).Holocaust-uniqueness advocates sometimes claim that the genocide of the Polish intelligentsia, unlike that of Jews, served a rational purpose--the elimination of resistance. Actually, the latter was, at most, a hoped-for byproduct of this nation-destroying act: \\"I want to add this, that the general opinion at SS headquarters was that the total annihilation of the Polish intelligentsia would also destroy the resistance movement. [SS Major] Thomsen was an ardent defender of this theory.\\" (p. 322).Initial plans to kill all Jews gave way to the sparing of some of them for forced labor (p. 34).Hoess discussed the Jewish Sonderkommando in considerable detail. Those Jews temporarily got to save their lives by dutifully assisting in the deception, gassing, despoiling, and cremation of their fellow Jews. He also observed Jew-against-Jew behavior by some Jews who had no hope of postponing their own deaths. As they entered the gas chambers, they told Germans the addresses of fugitive Jews back home. Hoess commented: \\"I cannot explain what motivated them to reveal this information. Was it personal revenge, or were they jealous because they did not want the others to live on?\\" (p. 160).In common with many Germans, Hoess attempts to rationalize his exterminatory conduct by equating it with the Allied bombings of German women and children. He estimates German civilian casualties in the several millions (p. 171), which is at least a 20-fold exaggeration.As for lebensraum, Hoess belatedly concluded that Germany could have achieved it peacefully (p. 182).Hoess suggested that crude propaganda such as Der Sturmer had hindered the development of scientific anti-Semitism (p. 140). He also came to believe that the extermination of Jews only brought hatred against Germany and increased Jewish power by discrediting anti-Semitism (p. 183).This volume isn't limited to Hoess' memoirs. The entire Wannsee Protocol is printed in translation. It is obvious that the choice of Poland as the site of the German death camps was based solely on practical considerations (minimalized transportation) and had nothing to do with real or stereotyped Polish attitudes towards Jews: \\"State Secretary Dr. Buehler declared that the government of Occupied Poland would welcome it if the final solution to this question would be started in Occupied Poland. His reason: transport plays no important role here and the deployment of workers during the operation would not cause any problems.\\" (p. 380)."},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","review":"Amazing new angle into the horrors of the concentration camp.

It is a challenging historical source because, on the one hand, Hoss is awaiting execution and lying cannot help him; on the other hand, he is shaping his legacy and is susceptible to whitewashing parts of the record to cast himself in a better light. Hoss' narrative covers his childhood through his arrest and capture. While mostly an autobiography, the book is necessarily a history of Auschwitz itself. The descriptions of life in the camp are horrifying; more so because Hoss is able to convey so much misery from the happier side of the fence. Hoss also waxes freely about several members of the SS and provides invaluable insight into the private sphere of the Nazi leadership. My edition of the book (Da Capo Press, 1996) includes cogent photographs and diagrams to illustrate the camp system, along with appendices that outline the history of Auschwitz. The edition also has a Foreword by Primo Levi, which is excellent, but I recommend reading his essay after finishing the book so his points are easier to appreciate.

Unblinking and remorseless, Hoss tells us in his own words about the twisted mentality of the SS and its officers in unflinching detail.

But that was back in Manila. Back, during a time, when her family had more money than they could count. Her mother, the owner of a booming restaurant in which the Manila president ate at herself, and her father, a businessman with all the right connections. But then, inexplicably, everything was different. Suddenly, Vicenza's parents, who always seemed quite content in their Manila dwellings, abruptly decide to leave for America, \\"the land of the free and the home of the brave,\\" where countless opportunities will come their way. Unfortunately, here we are, months later, and things aren't going as smoothly as the Ambrullo family originally hoped. Sure, Chips Ahoy cookies are dirt cheap here in the States, but everything else is fairly expensive, including the rent on their home. Vicenza doesn't have it easy either. Luckily her problems don't really revolve around money, instead, they revolve around your typical, run-of-the-mill dilemmas, like being the new girl. As a brainiac, Vicenza didn't have any trouble landing a great scholarship to Grosvernor High School. Surviving there is another story. Every girl is blonde and beautiful, with money oozing out of their pores, and private planes to jet them off to the South of France whenever they feel like a little topless sun-bathing. Basically, everyone is beyond snooty, and refuse to even give Vicenza the time of day. After all, no one swathed in Gucci would ever dream of hanging with a girl who spends her afternoons working at the Sears cafeteria her mother set-up, or rifling through the sales racks at the Salvation Army, searching for a cashmere sweater that is devoid of holes. But all that changes when Vicenza meets Isobel Saint-Pierre, a French math wiz, with a love for the offbeat. Isobel becomes Vicenza's solace, and confidant, something that she hasn't had since she left her best friend, Peaches, behind in Manila. And even though she and Peaches confer through e-mail, everything Vicenza says is a lie, trying to make her life sound better in America. But then things actually do get better, when Vicenza meets Claude Caligari. Claude is the most gorgeous boy Vicenza has ever seen - aside from Tobey McGuire - and she's determined to get him to ask her to Grosvernor's yearly Soiree d'Hiver, a beyond fancy dance that gives everyone the chance to dress up in expensive gowns, and dance the night away. Unfortunately, Vicenza is nothing more than a clueless geometry partner to Claude. Someone he ignores three days a week, as he speaks over the teacher, and manages to earn the lowest geometry grades Vicenza has ever seen. Still, Vicenza finds him dreamy, and, with a little help, she believes she'll be able to snag the guy of her dreams. But when she learns that the flirty fox is harboring a girlfriend, Vicenza sees her chance quickly slipping through her grasp. And it will only be through a little self-realization that she'll be able to see what's truly lying right before her eyes.Immigration is such a large part of today's society. However, we rarely get to see the effects of immigrating to a new culture through the eyes of a present-day teenager. Melissa de la Cruz seems to have embraced that idea within the pages of FRESH OFF THE BOAT, and turned it into a fun, inspirational, humorous learning experience. Vicenza is reminiscent of Meg Cabot's Mia Thermopolis - of THE PRINCESS DIARIES. She's awkward, and attempting to fit in at a new school. Of course, there is one extreme difference between the two, Vicenza is an immigrant, learning to navigate the streets of San Francisco, and find her niche in the American world. Vicenza isn't your typical teenage protagonist. She spends much of her time with her head buried in a book, and is hardworking. Not everything is handed to her on a silver platter, and she does what she can to please the people around her. Sure, Vicenza likes guy-watching, and gossip fests, but she's more brainy than many, and is quite goal-oriented and determined. She must contend with her lottery-obsessed parents, who seems to be in the midst of the biggest culture-shock of their lives, and is often made fun of by her wealthier classmates, yet she never really lets the ridicule get her down. Her relationship with Isobel Saint-Pierre is one of the aspects of FRESH OFF THE BOAT that adds a humorous touch to an otherwise sensitive, slightly harsh subject. Isobel is quirky and cool, and could care less what anyone thinks of her. She's obsessed with lycra, and feathers, and rides - dangerously, I might add - all over the place atop a Vespa. Isobel is like Vicenza's rock. She's supportive and carefree, and honestly cares about Vicenza, and any problems she may encounter. While Peaches was Vicenza's best friend for years in Manila, the reader may notice that her relationship with Isobel is much stronger, simply because she doesn't feel the need to lie about her social standing to her, as she does with Peaches. Together, Vicenza and Isobel make an indomitable pair, as the two work side-by-side to adjust to the harsh realities and rules the United States has to offer. Riddled with humorous episodes, and interesting flashbacks to Vicenza's days in Manila; along with a few very unexpected revelations, FRESH OFF THE BOAT is a FRESH addition to the de la Cruz collection.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Fresh Off the Boat","review":"Vicenza is having a hard time adjusting to life in San Francisco.

Her life gets so bad that she actually goes to the movies with her family on a Friday night. Finally, V, as her friends call her, befriends Isobel, the French exchange student, who helps V see that if the other girls don't want her, she doesn't want them, and also helps Vincenza snag the boy she wants. With excellently written characters and sprinkled with emails of her new \\"glamorous\\" (fictional) life to her friend back home in Manila, this book will be relatable for any girl who has ever felt out of place."},{"Title":"Fresh Off the Boat","review":"Vicenza's family moves to California from Manila, hoping to start a better life after a family friend embezzles all their money; but it gets a lot worse. At Vicenza's new school, Grosvernor High, she gets picked on for not wearing the newest fashion trends. Her only friend Isobel doesn't wear the newest fashions but styles of her own and still look hot in it. Vicenza's family television shoe video smuggling gets caught by the police,and is shut down. Now her family suffers with money and have to work extra hard at their cafeteria to earn more money. Once things calm down, Vicenza makes the top five slut list at Grosvernor School, as the number one slut after she is caught in the bathroom with Whitney's boyfriend Claude Caligari. Vicenza goes on her first date with Paul, a boy who works at Sears, after the aproval of her parents. They already knew him from their cafeteria, so they easily accepted the date. It was at the movies when Vicenza got her first kiss during the Stephen King Movie. I recommend this book for teens or adults who are fit for a wild narrative of a foreign teen.The book Fresh Off the Boat is realistic fiction. In this book there are stores like Sears, Mc Donalds, Outback Steakhouse,and Hechts, and movies like Stephen King and Bruce Almighty. There are also television shows like American Idol, The Real World, Fear Factor, and Primetime Live. More realistic themes in this novel are the trends. From ballroom-dancing to foxtrot, cha-cha, and the tango. Another realistic part in this book is how the characters in this book talk, act, and dress, like the teenagers actually do in real life middle and high schools. Everyone in Grosvernor High dresses in the newest trends, or at least the middle class and rich teens did. If you weren't seen in the latest trends or styles, then you are considered invisible.Vicenza parents were way over protective when it came to shopping, boys, cell phones, looks, and being totally cool. They gave Vicenza a cell phone but only because everyday they want to find out what time Vicenza was going to get to the cafe from school. Also when she was picking out a dress for the Montclair Academy-Grosvernor School for Girls Annual Soiree'd'Hiver. Vicenza's mom picked out a flashback to the 1980's dress, wtih three layers of ruffles, alternates pink and black, and has a butt bow. Instead of a more mature drees like a strapless mini dress with sparkes or a formal tank and frilly mini skirt.Whitney, Georgia, and Trish the popular Grosvernor girls did anything to pick on anyone who didn't dress in the latest trends,were recieving more attention then they were, or did anything really bad to humiliate themselves. Like when Vicenza was having trouble balancing a ball on a paddle they mimicked her all day, causing her to hide in the bathroom for the next class period. Or like when Vicenza got caught in the bathroom with Claude, Whitney's boyfriend, and they posted her name on a website, www.topfiveslutsatgrosvernorschool.com, as the number one slut at Grosvernor School for Girls. When Claude asked Isobel and Vicenza to tutor him in Geometry so he could stay captain of the lacrosse team, he was spending more time with them than Whitney. So she called them Claude's \\"loser girl study group,\\" or the L.G.S.G., as Isobel and Vicenza called it.Fresh Off the Boat was a very well written realistic fiction book for teens or young adults. Whitney, Georgia, and Trish did anything they could to make sure everyone uncool stayed uncool and invisible. Even Vicenza's parents kept her from being cool, they never let her wear mini skirts or shop at the botiques for the hottest new trends. Instead Viecnza steadily worked at her families cafeteria business at Sears to occupy her social life, that she didn't have. Since she moved to America her life became a nightmare.T.Brown"},{"Title":"Fresh Off the Boat","review":"Vicenza decides to lie in e-mails to her friend back in Manila named Peaches to impress her with details of her new life in America. Vicenza is a girl who came from Manila to America in hope to start a new life with the mother, father, and sister. When they get here they are forced to change and the go from high to low class in almost an instant. She pretends to have tons of friends and be popular when e-mailing her friend, although it is not true. She really only has one friend and no one really wants to talk to her. In the end, she ends up slowly telling Peaches the truth about her life and starts excepting the things that she has. This is a good book for people who like girly books because it was mainly about a teenage girls' life and how coming to America changes it.When Vicenza comes to America her life begins to change drastically. Vicenza and her family start to shop at the Salvation Army when they moved here and they used to shop at the Neiman Marcus. Her mom used to own a big restaurant now she owns a mall worker's cafeteria slot. He father used to own a big business but now he owns a one-man shop.She would lie in e-mails to Peaches telling her that her life was more glorious than it really was. At first she lied about going to the movies with popular girls, but really just went with her family. She also lied about buying clothes at the mall when she really got them from the Salvation Army. Vicenza lied about Claude, the popular boy, asking her the her school's annual Soiree when a geek named Freddie really did.Vicenza only had one true friend at her school. Her only friend was a French girl named Isobel. They went everywhere together and were even in many classes together until Isobel got switched out because she was very verysmart. Isobel and Vicenza also got in trouble many times together like when they snuck out and went to Claude's house or a party.This book is mainly about a girl whose life changes when she arrives in America, therefore I would recommend it to people who like the girly type of book. Fresh Off the Boat by Melissa De La Cruz was a very good book because it showed how w girl transitioned and strived to act popular although she really wasn't."},{"Title":"Fresh Off the Boat","review":"This is a good book about a fourteen year old girl who came from the phillipines for her first year of high school. She goes through different changes and tries to adapt to the American lifestyle, and also by trying to be popular at school too. This is a good book if you want to read something good or just want to read about highschool life."},{"Title":"Fresh Off the Boat","review":"Vicenza is a new arrival in the land of the free...and she's not exactly loving it. After having to leave her wealthy home in Manila for questionable reasons, she's having a hard time adjusting. Her parents are totally clueless, and so obviously immigrants. No one at her school will talk to her, and she has to struggle to keep up her grades for her scholarship. Vicenza has one friend, a quicky french girl who is an outcast just like her. Between working for her parents all the time and school, V has no life. Then she starts crushing on one of the most popular guys around. V sends emails full of lies about her\\"fabulous\\" life to her pals back home. On top of everything, the big formal is coming up, and V has the ugliest dress and the biggest loser for a date. Will V overcome her \\"fresh off the boat\\" status and adjust to life in America?"},{"Title":"Life in a Railway Factory Spec Hb","review":"Alfred Williams book, Life in Railway Factory is nicely written. He paints a convincing picture of the highs and lows of factory life and the honourable and otherwise behaviour of the staff, both high and low.I tried to acquire a copy in kindle format, but eventually acquired an e-copy as PDF file from the University of Illinois Library (333.8 W67l). I was disappointed that I could not read the PDF version of Life in a Railway Factory on Kindle reader, so I am reading it on my PC ususing adobe.I really recommend it. Last week,(12/13 Nov 2010) a local theatre group put on a fantastic play/opera 'The Hammerman' - Alfred Williams' life, in the Railway Museum in Swindon using material from his various poems and books. Having read much of the book, I enjoyed the production so much more.I hope Amazon will make this book and other Alfred Williams' work available on Kindle.Peter"},{"Title":"Life in a Railway Factory Spec Hb","review":"Alfred Williams, \\"The Hammerman Poet\\", worked in the Great Western Railway Works in Swindon at the height of its development, and published this detailed but human account of every part of that major enterprise just before the First World War. He writes from the workers' point of view, and doesn't have much time for bosses, capitalism or even foremen. For rail enthusiasts, social historians, or for those who like myself are researching ancestors who were railwaymen, it's a uniquely valuable account. The copy I received seems to be printed one-off on demand, new, not especially attractively presented, but it's the goods."},{"Title":"Policy Analysis and Public Choice: Selected Papers by William A. Niskanen","review":"William Niskanen's volume of selected papers showcases more than thirty selections from his previously published work, and the collection reveals him to be a thoughtful observer of contemporary government and an insightful public-policy analyst. Niskanen is best known for his 1971 book, Bureaucracy and Representative Government, which he wrote while working at the Institute of Defense Analysis....Although Niskanen's analysis is insightful and thought-provoking on all of the various topics covered, the whole volume seems to have less value than the sum of its parts. The collection will make some of these papers easier to locate, if potential readers are aware that they have been reprinted here, but the chapters do not complement and support one another as did the chapters in Niskanen's earlier collection on bureaucracy, Bureaucracy and Public Economics (Aldershot, Eng.: Edward Elgar, 1994). If one is interested in any of the topics Niskanen discusses, his analysis is sure to shed light on the subject. The topics are so varied, however, and the methods of analysis so different, that the volume will have greatest value as a reference to be consulted on various topics, rather than as a book to be read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Original Thoroughbred Times Racing Almanac - 2003 Edition","review":"The almanac has been published and updated for several years by Thoroughbred Times magazine.It is an absolute must for a fan of Thoroughbred racing, as it covers the sport from the major races, to the personalities and the legendary runners. What I find particularly interesting is the history of the tracks and wonder why such historic facilities like Hialeah Park are left to decay.You will spend hours going through the fascinating details of the sport and certainly come up with more than a few trivia questions that will stump your pals as you watch the post-parade for the race that has that live longshot."},{"Title":"Greatest Gift","review":"Charming 'naif' style paintings, while the text is based on Henry Van Dykes story of 4 wise men.4 wise men set out to find the King of Kings and this is the story of the last one, Artaban.Because compassion delayed him, time and again, he spends many years searching. However, to everyone he encounters, Artaban behaved with greatest charity until at last he reaches Damascus and gives away his last posession and gift.The emphasis of the story is on Artaban living by the principals which Jesus would teach without discriminating against peoples of different faiths or races.The described goal of the book: \\"showing how we can turn disappointment to good account; and how our outer journey through life is mirrored by the inner journey of the soul.\\"I rather liked it. The illustrations are simple watercolours and quite nice, with a good map at the front, and are a fine accompaniment to the story.It's a nice story for Christmas or any time.kotori"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Since 1973 when I read My Michael, I have read many of the novels Oz has written since. He has become a favorite writer. His voice, his perspective, his gentleness shine through in his work.However, A Tale of Love and Darkness is absolutely stellar in every way. It is historically fascinating and emotionally powerful -- especially the end.Whoever gives awards to books this year, should surely give this book the top prize."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"An erudite autobiography where Oz pieces together the lives of those close to him;his parents, their friends and associates,various aunts and uncles and those who influenced his life. For many, they arrived in Palestine fleeing the poison of 1920-30's Europe; the determination to see the birth of the Hebrew state, the illusion that it will lead to a perfect peace and the reality of the need to fight to exist every day.In some ways,'A Tale of Love' reminds of Stephan Zweig's 'The World of Yesterday'; the story of his parents life in Vilna and Rovno;the persecutions;the fighting for independence, the struggle to survive the first few years(and thereafter). But this is also a deeply personal voyage for Oz as well. Its also one that many people will be able to connect to, such is the universiality of growing up-Oz's initial blind support of his families politics, to a rebellion against in order to establish the individual to a gradual realisation that there is no absolute in right and wrong.But it is his Mother's mental deteriation and suicide that haunts the book as it has haunted Oz. Often he begins to broach the subject, only to shy away from going any deeper and it takes the whole book for him to cover the event and try to make sense out of yet another of the senseless events of death and destruction that is the lot of the Jew. Having an idyllic life in Rovno and a love of life and learning, going eventually to Prague University, she saw everything wiped out, most brutally by fascism, but with no less zeal from Stalin's communists.Fleeing to Israel for that perfect peace that even independence and the winning of the first Arab wars couldn't ensure, coupled with the grind of everyday austerity, I feel she must have felt the futility of life.Oz's accounts of his father are also deeply moving; his quirks and frustrated ambitions, the grief Oz-like all children-bring those closest to them, this really is a book that teaches, enlightens and hits a universal chord with anyone who reads it. A really magnificent book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This memoir by the Israeli novelist Amoz Oz is a fascinating depiction of both European and Israeli Jews. Although the author was born in Israel, his parents and relatives were all European Jews displaced by the events leading up to World War II.The graphic depiction of what anti-semitism does to an individual explains the need for a Jewish state more fully than any essay could, and the history of the first war against the Jews by the Arabs, aided openly by the British army which then controlled Palestine, and which started the very evening in November, 1947 of the U.N. vote to establish a Jewish homeland, not, as I previously thought, in May, 1948, when the state of Israel was officially declared, lends credence to the unfortunate belief that the Arabs will never accept the state of Israel. This makes the book sound incredibly sad, and of course it is in one sense. But in another, by creating the milieu of these early settlers in Jerusalem and their intellectual strengths and interests, and also the new Jew of the kibbutz, to which Oz went after the death of his mother and his father's remarriage, and where he lived and wrote for 30 years, the book turns out to be the best one I have read about this frantic period of Jewish history."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"True to its title, this is a no holds barred personal masterpiece. Perhaps, this is the book that one should read before any of his other works because you can see so much of his fiction coming from his personal life.As a long time fan of Amos Oz, I was not prepared for this extremely personal non linier biography of his early life. While jumping from his granparents to his parents history to the present time, he manages to weave a lucid memory of his childhood, the relationship of his parents, grandparents, and the amount of secrecy that many of us, contemporaries of his, though not Israelis were raised to not question.Mr. Oz, on the other hand has discarded the family covertness of that time. Learning so much about his life, I will have to become a re-reader of some of his novels and will look at the ones I have not read with new enlightenment."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"A Tale of Love and Darkness is a dense, beautiful memoir about the youth of the well-known Israeli writer, Amos Oz, and of his country, Israel. By telling the stories of his parents and grandparents, Ashkenazi Jews, who fled Eastern Europe for the Holy Land when Hitler rose to power, he tells a story of the history of the Jewish people from the nineteenth century to the birth of modern-day Israel. But the story is also intensely personal, focusing on the devastating effects of his parents unhappy marriage and his mother's depression and eventual suicide on this young, sensitive and precocious artist. A remarkable book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This review was published in The Australian, August 16, 2008. Greg Sheridan is the Foreign Editor.[...]Memoirs are made of thisOPINION: Greg Sheridan | August 16, 2008A FEW years ago I experienced a severe addiction to travel literature.With the contemporary serious novel in such a mess, travel writing, like biography, offers many of the traditional pleasures of the novel: story, character, good dialogue, development, resolution. But I can't say I discovered any great literature there, much as I enjoyed Bill Bryson's wit and Paul Theroux's misanthropy.Now I am immersed in a frenetic bout of memoir reading and here the story is different.When Tom Wolfe was promoting the new journalism, which has been with us several decades now, his essential insight was to bring the techniques of the novelist to bear on journalism: exploring the subjective elements of a story, the characters' inner lives and interior monologues, with the advantage that the events had actually happened.A novelist's memoir can achieve this supremely. A Tale of Love and Darkness is the childhood memoir of Amos Oz, Israel's greatest novelist and surely soon a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.This is an incomparably good book. Perhaps it is the best book I have read. It tells of growing up in Jerusalem in the 1930s and '40s. Oz conceives life as one part comedy, one part tragedy, one part humdrum, quotidian concreteness, and if you are Jewish, the chance always of utter disaster.His life proceeds against the backdrop of the Holocaust and the birth of Israel. Oz is an only child and his life is also shaped by the suicide of his mother when he is 12. This colossal roadblock dominates and shapes the book and yet does not distort the loving portrait of his father, a frustrated academic, out of his depth and at his wits' end with his wife's melancholy.Oz's technical accomplishments in this book are dazzling. He writes of his grandfather:It was not easy for him to go out. Grandma had a highly developed, super-sensitive radar screen on which she kept track of us all: at any given moment she could check the inventory, to know precisely where each of us was, Lonia at his desk in the National Library on the fourth floor of the Terra Sancta Building, Zussya at Cafe Atara, Fania sitting in the B'nai B'rith Library, Amos playing with his best friend Eliyahu next door at Mr Friedmann the engineer's, in the first building on the right. Only at the edge of her screen, behind the extinguished galaxy, in the corner from which her son Zyuzya, Zyuzinka, with Malka and little Daniel, whom she had never seen or washed, were supposed to flicker back at her, all she could see by day or night was a terrifying black hole.This passage is instructive. First, there is a lovely metaphor for domestic life. How many grandmas have their perfect family radar screens? Then, everyone is mentioned by name. There is the accumulation of small details of location that give the passage life. But suddenly, at the end, the shocking reality of the Holocaust explodes this domestic tableau, as it does intermittently throughout these beautiful memories.Almost every page of this book contains an observation or metaphor so striking you cannot let it go, or rather it will not let you go. Oz writes: \\"Both my parents had come to Jerusalem straight from the 19th century.\\"The contrast, indeed conflict, of east European Jews trying to recreate an idealised Europe, one free of anti-Semitism, in the hot, dusty climate of Israel, surrounded by hostile Arabs, is mined by Oz as much for comedy as tragedy. And there is endless comic delight in the crazy clash of expectation with reality. For bookish, intellectual, urban Jews such as Oz and his family, the kibbutz pioneers were a new kind of Jew. Oz mocks his own earnest idealisation of kibbutz pioneers, yet somehow affirms it as well:Tough, warm-hearted, though of course silent and thoughtful, young men and strapping, straightforward young women ... I pictured these pioneers as strong, serious, self-contained people, capable of sitting around in a circle and singing songs of heart-rending longing, or songs of mockery, or songs of outrageous lust ... (people) who could ride wild horses or wide-tracked tractors, who spoke Arabic, who knew every cave and wadi, who had a way with pistols and hand grenades, yet read poetry and philosophy.Oz is free of self-pity. Instead there is a generous human solidarity and understanding for everyone. But there are passages of aching melancholy and pain. The night the UN votes to establish Israel is the happiest night imaginable. Though it too is tinged with fear, as the Jews of Jerusalem are always in dread of a second holocaust. But the recognition of the Zionist dream is a fulfilment of generations' desires.In all his life, Oz never sees his father weep, except that night. The father crawls into bed beside young Amos and tousles his hair:Then he told me in a whisper what some hooligans did to him and his brother David in Odessa and what some gentile boys did to him at his Polish school in Vilna, and the girls joined in too, and the next day, when his father, Grandpa Alexander, came to the school to register a complaint, the bullies refused to return the torn trousers but attacked his father, Grandpa, in front of his eyes, forced him down on to the paving stones and removed his trousers too in the middle of the playground, and the girls laughed and made dirty jokes, saying that the Jews were all so-and-sos, while the teachers watched and said nothing.Now, the father tells Amos, people may bully you, but not because you are a Jew: \\"Not that. Never again. From tonight that's finished here. For ever.\\" Most of the book is not political in that sense. It's full of jokes, though its genius is to blend comedy and tragedy. Oz recounts how as a kid he talked all the time, but that was fine because everyone in Jerusalem talked all the time. A professor tells Oz that the odds of there being an afterlife, as there is no conclusive evidence either way, are 50-50. For a central European Jew in the generation of Hitler, those chances of survival are not at all bad.When a great novelist writes a memoir with all the technique of the novel at its best, you get a superior art form. If I could recommend just one book to tell you something about the human condition, this would be it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"In this book, Amos Oz tells the story of his family, the convergence of several different countries and cultures into one man.He describes precisely the mentality of the immigrants to Israel, the way the Arab/Jewish relationship changed with the creation of the State of Israel, and the formation of the Israeli people.The book is hypnotic, it is hard to read it slowly, and dozens of stories are interlinked leaving no sewing signs. He narrates Israeli history and personal life as one.The title is very accurate in representing the story. His life was surrounded by strong and controversial figures, which make a rich camp for enlightening insights by the author."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"I recommend this book to anyone interested in a good story about a Jewish family and how they came to live in Isreal and make it their own. The characters become alive in your mind and their stories gripping."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Amoz Oz is an excellent writer.He wove his life story with the development ofthe State of Israel. He often threaded and re threadedpeople and happenings so that you understood howthey and he (the author) were responding the way thedid. An outstanding writer worthy of the many accoladeshe has received."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Reading this book is a wonderful journey. There are so many layers in which to enjoy: the tale of a precocious only child observing all around him; the reflections of the mature writer observing the past; the story of immigrant families adjusting to the new land; the story of the forming of the state of Israel and the accompanying wars; the many people living in this land. If you're looking for an action packed story to breeze through, this is not it. It's a series of connected vignettes and interesting characters that are to be savored one by one. This is a dense book, full of beautiful language."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Since there where such good recommendations I hoped for a book that would grip my attention. But after 70 or so pages I could not continue, I found it desperately BORING. Just some endless summation of names and streets. May be some friend of mine will be happy with this present."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Generally, in interviews, etc., Oz is a bit cryptic about his own life, but in this memoir, a coming-of-age story of both a writer and a nation, his honesty and vulnerability are truly remarkable. A brief aside on translation--de Lange, as he's done with Oz's novels, does a marvelous job here. I usually read first in Hebrew, then in English, but this version is so seamless that the English reader will not suffer or miss out. I found the story of his relationship with his beautiful, despairing mother fascinating, and very revealing regarding the writer's attitude towards women in his novels. When I finished, I was so moved that I sat down and wrote the author a letter (albeit unsent), which I haven't done since childhood in Israel. There's an honesty in this book, an awareness of the fragility of memory, of love, of the tremendous need we all have for forgiveness, for connection over time and to each other. If you haven't read Oz's work, you can still learn from this memoir, though knowledge of his fiction will deepen your appreciation. A beautifully written, soul-searching book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"I decided to read this novel-like memoir after watching a program about it on Greek TV, and also after an American anti-Israel friend told me that he found a radio interview with the author \\"very moving\\". As other reviewers have pointed out, it's not easy reading, and the degree of detail can be tiring at times. But I am glad I read it, and I would heartily recommend it to others as a good introduction to Israel.Why so many details? One answer is \\"because the author, being such a famous writer, could\\". Another answer is that this was the only way to portray and compare Jewish life before and after Israel. For example, the excruciating emphasis on his grandmother's obsession with 'Levantine germs and viruses' is suddenly followed by a telling episode that marked her arrival to Haifa: as a British doctor attempted to spray his grandfather with disinfectant, the author's father grabbed the spray and doused the doctor instead -- for Jewish honor \\"should no longer be trampled underfoot or disinfected\\"!Another great 'surprise' is the way the author's tragic mother really 'enters' the memoir: right after his father is meticulously shown to receive the first copy of his book with unimaginable affection and liken it to a newborn baby, his mother dryly retorts \\"when it's time to change its nappy, I expect you'll call me\\".Is the author's mother's suicide presented as a metaphor for the pains of Israel's birth? I would say yes, even if indirectly and unintentionally: her suicide took place in the same room that noted Israeli general and archeologist Yigael Yadin was renting during the War of Independence; less poetically, her death compelled the author to leave Jerusalem for a kibbutz, moving from the abstract Zionist ideals and debates to the reality of toiling on the Land of Israel.Will this book be remembered as the saga of modern Israel? Perhaps, although the absence of Sephardic Jews and -- despite the author's 'accidental' visit to a wealthy Arab home -- Palestinian Arabs reduce its chances substantially. Still, if you read it Jerusalem will never be the same!One last note: I read the excellent Greek translation of Yaakov Schiby and, comparing it to Nicholas de Lange's English translation, I am stunned to see that the latter has omitted one of the 63 sections (where the author writes about novels and writing) and generally altered the text here and there; as a glaring example, only 2 of 10 lines from Zelda Schneurson-Mishkovsky's -- author's second grade teacher in pre-Israel Jerusalem -- magnificent poem \\"In an Old School for the Blind\\" cited by the author (and the Greek translator) appear in the English translation:\\"For the first time I am thinkingabout a night when the constellations are only a rumour\\"...[*12/20/07 EDIT*: I have good reasons by now to believe that the poem's author is not the teacher but the student (i.e., Amos Oz himself); in any case, here is how the Greek translation rescues that shadowy poem:\\"Why has the mountains' contempt scared me so muchMy soul landed here like a bird flyingfrom the land of a fruit that never tasted...That the night's garden violated its vow to the tender darknessFor the first time ever I pondera night in which the constelations and the degreesare but a rumor......................................................But when am I going to feel that its darknessis full of signs,that I know nothing about its soul's journeysinto the magic, the profound, the luminous,the impossible\\"This incident shows how fiction and fact may be weaved into each other in Oz's 'Tale': whether this was done randomly or with a pro-Israel agenda in mind I am leaving to others to investigate; what I would like to do here instead is to cite, straight from the English translation, the one marvelous paragraph where the author casts a bit of affectionate doubt on Israel (through an aunt's narration of her 1938 journey, along with a Greek and her baby, from Trieste to Tel Aviv):\\"I even remember that at one moment I had a fleeting thought, why did Ihave to go to the Land of Israel at all? Just to be among Jews? Yet thisGreek girl, who probably didn't even know what a Jew was, was closer to methan the entire Jewish people. The entire Jewish people seemed to me atthat moment like a great sweaty mass whose belly I was being tempted toenter, so it could consume me entirely with its digestive juices, and Isaid to myself, Sonia, is that what you really want? It's curious that inRovno I'd never experienced this fear, that I was going to be consumed bythe digestive juices of the Jewish people. It never came back once I washere, either. It was just then, for a moment, on that boat, on the way,when the Greek baby fell asleep in my lap and I could feel it through mydress as though at that moment she really was flesh of my flesh, eventhough she wasn't Jewish, and despite the wicked Jew-hating AntiochusEpiphanes.\\"]"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"In \\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" the Israeli novelist and political essayist reflects on his childhood. Oz tells of a morning writing the book in Arad, he is working on chapter 36, and says: \\"I don't know what can contribute to the progress of the story, because as yet I have no idea where this story wants to go, ....\\". Certainly, Oz is trying to understand and come to terms with his childhood, but I think his primary motivation may be even simpler: to better recall his youth and the people who were important to him, for Oz makes clear he does not have an exceptional memory, and that sometimes, like an archaeologist, he is recreating a memory from fragments (and whatever help he can get from other first person accounts of the time).What made reading this book such a memorable experience? Certainly, Oz is a talented writer. It is unlikely that someone who is not a novelist could write prose as well, or recreate conversations and scenes as well. Oz's childhood was eventful, and at least in his hands, his family life is interesting. Oz offers a feel for a time and place (lower middle class life in Jerusalem in the years 1939-1948) as well as fascinating stories about his ancestors, particularly on his mother's side. What really sets this book apart, however, is Oz's personality itself. You have to love and admire this man - and enjoy his sense of humor.\\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" could have benefited from better editing. I would advise the reader to keep in mind that Oz was born in 1939, for the book can be imprecise about dating events, and some readers might wish to begin by looking at the family picture on p.509."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"There are 54 reviewers who recorded their thoughts before mine. So, my review includes some comments on those reviews.I found the book to be very fascinating because I am very curious about Jews as people and Israel as a country. Amos Oz has gone through events that few people go through in their life ... the most difficult one is his mother's suicide. The story is told in a radiating style with his mother's suicide being the focus. Events either flow towards it or away from it. It is not easy to tell such a difficult, painful story. Amos Oz tells it very effectively and virtually takes you into his life. His prose is so beautiful. He is also very humorous.As many commented, this book is not completely autobiographical. A bulk of it is on his childhood years. He was in kibbutz for nearly 35 years starting from when he was nearly 15, but less than one third of the book is devoted to it. While so much detail is shared with readers about his reading habits, the people influenced him, etc., the life-changing decision he made with respect to joining kibbutz is told as if he woke up one day and decided to do it. There is no detail on how he found out about it, what he thought about it initially, and how he ultimately came up with the conviction.Someone has mentioned that there are nothing but street names in the first 70 pages and the book was so boring they could not continue. I feel sorry for the person because he missed the best parts of the book. Even in the first 70 pages, there are a number of events of interest. In fact the most poetical paragraph in the book is in the first 70 pages which describes how his mother acted in the presence of a famous writer (Agnon)."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"\\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" is quite possibly my favorite book ever-- and I usually don't care much for the memoire genre. The language is gorgeous and deep as poetry. But the book is also sociological,and helps you understand what it was like to grow up in Israeli society in the wake of WWII. At the heart of the story is Oz's beautiful but tormented mother, who took her own life when he was still a child. This tragedy, and Oz's alienation from his father, drove him to join a kibbutz as a teenager. The story circles inexorably around the suicide and zeroes in on it only at the very end. The passage in which Oz dreams of saving his mother is one of the most resonant in all of literature, for me:\\"I would certainly have tried my hardest to explain to her why she musn't. And if I did not succeed I would have done everything possible to stir her compassion, to make her take pity on her only child. I would have cried and I would have pleaded without any shame and I would have hugged her knees, I might even have pretended to faint or I might have hit and scratched myself till the blood flowed as I had seen her do in moments of dispair...\\" (p. 516)I leave the rest to you. I wish I could read the original Hebrew. This book is a masterpiece. So beautiful, it hurts."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Pearls of wisdom, interspersed with lovingly told family stories, including the horrors of loss and ongoing pain, and the history of a nation and people. Regretfully, these trite phrases don't do justice to what Oz has created in this memoir. This book is multi-layered in a way that seems to replicate the very act of memory itself, as past events show and return to told memory, through the scrim of the story at hand. It's a book to read and live with and it is an honor to be able to spend some time with this book and writer."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Reading this book was for me like looking at a family album while my host (whose album this is) tells me about the photographs quietly, gently, his sad eyes fixed on the back of my head. And as I looked I realized that the photographs (the still lives captured on this page and that) are photos of photos of photos; that behind them simmer reflections of things not in the image itself; that they are photos of the same scene but taken with many cameras, seen with many eyes; and slowly, gradually I realize that I am in the photographs also-a kind of ghost guided inside by my host-and I step in and look around.Until finally, I come to the last photograph in the album (not the last photograph; just the last photograph in that particular album) and I look at it, at its grey rain, at its sadness and I don't close the album.That is what reading this incredible book is like-and that is why I heartily recommend it to anyone who ever hesitated to speak of himself, his family, his heart."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"A moving, intense memoir of the life of this prolific Israel author, tells of life in the Land of Israel from the 1930s until the early 1950s. The author manages to juggle humor and sadness, in a book which does bring to life the Israel of that time. It is circular in nature and not chronological and dwells also on life in Europe for Jews before the re-establishment of the Jewish State. The two problems with the book are the amount of detail can become monotonous and boring and that Oz sometimes tries too hard to be iconoclastic and cynical, leading simply to a certain putridity. Though my own politics differs from Oz leftwing (yes still humane) political though and that may account for part of my irritation.The author describes his grandmother's obsession that the Levant is filled with germs, and her immaculate obsession with cleanliness as a result. Oz describes his early childhood with a clear and penetrating memory and end in his mother's suicide at 38 in the early 1950s-with Oz describing her depression and his pain and psychological exploration of her suicide. He describes his intellectual but frustrated father and the stifling, book filled flat in Jerusalem from which he escapes to the animating Kibbutz Hulda at the age of 15. The author describes the situation of Israel in the last years of the British Mandate of Palestine, and provides interesting history of the birth of Israel. From the Holy Land during the Second world war, when the Jewish yishuv (community) of Israel feared the Holocaust coming to the Holy Land at a time when the Nazis looked like they had the Palestine mandate strangled by their control of the Caucuses in the north and their advance in North Africa on the other frontier. At this time Haifa and Tel Aviv, as the auhtor mentions were bombed by Italian planes. The gripping elation and fear at the vote in the Untied Nations at the end of 1947 in which the partition of Palestine was agreed to, the coming of the painful War of Independence and the shortages incurred therein, the atrocities of the war such as the burning alive by Arabs of 50 nurses and doctors on the road to Jerusalem and the killing of dozens of Jews in Jerusalem during a terrorist bombing by pro-Arab British Army deserters calling itself the British Fascist Army. The author describes his first sexual infatuation with a schoolteacher in her 30s named Zelda, and this too is described in immaculate detail. Overall a great contribution to Israeli literature and thought."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"It is with a certain, very piquant, sense of humility that I pen this review. Oz's memoir is so textured, so full of the many layered joys and sorrows of life, anyone's life, that it rather overwhelms the sensitive reader, regardless of how well-read she or he may be. Whilst certainly tied to Jerusalem in the 1940's-1950's during which he came of age, Oz manages to weave a spell around the reader, all the while maintaining his Chekhovian eye for the particular, that transcends the particular circumstances, that inevitably sparks feelings of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu and forgotten moments from the reader's own childhood and early adolescence. I certainly found this to be the case with me. It is one of the few books that one can say, with complete lack of irony, that it will make you laugh and make you cry, both at the still, sad music of humanity and at its endemic foibles.Everyone will have her/his favourite sections. One of mine was young Amos's remembrance of his deep, painful crush on his second grade teacher, a poet, who would speak of a child as \\"flooded with light.\\" Of her, he says, \\"She was my first love. An unmarried woman in her thirties. Teacher Zelda, Miss Schneerson. I was not quite eight, and she swept me away, she set in motion some kind of inner metronome that had not stirred before and has not stopped since.\\"Of course, as other reviewers have noted, the book has a centripetal swirl, towards the eventual suicide of Oz's mother, and a parallel with the Jerusalem setting in what he has reconstructed of her privileged, then persecuted, girlhood in Eastern Europe. But this does not make the work ultimately tragic. It is another layer in this startlingly written record of one person's sojourn on this Earth, rich and strange as is the life of every person reading this review. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"A brilliantly written autobiography, A Tale of Love and Darkness is sometimes gorgeously descriptive, witty, with beautifully rounded and developed characters. At times, however, it's a hard slog.It's amazing how Oz somehow managed to know and interact with so many of the fathers and mothers of the State of Israel. The history alone makes this a powerful read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"In his Tale of Love and Darkness Amos Oz paints an atmospheric picture of growing up with his parents during the British occupation of Palestine and the early years of the state of Israel.He describes meticulously the background and European social mores of his parents and grandparents and their struggles to get by in the nascent state of Israel. He recounts the hardships and near starvation his family and their neighbors experienced because of the siege of Jerusalem by the Arab armies during Israel's War of Independence.This is a story of attachment and loss, love and death within a time and culture where family emotions were pushed underground and daily relationships were stifled by conventional custom. In the background is the European Holocaust, the destruction of whole families and communities, villages and towns, that casts a psychic shadow over the personalities in the story. This undercurrent of darkness combines with other currents leading inexorably to the tragical suicide of the writer's mother.[...]"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This tale of growing up in Israel contains wonderful descriptions and interesting historical background, but its real strong point remains the depiction of a child/adolescent mind. Voice of the protagonist carries it forward."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"I love Amos Oz's writing anyway, but because this book it his memoir, his language is all the more immediate and touching, so I love it all the more."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Not only a classic memoir, but the key to the concerns and even the images of many of Oz's other novels and stories, fromMy MichaeltoThe Same SeaandWhere the Jackals Howl. You might even say it's a key to his chosen name, Oz, which means heroism and valor in Hebrew. Personal heroism against the enemy, from the British occupiers to the Jordanian-Arab invaders of 1948 was one of the child Oz's principal fantasies when he was growing up in Jerusalem. Well worth your time and money."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"I loved this book which was both a personal and historic tale. Although at times it was quite humorous I cried openly at the very end. Amos Oz struggles his whole life with the death of his mother and I think writing these memoirs was a cathartic experience for him. A superb writer, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Amos Oz remembers and shares his early life and much more. All the details, surprises, family life, social context and History itself are rediscovered and savored with total honesty.Repetition with style and elegance becomes in his hands part of the texture of the book.The translation from the Hebrew by Nicholas de Lange is first rate. It reads as if the book was originally written in English.A masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Magnificent book, a masterpiece. The author, Amos Oz, through the lens of his family's and his own life, takes us through the history of the Jews in mid-20th Century Poland the the birth and growth of the State of Israel. As always, Oz is incredibly intuitive, poetic and compelling."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Amos Oz's A Tale of Love and Darkness is a memoir of his life and the life of his family up until the time of his mother's suicide at the age of 38 in the early 1950s. Oz's mother's suicide, never treated fictionally in his other work (as far as I can recall) is treated here with great care and thoroughness: there is anger, guilt, shame, sadness, loss, a sense of regret, and penetrating understanding. Without a doubt the book is strongest when Oz discusses his mother and her family. His mother, brought up on a romantic, Hebrew education in Rovno, was not ready for the tawdriness of life in Palestine, \\"the rough terrain of everyday life, diapers, husbands, migraines, queues, smells of moth balls and kitchen sinks.\\" The story of his mother's mental decline and suicide is also the story of the convergence and divergences of Jewish life in the 20th century; the outline of the gap between the real and the ideal of the Zionist dream. That said, A Tale of Love and Darkness is generally overwritten. There is much useless repetition here which drags down the trajectory of the memoir. I do not recommend this work as the first work of Amos Oz to be read, but the last. It makes for an instructive book end with Where the Jackal's Howl and Other Stories on the other side."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This is the first Amos Oz book I have read so I have nothing to compare it to. I loved it. A great storyteller even about true events."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This is a beautiful and moving memoir from a sensitive and humanistic writer of great skill and style. The reader will feel that he or she is personally experiencing growing up with the author in the most modest and simple circumstances, in the young State of Israel, from before statehood and into its early years, getting to know as friends and neighbors some of its intellectual leaders who were the writer's family members and friends. The book is a sheer delight, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This is a gem of a book. The autobiography of Israel's most popular author, this story is full of warmth, passion and heartache. It is the story of his childhood in Israel during the time of statehood, while including the childhoods of his parents in Eastern Europe just before World War II.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This 500+ page memoir by Israeli novelist Amos Oz is an absorbing \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" The first 200 pages are about his mother's and fathers' families, Russian-speaking emigrants to Israel in the 1930s from Eastern Europe. An only child, he devotes much of the rest of the book to his parents and the years until his mother's death when he was still a teenager. It is a richly detailed book peopled with a Dickensian cast of characters. He allows readers to experience a total immersion in the daily life of a low-income Jerusalem neighborhood during the years leading up to and following the creation of Israel in 1948. It is a troubling story, capturing on the one hand the intensely felt emotions of being young, self-aware, and sensitive, while portraying also the humiliations and the least flattering of the author's personality and character, all played against the difficulties of his parents' lives and what seems to have been a disintegrating marriage.Meanwhile, with its view of anti-semitic nationalism in Europe, readers can begin to understand something of the motivations driving zionist movements and the waves of Jewish settlement in Palestine before and after WWII. As Oz records the political discussions and obsessions of the friends of his parents, it's easier to understand the insularity and paranoia that led to the need for a homeland with defended borders and the eventual efforts to achieve military solutions to conflict with Palestinians and Arab neighbors. Though recognized today as a peace activist, Oz provides only hints of his evolution to a broader view, describing only his complete break with his past by leaving home for a kibbutz at the age of 15. As a companion memoir, readers will also be interested in \\"Once Upon a Country: A Palestinian Life,\\" by Sari Nusseibeh."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"You may not be able to take the shtetl out of the Jews. This is a moving and beautifully written book about life in Jerusalem among recent immigrants to Israel from the 1930's through the war of independence. Even the most nationalistic Zionists -- followers of Vladimir Jabotinsky -- found it difficult to be anything but Europeans. Perhaps the Jews should have insisted on part of Poland-Lithuania-Ukraine as their homeland; it would have been an easier adjustment than the Levant which they had lost contact with for at least 2000 years. I realise this is what the fanatical president of Iran is currently saying, but it may in the long run have been more true than not.Amos Oz lived among nationalistic Zionists; his uncle was Joseph Klausner, a distinguished historiand and partisan of the Zionist Revisionists. Oz, however, in the end reject their integral nationalism, but we don't know what he would put in its place. Indeed, with the Palestinian Arabs still refusing compromise and a live and let live relationship with the Israelis, the Israelis have probably no choice but to pursue the integral nationalism of resistance and uncompromising rigor. It's a tragedy."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"A TALE OF LOVE AND DARKNESS is a deeply poignant, lyrical tapestry of memories that will be much loved by admirers of Oz's work. The prose is finely crafted, as we'd expect from a writer of Oz's stature. This book is not a memoir, as such--its narrative is not linear, but waxes and wanes through various themes. Arching over the narrative is the shadow of Oz's loss of his mother. My one reservation about the book is that I feel Oz withholds from us--it's never really adequately explained why he changed his name to Oz or what train of thoughts led him to do this. Was he attempting to erase the trauma of his profound loss? Regardless, this work will linger with you after you finish its final pages."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Amos Oz likes to say \\"the first thing you should know about [his] autobiography is that it's not an autobiography. It's an imposition forced on [him] by the Library of Congress.\\" An interesting confession considering \\"A Tale\\" was published under the genre \\"memoir\\" and went on to reap much acclaim - and quite a bit of money -- as a memoir, including The Koret Jewish Book Award for Autobiography. Asked by befuddled interviewers to clarify himself, Mr. Oz will say only that having asked the dead into his home, \\"they told him the stories he never heard\\". This is a writerly response, with much truth and sense, but it doesn't excuse Mr. Oz for allowing his publisher to tout the work as a memoir or to blame the Library of Congress. Actually, a good old-fashioned name already exists: a semi-biographical novel. Or, if that's not hip enough, call it a post-modernist novel, then, a nod and a wink to the reader to figure out what is real and what isn't. As it stands,the many fans of Mr. Oz ---until now I've considered myself one --- believe they're hearing true stories, not stories conjured by the artist if he listens hard. This year we've been brutal on American writers who've played on the popular taste for truth; we've held them to standards and shouted \\"foul\\" when they haven't lived up to them. It saddens me that a great fiction writer like Mr. Oz hasn't held himself to a higher standard. \\"Oz\\" in Hebrew, we're reminded again and again, means \\"strength.\\" As a \\"moral conscience of the modern world\\", as we're also remindedagain and again, Mr. Oz demands \\"strength\\" from Israelis and Palestinians alike. And yet he wants us to accept with a titter of laughter that he was somehow coerced into calling his \\"Tale\\" a memoir. Shame on him. He should know better --- and something tells me he does."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This book is good and if you want a long drawn out, often over-detailed story about a family legacy from Europe to Israel and their trials and trevails, then this is good.

Sad!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Same old sardonic whimsey. Repetitive intellectual arrogance. Recapitulated old political arguments as if they remain coherent living issues. Profound things have happened to Israel. Time has passed Amos Oz by."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"The child of Ashkenazi Jews who escaped to Jerusalem just before the outbreak of World War II, Amos Klausner (the author's original name) grew up in a scholarly family which encouraged his precocity. His great uncle Joseph was Chair of Jewish History at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and wrote his magnum opus about Jesus of Nazareth. His father read sixteen or seventeen languages, wrote poetry, and had an enormous library, while his mother spoke four or five languages, could read seven or eight, and told elaborate stories.Amos grew up a solitary child, encouraged to entertain himself while his parents worked. Always a writer at heart, he believed that \\"it was not enough for me to be intelligent, rational, good, sensitive, creative.\\" He often felt he was a \\"one-child show...a non-stop performance,\\" always on display to the relatives, his accomplishments never seeming to be enough.In this elaborate, non-linear autobiography, Oz and his family are seen as archetypal immigrants to Jerusalem, people who arrived when the land was still under British rule and who helped create a new homeland, arguing ferociously about the direction the country should take and the leaders who should lead it. The history of Jerusalem combines with the author's own genealogical records and his memories about his early family life to create a broad picture of the society in which he grew up and in which his writing talent took root.Detailed, highly descriptive, and filled with introspection about his unusual life, the book shows the tensions within the society and within his family. After his mother's suicide when he was twelve, he broke with his father, joined a kibbutz, and, at fifteen changed his name. His observations about himself in relation to his peers and in relation to the outside world, even at that young age, show his inner turmoil and determination to discover a personal identity.As the book moves back and forth in time, the author comments about his writing, the people who influenced him, and his \\"pickpocketing,\\" his \\"stealing\\" of the lives of real people in order to invent stories about them. His observations about Israel, its leaders, its never-ending wars with the Arabs, and his experience as a resident of a kibbutz for more than thirty years broaden the scope and provide insight into one man's life in this developing country. Obviously a huge achievement for Oz personally, this is also a huge contribution to the understanding of the growth of a Jewish homeland and to an understanding of how Oz became the writer he is. Much more detailed and leisurely than Oz's novels, this is slow but satisfying reading for those who admire his novels. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"As I wrote yesterday, but deleted because I don't use my real name, this book is everything the news and customers have posted. I will only add this WARNING. Those of you, who, like myself, read about this book as the story of his mother's suicide, have been given a slanted idea about \\" A Tale of Love and Darkness.\\" Yes, his mother's suicide is here, but far more than that.As others have said better than I: It's a history of Palestine (pre-Israel), the autobiography of a writer, the way that European Jews experienced lower class/lower middle class life Palestine in the late 30's, early 40's, and all the myriad influences and people that created the great Amos Oz, who is surprisingly modest throughout. REALLY modest.Yes, as others have said, Oz is my favorite author. BUT, no one should imagine that this will be an easy read, because it is not. It isn't written to excite;is not plot-driven but meditative and far-ranging, as well as non-linear. It differs from Oz' other work, both novels and non-fiction, in that way. It is a long march and the reader must do some hard work to keep up with chronology and mostly to keep one's interest going.Do not buy this because of a few sensationalist views. Buy this, and yes, I too believe it is a MASTERPIECE, truly AMAZING-- if you are interested in: writing, Israel, Kibbutz life, in exile and hope, in situational despair, in character portraits, and in Oz himself.His mother's death IS utterly wrenching but hardly the main story and his father comes to life through Oz' genius, as well as his unhappy O how unhappy mom. Also, beware that because he meanders hither and yon, when her death happens it hurts, man o does it! During the second section and esp on the last pages I was sobbing, as her life's end is overwhelmingly sad. But whoever I first read claiming this is the story of his mother, I believe was wrong. It is a HUGE travel and the reader needs energy to keep going, to keep interested until at some point, one is simply hooked.I recommend this book highly but for experienced readers only, not looking for a quick fix, nor a page turner. For those who want a panoramtic and highly detailed tale, yes buy this and work it. I'm so glad Amos Oz dared to write a book so different from his other ones as he is a private man, a great one, and he got so much right here. Dig in and don't expect to love it all, not at the beginning. I remember almost every vignette now but it took three tries to get 'in'."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Others have written what this book is about, so I will not try to describe the content of this book. Like the way he presented his mother, Amos Oz is a born story teller and a great painter with words. There is not a place, a person or an activity but that he presents it in such detail that you can actually SEE them. But I must say that often I found the detail excessive. He seems to have total recall, which is often rewarding but can at other times be a bit of a bore. He tells you the number of steps leading up into a house; he describes the smallest objects in a room without asking himself whether they are truly necessary to establish the room's atmosphere; he is inordinately fond of lists. Here, for instance, is a sentence describing his mother working silently and efficiently in the house: \\"She cooked, baked, did the washing, put the shopping away, ironed, cleaned, tidied, washed the dishes, sliced vegetables, kneaded dough.\\" His aunts, who tell him about the family's life in Poland, also seem to have had total recall: that life is richly reconstructed, but again for my taste the pudding is often over-egged. Then he describes in minute detail and several times exactly which streets he or his mother would take from one location in Jerusalem to another. That might possibly be evocative for Jerusalemites who know the city; but if they know the city, do they need such a guide? These tiresome excesses are most in evidence when he describes his earliest years, until he is about eight years old; but those chapters take up about 2/3rds of this massive book (though his tale is never entirely chronological). Then, when he is eight, the War of Independence happens (excellent description of Jerusalem under siege), to be followed by the establishment of the State of Israel, and now the narrative becomes rather more concentrated and with fewer of the mannerisms of the earlier part. There is a magnificent description how, at the age of 15, this pale, immensely precocious cerebral but romantic youth escapes from the stifling intellectual world represented by his father and his father's friends, to live among the bronzed young gods on a kibbutz. He will stay on that kibbutz for the next 31 years, but his story ends with his adolescent admiration of the goddess who will become his wife five or six years later. And that is where, chronologically, his story ends (though throughout the book there are brief references to events in his later life).This is a totally inadequate account of the book, and does not even touch on the thread that runs throughout: his relationship with his parents and their relationship with each other. Despite the irritations I sometimes felt, I was never tempted to put the book aside: it is far too interesting and well-written well-written for that."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This memoir is a triumph on multiple levels. First, it is the story of a young man's growing up in a period of history fraught with tragedy and hope -- the time just after the Holocaust and before the State of Israel was founded and took root. Oz blends the personal and the political in a seamless manner. His account of his adolescent sexual fumblings and his eventual initiation into sexual activity by an older woman is both psychologically convincing and utterly hilarious. Second, this is the account of a new nation, Israel, struggling to be born and to forge its identity. Oz grew up as an acolyte of the political Zionist Right; it is remarkable that he moved decisively to the Left and remained there. He is a Zionist who feels deep and genuine empathy with the Arab populace. Third, many reviewers have not pointed out that this is a literary memoir. From almost the day that he learned to read, Oz devoured the classic and not-so-classic works of world literature -- whatever had been translated into Hebrew. In some ways, this book is Oz's effort to acknowledge his literary ancestors and repay his literary debts. The language is lyrical and the sense of history is pervasive. Altogether an outstanding book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Amos Oz is one of Israel's best known novelists; some label him as Israel's \\"number one\\". Any new book by Oz gets the immediate attention of everyone, gets translated to several languages and hits the no. 1 spot in the bestsellers list almost immediately. Indeed, Oz has become an icon in Israel to whom many turn to, not only to discuss literary matters but also get his opinion on politics, society and life in general. As my wife says, he has become a \\"sacred cow\\", elevated to a status where it has become extremely difficult for any critic to harm sales of his books in any significant way.I read A Tale of Love and Darkness (in Hebrew) during my trip in New Zealand and it accompanied me throughout the journey. It is an autobiography that Oz started writing shortly after he turned 60, at the end of the previous century. It tells mainly the story of his childhood in Jerusalem, growing up during the time Israel was being formed (Oz was 9 when Israel gained independence). Although the book covers many aspects of his life, the one overriding theme surfacing over and over again is the suicide of his mother when he was 12. This event shaped Oz's life and led to the abrupt change he embarked upon two years later: the move from the book-centric, scholarly life of his father in Jerusalem to the freedom and agricultural life of Kibbutz Hulda.Oz's writing is at times long-winded and pompous. Even daily, mundane events are recounted in excruciating detail that sometimes make the reader wonder whether they indeed made such an impact on his life to deserve such attention. Despite this, Oz manages to combine tragedy and comedy in his family's saga and his occasional self-effacing manner make the reader forgive him for his long-windedness. Throughout the book, the leading figures of Israel as a young nation pop up: Bialik, Tchernikhowsky, Agnon, Ben-Gurion and Yadin all came and went in Oz's childhood.The book is more of a memoir than an autobiography. The storyline is not linear and Oz repeats some events several times. If we ignore the fact that Oz wrote this book and thus remove the \\"sacred cow\\" factor, the book is an enjoyable read and contributes to the understanding of how Ashkenazi Jews coped with their new life in the Middle East."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"A number of long- time readers of Amos Oz have said that this is by far his greatest work and a true masterpiece.They say his evocation of the Jerusalem world of the thirties and forties is unmatched. That his description of his problematic and tremendously interesting intellectually overcharged family is done with dignity and distance which is nonetheless heartwarming.They say that Oz born to the right and having lived his political life largely as champion of the left provides a balanced picture of the fundamental political argument which has divided the Israeli public for years.They say that this story of a family is also one of the most convincing evocations of the early years of Israel .They speak of it as a gripping, moving read from start to finish.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This is one of the best modern works, that I have picked up in a while.

This book flows like water, it is a great story told by a great man!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"This book is intelligent, witty, heartfelt, appealing, and troubling. The author touches on many simple things of everyday life that make his life story unique and have affected his writing. With his superb prose, he puts readers in his own situation thereby giving a sense of what it must have felt like to live the life of Amos Oz. There are precious reminiscences, my favorite being his parents and himself on the one phone line from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv simply giving a weekly hello to relatives. He relates his deep shame at having inadvertently harmed a young Arab boy, what it was like to celebrate the night of Israel's Independence, his experience of being ushered out of an auditorium after laughing at Menachem Begin's use of the word \\"to arm\\", how in awe he felt in the presence of David Ben Gurion, how he became aware of his own political leanings, and the difficulty of carving out his own place in kibbutz life. He also opened his soul in revealing the anguish of his mother's illness and the pain of her death.I love Oz's writing. It's very passionate, but often in an understated way. This is a truly special book. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"As I read this book, I alternated between laughing out loud and weeping uncontrollably - not only for Amos Oz's private tragedy, but also for the larger tragedy of our joint history. This book provides an intimate personal description of some of the most dramatic periods in the history of Israel and Jerusalem. The writing is remarkable. I wish I could have read it in the original Hebrew, but de Langes translation is great."},{"Title":"A Tale of Love and Darkness","review":"Oz calls himself a 'word child' from the earliest of times. His love of language and his ability to use it in such lyrical and striking terms, is what sets Oz apart from many good writers today. A Tale of Love and Darkness is a magical book, one which recount's Oz's story from the eyes of a child growing up in Palestine, when was a young child of 8 or 9 years old. Oz moves backwards and forwards telling his story, which appears to be non-fiction, (about his own life and that of Israel,)but could very well have elements of a beautiful fairy tale and fiction as he discusses what life was like growing up in Palestine and then Israel of from the late 1940s. In his early life, he dealt with the suicide of his mother, and its impact on his relationship with his father, himself and his country.My only regret is that I could not read this amazing book in its original language of Hebrew. Being a lover of words myself, there are probably even deeper and more mystical layers of meaning in the original language of this great writer."},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"Dr. Eileen Flynn has given us the most readable and by far the most intelligently reasoned book yet to help hierarchy, clergy and laity find their way back. She has not only done her homework and analyzed her findings with skills based on her dozen or more earlier books. She has also organized her approach so clearly that the reader follows her argument with ease and in some ways with pleasure and relief, however appalling the material has to be at certain inescapable points of that argument. She presents a calm, admirably positive prescription for recovery while there is still time. Flynn pulls no punches in setting forth her Rx to repair the catastrophic damage born of millennial practices of governance that little if anything to do with original intent. Her book gives us her special woman's interpretation of what Raymond Schroth, S.J., meant when he wrote, &quot;Nowhere does Scripture have anything good to say about power and hanging onto power.&quot;"},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"Flynn's book brings the reader around to a not-so-easy solution to a horrifying problem. Lay Catholics must become involved and fully participate, as did Christians in the days following the time of Christ. Being a sheep is not what it's about. If you're a Catholic or anyone else who is upset and angry about the behavior of some priests, and even enraged about the cover-up by some bishops or archbishops, but don't know what to do about it, read this book. Changes can be made. Catholics at a Crossroads gives background on the facts of this problem, proposes a number of causes and finally offers the solution - activism by lay people."},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"The stories about sexual abuse by Catholic priests are still making headlines. As a Catholic, I am horrified by these news stories. Every time I read them, I ask myself why, how could this happen? Then a few months ago I received a manuscript in the mail from a Catholic theologian who had tackled this question directly and thoughtfully. I am the editor of Paraview Publishing and Eileen Flynn's manuscript answered the questions I had been asking myself ever since the crisis broke in 2002. Flynn's crystal clear analysis of the situation uncovers the underlying causes of the crisis: the inflexibility of Catholic sexual ethics, the theological issues of responsibility, and the reality of a dysfunctional institution. If you'll look at the \\"Editorial Reviews\\" section of this book page, you'll see that knowledgeable people agree that Flynn has hit the nail on the head. Frankly, it would all be quite depressing if not for the fact that Flynn is also able to offer a \\"cure,\\" a way for the laity and the Church to work together, address the underlying problems, and finally set things straight."},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"Using a format of Stop, Look and Listen, Dr. Flynn offers an excellent analysis of the crisis in the Church.Most importantly, Catholics at the Crossroads outlines concrete changes that must be made for the Church to recover its health and credibility."},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"Using the format of stop, look and listen, Dr. Flynn offers an excellent analysis of the crisis in the Church.Most importantly, Catholics at the Crossroads outlines concrete changes that must be made for the Church to recover its health and credibility"},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"A clear, concise,and objective view of this serious problem within the Church. Reading it was a real eye opener for me. Flynn's use of language was crisp. Each section flowed in a very logical way, holding my interest easily. Documentation of the facts was thorough. Hard to put down! I hope to read more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Catholics at a Crossroads: Coverup, Crisis, and Cure","review":"Compelling account of an extremely volatile situation in the American Catholic Church. Flynn adroitly addresses this crisis concisely outlining the coverup, crisis, and cure. I really appreciated her candid, metaphorical approach, ala a freight train railroad crossing,incorporating a stop, look, listen to avoid disaster.A must read that sends a loud message to all of us."},{"Title":"Morning glory: A history of the Imperial Japanese Navy","review":"The reference sources and archves were well used for the subjects he has covered here, but he makes no aattempt to reconcile himself to the realities of the case by using current reference sources such as Janes', such that when we get into areas of real revelation, he is all at sea. For instance a basic misunderstanding of the prewar terminology of Cruiser and Battleship, and even the relevance of it, leaves him with 2 battleships and a cruiser in Vladivostok harbour, rather than the 2 wonderful large pre-1905 vintage cruisers photographed and described by such as Frances Farmborough [ search Amazon!] and by the heavy hitters and such writers such as Dobson's: the Day we almost bombed Moscow. Again and again he takes you to interseting sources: look at the Tsingtau bombardments, for example, and yet the depiction leaves you fumbling, determined to get into the manuscript sources to ensure that is what really happened.There is so much here to spark off the imagination, but for the serious researcher it is a caution: check, check,check."},{"Title":"Morning glory: A history of the Imperial Japanese Navy","review":"the author has a wonderful insight on the value of documented history. But after the publication of this book, numerous octogenerian and nanogenerian ex-officers have published valuable memoirs which I believe forms an integral part of this would-be updated book. i hope the author agrees. if he is interested, he can contact me at eugenemm@gol.com eugene moosa-mikami"},{"Title":"Cult of Flesh","review":"It looks like erotic horror. It is listed as adult fiction. But what is THE CULT OF FLESH really? Well, I'm not sure and I just finished reading it. The story centers around a poet living in Paris. He has decided to give up on his unremarkable career and spend his days pursuing a hedonistic lifestyle by immersing himself in the pleasures of the flesh. But as the story opens, he makes the acquaintance of a beautiful woman and is introduced to Count Vico.Count Vico is central to the story but we know little about him. He seems to be of evil intent. One character calls him the Anti-Christ. James Joyce wrote of a Count by the same name. But whatever he is, he seems in control of the lives of many people. Soon our protagonist is deeply involved with the Counts machinations and flees to Spain in the company of a beautiful woman. Eventually he winds up back in Paris and we learn more of the Count and his control of others.Oddly, this book is written by a poet and is about a poet. In one scene, the main character meets someone with the author's name. Is this a poet's attempt at describing a philosophy of freedom, or is it the justification of free love? Whatever you feel it may represent, it is done by mixing non-erotic sex scenes with the spouting of philosophy. While the book is packaged to resemble erotica and it is packed with sexual encounters, it is not an erotic work. It is often very explicit but never titillating. It is not erotica or horror. It is instead a philosophical exercise that probably sold better marketed as erotica than it would have as philosophy."},{"Title":"Restoration In The Barrens","review":"In my class we read the book Restoration of the Barrens, though the teacher seemed to like it the whole class agreed that they were disappointed. It simply wasn't very believable, although a degree of sympathy was felt during the beginning the main character Corey didn't have a backbone or sense of humor, I found it strange that Don continued to stay friends with him. And also that all the adults (with one exception of his 'so-called' evil science teacher) seemed to fall in love with him imediately. Another unbelievable factor of this book was the teasing in the fact that it wasn't very realistic either, the nickname that his peers gave to him in the book was \\"Professer Crane\\". Really? Seriously? No, you have to be kidding me. If it was real the other teenagers could have found a much more creative name to call him. That book is a insult to teenage intelligence. It mentions more than once how Corey finds his peers idiotic and then mentions the reasons. That is the only fact that the author got right about a teenagers life and, let me just say, maybe calling all the people who you want to read your book stupid in the book itself is NOT a smart idea. But hey, it's not my job to scorn the author's hard work so I'll tell you about the upside. Oops, forgot, there is none."},{"Title":"Restoration In The Barrens","review":"I loved this book. The writer knows what happens to young adolescents when they don't &quot;fit in&quot; to their high school society. They get harrassed, rejected, taunted and humiliated, and some teachers look on and fail to protect, even seem to sanction. But the grieving young man in this fast moving story takes to the near by woods and prairie, studies the plants and animals, hangs out with the natural world. And is richly rewarded by being needed in a restoration project. The story could not be more timely, when we are all talking about teenage anger and its sometimes tragic expression. Edith Nash"},{"Title":"Restoration In The Barrens","review":"This book is a great way to teach ecology concepts to adolescents, but it's also a quick read. Corey quickly becomes a friend of the reader, although most readers would agree at the beginning that Corey is somewhat a geek. Through his trials, he shares with the reader his love of nature, especially the praries of Wisconsin. All the places mentioned in the book really do exist, as well as all the ecological concepts. This was an awesome story and my students couldn't wait to read his next book; Trouble in the Barrens."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I was unsure of how well I would like this deck when I read the description of the cards. The images are very friendly and they have a very &quot;nice&quot; feeling to them. The readings are accurate and have a more positive twist to them. Some of the images are of people from the 1800's and, at first, I found that a bit odd but I realized that for this particular deck, it's perfect. Great for everyday use or to just collect. I was very surprised by this deck and I'm sure others will be too."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"Though there are several decks I really love, this one is now my favorite Tarot deck, as it brings together many elements which are important to me. The deck is lusciously vibrant with rich color. Dark blue and also a lighter blue are predominant colors, carrying the background of the whole deck, which I think gives the entire deck a \\"Lunar\\" quality which supports our intuition and Lunar or Moon knowledge and abilities. Then too, Carl Jung knew the importance of bright color, how it attracts the unconscious, and I believe that the ability to work intuitively with a deck is enhanced when it has both rich colors and appropriate symbolic depth. The Major Arcana cards on this deck show the Kabbalah correspondences, depicting the Hebrew letters corresponding to the trumps, as well as depicting the particular Sephiroth on the Tree of LIfe which are related to the trump. I have always felt disappointed with the Rider Waite deck, which, though it is hailed for its \\"correct\\" hermetic symbolism, to me is far too plain, even banal, in its color. The images of the Spiral Tarot, particularly the trumps but also the Minor Arcana, are more complex, saturated, dreamy and engaging, and I think that helps to feel energetically pulled in towards the cards, when you feel like you wouldn't mind walking right into that scene and being there to fully feel it. The Spiral Tarot sticks close to traditional depictions of the trumps and Minor Arcana, but renders them more compellingly. To contrast to another symbolic deck: the Haindl Tarot, which I enjoy, may have more symbolic depth in terms of its trump cards, but their coloring is too thin to draw me in strongly: and the Haindl's Minor Arcana are disappointing in their simplistic, impersonal and geometric style. To compare to another deck: The Druidcraft Tarot, another one that I like, are also quite vibrant cards with rich color saturation and strong personality, but they come across to me as too concrete, where you see every detail plainly, the Druidcraft have no \\"dark corners\\" or unknown spaces where the intuition can work beyond what is known to the senses. The Arthurian Tarot by Caitlin Matthews is another colorful deck, but its scenes often feel lonely, without enough human presence, and again the pictures are highly detailed and concrete, without enough dark shadows for unknown things to form in. So the Spiral Tarot for me appeals more than these others, though I use the others too from time to time."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"As a professional reader, I was drawn to these cards by the images displayed...The standard and the quality of the actual pictures are great, however, I personally feel that there are far too many cards that have deviated from the original sense-meaning...This is solely my own opinion, and others may find them quite adequate...I will not be using them for professional use, for the original 'story' of the Fool has been lost or, sacrificed to make a 'pretty-picture' ... My opinion only ..."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I bought this deck based upon the glowing reviews I'd read here. I was disappointed. The cards are about the size of regular playing cards (smaller than a standard Rider-Waite)--which wouldn't be a bad thing, except that they also have garish graphic purple borders. They make the cards look like cheap bubble gum trading cards. As for the paintings themselves, the artist paints in the styles of various famous (in this case, mostly impressionist and fantasy) painters, and the result often feels a bit inconsistent. I would've liked it if the artist had more of her own developed style. I realize that this is only a tarot deck, and wasn't meant to be a great work of art, but it's worth pointing out. But those borders are so atrocious and distracting that they'd distract from any kind of painting. I don't know what the designers of this deck were thinking.It should also be noted that this deck is supposed to be very celtic."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"Every year around the Vernal Equinox, I buy a new set of Tarot cards. After reading the positive reviews on this deck and seeing the photos, I decided on this one...I was very surprised when I first opened the pack and started to look deeply into each card. I found the Major Arcana cards to be very hard, harsh and not at all friendly. The faces are very intricate and mostly homely. I think they remind me of people I actually know and that in itself, is frightening.... Who are these people?The Minors and the Court cards are my favorites. They are less critical, softer, calmer and more appealing to my sense of wonder. They make me happy...I find much joy here.The other thing I thought odd, was that the cards themselves, are very thin. Not at all what I've experienced with other decks.... I'm used to them now.... but a heavier stock of paper would have greatly enhanced them for me. I do love the beautiful, royal blue backside of the cards. The gold spirals are soothing and give off a aire of Royalty. I find this very comforting..Tarot cards enter into an intimate relationship with me and tend to evolve the more I use them.....My first impression was one of shock but I have now settled in with them...They are kind of like a goofy husband....somehow, they seem less goofy over time..."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"These cards are wonderful. The artwork is beautiful, and each card tells a story unto itself.

The artwork is totally fantastic, very elaborate yet simple and beautiful, and the little book that accompanies it is great. However, it( the book) could do with a little more info. But don't get me wrong! this deck is exquisitly done, and i definatly recommend it. I think i'll check out the accompanying book, also."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"The images of this deck feel etherial, and the artwork and symbolism speak volumes. This deck is a secondary deck for me; one I look to for deeper meanings. My clients are often drawn towards this deck with its images and soft colors. It is not &quot;bubble-gum&quot; looking: the lavendar borders accentuate the artistry and colors of the images, and highlights the softness of the deck. This is a good deck for intermediates, or those ready to explore the cards in their own way."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"A lot of people really like this deck. It just wasn't me. I bought the deck based on the Major Arcana. The minors look like they come from a completely different deck to me. The majors all look mythological .. while the minors remind me of the deep south during early America. So, I sold it. I would just advise getting a look at all the cards before making a decision. (one good thing - the cards are not large so they are great for smaller hands. the size reminded me of the hanson-roberts deck)"},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"Pity that the deck forces Golden Dawn Hebrew letter attributions: they are included upon the cards. Via the Waite/Colman Smith deck and the many commentaries discussed in numerous books, these attributions have spread widely, yet, many share the view that these are *not* correct. To have them presented leaves the person unfree to work with letter attributions (if at all) as they so wish, or as they discover differently from deeper study.If it wasn't for this, I would have given it a far higher rating - the artwork is worth a four or five star."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"...and now a part of my collection. The Trump cards are full of information - Qabalah, Astrology - but the pip cards are much more basic. That's OK, but I prefer a deck to have more consistancy in this regard. There are simply better decks for &#34;reading&#34; out there in my opinion, but I am happy to have this one in my collection. The art is wonderful."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"When I say \\"easy to interpret,\\" I mean that the imagery of the cards lends itself to interpretation. I don't need to refer to a tarot book for meanings; I can just let the cards in a spread tell the story. The Spiral Tarot has representational and symbolic imagery that speaks to the conscious and subconscious, the mind and the spirit. When one is open to the story, it will tell itself. Some decks seem to be designed to keep secrets; the Spiral Tarot helps them to unfold."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"Great Tool for intuitive work.

Many fine female readers I know are inexplicably drawn to it."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I've a few tarot decks but this one is my favourite. It follows the rider waite themes but with so much more colour and class. I would recommend it to the beginner for learning as the symbols are clear but also for someone who already reads.

In fact, probably going to buy myself another deck as mine are so well used."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I instantly fell in love with the Spiral Tarots as soon as I saw them. They're very feminine and i love the different shades and colours used. I'm new to Tarot cards, but I beleive I made the right choice choosing this deck as my first."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I agree with the reviewer who described these cards as deviating too much in their illustrations of the cards' meanings. I am a beginner, and I was hoping to have a deck with illustrations that align with the descriptions provided in most tarot teaching sources, especially those found online which I've found most helpful (biddy tarot, learn tarot, e.g.). However, these cards--beautiful though they are--seem to employ their own symbology, and in the absence of a book that applies to this deck specifically (something I didn't know I'd have to buy), I can't interpret many of these cards. Specifically, many of the cards feature a triangle, or an inverted triangle, letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and astrological symbols that mean nothing to me, and no explanation is offered in the tiny pamphlet that accompanies the deck. The meaning is lost on me. I run to one of my sources & look up the meaning...and my sources provide details of illustrations that are tarot-traditional, and aren't offered in these cards. One wants to have these \\"clues\\" in the pictures, so eventually you don't have to run to a source for an interpretation. I beg to differ with those who suggest this is a good deck for beginners. Unless you want to invest your time in learning a language of symbols that is specific to this tarot deck only, it isn't appropriate for learning the language of the tarot. The paintings are indeed beautiful, but I need more substance, i.e., illustrations that are grounded in the traditional tarot mythos."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"(Updated May 2009)The Spiral Tarot is essentially a Rider-Waite type deck with fancier art; however, there are a few cards where the artist took some liberties and fashioned cards that didn't strictly mimic their Rider-Waite counterparts. At first glance the deck does seem really pretty, but upon further study I came to regard many of the cards as downright creepy.The other issue with this deck is that the art is entirely way too cluttered. There's so much going on in the picture that you're unable to pick out what it's trying to tell you. It's like being a teacher and trying to get an answer out of your students but all of them are talking at once. Each card has a Hebrew letter and multiple astrological signs (which may remind some of a more Thoth-styled deck). The art itself is intensely dense. Layer upon layer of detail with dark, muddled colors make the deck feel rather oppressive.I've seen and used 3 incarnations of this deck, owned by two of my friends. The one deck just seemed like a real dud, and the other two tended to focus of the negative aspects of any situation being read about rather than focusing on the positive or, preferably, the whole picture. I can't say I'm all that impressed."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"The Spiral Tarot is my primary reading deck. Based primarily on Rider-Waite-Smith, it's eclectic and easy to learn. The Majors, especially, are heavily derived from Smith's artwork, but Steventon's style is much more elaborate and magical. I can't describe it very well; check out a tarot review site for pictures. While she draws heavily on Smith, Steventon makes several of the cards unmistakably her own. The Devil is one innovation--old Beelzebub is holding up a mirror, and the woman in the mirror blocks her reflection from her own sight. The Minors are done in a 19th-century style; some of the cards are clearly based on Impressionistic, Romantic, and Pre-Raphaelite works. For example, the 3 of Pentacles pictures a ballet dancer and reminds one of Degas's art, while the 8 of Cups is reminiscent of Rossetti's &quot;Proserpina&quot;. Most of the cards are beautiful and evocative. The deck is not overly religious or political, and so is useful for any question and any querent. I recommend it to anyone; a beginner and an advanced reader could probably both enjoy this deck."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"This deck is awesome. The symbolism is close to the standard Waite type, but the artwork has been improved a great deal. The Major Arcana cards are the nicest I've come across. The Minor Arcana are simpler, and look like the artist didn't spend as much time on them, but they are still very good. I found it very easy to read these cards; in fact I'd recommend not using the little interpretation booklet at all. The cards are that intuitive. If you like this one, you might also like the Robin Wood deck, which is similar but with a different style of drawing. Both are easy to read and have beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I'm a tarot newbie, and this is only the second deck I've bought (the first was the Sacred Circle Tarot). I've found it to be an excellent &quot;starter deck&quot; for beginners like me. The images are amazingly intuitive. It's nice to be able to do a spread without constantly referring to the handbook that gives the interpretation of each card! I never thought I'd be able to do that so quickly, but this deck is so easy to read! The artwork is very nice as well. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"My husband bought me this deck as a present and I immediately fell in love with it. I have other decks that I use but since receiving this Spiral deck, I find that I'm drawn more to it and have gained a new understanding of the cards. The images for the minor arcana are insightful and I find that interpretation has come much more readily and I don't always have to consult a book for meaning. It's also nice to compare and contrast this deck with others to see how the images are portrayed. I recommend this to beginners, collectors or almost anyone interested in Tarot."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"The visual side of this deck is amazing, each card an oil painting that has been meticulously beaded.The images are big visual memory prompts, teaching you what each card represents. I also, being a student of history, love the celtic and Arthurian themes that run through the arcanas.I am a beginner to astrology and do not understand a lot of the symbols on the cards, but I find this deck easy to use and really helpful, as just using it improves your knowledge of symbology and the art of tarot.I definately recommend it, its a brilliant buy and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I became a deck collector sort of by accident (how did that drawer get full of Tarot decks??)... but THIS deck is the one I use constantly. This deck is the one I bought a spare deck of..just in case. It is lovely, yet not that pretty/fluffy look of some of the fantasy type decks. Each card has unique symbolism built into it which really assists with doing a reading without constantly 'looking it up'. I also highly recommend the book that was written for this deck. Very well done."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who gave 5 stars. The artwork is beautiful and the book accompany this deck will explain the imagaes, which will help you as an aide-memoire to figure out the meanings of the cards if you are a beginner. This is a great deck for beginners as it was my very first deck and I learned tarot using this deck. The images are very classic and look like paintings. There are also images that are hints in the background of the cards relating the numerology and jewish mysticism (tree of life) aspect of tarot to the pictures. one note: this deck uses pentacles for a suit instead of coins or discs, but it's hard to know that from the outside of the box--just in case you have a preference for the name of the suit or if you don't like to look at pentacles (which give an occult look) to the deck--even though in tarot that is not what pentacles stand for. I enjoy this deck very much even today."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"It wasn't easy to find that just right deck. Being that this was to be my first tarot deck, I wanted just the right deck. The spiral tarot offers mind-blowing artwork and an easy to read format that even seasoned divinors can enjoy.

I was cautious about buying this deck after that review, but the beauty of the cards won me over. And isn't that the way it's supposed to be? The cards should speak to the reader; so go to a site with illustrations of these cards and see what you think. I find the Major Arcana cards totally evocative and multi-dimensional; similar to the Waite so you're not trying to figure out where they fit, but with a clarity of their own. I don't mind the purple border; purple is the color of spirituality. My main worry was the Minor Arcana cards; I was expecting some tawdy Victorian cartoon drawings or something. But I find the Minor Arcana of this deck to be very people-oriented; one review at another site mentioned it hits the &quot;details&quot;. Their setting has a mythology of its own. The one drawback I've found so far is with the Court Cards; personally I prefer the Robin Wood version. But I'm sure the court cards will prove their own worth, as well."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"I received this deck as a gift from a friend nearly a year ago now, and since then, I don't think I've parted from it for more than a few days at a time, it's constantly with me.

Definitely something I'd recommend. I don't like the artwork of the Minor Arcana very much, but that's the only setback in my opinion."},{"Title":"Spiral Tarot Deck","review":"This particular deck has some very pretty cards in it.

And on top of that, he writes an excellent plot that keeps you turning pages. He does a great job of timing so that there is just enough of his theory of evolution at any one point to keep me fascinated!"},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"As usual, it's filled with sexism, women as victims or sluts, a convoluted plot, shallow characters and poor dialogue. It didn't sound at all historical - it sounded like modern people in costume. Badly done, but its typical Anthony fare."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"The second Geodyssey volume from Piers Anthony, 'Shame of Man' follows the lives of Hugh and Ann, illuminating as they do eight million years of history. The self-contained formula of 'Isle of Woman' is maintained; however, characters from that novel usefully return as occasional backdrop. The scenery remains wonderfully varied, with the narrative opening in the Great Rift Valley and continuing as far afield as Vietnam, Newfoundland and Scotland's Orkney Islands.The strongest of the twenty scenarios occurs 3,000 years ago, around the time of King David. Anthony's choice of Philistine characters here illustrates his approach: he doesn't always avoid the history textbooks' ground, but is nonetheless loath to retread conventional paths. Thus we see Japan visited in the third century AD, and on Genghis Khan's rise to fame we see an enemy's colossal misjudgment where other authors might substitute triumphant slaughter. The requisite Mediterranean setting is not Rome but New Carthage; similarly, when the story touches down in 1862 the siege is not of Richmond but of Shanghai, where millions died in the Taiping rebellion.Anthony expresses concern that global catastrophe lurks around the corner, and this is brought home to the reader most clearly in the microcosm of Easter Island (neatly sandwiched between Genghis and Scheherazade). Indeed, even the characters gradually become aware of it. The future of the sensible ones is glimpsed in Tasmania half a century hence. The use to which they put their technology, and their need to do so, is rich food for thought."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"Across eight million years, mankind repeats a single story. Hu/Hugh finds his true love, battles a brother-sister team, raises one genetic son, one adopted daughter, and one adopted son, and discovers and practices music while his wife develops dance. In more than a dozen lands--from early Africa to China, Mongolia, Easter Island, Palestine, and even Tasmania, Hu and Anne explore their relationship, Hu's weird obsession with Ss, and the art of becoming good parents.As this family pursues survival, they discover the dangers of falling outside the pack. When Hu refuses to join in a hunt for giant orangetangs, believing them too manlike to serve as food, he is cast out of his pack and nearly dies. But the result of the hunt is, over time, the elimination of a kindred species and their replacement with the dominant man. Likewise, in the recent past, Hugh's decision to support tree-spiking nearly results in his arrest. Short term profit maximization becomes more important than the long term survival of the planet.Author Piers Anthony continues his fascinating exploration of mankind's history--and mankind's relationship to the planet. Throughout history, living creatures have shaped the earth without being aware of the consequences of their actions. Man, by virtue of his intelligence, is able to do far more to Earth than most species--and in a far shorter time. But Anthony manages (mostly) to avoid a preachy political manifesto in the form of a story. Instead, the oddesy of Hu and Anne through the millions of years, with a variety of faces, becomes a compelling and fascinating story. With Anthony's strong writing, this book is hard to put down.Is Anthony right--will mankind be doomed to exercise extreme social control in order to prevent our own extinction? It certainly seems possible. Indeed, the Bush administration's decision to name environmental activists leaders in 'domestic terrorism' indicates how far mankind must come in a very short time if we are to begin to even take into account the very real costs that our actions impose on Earth.SHAME OF MAN is the kind of story that makes you think--and stretches your brain. There's plenty of tragedy here, but also a solid adventure, a love story, retelling of mythology, and a number of windows to societies outside those that Americans are generally exposed to in their history classes."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"This book really makes you think about how our insticts guide us and human existence in general.

There wasn't as much sex and rape as was in the first book, but still more than was necessary (none would have probably been just fine.)The storyline in this book is much more congruous throughout the ages unlike the first one. This made it easier to relate to the new surroundings.The history presented is very interesting.One thing I can't stand in books are flashbacks to things that happened earlier in the book. This happens nearly every chapter as the previous events are recounted in the new setting.The last thing that really annoyed me are the names of some of the people. Bb, Ss, Vk, Beebub, Scevo...

It is an interesting way to look at human evolution and will give you a better understanding of the how and why we have evolved to the point we are at now."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"This was a rather good book and a decent follow-up to Isle of Woman. I actually enjoyed the more primitive parts of this book (the ones that happened more than 10,000 years ago), because after that, the stories have a lot of smut in them. Not that adult stuff is bad, since most of us are adults, but I do wish that Mr. Anthony would rely on it less as a plot device, he uses it SO much in most if not all of his books, and it gets really old.I mean, after a while, I was getting REALLY tired of reading about Hu and Sis because it was just the same thing over and over and OVER, and I'm thinking to myself, COME ON. It's crazy, especially when the family has basically the same story through their reincarnations (losing Chip, finding an abandoned Mina, etc) so it got rather monotonous with about 1/2-1/3 of the stories (the last third of this book) and I wish Mr, Anthony had focused more on the real plot instead of all the drama with Sis. This is why I only gave the book 3 stars, because while it was creative (the non-smut part) it got very repetitive, and I was getting bored about 2/3 through the book."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"This book is sequel to Isle of Woman, which I did like a lot This one was good but not as good as the first. Shame of Man mostly revolved around the character Hue, or Hugh or other variations of his was used also. Revolving around one character made it different from the first book because the first had two main characters and it was more of a love story. This one was more about struggles of man versus evil or man vs. survival. There was more history and mythology involved in this also, which I found in parts were kinda of dry and hard for my thought process. I had a problem with trying to figure out in each chapter reincarnation, who was who because their names changed slightly each time to fit the area a time period. It also had characters from the first book in the series so I was trying to remember them as well and sometimes coming up blank. Then there was new character to which I would try to figure out if I had met them yet. So that made it a little frustrating. I still like the book and the thought of the way it is written but whether I will read the third one in the series, Hope of Earth, is up in the air. On one side I really liked Isle of Woman but on the other Shame of Man was only so so. Maybe it was just the fact that the story was man vs. evil and that there is always a balancing act between the two and not yay good won! I don't know resembles life to much for me. Yet if it had been yay good wins I probably would have said predicable."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"The concept behing the Geodessy is compeling and the first book was great. This one didn't add that much to it.I do admire the way Anthony changed his focus. This novel focuses on the role of the family and family members in struggle. This is not as dynamic or suspenseful a focus as that of Isle of Woman and therefore the book lacks a little in the suspense department. You will probably always know what the characters will do - they stick together 'cause their a family.That being said, the stories are fun and the concept behind the book still carries it further than you'd expect (the concept of the same characters being reborn in various places and times).If you like Isle of Woman, you'll probably like this one. If you thought it was so-so, you may be in for a long, dull night."},{"Title":"Shame of Man","review":"After reading Isle of Woman, getting and reading Shame of Man became my next obsession. I'm happy that I did read it. This sequal to Isle of Woman is about Hugh and his beautiful wife Anne and their family. While the plot seems simple enough, Piers Anthony puts in the most wonderful unexpected twists and turns that make this story so exciting. He also includes characters from other sagas in the Geodyssey series as they continue on with their lives. I very highly reccomend this book to people who love history and enjoy feeling as connected to the characters as I do. All in all, the characters are wonderful, and the places in the past Piers Anthony sends you makes you feel like your there.

It was published posthumously in the 1930s. Pirenne's thesis is simple, but, I believe, compelling: The Roman Empire did not come to an end with the Germanic invasions, as was the consensus view of historians; but with the Islamic invasions of the seventh century that transformed the Mediterranean from a Roman lake-&#34;mare nostrum&#34;-that facilitated commerce between the northern and southern shores into a barrier that barred non-Muslim commerce in the western Mediterranean and compelled the Christian world to turn inward toward northern Europe for its growth and eventual development.I have one caveat.

Why did Europe take such a catastrophic slide backwards?Pirenne's answer is that Arab conquerors turned the Mediterranean into a Muslim lake, and, as a result, trade plummeted and Europe went into an economic death-spiral.Unfortunately, this answer does not satisfy many modern historians. At their boldest, they claim that Pirenne was trying to explain something (\\"The Dark Ages\\") that simply did not exist. You might want to argue about that, but there is very little argument about the idea of the \\"Muslim Lake.\\" In fact, during most of the period under investigation, the Eastern Mediterranean was a Byzantinue lake!Let us not forget that Muhammad and his tribes were people of the desert, who knew everything about camels but nothing at all about ships: \\"Muslim fleets\\" were built by non-Arabs (and non-Muslims) and they were also staffed by mercenaries who knew which way the winds blew in the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, the \\"Muslim fleets\\" were annihilated by the Byzantine \\"secret weapon\\" known as \\"Greek Fire.\\"To cap it all off, there is no evidence at all that trade between Europe and the Middle East took a fall. Prof. Pirenne thought he had found some, but modern research has found a lot more which contradicts the fragments he found.As for those pesky \\"Dark Ages,\\" they were not as productive of books and high intellectual culture, which academics love, but they were extremely productive in inventions which enabled farmers to produce more and people to eat more: the deep plow with moldboard, the three-field cropping system, the breeding and use of really big horses to use as draft animals and \\"war horses,\\" chain-mail armor, the high-backed saddle, the stirrup, the crossbow...the era was not really dark at all, but does rather raise the question of why all these crucial innovations had to await the fall of the Roman Empire.I suspect that a couple of books will help you explore these problems: Rodney Stark'sGod's Battalions: The Case for the Crusadesand the same author'sThe Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success.But the main one is Peter Brown'sThe Rise of Western Christendom: Triumph and Diversity, A.D. 200-1000, 2nd Edition (The Making of Europe)."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"This is the first book I have read by Pirenne and I will certainly read the others. It was very illuminating of a particularly difficult period to comprehend.The book is important in that it throws a lot of components not often discussed in the military-dynastic histories that are more readily available on this period, or for that matter on any other. The concept of investigating the economic structures was revolutionary in Pirenne's time, and this is the principal, most important contribution of his dissertation, which must be considered incomplete, as I read in the introduction that his son gave the manuscript to a scholar that was one of Pirenne's best students to polish for publication, and that it was the standard procedure for his father to write every book twice over, the second version being usually significantly changed from the first. I also read the book in French, as I find a lot of foreign works are often censored and adapted when translated into English.I think his research was superb, as it approaches the entire periods discussed from an economic point of view. The period after the fall of the Roman Empire is not, according to Pirenne, as dark as we had previously considered. The Roman system persevered for centuries, it was the invasion of the Mediterranean by the Muslims from the 7th century forward that crushed the Roman legacy and brought forth the \\"Middle\\" Ages. However Pirenne does not at any point clarify that both Christianity and Islam were equally intellectually inferior to the culture they were replacing, which needed renovation and evolution rather than obliteration. At least a chapter should have been dedicated to this important issue, which was not economical, yet surely had an effect on the economy and could have been discussed from that viewpoint, such as for example the issue of interest in finance and its conflict with Christian teaching during this period. Yet I am nevertheless impressed by the amount of information that Pirenne provides to support the preservation of Roman culture and infrastructure in the newly established barbaric kingdoms.My one point of contention, and it is an important point, is that it should be noted that as a westerner and a christian, Pirenne was prejudiced against the muslim, which he tends to color as a barbaric horde of destruction and whom he continuously blames for not following or maintaining the roman cultural models. This is a subtle, yet latent component in the book yet it is not quite accurate as a historical truth. For all his discussion of papyrus and parchment, for example, Pirenne omits that during the entire period of the Middle Ages, Europe's most important library was in Cordoba, starting around in 788, or more than a full generation prior to Charlemagne's coronation. Please see C. Prince, 'The Historical Context of Arabic Translation, Learning, and The Libraries of Medieval Andalusia', Library History, v. 18, July 2002, pp. 73-87 for a most refreshing view on the topic of book production, libraries and paper trade from the 8th century onwards, as well as to the control of quality that existed in Arab copies. Its a well known fact that this library had over 60,000 volumes listed in its 48 volume catalogue while Christendom's two largest libraries at Avignon and the Sorbonne contained at most 2,000 volumes until as late as 1150. More importantly, the preservation of classical texts is their greatest achievement. These texts would have disappeared forever, we can be sure with the blessing of the Christian church, as many others undoubtedly did, had it not been preserved for us by Muslim scholars and libraries.The viewpoint of western cultural centrism is not only obsolete, but a dangerous idiocy that has caused and continues to cause an inaccurate reading of history as well as to fuel and distort the animosity between Christian and Muslim cultures, which was basically then and has been through the centuries that of rival empires. One should keep that in mind when noting that the entire corpus of Aristotle's works were among the treasures that were salvaged from the Arab libraries and that making their way back into western cultural mainstream provided the basis for the Renaissance and the renewal of Modern Europe."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"Belgian historian Henri Pirenne's thesis, that the Mediterranean World of Antiquity was broken by the rise of Islam in the seventh and eighth centuries and not by the Germanic invaders of the fifth and sixth centuries has been subject to endless criticism, debate and revision since Mohammed and Charlemage was first published in Europe in 1937.In Pirenne's view, the conquest of the eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean, of Spain, and of the important islands had shut off the movement of world trade which had flourished during the late Roman times. The result of this closure returned western Europe to an earlier &quot;natural&quot; and rural economic system, which set in motion a shifting of the balance of power in Europe from the Mediterranean region to the north.Although by the time Mohammed and Charlemagne was published the theory that Rome had collapsed suddenly under the impact of the immense German invasions during the fifth century was being qualified, it was Pirenne's theory on the end of the Ancient World and the beginning of the Middle Ages that upset traditional historical conceptions. He advanced the thesis that the Ancient World ended only after the Arab invasions of the seventh and eighth centuries had swept around the coasts of Mediterranean and had converted it into a Moslem lake on which, as one Arab writer said, the Christians could no longer &quot;float a plank.&quot; This, Pirenne argued, had been accomplished by the last quarter of the eighth century and had destroyed the essential unity of the Roman Empire. For centuries the Mediterranean had been a &quot;Roman lake&quot; the Mare Nostrum of the Romans which held the great imperial structure together: Rome's trade and commerce, its military and naval might, the important exchange of ideas.The Mediterranean unity of the Roman Empire had not, according to Pirenne, been destroyed by the German tribes that had occupied the western Empire. The Germans admired the superior Roman civilization and diligently set about to continue it, copying everything from the Roman emperors' dress and ceremonies to the government structures and gold coinage. They did whatever they could to preserve Roman culture.This book is a classic which is as timely today as it was when it was first published on the eve of WWII. Read it for Pirenne's immaculate scholarship and his then provocative theory that the Teutonic &quot;barbarians&quot; were the upholders and awestruck heirs of Rome and not its destroyers--that distinction belongs to rise Islam."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"Mohammed and Charlemagne is the last work of Henri Pirenne. It was published after his death and represents a masterpiece of historical scholarship. This is a seminal work that challenged the thesis that Germanic barbarians obliterated the Roman Empire. His revolutionary thesis was that the unexpected rise and advance of Islam led to the downfall of the Empire. With the rise of Islam, the Mediterranean was no longer a thoroughfare of commerce and ideas. Without the Mediterranean, commerce dried up to a trickle and Europe slipped into the Middle Ages.The revision and completion of the book was completed by one of Pirenne's students after his death. That leads to one of my criticisms. Previous works by Pirenne I found engaging and masterfully written. This work however, seemed to lack the same literary style and, as a consequence, I found it to be a choppy read that lacked the clear crispness of his previous works. While this statement is subjective, it is not irrelevant. When Pirenne expounds on economic and sociological issues of the Middle Ages his words literally leap off the page. It is disappointing that this subject does not surface until the end of the book."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"Henri Pirenne's legacy lies in his famous thesis, publishedposthumously in 1937 as \\"Mohammed and Charlemagne\\" (and statedearlier in numerous articles): namely, that whereas theGermanic invasions of the IV and V century broke the politicalunity of the Mediterranean world, they did not break itscultural and economic unity. The ancient world kept huggingthe coastline 'like frogs around a pond' and the East reassertedits supremacy over the West. All this changed when the Islamicinvasions conquered Northern Africa and the EasternMediterranean, closing the commercial and cultural exchangesbetween the two halves of the Roman empire and capturing thetwo most vibrant centres of commerce and culture (especially,theological culture) of the Byzantine empire: Syria and Egypt,whose religious separatism had been a constant worry for theEastern Roman emperors.As a consequence, the center of gravity of the European economyshifted to the more agrarian and less romanized regions aroundthe Rhine (Charlemagne's capital is in Aix-La-Chapelle, nowadaysAachen) while the cities of Italy and Southern France decayed.It is this which eventually led to the emergence of a diversifiedWestern European culture as opposed to the Middle East and,eventually, Eastern (Orthodox) Europe. And therefore Charlemagnecould never have existed without Mohammed.However, this is not the whole story. As Dennett and Lopez noted,lack of Oriental merchandise in Merovingian lists may notnecessarily be due to a dearth of imports but to events onthe supply side and most importantly to the opening of theRussian route to Baghdad, as Scandinavian coin hoards show(e.g., Bohlin and Riising). Hence the rise of Quentovic andDorestad as important ports and the Frisian trade until theirdestruction by Northman raiders.Although commerce was now closed to Frankish shipping,trade in the Mediterranean had long been the prerogativeof Syrians, who had extensive colonies in Marseilles.Meroviangian cities in the region had already been decliningfor some time and ideas of a renaissance of a Romano-Germanculture in the VI and VII centuries are overrated by itslack of originality; the foremost product of VI centuryerudition is the largely fallacious encyclopedia of Isidore.Despite its flaws, this work is fundamental for its boldness inpresenting a continental and often world view of history andof great transformations.

Lappen"},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"Henri Pirenne, who revolutionized the study of medieval beginnings, presents a thorough explanation of his intriguing thesis in this final historical volume. His point is well taken, that the Moslem invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries were just as crucial, if not more so, to the dawn of the Middle Ages as were the Germanic invasions of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. However, as far-sighted as this idea may be, there is a near obsessiveness with proving his point that tends to make Pirenne's work seem less than well-founded. Several wide sweeping generalizations are made, such as the observation that the Germanic invaders contributed nothing of worth to their new surroundings, but rather came for the social paradise that was the Roman Empire. Also, he seems to contradict his own conclusions from time to time, as in his assertion that Charlemagne both sought and did not seek a Mediterranean Empire during his reign. As a whole, though, the book is a fascinating read.For those who do not have any knowledge of Latin or French, the book makes a difficult read, as many of his sources are quoted in their original language, and beginning historians may have trouble with the veritable barrage of unfamiliar names and concepts. However, two works which may make this problem a little less severe are William Bark's &quot;Origins of the Medieval World,&quot; and &quot;The Pirenne Thesis,&quot; edited by Alfred Havighurst."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"Although by many dismissed as \\"dated\\", Pirenne's \\"M&C;\\" remains a central piece of historical writing that cannot be ignored.That is why first-rate scholars of today, like Michael McCormick, are still wrestling with the range of issues Pirenne brought into focus. (McCormick's \\"Origins of the European economy, 300-900\\" is an indispensable modern masterpiece, by the way).While Pirenne certainly overstated his case in some respects (particularly in minimizing the economic decline of the Mediterrenean in the fifth and sixth centuries along with an oversimplified picture of the Carolingian Empire as an essentially non-monetary society), some aspects retain relevance, and also some validity:1. Pirenne emphasized the crucial importance of the nort-western Frisian trade in Carolingian times in the \\"new economy\\". This point is uncontroversial today; what is probably dated is Pirenne's restriction of monetary Carolingian economy to this region; McCormick, for example, is highly convincing in his arguments that the Carolingian juggernaut fed the Slavic slave export to the Islamic countries (and to a lesser extent, to Byzantium) by way of Venice.2. It is an indubitable fact that the Rhone valley and ports like Marseilles were wholly insignificant in Carolingian times, in complete contrast to their pivotal role in Merovingian times. (McCormick and others don't dispute that).But, this is the only region of Gaul that has a direct Mediterrenean connection!!Thus, dynamically speaking, Pirenne is perfectly correct in saying that France's link to the rest of the Old Roman world shifted northwards, namely through the Alpine passes and Germany and so on.The Mediterrenean \\"unity\\" was indeed a broken thing at the time of Charlemagne, in the sense that it was not transport acrooss the sea that connected Gaul to the rest as it had been up till the..seventh century.And what might the role of the rise of Islam be here?To mention a few points:1. McCormick notes that the large factories for the production of garum around Gibraltar went into a precipitious decline as the result of the Muslim invasions of North Africa (and then Spain). This is an uncontroversial issue.But, how would these products have been spread throughout the (northern) Mediterrenean?An ideal stopping place along a coastal-hugging route would, indeed, be Marseilles.It would therefore be highly interesting to study whether Marseilles, in Merovingian times up to the Arab invasions, was a major transit station milking off Spanish products.If that was the case, then the Muslim expansion cannot get \\"off the hook\\" for the decline in the importance of the Rhone area.2. If I remember correctly, a major export article from Merovingian Gaul was timber, along with wine and grain. The timber was sent to wood-poor areas like Nort Africa and Syria.While the withering of Rome in the fifth and sixth centuries would result in a probable collapse in the wine and grain export from Gaul, the timber export would hardly have been affected (or rather, that is something to find out!).But, the demand after construction materials like timber is highly sensitive to political distress. Furthermore, as the result of the Muslim invasions, it would seem highly imprudent to furnish the new masters in Syria and North Africa with building materials for fleets.Thus, as I see it, the Muslim invasions in the southern mediterrenean may have dealt the deathblow to a flourishing timber trade down the Rhone, and that in this sense, Pirenne was right with regard to the devastating impact of these invasions on Gaulish economy.Anyway, aside from these speculations, Pirenne's book is elegantly written and is a very good read."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"This was a dense and sometimes intractable read with a few startling insights. I found it hard going but worth the slog. Pirenne suffers a little from the historian's deformity of Kingitis, and expends a deal of space tracking the rise and fall of the early Germanic monarchs and those around them. This is reality TV for the pre-Marconi erudite, and not for everyone. I personally have a taste for more details of the agricultural landscape, diet, medicine, philosophical ideas and the other trappings of a whole civilisation. As we are dealing with the fall of the classical West, philosophical ideas are not far away, but that it about as far as it goes.So I might have written this book off with two or three stars. Why didn't I? Well, because there is a striking new way of looking at the Mediterranean world and the transition from late antiquity to the Middle Ages, and one that I find Pirenne has managed to sell to me. Pirenne's assiduous collection of royal mugs reveals a picture of the hairy barbarians who penetrated the Empire quite different to the usual. He states no less that that the Goths, Vandals, Lombards and Franks who indundated most of Western Rome, beside sacking the odd city like Rome, did not actually displace Rome. They became part of it. Continuity was preserved, not just in Byzantium but in Africa, Italy, Languedoc and Iberia. The Germans wanted the status of Roman citizenship, once they had tasted it.So why, then, did the Western Empire nevertheless collapse and Europe sink into a Dark Age? The economy collapsed, feudalism took hold, gold coin was no longer minted and Latin fragmented into the score of languages we see today, retained in a pure form only by the clergy. Why, if the martially potent Germans sought to retain the empire, did they not do so? Pirenne's answer is that the astonishing, explosive expansion of Islam a mere few years after the death of Muhammad turned Europe on its head and the Western Mediterranean into a corsairs' boating lake. Africa, the bread-basket, was lost in a flash. Trade across the sea stagnated. Iberia and Sicily were overrun and Constantinople besieged. Parts of Southern France were occupied and cities from Italy to Scandinavia raided. What the German and Turkic barbarians did not achieve by way of fragmenting the Empire Islam achieved in a moment. Europe turned in on itself.This is a compelling vision, and explains some oddities such as the simultaneous fragmentation of Latin as a vulgar tongue and perfection as a language of erudition. It also chimes well with the aspiration to continuity which obviously hung about the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire felt itself to be the old but clearly was not. The oddly tense relationship between the Church and the Emperor acquires some clarity in Pirenne's light, as well.So on the whole I found this a tiring but very worthwhile read. I am glad I persevered."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"Like most revisionist histories, it's enjoyable to see an authors attempts at cause and effect even if you don't agree with some of their arguments.The Roman Empire faced a north-south divide between the Roman south and the German north before being broken by the Wanderung, so the concept is not new and the idea that the Islamic Conquest closed off the Roman Mare Nostrum is self-evident. I do take issue with this thesis that the Germanic invasions had no lasting impact (you should remember that each historian is a product of their time), they don't call it the Dark Ages for nothing. Yes, the world of 650AD may have been recognisable to an inhabitant of 400AD, but in purely technological or agricultural terms. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, where are the tax receipts, the literature, the civic building projects and the infrastructure repairs and the developed legal processes? While the german tribes who crossed the Rhine may have looked upon the Empire as a cash cow or lands to be expropriated, they were too unsophisticated to run it themselves, relying first on romanised patricians, then the Church to handle the levers of government as the provinces collapsed into decay and internecine warfare. It wasn't until those statelets coalesced into mature principalities that the decay was able to be reversed from Charlemagne onwards. However they still harked back to the forms of the Roman Empire that they had supplanted.The closing off of the Mediterranean is a different matter, easily verified through documentary, archaeological and mercantile sources. Again, a group of people looking enviously at the Roman patrimony who did their best to supplant it, but one that Pirenne here accurately describes as a huge cultural and economic shift, that continues to this day with a north-south and an east-west divide across the Mediterranean. The only real obstacle to an Islamic Roman Empire was Byzantium, behind who sheltered the western statelets.Whether you agree with Pirenne or not, it is still an absorbing study of the collapse and division of the Roman Empire whose ghost still haunts us today."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne (Meridian books)","review":"This magnificent 284 page piece of scholarship was first published in English in 1939 by W.W.

It is magisterial in scope, thesis, and evidence gathering. To read it is to follow along with the mind of a master. The book's title gives the thesis - to study nature's ecosystems as economies. Predator and prey are construed as consumer and producer. Ecosystems are compared as between different evolutionary eras, continents versus islands, and different climactic regimes to pull out principle relations among and between economies such as power. An easy sample: \\"Ecologically, this means that powerful entities are large, fast, wide-ranging, rapidly metabolizing units capable of exerting strong forces, storing and regulating resources, and responding appropriately to a wide variety of circumstances. Power makes for prolific producers and demanding consumers with a wide reach.\\" (p. 124)The book gave me the sense of the author's being onto something really important, but at the same time the thesis came off somewhat diffuse and without the punch of a mature new theory (why I gave only 4 stars).

Thompson's book is the first I have ever read that is more than the typical slander on Joe Jackson.Thompson takes a look into the man, more than the ball player, and allows you to see a side of Jackson never before revealed. What Thompson gives the reader is by far the best accounting of a true hero in the game of baseball.This book is so much more than a story about a World Series in 1919; it's so much more than a story about baseball. This book is about the man Joe Jackson and the side of him most of us have never seen. I am extremely proud to be allowed to review this book"},{"Title":"Growing Up With \\"Shoeless Joe\\" The Greatest Natural Player in Baseball History","review":"Last September I painted a mural of &quot;Shoeless &quot; Joe Jackson in his home town---Greenville, South Carolina. His name meant nothing to me until I went to the library to do research for the painting. There I discovered I might be the only person in the world who was unaware of &quot;Shoeless.&quot;Never interested in sports, I thought I was reading about the legendary hero only to acquaint myself with the visual particulars of the man and the game of baseball in the early 1900's. Before I finished the first book I was hooked----not by the sport, but by the deeply moving life story of Joe himself.Further research led me to read Joe Thompson's GROWING UP WITH &quot;SHOELESS&quot; JOE JACKSON, The Greatest Natural Player In Baseball History. Here was an account, written in the personal first person that makes one feel the intimacy of a hometown boy's acquaintance, and love for the subject. There was no turning back then. I became an ardent fan of &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe.Thompson has written in the voice of the South Carolina native he is. Unpretentiously he tells, not only the history of Jackson's baseball career, but of the man as a child of impoverished mill worker parents. He speaks of a small boy who was never sent to school, and who was sweeping the floors of Brandon Mill when only seven years old. He makes you hear the taunts &quot;Shoeless&quot; endured because he never learned to read or write. He makes you proud of the little mill kid who, in spite of everything, made it to the major leagues. And he makes you weep for the wretched debacle which cost an innocent &quot;Shoeless&quot; his brilliant career.In 1996 the Brandon Mill Baseball Field in West Greenville was finally named for &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson. Thompson's vivid fury that publicity and general media coverage was as lackluster as the bitterly cold day of the dedication, fairly sizzles on the pages of his book.Thompson's infectious outrage that &quot;Shoeless&quot; has been slighted by his own hometown has persuaded me to become involved in the renewal of the once thriving business district of the mill village. Many more murals depicting &quot;Shoeless'&quot; career, and the textile history of the area, are on the drawing boards.Buddy Hunt, who commissioned the original mural, is opening a coffee shop, Cuppa Joe, so fans will have a place to stop and chat when visiting. Hunt owns a number of large empty buildings across the street from where &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe owned a liquor store. His hope is to attract investors, restaurateurs and shop keepers---all with sports, or related themes---to the long neglected area.I have met the author of GROWING UP WITH &quot;SHOELESS&quot; JOE JACKSON, and am proud that he not only approves of the renewal project, but is helping to bring it about.Whether or not you are a sports fan, this book will tug at your heartstrings, for it is a rich and poignant history written by a hometown boy who tells it like it is.Polly Hunt Neal"},{"Title":"Frommer's Unofficial Guide to the Best RV & Tent Campgrounds in the U.S.A.","review":"An overall failing, in my opinion, of the campground rating books (I would include Woodall's &amp; Trailer Life) is a tendency to \\"fluff\\" the description or rating of the parks. This book is guilty, guilty, guilty. Let's take just an example. In the gorgeous state of Montana they review Indian Creek RV Campground in Deer Lodge. For beauty they give it a 4 star rating, I will go along; the mountains alone probably merit the rating; if you will overlook the immediate surroundings. Spaciousness is given a 4, only true if the park is half empty. If you have someone next to you, it is cheek and jowl. When we stayed there for one night, we could have passed the salt easily from our dining table inside the RV to the neighbor's picnic table. Our picnic table was taken over by the trailer for the tow vehicle of the people next door; they had no room left in their space. I think a rating of 3out of 5 would lead you to believe the spaciousness was reasonably good, I disagree. Site privacy was non existent in most cases yet the park is given a rating of 3 out of 5. Quiet is given 3 stars. I-90 is one of the boundaries of the campground. I-90 is not known for being quiet, although I do admit it quieted down a lot past 8:00 PM. In the text descriptions of the campground, it is described as being on the banks of the Yellowstone River. NOT, nowhere near. I would recommend Deer Lodge, if you can stay in the part away from the interstate in one of the larger sites. The town should not be missed, the mountains are glorious, and you can walk or bike to town. But I would not want to go here planning to spend several days in a quiet place with big spaces on the banks of a non-existent river. It would be a disappointing experience. One buys these books to avoid disappointing experiences. Why not tell the truth, some sites are narrow some are larger, by the interstate so not real quiet but not too noisy, great mountain view, walking distance to a very interesting town. Isn't that good enough? Do we need to fluff it so you arrive and are set up for disappointment? Where the river comes in, I don't know. Perhaps there are 2 Indian Creak RV parks in two different Deer Lodge Montanas?Some of the RV parks are in the wrong cities. Columbia riverfront RV Resort is in Woodland. Would someone looking for lodging in Woodland search in Vancouver? I think not.While some parks seem to have inflated ratings others seem not to be given credit. Yogi Bear's Camp Resort in Cheney outside Spokane Washington is given only 1 star for site privacy. Yet it has huge spaces with trees in between. While you can see other RV's, the privacy seems better than most and certainly better than Indian Creek RV Park in Deer Lodge Montana, yet that park merited a rating of 3. Makes no sense. I would give the Cheney Park a 3. Spaciousness rates the Cheney park 2 while it has nice big sites, compared to a 3 in Deer Lodge. Makes no sense.Many great parks are missed completely. By Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, Blackwell's is a marvelous park. No mention of it in this book.I think the book succeed in some ways. The written description (where it is accurate) is a great adjunct to the ratings. Fleshing out the ratings is a great idea! Some of the descriptions are apt and lead to parks you would not want to miss, like Polson KOA in Montana, a gorgeous park looking over Flathead Lake and the Mission Mountains, beautifully landscaped and well run.More often I think the book fails.1. Inaccuracy. Rivers where there are none. Privacy and space where there are none.2. If it is a guide to the \\"Best\\" RV campgrounds, why does it include VanMall RV Park in Vancouver, a cramped, crowded, parking lot type park with no privacy or space and leave out Blackwell's in Coeur D'Alene with the river, lake, great service, grassy sites, and wildlife? Deer Park in Eugen Oregon is another nice park with a big grassy lawn, nice sites, and friendly people, no mention here.The \\"best\\" RV park guide has not been written.

This list is alphabetical. Works of art are mentioned under the name of the artist. As a sample of this index I copy a little bit from the entry about Tintoretto below. Because of the age of this book some of the works of art may no longer be in the place they were at the time this book was written.Sample from the Index of Places:JACOPO TINTORETTO.1518-1592.

A Lady dressed as a Queen.=Berlin.= 298. Portrait of Procurator.299. The same.300. Madonna with SS. Mark and Luke.[...]*************Sample from Chapter 14 (about Tintoretto:)Tintoretto grew to manhood when thefruit of the Renaissance was ripe on every bough. The Renaissance hadresulted in the emancipation of the individual, in making him feel thatthe universe had no other purpose than his happiness. This brought anentirely new answer to the question, \\"Why should I do this or that?\\" Itused to be, \\"Because self-instituted authority commands you.\\" The answernow was, \\"Because it is good for men.\\" In this lies our greatest debt tothe Renaissance, that it instituted the welfare of man as the end of allaction. The Renaissance did not bring this idea to practical issue, butour debt to it is endless on account of the results the idea hasproduced in our own days. This alone would have made the Renaissance aperiod of peculiar interest, even if it had had no art whatever. Butwhen ideas are fresh and strong, they are almost sure to find artisticembodiment, as indeed this whole epoch found in painting, and thisparticular period in the works of Tintoretto.[...]"},{"Title":"Bigwig Briefs: Become an Investment Banker - The Real World Intelligence Necessary to Become a Successful Investment Banker","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone going into, or thinking of going into investment banking.

Especially useful was the chapter written by the head of investment banking from Merrilly Lynch.The book is short and very easy to read. I highligh recommend it for anyone interested in investment banking."},{"Title":"Bigwig Briefs: Become an Investment Banker - The Real World Intelligence Necessary to Become a Successful Investment Banker","review":"This book is a collection of general advice from 10 professionals in banking and venture capital. It's short (which I found to be both a pro and a con) - about 90 pages long (in huge font with large spacing) - and takes 1-2 hours to read.The advice in this book concentrates on personal qualities and work ethics that will help a beginning banker become successful in his/her career. It does not cover what a job at an i-bank or a private equity firm would actually entail (i.e. job responsibilities, corporate structure, hours, pay, etc.). For that information, check out the Vault Career Guide for Investment Banking - it is very comprehensive, despite its poor rating and reviews here on Amazon.I found most of the advice given in this book very repetitive and, in most cases, rather obvious. Most of the professionals stress that you need to have good \\"people skills\\", understand issues from the client's perspective, and build a long-term relationship with the client based on mutual understanding and trust. Most of the other advice given in the book stems from these three basic facts. Sure, it is useful to know this - but I think that most readers of this book already do.A significant area covered by the book is a very high-level discussion on various methods of valuation - what you should keep in mind right now, how to project future value, etc. I found this pretty interesting, but too high-level - not really exploring any details. Only the last chapter (from Alex Wilmerding of Boston Capital Ventures) features some actual numbers - but, again, with very little detail and no explanation of how many of the numbers are derived.I was hoping to see more information that would be helpful in preparing for an interview at one of the large firms presented in the book. However, I found almost nothing of that sort. A couple brief pieces of advice are scattered throughout the book. Here's one from Eduardo G. Mestre of Salomon Smith Barney (and later repeated by Patrick Ennis of ARCH Venture Partners) that has some use: \\"A stint at a real job in some nice, big industrial enterprise would also probably be helpful, especially if you intend to become a so-called industry specialist. Believe it or not, it actually helps to have at least a notional understanding of the business you are trying to finance, buy, sell, or restructure\\" (49-50).In conclusion, the book provides very basic advice that you, as the reader, will most likely already know - either from common sense or from other extremely basic knowledge of the banking/finance world. However, the book is very short and might be worth reading just for the few useful pieces of advice scattered throughout. Plus, perhaps you can quote these guys to impress your interviewers.Pros:+ short, quick read+ a few useful tidbits of advice scattered throughoutCons:- short, simply not enough discussion of details- a lot of repetition- most of the advice is very basic - stuff you probably already know"},{"Title":"Boy Next Door Signed","review":"That review-title sounds weird, I know, but I've liked Betty Cavanna's/Elizabeth Headley's(sp?) young-adult romance-novels before, and so I'm pretty sure I'll like this one, too. :)It arrived in the mail sooner than the delivery-deadline (always good:) and as soon as I finish reading a coupl'a other books I've already started, I'm going to probably dive into this one.:)Her novels helped me thru a very unhappy time in my life, years ago; they cheered me a good bit, and I thought her writing believable, refreshing, and good."},{"Title":"Boy Next Door Signed","review":"Cavanna is certainly a very detailed and careful writer.

Most of these are given their own spread, with a few hundred words about each, several sample covers and several sample interior spreads. As with most books of this kind, art and design titles tend to dominate, along with lifestyle, and culture, although other categories include news and business, as well as science and technology. Most of the titles are from the U.S., with the typical smattering of European titles (is there any book on magazines that doesn't include Bennetton's \\"Colors\\"?), an Asian title and a few Brazilians. The text is good when it isn't marred by the numerous typos and occasional references to design features that aren't apparent in the sample images. In fact, a recurring problem with the book is the size of the sample images. Many are too small to adequately present the design solutions, and the book would have been better served by fewer, but larger, reproductions. Overall, a useful survey, but some ten years on, a but dated."},{"Title":"Magazines: Inside & Out","review":"This introductory survey at magazine editorial direction and design layout is divided into five sections to give a brief discussion on magazines in various categories: Art, architecture and design; news and business; lifestyle; science and technology; and culture.

Though some points are insightful, further elaborations are lacking."},{"Title":"World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia (Military History of the United States)","review":"The massive two-volume work will most likely be found only in University and large metropolitan libraries. An occasional military history nut like myself will shell out the better part of $200 for this comprehensive and well-organized reference work.Does it replace single volume, cheaper and handier encyclopedia? I have not seen any notable gaps in coverage when randomly searching for some relatively obscure events, items or person be they Rumanian military commanders, Baltic seacoast skirmishes or Polish tankettes. However, as the title notes, this work is devoted to the European Theater(which includes much of the African and Middle Eastern theaters as well). As such, it is exhaustive.It is organized into sections dealing with &quot;Social and Political Events&quot;, &quot;Leaders&quot;, &quot;Units and Organizations&quot;, &quot;Weapons&quot;, &quot;Strategy, Tactics and Operational concepts (including doctrine)&quot;, and finally &quot;Battles and Campaigns&quot;. Each article is written by someone who obviously knows his or her material. Suggested reading lists immediately follow each entry, which vary from a paragraph or two to several pages. This aspect is uneven. Some lists suggest outdated and curious wartime items, others include dubious popular accounts or works that mention the subject only incidentally. However, enough substantial and authoritative works are included to provide adequate additional depth for the most part. The general bibliography at the end supplements the mini-list nicely.Appendices handle code names, a chronological table, acronyms, comparative ranks and a general selected bibiliography covering each topical subdivision.There are two indices: military units/warships, and general subjects. The latter is comprehensive and will pinpoint your research requirements.Some may not care for the topical subdivisions;the format doesn't make the book easy to casually leaf through in order to get information on a subject on impulse. The index however, is useful in finding the main entry for the subject you are researching ( in bold) as well as places where to find more incidental references to the topic.The section on Units and Organizations, for example, does not go into operational histories but only the &quot;organizational profiles&quot;. So if you are interested in both the structure/character AND the war record of a certain division or elite formation, you'd have to check out relevant sections in Battles and Campaigns as well as the &quot;Unit&quot; pages. Also, it's not always easy to separate the political from the military-operational aspects of cerain events. However, the index compensates for the unavoidable fragmentation of these discussions, which is really not a drawback for the most part.The section on Weapons and Equipment is not simply an annotated tabular reference such as you find in many of the glossy coffee table &quot;Planes of the Luftwaffe&quot; picture books. The discussions give an excellent feel for the pre-war development of the plane, tank or ship under discussion as well as it's impact on operations and relative performance in the various theaters and campaigns.I like the idea of the special section on Strategy, Tactics and Doctrine. These subjects are not analyzed abstractly, but are related to particular campaigns. Furhter,their wartime evolution is clearly denoted.Thirty-seven strategical/operational maps in the beginning of the Battles and Campaigns segment are detailed enough to follow most of the following discussions.This work, along with the forthcoming Pacific volumes, belongs on any two-foot shelf of essential World War II reading."},{"Title":"World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia (Military History of the United States)","review":"This is the most complete source of information that you can get on WWII in Europe without expanding to 20 volumes.

In true warhammer fashion, the adventurers can get themselves into a deep hole and end up with the performaing the ultimate sacrifice (no fate points here)."},{"Title":"Walker Evans: Polaroids","review":"Superficially, this book of over 120 colour plates of Walker Evans' Polaroids could be categorised as a 'novelty' piece, much like the recent 'Ansel Adams in Color,' (Harry Callaghan, ed). Adams' colour work, however, never represented much more than a curious footnote in the master craftsman's career; Adams' overwhelming importance is in how he brought breathtaking drama to his prints through his use of the zone system, and a refined, exacting, approach to the printing process.Walker Evans, on the other hand, was almost the opposite of Adams in his approach to the finished photograph: His approach centered more on a refinement of composition, and of excising the non-essential and extraneous from his final prints. Yet, along with Adams, he shared a disdain for colour photography -- both found it to be 'garish,' 'vulgar.'However, this work -- which represents the final chapter in Evans' artistic life -- is a radical departure from his stated aversion to colour photography. The story is equally intriguing.As Walker Evans approached 70, divorced and in failing health, it seemed that his creative days were behind him. He had produced some images since the mid 1960s, but it became increasingly difficult for him to have to schlep around his cumbersome view camera and tripod. Quite fortuitously, though, the Polaroid corporation sent Evans its SX-70 auto-focus camera and an unlimited supply of film, hoping that the prestige of Evans' name would have help market its latest camera. Suddenly, Evans found his artistic 'second wind,' and began manically snapping up instant photographs with this simple camera he referred to affectionately as 'the toy.'In the last two and-a-half years of his life, Evans would eventually take more than 2500 pictures with this camera. The photographs contained within are pure Walker Evans: Sometimes simple, sometimes complex, but always perfect compositions, always ruthlessly cropped within the camera. Evans commented about this camera \\"that nobody should touch a Polaroid until he's over sixty.\\" Yet, viewing Evans' prints, which combines a colourful joy de vivre within the context of refined taste, it becomes obvious that anyone aspiring to the title of 'artist' or 'serious photographer' should not be permitted to advance to medium format or large format view cameras until he's mastered the art of composition with this seemingly innocuous 'toy.' Keep in mind that the photographs within are in the shape of a perfect square, a much more difficult canvas on which to let the compositional elements coalesce than the easy rectangle offered by 35mm cameras.Many of the plates in 'Polaroids' were first published in earlier volumes, such as 'Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye' (1993) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 2000 retrospective, which along with this volume, was also edited by Jeff Rosenheim. The only drawback to this book, is that the photographs are printed 1:1 to the actual prints (just 3-1/8\\" sqaure) and are somewhat darker than in the two previous volumes, obscuring some detail. Also, the colours have also faded since the two previous volumes' release, showing just how fragile the Polaroid medium is.Nonetheless, this volume was worth every penny I paid for it: There is such a serendipitous element of wry humour, even whimsy, that is both intimate and charming, and relate to the viewer Evans' essentially benevolent outlook on life, much of which had been brought back by this 'toy.'Many of the photographs are purely abstract, but some are also literal in nature: Breaking down lettering in signage and from traffic markings, Evans attempted to collect a series of all the letters of the alphabet in idealised form. There are also some photos of signs that are witty puns (such as the 'IQ' isolated from a 'LIQUOR' sign) or double-entendre, such as the railway placard 'DO NOT HUMP.'But best of all are his simple compositions of ordinary objects, such as a garden spade, a half-eaten blueberry pie, kitchen utensils, a mailbox, a dress-makers manequin and -- of course -- signs. Evans took deceptively prosaic objects, photographing them in an almost 'objective,' documentary manner, yet endowed them with his intelligent sense of selective observation. In his introduction, Rosenheim noted Evans' 1971 comment in relating Evans' aesthetic method: 'The secret of photography is, the camera takes on the character and the personality of the handler. The mind works on the machine -- through it, rather.'In his adolesence, Walker Evans dreamed of becoming an author, a literary man of letters. He found out, however, early-on that he was better-suited to photography. But in the twilight of his years, he left the world his final chapter in the story of his life, this collection of Polaroids. These delicate, sardonic and bittersweet images more than fulfill his early aspirations, for all their visual prose and poetry."},{"Title":"Walker Evans: Polaroids","review":"This is a near perfect, and very moving book. As the editor says in his introduction, Walker Evans was an ailing, elderly statesman whose best photographs were seemingly behind him when he decided to use a Polaroid SX-70 camera. The results obtained over the year or so that he photographed are startling. Here are examples of &quot;seeing&quot; in their purest form....the small intense prints are fading away as polaroids are apt to do, but they are exquisite and are simply the final amazing burst of creative activity of a master. The presentation here is great....one print per page, actual size and no text.

If you need some guidelines pertaining to the Catholic ways within the Church, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Catholic Etiquette: What You Need to Know about Catholic Rites and Wrongs","review":"I bought this book for help in raising my own children. For this, I found it somewhat limited. There are a handful of useful bits of information to put into practice. But, mostly, in reading it, I was a bit put off by Kay Lynn Isca's strong opinions about proper and improper, opinions that I suspect were formed somewhere in her life and upbringing, but not inside the Church. From my perspective, this book is really an illustration about how the values, opinions, ethical ideas, and etiquette of a specific community in a time and place (oh, probably contemporary Indiana or somthing similar) have influenced a certain kind of mainstream middle class Catholicism. Throughout the book, Ms. Isca distinguishes between what she calls \\"ethnic churches\\" (generally, any Catholic community that doesn't conform to her standards of etiquette) and \\"mainstream churches\\". While in my family we attend a \\"mainstream\\" church (if by mainstream, she means, mass in English, majority of parish members are white, middle to upper class, in a parish located in a predominantly non-Catholic city), my wife and I each come from what Ms. Isca would consider fringe, marginal \\"ethnic churches\\" (her term) and have participated in parishes that are not islands surrounded by a sea of Protestantism, both in the US and abroad. As a result, I found myself over and over reading her descriptions of certain aspects of her experience in American catholicism and saying to myself \\"not so fast. Not necessarily.\\" or \\"Not in my opinion\\" The important thing to keep in mind is that Catholicism is not an American church, but a universal church. From Italy, to Gabon, to Mexico, to Quebec to Australia, one is bound to find variations in what Ms. Isca calls \\"Catholic etiquette.\\" The title of Ms. Isca's book is misleading, in that it suggests that what Ms. Isca describes as \\"right\\" is necessarily a \\"rite.\\" Much of what Ms. Isca considers \\"right\\" catholicism is definitely note a rule of the Church but is rather a reflection of contemporary American social attitudes finding their way into the church itself (for example, her comments on children and the church). (Ms. Isca seems to acknowledge as much when she recognizes that some \\"ethnic churches\\" might tolerate some otherwise unacceptable etiquette, but it is definitely \\"wrong\\" in her Catholic etiquette. My point is that what Ms. Isca's notions of right and wrong in Church are much more a symptom and reflection of what self-identified \\"mainstream\\" Americans think about Catholicism than it is a reflection of what is universally \\"Catholic\\" about Catholic etiquette."},{"Title":"Catholic Etiquette: What You Need to Know about Catholic Rites and Wrongs","review":"I STARTED TO READ THE BOOK WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM, WHICH QUICKLY CAME TO A HALT. THE AUTHOR BREEZED OVER THE REALLY IMPORTANT PARTS OF MASS SUCH AS THE EUCHARIST, COMMUNION, WHAT MASS IS ALL ABOUT AND EXTENDED THE CHAPTERS ON PLANNING WEDDINGS, AND PARTIES FOR WEDDINGS, BAPTISMS, COMMUNION, ETC. THE AUTHOR NEVER GOT INTO WHAT EACH RITE OF PASSAGE IS ALL ABOUT, WHY WE CELEBRATE THE RITE. I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO IN CHURCH, NOT HOW TO PLAN THE PARTY AFTER THE WEDDING OR BAPTISM. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK AND WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK.

The &quot;rules&quot; are still out there, just so many people choose to ignore them or are ignorant.The author presents many of the issues, like &quot;Children at Mass&quot; not with a definitive, &quot;do this&quot;, but more with a &quot;if you feel inclined...&quot;"},{"Title":"Catholic Etiquette: What You Need to Know about Catholic Rites and Wrongs","review":"Book given as a gift.

I would recommend the book for non-Catholics who want to know why Catholics do the things they do, or those who might have occasion to attend a Catholic mass, funeral, baptism, confirmation, or other event, and want to know the proper things to do. It is also useful for recent converts to the Catholic religion because the author answers the questions she had herself. It's a very good book that I believe to be accurate, and is entertaining at the same time."},{"Title":"Catholic Etiquette: What You Need to Know about Catholic Rites and Wrongs","review":"Kay Lynn Isca was raised a Protestant and is well aware that some Catholic practices and customs may be confusing to new Catholics and to some cradle Catholics as well. For Protestants with close Catholic friend's things can be particularly confusing if they are called on to attend Catholic weddings, funerals, or other events that are particular to the Catholic faith. This book is intended to relieve some of the anxieties of the confused and point out what is correct and what is not.Mrs. Isca writes in a very pleasing way and often makes her point with personal experiences. There is no doctrine or dogma here, just simple etiquette for various situations that may be faced both by Catholics and their friends and relatives. We all wonder sometimes whether a gift is appropriate in a certain situation and if so what kind of gift it should be. Most people are also faced with honorariums for weddings and funerals and have no idea how much should be given. During my former life in the funeral industry I was asked many times, \\"How much should we pay the preacher?\\" Those are among the many questions and concerns that the author deals with in this book. I found her chapter on children at Mass to be very informative and would highly recommend that any new parent take the time to read this chapter. Of course I would also recommend this chapter to anybody else who has a tendency to grouch about noisy children in Church.I did find one thing in this book that bothered me and it involves a practice that I and most of the Catholics I know are in the habit of. Mrs. Isca says this practice is wrong and she may well be right but she never explains why it is wrong. It would have helped the author's credibility a great deal had she explained her statement at least a little. This was the only thing in this book that I didn't find to be right on the mark and also very helpful. The author even deals with the proper response for a Catholic caught in several situations that might cause hard feelings if handled incorrectly. For example, if a Catholic attends a dinner party on a Friday during Lent and finds themselves being served a plate of beef should they eat it or leave it and risk offending their non-Catholic host?This book will be helpful to all Catholics who read it but more so for new Catholics. It will be worth it's weight in gold to someone who is planning a mixed wedding or to any non-Catholic who has a close Catholic friend or family member. I know there are going to be times that my Baptist wife may have to rely heavily on this book. There is nothing deep or theological here, just some plain common sense advice on the etiquette of the Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Catholic Etiquette: What You Need to Know about Catholic Rites and Wrongs","review":"When I married my husband (an agnostic) in the Catholic church, he had no idea about what was going on.

I hoped to read through it and pass it on to my convert-niece to help her know what to do in 'Catholic' situations she was not brough up with. But I found things in it that are not helpful, and rather than mark up the book with, 'No - she's wrong' or 'Not everywhere,' in the margins, I just shelved the book.For example, in a Q & A on whether to eat meat one had been served on a Friday in Lent, she says, 'In my opinion, you were correct' to eat the steak. Her 'opinion'? That you should violate the rule of abstinence on Fridays in Lent instead of explaining to your hosts the practice, and witnessing to them that you take your faith seriously? The principle here seems to be, 'rather than make anyone else uncomfortable, you should compromise your Catholicism.' This does not inspire my confidence in the author.Some of the questions - like the one about eating meat on a Friday in Lent - weren't really about etiquette, but practicing the faith. For example, the question about people who were visiting some Protestants and were not allowed the opportunity to go to Mass: what should they do next time? The advice was correct - but it was about commonsense planning to make sure you get to Sunday Mass while on holiday. It has nothing to do with 'etiquette.'If someone comes to this book REALLY baffled about things Catholic, and what to do in various situations, of course it will be a help. For a convert, it is a good place to begin. But it is NOT definitive, it is NOT comprehensive, and it is NOT 100% reliable. I have no doubt that it will NOT become the 'Emily Post' of Catholic etiquette, simply because almost everyone can object to things she has said or find situations that are not covered. For the things that I wanted to know, I would have to look in another book. Fortunately, there are notes at the end of every chapter. But if this is a book called 'Catholic Etiquette,' then it really should cover Catholic etiquette, and not send the reader to other books.The book's a good idea, but the title is misleading and the information is not helpful outside certain narrow parameters within Catholicism. I wonder if it would be more useful if the writer had read a few general books on etiquette (Miss Manners or Emily Post, for example), to know the kinds of things people really want to know when they pick up a book on etiquette.Use it as a beginning text, but take the advice with a grain of salt. I could probably follow much (not all) of this advice if I were home in the western US, but if I followed it where I live now (Poland), I'd stick out like a sore thumb.'Keep your eyes on your hostess' or the most socially experienced person in the group, 'and follow her lead' is the advice my mother gave me. That advice goes for readers of this book, because if you find yourself outside the region or country or ethnic tradition assumed in this book, you may find yourself doing the wrong thing. Watch what others do - especially the ubiquitous elderly Catholic 'church ladies' - and you'll have a good model to follow. (At the very least, if you follow the lead of the elderly 'church ladies,' no one will scowl at you in disapproval. This I learned from attending Mass in many nations: the most exacting are the elderly church ladies. If THEY don't 'tsk-tsk' over your manners, NO ONE will.)"},{"Title":"Catholic Etiquette: What You Need to Know about Catholic Rites and Wrongs","review":"Have you ever been protestant and gone to a catholic church and felt like a fish out of water if so this is the book for you! This books though not very long gives answers to what goes on in a catholic church service so that someone who is not familiar with what is taking place can understand the service!

She reaches into Celtic lore, 9th century chistian belief, shamanic ritual and Germanic myth to create a world where religion and forces of nature are in flux. Part of this is the sacred marriage between the male and female principles (hieros gamos). The various sexual acts in this story illustrate the uses of sex from the sacred to the profane. That's not to say they aren't fun-- because they are. But they are an integral and interesting part of the story.It's not necessary that the reader know a lot about 9th century France, shamanism or pagan myth, but it doesn't hurt."},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"I loved the way I felt as I opened up this book and began to read. The promise of a thumping good read in historical fiction-- my favorite. But as I read on, the story is continuously, unexpectedly , interrupted by odd segments of gratuitous sex that read as if they were inserted to satisfy the romance genre. While I loved the premise of the heroine and hero, their characters did not captivate me. The character development somehow did not have me giving a darn about these people. I'd turn the page and end up somewhere lost in a sudden change of scene. My personal review of three stars was given due to the wonderful historical detail and plot, not to the writing itself. But I would read something of hers again...there's something that smells of promise here. This book just wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped. Perhaps my expectations were too high. But a good read overall, and as I mentioned earlier, excellent historical detail!"},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"I was totally enthralled and engrossed in this novel. The characters are wonderful and the attention to detail and character developement is first rate. I particularly love the humourous touches and more than once I found myself laughing out loud. There really is something for everyone in this novel....lots of violence and bloodshed, lots of romance including sexy scenes, lots of humour and great historical detail. Highly recommended, and i have just started reading the sequel and it promises to be just as good."},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"I listened to the Unabridged Audio version of Devoted, and WOW, all I can say is this novel packs a punch! This is the story of Ellen, a pagan princess and her love for the Archbishop Owen. This novel is set in early Medieval France, a time of mysticism, paganism and Viking raids. I particularly loved the gritty realism of the cities, the manner in which Owen was portrayed, and the inclusion of the pictish 'old people.'I agree with some reviewers that the sex scenes were somewhat gratuitous and numerous. Also, I felt the lead characters were somewhat anachronistic and a little PC. (Nobility schmoozing with the servants, religious tolerance), these elements did not fully detract from the novel.My only dislike? I disliked Ellen's \\"Powers.\\" I thought her 'abilities' were prime examples of deus ex machina, and were used twice to resolve difficult plot points which could've been solved in different manner without the silly mysticism.Overall, though, this book is one of the better historical romance reads I've read in a while. Well worth the effort to pick up in Audio format."},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"Having read Devoted at least twice I have to admit I can't wait to read it again. Alice Borchardt's style is so clean. There are no unneccesary plots and characters, much like her sister Anne Rice.I would also like to comment on the audio version of this book. Michael Page's read is exceptional, from the blustering knights to the soft spoken forest people. Listen to this one. You won't be sorry"},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"I picked the hardcover version of this book up at used book store. I'll be honest, it was the 'Introduction by Anne Rice' printed on the cover that caught my attention.

I found the beginning to be enthralling, but as the story dragged on, I got bored with the common use of language. It felt as if the novel was written so that it could easily be made into a B Hollywood movie.The book was much too predictable. I don't think that I will purchase the sequel, 'Beguiled.' However, I may give the author another chance with her latest novel 'The Silver Wolf.'"},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"This is one of the finest historicals I have ever read. Above all, the characters, the dialogue, and the relationships were believable and fascinating. I have never read a historical novel with such ironic, witty, and subtle dialogue. Most people writing in other periods seem to think this makes the characters lose all ability to speak in subtle ways. Borchardt's dialogue shines. Plus, the relationship between the two main characters is the meeting of two powerful forces, sexy as hell, and not at all sexist. The sequel, which brings in a second relationship of great power, and manages to end in a way that does not mean one force destroys another and yet is satisfying, is even better. And great fight scenes!"},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"When I started this book I was hit by the depth of detail and character development. I thought, This is a keeper!!

Then skipped ahead almost 40 pages to the last scenes!! I missed the end of the main battle and some of the turning point magic!!

And it IS readable, but I was disappointed to discover it was basically just another bodice-ripper. I had hoped to find a book that told a story of this historical era, warts and all. However, in the Borchardt world of the Middle Ages there is excessive rhapsodizing over the ebony hair and ivory skin of the heroine. I was looking for a fine, hearty meal of a book, but this one is more like movie theater popcorn. You enjoy it, but it's not filling, and there's a nagging thought in the back of your mind that it's just empty calories."},{"Title":"Devoted (Topaz historical romances)","review":"I was lucky, I think, to find a seller with this book with Prime Shipping.

Jasher covers Biblical history from the creation down to Jasher's own day and was represented as being the lost Sefer HaYashar mentioned in the Bible. In Alcuinus' purported translation the book the Law was given to Moses on Mount Sinai not by God but by Moses' father-in-law Jethro.If you are a scholar of lost books of the bible and the old testament in particular, you will find this book quite informative and arresting.

However, I was a little disappointed that Meredith didn't get more of a comeuppance. And the character Devin just kind of fizzled away. His character had the potential to become a very dangerous one, one that could have impacted other characters lives more and would have added a little more spice. What would have been a nice twist was to find out that Devin was the one who had fathered the baby! Now that would have been interesting. LOL!

With this book she has proven to me that she is an all-around author and talented storyteller. She's one of the best out there."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I don't usually read fiction by women. This was one heck of a book.

I guess maybe that's why I wasn't as &quot;in to&quot; this novel as I was with the others.Don't get me wrong, it was a good novel, it just wasn't a &quot;Can't put down&quot; type of book. The characters were truly HOLLYWOOD (smile) and I also enjoyed the bit of mystery that Ms. Files added to the story. I kept going back and forth with who Alisha's mother was (especially since everybody seemed to be getting those mysterious hang-ups) - but when I found out - I kinda felt like I was left hanging - I really wanted to see something else happen.Overall, thanks Ms. Files for another novel and please, please bless us with another Reesy and Misty story!!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I'm so glad that we have so much diversity in fiction these days.

Most Hollywood books are too girly, too gaudy, or too heavy on the schmaltz. Lolita packs this joyride with sure-fire fun and devilry from beginning to end, and she manages to be pretty accurate about the way things are. As a person who's deep in the industry, all I can do is bow down to Miss Files for this one. Only an insider, or a damn good spy, could capture it this well."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This book is excellent. Lolita gave us a glimpse into a Hollywood that everyone needs to know about. The subject of the lack of diversity continues to be a thorn in TinselTown's side, and until it's plucked out, it's sure great to know that there are books like this to keep bringing it to the fore. What's most remarkable is that this book is flat-out entertaining---a total page-turner. Lolita Files has cemented her position as my favorite contemporary writer with this one."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Files' new book is a sure thing.

Blind Ambitions is her best yet. It's the best book I've read all year. It kept me completely wrapped up until the very end."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Honestly, this book reads like a made for TV movie. I gave it 3 stars because it's incredibly entertaining. However, The book lacks the kind personable narration that I admired in Ms. Files previous books, 'Scenes...' and '...good part'.While I could imagine most of the characters to some degree, I was having some profound trouble with the main character, Desi, whose personality was complex to the point of schizophrenia. Still, the book was entertaining. If you enjoyed Dynasty, Dallas or even Twin Peeks, this book might be the one for you.It takes a thorough look at the relationships and dynamics of the African American Entertainment Community in Hollywood. As well as some of the self described 'do's and don'ts' of the industry.the book seemed extremely rushed, also unlike her past works, and the ending does not seem to resolve much for the reader. It was closure without a clue. It would be great if there were a sequel that could further explain the exploits of the first book.Also recommend: Men cry in the Dark, Just as I am, Single Mom, Something's wrong with your scale!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I loved Blind Ambitions.

I ended up staying at the office later than I planned. The book was that good. I took the book home with me and read it that night after dinner. Even my wife was shocked. I don't read fiction. I was reading parts to my wife out loud, and she wanted to know if she could have the book next. That was out of the question because my receptionist didn't know I had her copy to begin with. I finished the book that night. Lolita Files is an excellent writer. This book gets the highest praise from me. The state of affairs for African-Americans in Hollywood is pretty messy, but this book gives me hope. I slid the book back on my receptionist's desk before she came in. Today I not only bought my wife a copy of Blind Ambitions, but I bought her everything Lolita Files had ever written."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I have to admit that I had not heard of Lolita Files before.

I just came back from the bookstore. I went out and bought Lolita's other two books. That's when I realized that I had seen 'Scenes From A Sistah' and 'Getting To The Good Part' before.

Sprinkled liberally throughout with the trials and tribulations of backstabbing co-workers, dishonest showbiz types, afrocentric power players, fast women and faster men, &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; is good entertainment.

I felt that the story was very timely, given the boycotts and disscussions regarding people of color in the entertainment industry.

I loved Scenes from A Sistah and Getting to the Ggood Part but it seems as if this book was hastily written. Whereas I felt that I knew Misty and Reesy, the characters in Blind Ambitions had little to no depth and it seemed as if whole parts of the story were missing. The ending of this book was a letdown also. Maybe I expected too much from Ms. Files but I was sorely disappointed by this novel."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This book was clearly lacking! Where is the plot? Where is the character development? Where is the intrugue? Where is the unexpected twist? Why was everything so predictable? As another reviewer said, what has been written is just an outline for a novel. A very good book could have been delivered, but what we got was air.I was relieved that Ms. Files wrote this book without the rawness of her first two novels. For that she gets the two stars. However, she needs to refine her writing skills to produce good, solid, memorable storylines and characters. &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; missed the mark.Ms. Files has the potential to transition to a good novelst. She is not there yet. The standards for African-American authors is being raised higher and higher everyday as new writers enter the playing field. I trust that Ms. Files learns from this book and moves forward."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I liked this story, but it didn't really live up to the promise of the prologue. I would have liked to see a little more character development; I didn't feel like I knew them that well. With so many major characters, this book could have been a lot longer. Maybe the author was going for the breezy summer read; I don't know.One thing I absolutely loved was the surprise about the identity of the girl in the prologue! I did not see that coming, and I'm usually good at predictions."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This book was a well written outline. It had very little substance to it. I did not feel anything for the characters. I don't understand what others thought was so great it. The book started off great but went down hill from there.

Yet that is all there is - potential. It does not deliver."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Although it wasn't a bad story line. This book proved to be a little to Hollywood for my taste.

Attention everybody: Lolita Files is The Next Big Thing. For those of you who don't know, you'd better wake up. This is commercial fiction, and it's damned good. But I get the feeling that there's even more to Lolita than what's in the pages of the three books she's written. You can tell from her use of the language and phraseology that she's on a higher plane. Her writing is a refreshing change from all those books being published by people who can barely complete a sentence, let alone hold the attention of a reader."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I bought this book last week and thought it was banging. I read it at work, during breaks in the car, and just before bed. The writing kept me hooked all the way through. I just saw Lolita Files at a booksigning. That in and of itself was phenomenal. She is not just an excellent writer. She is personable, entertaining, accessible, and seemed very friendly. The crowd loved her. She is also gorgeous, which has nothing to do with anything in terms of writing, but makes her even more fascinating in a layered way. She looks like a star but feels like a friend. The bookstore owner said that Miss Files is one of the most popular authors out there because of how she writes and how she is as a person. I'm already sold. I'm a Lolita Files fan fa life. P.S. Miss Files, are you single? Probably not. You're probably beating them back with a stick.

He had me thinking he was just another one of Bettina's good time guys ! I think he thought he was actually in love with her !

We get to follow Desi, Bettina, and Sharon,stuggling AA females in a city and working in an industry that does not encourage them to succeed, for 5 days. That's right 5 days. You know how you have those weeks when it seems a lot longer, these 5 days seems that way. Desi is a struggling actress and has to make some major decisions about her career. Sharon is a struggling producer who needs to make some decisons about her personal life and Bettina finds that her way of attaining success is not working and makes some changes in her life. There are ups and downs.While probably not the author's intent to make her a main character I have to mention Meredith. Her antics and storyline are very strong for a secondary character. Is she the villian or a victim?You will enjoy reading this well written book sneaking a peek at the rich and famous."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This is the first book that I read by Ms Files and I received this one for my bookclub to review last week in the mail. It started off kind of slow but once the story line got going I became more and more interested in what was going to happen next. I love the characters. This book is a great pick up.. I do have the other 2 books at home so I will have to add Ms Files as one of my authors to keep up with."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Lolita Files' Blind Ambitions is her best effort yet. Kudos to Ms. Files whose writing style keeps getting better and better with each new release. Just as in her first two novels, she delivers the goods! I won't give away the plot, but suffice it to say that you'll be left turning these pages in breathless anticipation. Much love to Ms. Files for turning out another superb novel!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I can't believe I am just coming across this author's work. I read this book in one day. I loved the cover and the synopsis on the jacket was interesting enough. Once I got inside the pages, I was a goner. I went back and got Lolita's other two books. Color me hooked."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Lolita File's Blind Ambitions is a fast-paced, quick read. I started this book and didn't think about doing anything else until after I read the last page. What a whirlwind week in the life of Hollywood heroines! From the prologue, I was hooked and glued to the pages trying to figure out \\"whose child is it\\". File takes us into and behind the scenes of Hollywood with AA movers &amp; shakers. The reader is right there experiencing the dreams, disappointments, and secrets of Desi, Bettina, and Sharon. But let's not forget about secondary characters Meredith and Devin who added much spice and drama to the storyline. The storyline has a little bit of everything for every body-love, lust, power, politics, money, backstabbers, manipulators &amp; schemers-and you will turn the pages quickly to see what's going to happen next. Blind Ambition is my favorite book by Ms. Files; her writing does continue to get better &amp; better. However, I have to admit that I too was slightly disappointed in the ending(everything was a little too neatly wrapped up) and I was big-time let down/disappointed/upset when I discovered the identity of the anonymous character in the prologue. I figured out the identity about half way through the book and I was so disappointed that it was that particular character! When you read the book you will understand why. That said I still recommend Blind Ambition for an entertaining afternoon read. Blind Ambitions is well-written with a plausible storyline, good character development, vivid imagery, and off the hook plot twist and turns that will catapult you right over the edge and have you laughing out loud and talking to the characters. Check out this provocative, entertaining, page-turner today!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Mixing a little mystery and drama, Blind Ambitions is a peek into the struggles, ambitions, lessons, and lives of Desi, Bettina, Sharon, Steve, &amp; Randall. They are all in Hollywood trying to make it..one way or the other. Their dilemmas are spicy, the solutions are steamy, and the overall outcome is...well, you'll just have to read the book to find out!What I like most about Blind Ambitions is the colorful ensemble of characters. Lolita has a gift for creating spicy and unique characters that arouse our curiosity, tickle our funny bone, and lure us into their lives and battles.Blind Ambitions has something that interests everyone. This clever novel shows that Lolita is a versatile author, whose writing spans multiple arenas. Lolita still maintains her 'in your face', 'tell it like it is' voice, but she just adds a different flavor to it.Blind Ambitions is a fun and entertaining read with vivid situations, sassy language, colorful characters, and a stellar storyline."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"i must give lolita files all the respect she deserves for this wonderfully crafted novel. i must say, this is my first novel by lolita files, and i can guarantee you that it most definitely won't be the last book i read by her...not by a long shot.i tell ya, in between the hilarious, and some what controversial plot line, i became a fan of lolita files...this is more like an omar tyree type flyy girl all grown up (better than the current sequel of course) with a waiting to exhale type of twist. believe me when i tell you to pick this bad boy up...you WILL NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I became a fan of Lolita Files' after I read &quot;Scenes from a Sister&quot; and &quot;Getting to the Good Part&quot;. I became hooked on her realistic characters and fast paced writing style. With &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot;, I did not know anything about the book, before I brought it, with Ms. Files, I did not need to know, I trust that she will keep me entertained and she did not DISAPPOINT. I felt that the story was very timely, given the boycotts and disscussions regarding people of color in the entertainment industry. I felt for these charaters, I laughed with them, cried with them and cheered for them. I will tell anyone who will listen (and those that won't) to get this book. You go Girl!,when is the next book coming out, I can't wait."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This is a fast paced, fun novel to read. Ms. Files does a good job of describing the entertainment business from the point of view of an insider. She also is very skillful in describing the pitfalls and disappointments felt by many in the business. She has developed sympathetic female protagonists who are realistic, talented and vulnerable in a hardened world of the unprepared. And, she goes one step further in what I consider a female novel (in that I think more women would read this than men) by developing believable, understanding male characters. Weaving the story together between the women and the men while still following each main character through her particular development was smooth and well crafted.Ms Files writes exciting and graphic sex scenes that make the page steam with passion, which is a difficult thing to do with many authors. She doesn't dip into pornography like many writers feel the need to do when describing realistic sex. Her characters evolve and transform according to the events that happen to them, which makes them very believable. The book was an enjoyable read. It seemed the author often used too many adjectives to describe a detail when one creative word might have been better. I would give this book 3 and stars.Reviewed by Kathleen Sinclair"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I could not put this book down!!!!!! I thought this was going to be similar to Scenes and Getting to the Good Part... boy was I wrong. Ms. Files has outdone herself with Blind Ambitions. I suggest everyone run out and purchase this book. Lolita, you are very talented and I hope to be able to meet you in person one day to let you know just how much pleasure I get from reading your books. They always take me on a different adventure."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Blind Ambitions is about several people trying to make it big in the world of entertainment for writers, actors and execs. The book reminded me of a &quot;Dancing In September&quot; (feature film by Reggie Rock Blythewood) in how television shows are made and the struggles of all involved.Lolita Files is a fantastic writer and I enjoy her use of prose and her lyrical writing style.I gave a lukewarm rating because I thought the story line was extremely simplistic. I like a lot more meat and thought provoking material as in her book Child of God. While I thought the story was complete and vivid I found most of the character's actions and behavior to be predictable. Everything worked out for everyone in the end and that was cute. But I was disappointed that the novel's description on the back cover was misleading and somewhat unfulfilled.I however, would recommend this along with all of Ms. Files' other novels as well."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I made the mistake of reading &quot;Child of God&quot; first which was totally off the hook. I then read Files' other three books in publication order. In all fairness to Files, I used &quot;Child of God&quot; as the standard, and though &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; was entertaining it does not even compare. The plot and character development was very thin and amateurish. Files' attempt at a twist (with the prologues and midlouges) was confusing at best."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I have nothing but love for Lolita Files. &quot;Scenes From a Sista&quot; and &quot;Getting to the Good Part&quot; had me laughing out loud. I loved both and highly recommend them. Blind Ambitions was a good read but it wasn't the normal stuff I'm used to from this talented author. Blind Ambitions gives us a look into the lives of Steve, Randall, Desi, Bettina and Sharon. All looking to rise up in Hollywood. Hold on tight because this one is a sure roller coster ride. Lolita, keep up the good work. Be Blessed."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I really enjoyed this change of pace novel from Ms. Files. This was an awesome book. The story of three ladies all trying to get ahead in the show business world. We get to meet Desi, who is an actress trying to make it, while at the same time trying to decide if she needs a career change. Her best friend Sharon, who is trying to get ahead as a producer and then Bettina, who dates alot of married men and is trying to get into tv. writing. The story goes along and takes us through their trials and tribulations. This book kind of reminded me of a Jackie Collins novel(without all of the trashiness--Thank God). Success and blessings to Ms. Files. I am definitely waiting for the next one. Peace!!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I really enjoyed this book and if you've read her other books, you'll also enjoy it. The characters are good and bad, funny, deceiptful, sleezey, desperate and power-hungry. The story line was great and it gave the book great potential. The reason I only gave this four stars however, is because the ending was anti-climatic and rushed. The next thing you know, is that two years have gone by and you only get to hear about what has happened and not see how it actually happened. Other than that, go and buy this. Now."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Lolita Files is one of my favorite female authors, so I was very anxious and excited about Blind Ambitions. I was disappointed however while reading the book. This book started off very slow, and did not pick up until the very end. Another is the relationships between the characters weren't developed very well. I love Lolita, and I'll buy anything she writes. Hopefully her next book is better than this one!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I picked this book up at about 8am in the morning and when I put it down at about 4pm the same day - I was done! It's a quick and interesting novel.I admit that I was a bit skeptical about this book when I originally purchased it. Reesy and Misty from Lolita Files' first 2 novels were two of my all-time favorite characters. I really thought that breaking away from them was a huge mistake - but the mistake was all MINE!The new characters are PHENOMENAL! I found a little bit of me in each of the characters (even Steve and Randall), which made this novel even better.This book centers around Desi, a kind of &quot;has-been&quot; actress looking for that one role that will put her back on top; Sharon, a ghetto-fabulous ........ producer; Bettina, a woman who tried to sleep her way to the top - but only made it to the phone operator level; and Randall and Steve, two Emmy Award winning writers who are itching to branch out on their own. These 5 are intermingled with some other strange characters, including the &quot;Diabolical Miss M,&quot; Devin, Jackson, Jet and Glen. When you mix 'em all in a pot - you come up with an extremely entertaining story!Even if you have never read Lolita Files before - I strongly recommend picking this book up. You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This is my third Lolita Files book. I've been with her since the first one, Scenes from a Sistah, and she is so entertaining. I was completely entangled in the lives of these characters. I didn't know how situations would work out until the very end, which I loved. I stayed up all night reading. Lolita sure knows how to reel a reader in!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Dang. This was like a rollercoaster ride. It was so much fun it made me dizzy. If this is what Hollywood is like, I'm almost grateful for my normal 9-to-5. Makes me glad I never wanted to be a star. Keep up the great work Lolita. This book was the real deal."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This book was outstanding. As a person who has been trying to break into the industry for the past six years, this book was like a tutorial/bible. I've been recommending it to everybody."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Great book. Very timely. This author is one of my top two favorite writers."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Ha! That reader who gave Lolita Files that low rating is plum crazy! Not only is this book slamming, Lolita is one of the friendliest authors out there. I've met her and she was real friendly to me. I go to booksignings all the time, and almost every author on the block mentions her name and says how friendly and supportive she is. But that shouldn't even come in the picture. It's all about the books. Lolita, girl, you can write! Keep those books coming. You've got a fan forever in me."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I cannot believe the person who reviewed &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; and said they met Miss Files and thought she was snooty. I've met and talked with Miss Files on three different occasions, each time with each of her books. I saw her in Chicago at the Delta Convention in July. I saw her two years ago at the Delta Convention here in New Orleans, and I just saw her here again a week ago when she was with another author who I think is a Delta (Miss Files is an AKA) and they were talking to everybody who passed by. She was very friendly and willing to chat with readers about her characters and her books. I've even e-mailed her a few times back and forth and she's been nice enough to give me advice about writing and suggest books for me to read. I can't believe how some people miss the point. We don't own authors. They are people, too. I loved &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; as well as Miss Files's first two books. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Blind Ambitions was an entertaining read. It was a book I couldn't put down and when I did it was not for too long. Because I wanted to know, if Desi would finally become a star. Would Sharon and Glen realize what they both had. Would Bettina maintain her celibacy and of course would Meredith get hers.Lo, I loved the writing style! The depth of your talent shows with each book. The new characters were great and well developed. You did your work with Blind Ambitions, now go buy some shoes."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I LOVE the other two books from Lolita but I thought this one was way to intense when it came to show business terminology. When I read fiction, I am looking for a good story and SOME detail but not a term paper on a particular subject, which is what I felt this was... I think fiction should be enjoyable and full surprises and suspense not an in depth study of any type of information...."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Ok. I have to start off first, saying how I enjoyed Lolita Files' last two books &quot;Scenes From A Sista&quot; and &quot;Getting To The Good Part&quot;, but I missed it somewhere with &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot;. I found it very choppy and hard to read. I couldn't follow the characters lives and how they all came together. I would have liked to see Bettina developed alittle more. She seemed very interesting and like she was really getting it together but - BOOM, the ball just dropped with her and NEXT.I also felt it was VERY HOLLYWOOD. Lolita, I am still a fan and would buy another of your novels, just cause your name is penned on it, but I wasn't feelin' Blind Ambitions at all.Peace!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Ms. Files has done a great job in this book. I've read all of her previous novels and it seems as though she keeps getting better. The characters in this book were both real and intimate. And it really gives you a look into Hollywood. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I am a fan of Ms. Files. I still talk about her last two books and it's been a long time since I've read them. The reasons I liked those books so much was because she made the characters come alive with the depth she gave them. In Blind Ambitions, the characters do not have that same depth, but the book is as entertaining as ever. It is a very quick read. If you're looking to take a break from ANYTHING, pick up this book for a short-lived refreshing get-a-away. With that attitude you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I must say that Lolita did not let me down, it was some good reading. I wouldn't give it five star's because I was really let down in the end. I was all hyped up, just to be kind of let down. With her I am used an ending that just keeps you wanting more, and I don't. There was a lot of show biz terms thrown around and a lot of material things mentioned, but hey thats showbiz. It is a book of Love, Power, Politic's and Money. There are sad parts and parts where you will be rolling on the floor. I believe everyone will enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I stayed up all night to finish this book because I could not put it down! I have been a Loilta Files fan since the beginning and she did not disappoint with her latest offering. The inside peek into Hollywood is a unique backdrop for a new set of &quot;sistahs&quot; trying to do their thing. I hesitated for a 5-star only because the novel rose to a feverish pitch and then Ms. Files wrapped up everything quickly and neatly, but I still felt like there was some loose ends. Still, a great read!!!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Lolita Files is a true talent in very sense of the word. One of the things I really love about her work is that her characters are realistic. She has this great ability to make you care about characters that (like all of us) are flawed. She avoids the pitfall of painting people as good, bad, evil or indifferent. Instead she shows us their human failings and dares us not to understand and love them anyway.I had a difficult time putting this book down (it was 1:00am and I had to go to work the next day). I'm on page 240 and there are about five or six unresloved storylines,and I check there are only 283 pages in the book. I'm thinking there is no way she can tie this up in only 43 pages. By now I think I know where everything is headed and I'm really dreading some of the things that are going to happen to some of the characters.But Ms. Files reminds me that I am the reader and she is master of this storyline, and she ends this one beautifully and unexpectedly.One small complaint, why so short?..Is there a rumor out there that readers don't like long books? Not True."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"&quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; gives a thorough, believable account of what Hollywood is like from not only the actor's viewpoint, but the writers', producers', and developers' as well. Most books about Hollywood focus on the troubles of actors, but Lolita Files makes the case that the people behind the scenes have an equally hard time as well.Primarily narrated by African-American characters, &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; details the struggles of three African-American women, an actress, a producer, and a secretary who wants to be a producer, trying to succeed in Hollywood, where the power structure is dominated by White people. Files gives vivid accounts of how a television series is developed, along with all of the manipulations, lies, and power plays involved. This is where &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; succeeds, making it a must-read for anyone wanting to work in the entertainment industry.Files is less successful at creating a plot, which includes a laughable mystery that has nothing to do with the main action in the book, and feels tacked on. Also, some of the characters motivations are inexplicable, and no follow up explanation is ever provided. For instance, Randall pursues Desi quite eagerly, nearly to the point of begging, to play the main character in his new television series, even though Desi is a washed up actress. Although it is hinted that Randall has more than a professional interest in Desi, it is never made apparent to the reader, and nothing ever comes of it. There are several other similar loose ends in the book that makes it less than satisfying as a complete story. However, the book's main draw is the insight it gives into the machinations of Hollywood, something you don't read about in People magazine or see on Entertainment Tonight. It is for this reason that &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Blind Ambition is about three women trying to make it in the entertainment business. Desi as an up and coming actress once her chance at a big role instead of low budget films, and commericals, Bettina once would have did anything to make it as a writer for tv shows. Sharon is trying to handle a much younger man, plus bigger as a producer in the entertainment world. I throught the book was good in that it didn't focus so much in the entertainment, the characthers had regular lives most of the book."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"It would be appropriate to simply state &quot;move on, there's nothing to see here,&quot; however I will not heed my own advice. There is little to distinguish this offering from anything currently out there from Tyree, Harris, Dickey, George, Williams and I hazard to assume a host of others I have not encountered. Frankly, BLIND AMBITIONS could have comfortably fit as the much anticipated sequel to Tyree's FLYY GIRL, in fact, it should have but that's another review.I'm not presumptuous enough to expect each developing writer to explore brand new territory but I do expect them to at least plant independent footsteps in the terrain.I rate it two stars as it is not unreadable, it simply fails to present characters or ideas that can be delineated from the voluminous works of her contemporaries."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"In a world where authors tend to churn out the same stories over and over again I take my hat of to you Ms. Lolita for taking your writing to another level. You have out done even you with this one and thats saying a lot.The story is as beautiful as a sunset, thought provoking as a sunrise and as hot as the hinges of hell.Continue blazing trails and we will all trail the blaze."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This book is very slow. I was not able to complete it. It describes everything with too much detail. I was half way through the book and I had not reached a climax, or it got lost in all of the description. The characters were not interesting, I just did not like this book.--"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"It amazed me that there could be so much going on in a four day period. However, Ms. Files was able to do it and do it well. I enjoyed this book tremendously. I read this book during every break I had. I was well pleased with the outcome. I am definitely a fan and recommend all of her books. You will be thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I've read the reviews and I'm trying to understand something -- what am I missing? Am I expecting too much? I love my authors and will continue to support -- but at what price? Like most people who've read the book, it IS a quick read -- I finished it in two days. Actually this is the 1st book by Ms. Files that I've been able to finish. Would I recommend purchasing the hardback? No. I would encourage people to either check it out of the Library or wait for the paperback version.Without giving away the story for those who haven't read it yet -- I didn't know what to think after I was finished. There were things that she dropped without explanation. Too many open issues. The ending was forced and hurried up. I was just plain confused about the book in the end.Can someone help me understand?"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"With the previous novels written by Lolita Files, Scenes From A Sistah and Getting To The Good Part I was unable to read past the first two chapters of either book. I found them dull and lacking substance. However, I decided to give Ms. Files one more chance to redeem herself in my eyes and I'm happy to say she did so with flying colors!While Blind Ambitions was entertaining enough to keep me turning pages to get to the ending. I found that there was a lot more that could have been done to make her characters and plot a little more interesting. The character Randall was not fleshed out as completely as I think he should have been and then when they were thrown together at the end it was typical because it lacked any anticipation from the reader. There are several other points in the book where characters could have been more well defined but I did not write this review to completely bash this book. Instead I wanted to say that I am pleasantly surprised that with this book Ms. Files has regained some of my respect for her as a writer. At this stage I'm figuring she should only get better, or at least I hope that's the case."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"We found this book to be a very quick read. The novel reminded us of the Jackie Collins' books about the shallowness of Hollywood life. One of the main strengths of this novel is that the story kept you guessing until the very end. Some of us liked the midilogues and some of us didn't because we found them confusing. Since this book reminded us of the Hollywood novels by Collins, it is fair to say the story was shallow and offered little redeeming qualities. The characters were not well developed and some of us found the story seemed rushed at the end. However, the author does provide a strong message: Ambition is key to anything you want to accomplish.Although, this was not our favorite File's story it provided something quick to read and gave us an opportunity to escape for a little while from our everyday lives. The book club looks forward to our second novel on our syllabus this year by Files."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Blind Ambition is about three women trying to make it in the entertainment business.

I throught the book was good in that it didn't focus so much in the entertainment, the characthers had regular lives most of the book."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I am amazed at how Lolita Files puts a story together and how she makes her characters so believable. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next one and the next one and the next one."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"If you're a fan of Lolita Files based on the first two novels she wrote, then don't attempt to read this one.I was very disappointed. This book,in no way, compares to Scenes From a Sistah and Getting to the Good Part.The book lacks excitement and the &quot;sistah&quot; type flavor the previous two books seem to explode with.My reading partner and I ran to the bookstore to purchase the book and we were both disappointed in this book.Lolita, if you read this,&quot;PLEASE REVIVE THE SISTAH TYPE WRITING&quot;. This book was a difficult read because it was so boring and way too slow for me.If you're a fan-&quot;save your money and wait for Ms. Files to write a new one 'cause this one isn't worth your time or your money&quot;."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"The book started off slow. Once it picks up, I find out that the main part of the story has nothing to do with the 3 main characters. All of the action basically happens in the last two or three chapters. I know that her work is usually EXCELLENT. I read her other two books and loved them. I will buy her next book, but I hope that I can give it a higher rating."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Ms. Files is certainly a good storyteller. &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; was well written and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel to its conclusion. I never figured out who the character mentioned in the prologue was which kind of surprised me since I had already pointed the finger at one of the other characters. This novel took me by surprise as I thought Ms. Files would have followed along paths as her previous two novels, &quot;Scenes from a Sister&quot; and &quot;Getting to the Good Part&quot; which both very good stories and I sometimes reread my favorite parts over and over again. Obviously, Ms. Files doesn't fall into just one category, she's very versatile and not to be typecasted. If you haven't read Ms. Files' material yet, check them out -- you'll be in for a treat."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I had never read any of Ms. Files books and she beyond held my interest. I read about 1-2 novels a week so I am hard to please when it comes to writing. I finished reading it in less than 24 hours while working a full time job. After I finished reading Blind Ambitions, I immediately called the bookstore to see if they had copies of her other books in stock."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I tracked this book until I finally got a copy, having read all of Ms. Files previous books. Can this get any better - or what? I read the book while flying to Jamaica to begin a wonderful vacation. The characters were real and I really enjoyed this book - the best so far. Can't wait for the others. Absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I thought she could do no better then I pick up Blind Ambitions; this is the best book yet. I was hooked from the very beginning and could not put the book down. All the characters were real and exciting. This author has been one of my favorites and she still stands in the top 5."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Ms. Files has excellently penned a story that the readers invade the lives of people struggling to get discovered in the world of Hollywood. She has nicely woven suspense, drama (and humor), as well as intensity in her story. This is just \\"another\\" one of her novels declaring her talent as an author.... go, Ms. Files...you bad, gurl!!!"},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"This book had its slow parts but for the most part, I would say that it was a good read.This scandal keep me turning the pages wonder what would happen next.Lolita Files is a great author with excellent writing abilities."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"A disappointing waste of cash in my opinion. I really enjoyed the writer's first two novels and I had high expectations of this one. The opening scene was interesting but after that the book lost momentum and became a jumbled mess of uninteresting characters who seemed contrived and unreal. I could not relate to any of the characters and found them uninteresting and unengaging. I couldn't even be bothered to read the last few pages."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"As the first book I've read by Lolita Files, Blind Ambition really put me there, on the Hollywood scene, with the stories of Sharon, Bettina, Steve and Randall. With the twist of mystery added to the story, it really keep me up all night trying to finish and find out what was what! It was so good that I'm waiting to hear about a sequel, made-for-TV series or movie about the characters from the book."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"I love the way Lolita Files writes her novels. I really enjoyed the first two and recommended them to everyone. I just knew this one would not let me down. From the begining to end I just fell in love with all the characters, Sharon was my favorite though. My only problem was that it was so short, but unlike some other authors she closed off the book very well, you got to see what happened to all the characters and was not left hanging. If you want a really good and quick read, pick this up."},{"Title":"Blind Ambitions","review":"Lolita has done it again. Blind Ambitions is so juicy that you can't stop turning the pages. The story line isn't as deep as her previous books, but there are some sharp corners! I liked the entrapment in the book and it was a little suspenseful. Desi and Sharon seemed to have one of those genuine friendships that many women would like to have and that was nice to see. I was glad Meredith got what she deserved in the end. God definitely does not like Ugly! The characters were well rounded and kind of easy to predict, but they all added to the plot. Lolita if you keep dishin' em out, I'll keep reading. You have a definite fan."},{"Title":"Cool School (Road to Writing)","review":"I purchased this book hoping to entice my 6 year old reluctant reader/writer. It was one of the best book purchases I've ever made. The helpful prompts give the kids just enough information to truly spark their imagination, while the combination of both writing and drawing keep them interested and focused. I've taken this book on car trips, to the doctor's office, and to church. My once reluctant reader/writer begged me to buy her more of the books in the series and is reluctant no more!"},{"Title":"Custer's Chief of Scouts: The Reminiscences of Charles A. Varnum","review":"Varnum's firsthand accounts are at once interesting and revealing. He tells his tale twice. First, he tells it as Reminiscences. Then we read much of it again as his Testimony at the Reno Court of Inquiry. In either telling, we see much that is now accepted by recent writers. I also sensed there was a great deal he was holding back that lend credence to the Carter allegations of the officers banding together for the honor of the regiment and in deference to Mrs. Custer. In testimony, he was often evasive.For me the most revealing statement was toward the end, when Varnum states that Reno sent a messenger to Gen Terry on the 26th. On the morning after the Custer battle Reno is asking for help from Terry!If Reno believed Custer was still alive, then wouldn't he have sent the request to Custer, his commanding officer, who they claimed to believe, must have to join up with Terry? This may have been the first crack in the cover up shell. Panzeri, LBH 1876, states that Edgerly admitted years later that they could see the bodies of Custer's men from Weir's Point."},{"Title":"Custer's Chief of Scouts: The Reminiscences of Charles A. Varnum","review":"Charles A. Varnum was known never to speak of himself, or of Custer, or of his days with the 7th at the Little Big Horn. So you have to wonder why this book from Nebraska Bison Books (I have the 1987 first printing, paperback) After all these years I've finally gotten around to looking at it closely. There are a couple things of which a prospective reader should be advised:The first portion of the book which falls into an autobiography of sorts, after 96 pages just stops cold, in mid sentence, never to be completed. This is a very incomplete autobiography stopping with the battle at the Little Big Horn. In fact the writing just stops in mid sentence.Stranger still, the testimony of the Reno court of inquiry (1879) in section two is comprised by guesses, uncertainties, & \\"I don't knows\\", etc. Almost as if Varnum had not been there at the battle with Custer in charge of Arikara scouts.... rather strange. One thing becomes clear: Varnum was not liked by Reno and Varnum did not like Reno. Too, Libby Custer at this time is still alive and the memories are still fresh. Whether you like Reno or not, Reno is under attack. Also, Varnum was a professional 7th Calvary man and he and his brother officers are not about to \\"air\\" dirty linen in public view.Both Luther Hare and Charles Varnum \\"ignored the historic events of the frontier\\" and \\"both testified at the Reno Court of Inquiry\\". And that is about all with certainty one can say at this late date, other than Charles Varnum lived until 86 years of age. Presented the Medal of Honor for heroism in battle at Wounded Knee, Pine Ridge, 1891.Unless you are a true Custer fan, you might just want to pass this one up."},{"Title":"Custer's Chief of Scouts: The Reminiscences of Charles A.

(...)I recommend this book to everyone, not just devout fans- it's a must-have!!"},{"Title":"The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook","review":"This very detailed and descriptive analysis of Barbra Streisand's career by Alison J. Waldman. She examines almost every detail and aspect of Barbra's very large and extensive career. The part I enjoyed most was the music section where she describes the preparation of and commercial action of each of Barbra's CDs. It is nice to see how stars choose what songs and how all the songs work together. No less fascinating is the Movie section which is very comprehensive. Waldman even crafts a Scale rating the movies' many factors such as Longtime Durability and Success. For the private life, there is some spilling of the beans here and for projects Barbra could have participated in, one can imagine. The book also has a section that chronicles the top rumors of Streisand that are either proven or disproven. One can tell that the author is a fan of Streiand as she details many elements in a style and manner that is highly uncontestable among other biographers of not only Streisand but others as well.

All of Streisand's albums are included here....in a table format and in narrative, describing the recording and release and success of each one in remarkable detail. Even more wonderful is the chapter devoted to Streisand's movies....very detailed and filled with wonderful anecdotes and reviews of each movie. This book is FABULOUS!!!Overall this book is one that I truly loved and will always cherish as a wonderful chronicle of Streisand's career, one that I have followed with much interest over the past 25 years.If Barbra (God forbid!!) should ever need to prove herself as a singer or actress or director,all she would need is to show this book as her &quot;resume&quot; of all that she has done in her 40 year career.

BUY IT!"},{"Title":"The Complete Round-the-World Cookbook","review":"This is a great cookbook! If you love to make foods from all over the world but don't want to spend a whole weekend on one entree, this is the book for you - Pan Am stewardesses, circa 1954, were asked to provide a small number of recipes for appetizers, entrees, vegetables, desserts and drinks, from the routes they flew, so there are foods from literally all over the world. Easy to make, even easier to eat - yum! Whenever I have company, this is the book I use to prepare meals, and no one has ever complained - plus they always ask for seconds. And don't miss the fabulous introduction, wherein the editor, Myra Waldo, warns her readers of 50 years ago that they will be running into strange ingredients in these recipes that they have rarely used before - things like garlic, onions and rice! Plus, the line drawing illustrations are absolutely charming. Buy this cookbook, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Round-the-World Cookbook","review":"Though I haven't cooked anything from the book yet, I marked dozens of interesting recipes in the book. They are unique without being weird, and they don't often have ingredients I won't be able to find in local grocery stores. Most didn't look time-consuming to make. I liked adding a cookbook to my collection that lists recipes by country and included a wide variety of countries around the world."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"I really like Robert Goddard's books. This is the first one I've read from \\"modern\\" times and I really enjoyed it. I've always enjoyed his earlier books and this was very good also."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"Robert Goddard is that truly British type that fills every page with articulate detail and a knack for creating characters that truly live.I agree with all the other reviews and was captivated by the narrative however there is a flaw that is central to the engine of the plot and simply put, it is essential that Toby have a all consuming love for his soon to be ex-wife and frankly I never saw anything in his description of her that made me see why he would care for one way or another.Truth is, I found her to be quite the unlikeable sort and so, although enamored of all that went on, I could not help but be jolted out of the story repeatedly by the woman Toby was doing everything for."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"(I read this book when it came out in the UK two years ago. I haven't seen this edition but I assume it's the same.)All the elements of the classic Goddard formula are on display here: the downcast hero who's managed to screw up his own life, the links to a past wrong, a touch of history that's just enough to thrill those who know the references without being too precious to alienate those who don't. Play to the End tells the story of an actor who is trying to salvage his career and the opportunity presented by a lead role in a lost (and imaginary) Joe Orton play when he's drawn into a mystery involving the ex-wife he still loves. It's the usual thrilling ride with Goddard at the helm. What sets Goddard apart from the hundreds of other thriller writers of today is his ability to marry those twists with a compelling narrative style, genuine character development and intelligent subject matter.Fans of Robert Goddard will embrace this latest of his thrillers to hit the States. For newcomers who want a mystery/thriller that isn't dumbed down this book is a good entry into the world of the surprise twist that Goddard does so well."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"I ... hate .... to ... admit it, but I had a hard time finishing this book. Robert Goddard's work usually captures me from the beginning and keeps me interested until the final page. This book is a bit weaker in terms of character development (anyone beyond Toby Flood is loosely drawn) and the plot is uninteresting once the direction is clear."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"Toby Flood, who almost got to play James Bond, is on his way down. His divorce to the woman he loves is almost final; his career is fading. Life isn't too bright for Toby at the moment.He's in Brighton, doing the last few performances of a play that isn't going to make it to the big-time. Brighton just happens to be where his soon to be ex-wife lives with her new lover, the rich scion of a local industrial family. Oh woe is Toby.He brightens when his beloved calls and asks his help. She owns a millinery in town and she is, she believes, being stalked. Toby, brave man, confronts the stalker, Derek Oswin, a local man who seems more than a bit odd. Toby extracts a promise from Derek that he will leave his almost divorced wife alone, a promise quickly broken.Derek at first appears to have more than a few screws loose, but it turns out that he has a genius for manipulating Toby Flood. Shrewd enough to realize that Toby will do anything to regain the love of his wife, Derek maneuvers Toby into becoming his weapon against Roger Colburn, Jennifer Flood's fiance.The Colburn family has a past and secrets to hide: secrets so dangerous that Roger will stop at nothing to keep them hidden, even if it means murder.I won't spoil things by saying more. Suffice it to say that Robert Goddard's characters are richly endowed: if you're a fan of old British films, you'll see a young Alec Guiness playing Toby Flood. Or maybe even Michael Caine. Richard Burton would have made a perfect Roger Colburn. Every character in Goddard's book suggests its own player.The plot and sub-plots are totally delicious. There are a number of surprises along the way and Goddard keeps things moving fast enough so that they remain surprises.Altogether a marvelous offbeat mystery and a delightful read.Jerry"},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"This is my first Robert Goddard novel, but it certainly will not be my last. This story is wonderfully plotted, fluid and intelligent. Duplicity and intrigue are the order of the day and will keep you reading. Unlike most mystery/suspense novels, Mr. Goddard's manipulations and story telling expertise do not \\"telegraph\\" the ending when your half way through the book. Others have described the plotline, I will not do so. Just know that if your in the mood for some engrossing storytelling, this is the ticket."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"While taking the monotonous train to Brighton, actor Toby Flood muses about his career in which the highlight was years ago when he was a strong candidate to replace Roger Moore as James Bond. Not long after failing to be selected as 007, Toby's career stopped ascending and began the dive that continues today. He knows that though he has top billing in a Joe Orton play, deputy stage manager Mandy Pringle sees support actor Martin Donahue as the near term future. Perhaps adding to his melancholy mood of failure, Toby regrets that his wife Jenny, whom he still loves, has field for divorce.Brighton hat shop owner Jenny calls Toby to demand he stop the stalker. Hex explains he has not hired any stalker, but will look into it especially when she claims he has a video of one of Toby's films. Toby confronts Derek Oswin, who promises to stop staring at Jenny stating he only used her as a means to meet his hero, Mr. Flood. However, when Derek fails to live up to his agreement, Toby follows up, even missing a performance, However, he will soon miss a lot more as Toby, in his quest to recapture Jenny's love, has become entangled in a domestic dispute involving the affluent Colburn family.Robert Goddard is one of the best suspense writers on the market today (see BORROWED TIME). As always his tales star a seemingly average individual (this time a B actor who missed his fifteen minutes) placed in lethal situations in which the outcome remains up in the air until the final climax. PLAY TO THE END does that and more as Toby's desperation ploy to regain his beloved turns into a nightmare.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"Difficult to put down. Lots of plot twists. Very satisfying ending. Robert Goddard's books are a favourite of mine, and this is one of the best I have read so far. If you like going to live theatre then this book gets into that world which adds more interest to this book. Try it."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"I have been a fan of Robert Goddard for nearly thirty years. Someone recommended his first, \\"Past Caring\\", I read it in suspense until nearly the last page and was hooked.His lead characters are usually flawed in some way, and the novels are about redemption. Frequently he peels back the past, and joins it with the future.I wouldn't call his novels \\"thrillers,\\" but they are page-turners and full of surprises.Toby, the lead in \\"Play to the End\\", I think Goddard's latest book, is an actor who is still in love with his wife, from who he is separated. She intends to marry a powerful, wealthy man, whom Toby tries to incriminate, and who it appears is trying to kill the actor. While the mystery is evolving, Toby is trying to save his shaky career. All of Goddard's books deserve the epitaph, \\"A Jolly Good Read.\\" Plotting is his best claim to fame.I can't figure why Goddard's books are not more popular in the US. They are hard to find, even in the Mass-market bookstores, but are reliably available on Amazon."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"This is my second exposure to Robert Goddard and I'm still hungry for the rest of his books. Toby Flood, a B actor on his way down into oblivion is the star of a traveling theatre production in England. When the play reaches Brighton he is contacted by his ex-wife who is being observed by a stalker. She wants Toby to find out what the stalker wants. From here on the story twists and turns with interesting character, great plots and surprising events throughout. Some of my favorite authors include Ngaio March, P.D. James and Martha Grimes. Robert Goddard fits right in there with them, with great storylines and a mastery of the English language. Each page is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"Robert Goddard remains my favorite modern author, and I'll continue to add his novels to my collection. But \\"Play to the End\\" will not be my favorite.Hard to say why, but I think it has to do with style and choice of setting. The story's hero, Toby Flood, is an actor - and the shallow, insincere world of the theater is well portrayed. The result is that I had a hard time identifying with the hero - something that was not at all difficult in any of the other Goddard novels I've read.As for style, it seemed to me to be somewhat staccato, again different from Goddard's usual. Almost as if he was emulating some writer of pulp detective fiction from the 1920s Chicago."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"For lovers of the British mystery, Goddard is or should be a beloved name. He manages to mix things that are quintessentially English with off-beat areas of expertise, fast-plotting and strong characters and does this with equal ease in either historical or contemporary settings.Play to the End is set in contemporary England and follows actor Toby Flood who is at an ebb point in his life and career. He is starring in a failed Orton play, about to lose his wife to a man who is richer, handsomer and more charming and has no long-term prospects in his chosen career. The plot of this mystery involves early plastic manufacturing, Joe Orton plays and biography, the English stage, family dysfunction, redemption and of course, a psychopath. How Goddard mixes these elements into a more than readable English mystery is a delight to behold. Recommended as is all of Goddard's work. Highly recommended to fans of British mysteries."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"I'm a fan of Robert Goddard and have read most of his novels. Some I like more than others. This one, I felt, was one of the weakest. Toby Flood, the hero, is a man driven to help his about-to-be-ex wife because he still loves her. She is about to marry somebody else. But something is wrong, and she asks for Toby's help. The plot escalates from there. I felt most of the characters were two-dimensional, and I just didn't find the story that gripping."},{"Title":"Play to the End","review":"I'd never read this author before. But, in this one I found he had a fun way with words and quirky characters that engaged me in the tale.Short Summary: B-List actor goes to Brighton on tour with the play he stars in. His ex-wife and her future husband live there. She asks him to help w/ a man who's been stalking her. He finds himself trying to unravel a mysterious web around the stalker and his wife's future husband whom he suspects is not the man for her.UPSIDES & DOWNSIDES:- This is one for when you're in the mood for a light, entertaining mystery that'll keep you turning the pages. It's a nice little lark of an escape - good for on the beach or traveling.- The ending goes way \\"over-the-top\\" for me. It's a pet peeve of mine when books suddenly turn into really, really EVIL guy doing crazy things - with good guy suddenly taking really, really not so clever actions. But, I'll hand it up to Goddard that often just when I thought \\"oh, this is going to be so predictable, he's going to have so-and-so do such-and-such\\", Goddard would have one of the characters say something to the other like \\"don't even think about doing such-and-such\\" and what I thought would occur didn't. Nice way to keep me engaged.BOTTOM LINE: 3.5 stars for a fun, page-turning, light \\"beach read\\" sort of action mystery, despite a slightly loose plot that ends up having to rely on a stereotypical \\"over-the-top\\" gun toting bad guy vs. good guy ending."},{"Title":"Watch for the Morning","review":"The book was gripping.

But I finally picked this one up and though \\"what the heck. I'll just read it.\\" and I was pleasantly suprised. It was pretty good.

(You need 44 candles for all 8 nights of Hanukkah.) My three children (ages 4,6,and 8) and my husband and I were really looking forward to this activity. Because of the lack of adequate supplies, as well as the brittleness of the wax, it turned out to be a huge waste of money and expectations. Until the company fixes the supply problem, I would not recommend this product. Good potential, so that's why I gave it 2 stars and not 1."},{"Title":"The Hanukkah Candle Kit","review":"As others have noted, the kit is sorely lacking in supplies. However, if you accept that you will not be able to make all the candles you need, it can be a special family project. How about one night of candles, or a shamash for every night?

The NationalResearch Council is routinely put into that position nevertheless--and we're better off for it. This work, &quot;Embedded, Everywhere&quot;, isa work from some of the top people in Computer Science today andattempts to identify the issues relating to a world saturated withcomputing resources.EmNets, networked systems of embedded computers, are the centraltheme of the book. This isn't science fiction. Some of what isdiscussed in the work is already touching our lives. &quot;It shouldcome as no surprise that the modern automobile is already a rollingnetwork of embedded computers. In model year 2001, cars havebetween 20 and 80 microprocessors controlling everything from therunning of the engine to the break system to the deployment ofthe airbags.&quot; While this certainly presents technical challenges,there are ethical ones as well. &quot;Few automobile drivers, forexample, are currently aware that many cars collect and storeinformation about the way the car has been driven (e.g., drivingspeed, acceleration, engine speed). This information can be usedby manufacturers to better analyze accidents and, hence, improvesafety but could also be used to disallow warranty claims or toprove that an automobile was operated in an unsafe manner.&quot;Today's computing systems are complex and in amazing places. Yet,the book makes the following assertion: &quot;...as the rest of thisreport makes clear, incremental improvement to today's solutionswill not suffice to realize the full potential of EmNets.&quot; Thebook then goes on to identify those problem areas and to makespecific recommendations for research into solving those problems.The book has an impressive list of authors. Deborah Estrin,professor of CS at UCLA was the committee chair andwas backed up by Mark Horowitz of Stanford, Barbara Liskov of MITand others from academia. This wasn't just some university exercise,however. Industry was also well represented on the effort with thelikes of Jerry Fiddler (founder and chairman of Wind River Systems),Robert Colwell (lead architect for the P6 at Intel), and Jim Waldo(Sun Microsystems and developer of the first CORBA ORB and laterJini Network Technology), to name a few.There is a hard-edged, practical feel to the extensive discussionsin this small book.

Luckily, you don't need to.Just follow the research initiatives and they will light the path."},{"Title":"Embedded, Everywhere: A Research Agenda for Networked Systems of Embedded Computers","review":"This report takes the view that information technology (IT) is on the verge of another revolution, driven by the increasing capabilities and ever declining costs of computing and communications. IT is being embedded into a growing range of physical devices linked together through networks and will become ever more pervasive as the component technologies become smaller, faster, and cheaper. These networked systems of embedded computers, referred to by this report as EmNets, have the potential to change radically the way people interact with their environment by linking together a range of devices and sensors that will allow information to be collected, shared, and processed in unprecedented ways. EmNets could be implemented as a kind of digital nervous system to enable instrumentation of all sorts of spaces. EmNets are expected be employed in personal monitoring strategies (both defense related and civilian), combining information from sensors on and within a person with information from laboratory tests and other sources; and EmNets will dramatically affect scientific data collection capabilities, ranging from new techniques for precision agriculture and biotechnological research to detailed environmental and pollution monitoring.The report expects EmNets to quite possibly dwarf previous milestones in the information revolution. It sees IT eventually becoming an invisible component of almost everything in everyone's surroundings. This 236-page report explores the potential of EmNets and the research challenges they present. It describes the many ways in which these emerging networks operate under unique constraints not present in more traditional distributed systems such as the Internet.

If you thought &quot;Lady Cottington's...&quot; was good, this is better. This is a complete guide to Faeries, Pixies, Gnomes and other such creatures. It tells that faeries arent pretty tinkerbelle things, but are watchers of nature. This book is a great gift for any faery believer and a must have to add to your faery collection! I recently got this for christmas, and it makes a wonderful gift to any Faery Believer! Even if they dont, this makes a unique gift!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"The most beautiful drawings I've ever seen. A true love of Faeries makes it all the more magical."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This book was given to me by a friend in Colorado. I had wandered out into the woods from time to time to catch a thought and found an emptiness that I hadn't realized was there. It fealt like an inability to dream, or imagine. Once I read this book I fealt renewed in the imaginative sense, whole, I dream all the time now, whenever I'm out and about. That little thought that I'm not alone, silly, yet humerous, it's comforting. I love the book. If anyone wants to talk about it with me, I just got an account: jasper_47@hotmail.com :feel free. I'll dream with ya"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"If you have never read the earlier versions of this book; I would recommend buying it at once if you are interested in Faerylore. If you have one of the earlier versions you will find some added material in this edition; however, there are some lost portions as well. Though I have the earlier editions; I still liked this one too. Interesting, full of stories and discriptions of fae and their not so pleasant relatives the book is very well illustrated. So well illustrated that many would find illustrations, alone, worth the price of the book. At least one other reviewer felt the book was pornographic. Considering the subject matter and its total otherworldliness, I find that statement to be a gross exaggeration. Some of the Faeries are shown nude or near nude; but their relationship with humans is as questionable as nude doga and cats. Lets not make something out of nothing. Only the extreme prude and I do mean \\"extreme\\" would find these pictures indecent. Disneys Fantasia had such nudity as this book and Fantasia passed the censors of the 1930s. A fascinating book I highly recommend. I only gave it 4 stars instead of five because I have two similar, earlier, versions and I would have appreciated more new material."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I had this magnificant book when I was wee lass, kept me awake many a night. So happy to see a new edition print, so I can own the book of creatures and fellows realtive to dreams. Brian Froud's artwork is a passage, a glimmer reflection of a world outside human exsistence, a sparkel of what is not always seen. His ability to capture Fae folk images is a true gift or trade...as the fae are fickle that way. Buy this book and add it to ANY collection of books!!! The only sad part I have to say about this magical book, is that some of the original artwork back rounds seem to be missing. I remeber the Kelpie to be shrouded in the woods on the page, scared the wits out of me as a child. Now there seems to be alot of white, almost to much white at times... but at least I have a copy!!! I believe in Faeries and all their kin!!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Faeries was a title I had many years ago in my artbook collection. When I bought the original book when first published, it was a source of inspiration for many years. Having moved around since then, it disappeared (perhaps a loan to a friend). It had been out sight and mind for at least 25 years. In a conversation with my children, they remembered the book and asked to see it again, and I was given the inspiration to search again. I bought the \\"Deluxe edition\\" this time and I am delighted with it all over again. If you're a fan of art and/or the \\"Middle Earth\\" look by Tolkien, this book is for you. It's good to have it back in the family again. I may buy another for my aspiring artist grand-daughter for her future inspirations."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This is a great reference book for faeries. Just what I was looking for.

I highly recommend this fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Anyone serious about learning from faeries has to check out this book. Its pages are full of knowledge and fascination. It is not a documental but rather a compilation of popular wisdom brought to life by two of the most important interpreters of faerie art and folklore. It will be fun and at the same time you will come out feeling you understand your world a little better. But faerie is a vast subject and you can search your entire life for the meaning of it and your place in it and never truly understand it all.So consider this just a stepping stone on your long journey."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Really great book.

It's the perfect addition to any Froud lover's collection. I had the original edition since I was a little girl, but eventually had to share, so I had to get one of my own. I love it just as much now as I did when I was younger. Froud is a brilliant artist, and the explanations he provides for his characters are just as fantastic.

This book weaves a spell over the common folk! Not only does Foud and Lee depict the various form of fae (seelie, unseelie, goblins, etc.); they also share the stories surrounding these mystical creatures.

However, fate didn't dissapoint me with this one. This book is so informative, I just loved it, and still do. The pictures are fantastic and some beyond belief that they were created by mortal hands.

In the years since, Brian Froud has never stopped his extensive personal exploration of the faery realms--filling his studio in rural England with one extraodinary painting after another. Fans of his work will be pleased to know that a brand new book of faery lore (GOOD FAERIES, BAD FAERIES by Brian Froud, edited by Terri Windling) will be soon be available (Autumn 1998). The new book goes beyond the ancient faery lore of the Britist Isles to explore faery lore from all around the world...include faeries of the present day, bringing magic to modern life. For a taste of the forthcoming book, an article about it from Realms of Fantasy Magazine can be found reprinted on the Endicott Studio web site (Gallery section)"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This is one of the most influental books I have read. Even as a small child, I would talk to the trees and flowers in hope that I would get an answer from the Faerie folk. The illustrations are magnificent and the text is wonderfully written.

Brian Froud and Alan Lee have created a marvelous book that weaves a magical tapestry about the reader, and won't let them go until the book is through with them! A perfect blending of typed and hand-written texts, and many differing styles of artwork help to make this volume a captivating sourcebook for lovers of the fae and light hearts everywhere! Colorful, richly drawn canvases reach out to the viewer to entrance them and hold them in the faerie world these two gentlemen speak so ellequently about. The combination of lovely prose, great sections of written verses and blurbs, and staggeringly beautiful, (and sometimes staggeringly jarring,) artwork make this book a true transportation device. Straight past the walls of reality and through the veils of the Enchanted World! I would recommend it to anyone with a free spirit, a grand imagination, and especially to someone who needs"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This is a great choice for anyone who loves stories of fairies and, most especially, totally wondrous art."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I loved this book with it's artwork, text, and comprehensive handling of faeries. The treatment of the \\"species\\" was also consistent with other sources I have read. Faeries are not of human origin and therefore do not maintain the same behaviors or values that many would like to project on them. The author's handling of encounters, cooperation, and offenses against faeries was insightful. There is good reason to avoid encounter with these creatures.Those that criticize this book for its realistic approach have not read far. This subject is not for children as the characters are not gossimer cuddlies but self-centered, manipulative, unpredictable beings. If readers are disenchanted by this book, they should also avoid delving into the subject of angels."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I borrowed this book from the university's library, and I enjoyed it very much. Alan Lee and Brian Froud are among my favorite artists; the illustrations are incredibly beautiful, and the history and the folklore was very interesting. Finally, a true portrayal of faeries!A lot of people complain that the book is \\"too dark\\" and \\"too ugly\\" of a portrayal on faeries. The interesting thing about these complaints however, is that faeries were NOT limited to the cute little winged figures that sat in flowers (this was in fact, a much later and highly romanticized form added). Nor were Faeries truly good. Though the Faery Realm was indeed a realm of beauty, laughter and music, it was also a realm of darkness, ugliness, and even evil. My suggestion is, instead of bashing it because it's not something you're familiar with, read it and learn something new. I definately learned something and I plan on purchasing this book in the near future."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I for one absolutely love anything with faeries! No not the cutesy ones, but the ones that Brian Froud and Allan Lee have come to illustrate. I first stumbled upon this book on ebay through one of my favorite sellers, but they wanted nearly $30 for it and it was out of my price range. By some miracle I have made up my mind that I have to have this book. So, two weeks later I found this book in my local library used book store and bought the original 70s version for $6.I couldn't wait to get it home and open it! The drawings are nothing less than amazing. The detail that goes into each one is beyond belief. Mr. Froud and Mr. Lee has illustrated the realm of faerie as it has not been seen before. Tinkerbell may be cute, but this book shows a side of the faerie realm that is not often portrayed. They are portrayed as tricksters and not always friendly. We are shown that faeries aren't neccessarily the cutesy beings that tend to your garden. They are very personal and like to be left alone by humans. Whether this is true in reality or not, I cannot say, but the stories and the details of each drawing are sure enough to make you a believer. I didn't need to try hard to like this, as I believe! I think one thing that most people might not realize is this doesn't mean that if you go to the UK and hang out in a forest long enough, you will see faerie folk. Many books actually emphasize that faeries do not exist in the same plane that we do, and many times they can only be seen in your mind's eye almost in a psychic way.What makes this book even harder to put down is the fact that at the end of the book there are actual photographs of what may indeed be real faeries. Of course the pictures are quite a few decades old, and the cameras used back then have not been up to par with the ones used now. They are definitely there to see and question whether or not, the sightings photographed may have actually taken place.This is a beautiful book and well worth owning for any faerie fan. Some of the writing tends to be a bit hard to read as the author wrote it in his own handwriting as it looks, but that's what makes this book even better! This book is full of amazing stories, history and illustrations."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"The illustrations are hauntingly beautiful and the whole book just flows wonderfully. Really lets you feel as if you know all about the fairies...both good and bad!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This serious of books is amazing if you like the artists style, which i love, a great addition to your art book collection."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This book is teaching me things about faeries that, somehow, I already knew. Faeries are creatures that remind us who we really are and our connection with nature."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Ever since I grew up, I have beleived in faeries. Well, I grew up with this book! I have read Faeries around 50 times cover to cover since I was nine.( now I am 13) What I don't understand:why not put more photographs at the end? Faeries is very interesting and I would reccomend it to anyone who knows how to read.(and I have knowledge that young&amp;old like it because my grandmother, my mother and I used to read it together) Brian Froud certainly captures the beauty of a mysterious world perfectly!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I first saw this book in a store while attending University and fell instantly in love. I have waited 10 long years to own a copy of my own and finally I have it !!! I am familiar with the works of both Mr. Froud and Mr. Lee -- through my friend and author, Anna Marie Ferguson ( Legend : the Arthurian Tarot ). This book should be on the shelves of every child, so that they may keep the path to their imaginations open. Had this book been in my posession years ago, I know without a doubt it would have provided both comfort and inspiration to a young girl seeking a path to the land of the Fey. I have yet the words to describe what this book means to me. I will treasure it for the rest of my days - and entrust a copy to as many as possible.I, too am in the process of choosing one of these exquisite depictions of the Faerie Folk to tattoo on myself, as an homage to the works of Mr. Froud and Mr. Lee.Thank-you both for taking my hand and showing me the way. I als! ! o have a copy of &quot;Strange Stains and Mysterious Smells&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; my favorite film. I look so forward to collecting more of your wonderous works!If you do not already have a copy -- hardcover, of course -- get one ( or six ). Everyone who has the priveledge of viewing mine wants one of their own!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This book can be aptly called beauty at its best. Not only is it informative by giving thereader descriptions of numerous creatures of folklore, but the pictures are gorgeous!...Each creature is drawn with a realisticism worthy of museum display, and even if you're looking topurchase this book for someone who can't readthe text for themselves, they'll be delightedby the drawings.Definitely a must-have for anyone who collectsworks on mythology. A warning, however. Someof the pictures do contain nudity, so you might want to use discretion with younger readers."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"My parents gave this to me for my fifth birthday and it is one of the most cherished and beautiful books that I own. It's a compilation of gorgeous watercolors, sketches, and a systematic like grouping of faeries and their mythical kin. I can't imagine a better book for a young artist or creative reader. I spent hours and hours poring over each illustration and reading about the origins of all the creatures. It has a Jim Henson-like quality in its imaginative spirit (echoed by one of the jacket covers which features Froud with a little puppet faery mannikin posed in a tree). Alan Lee is responsible for those gorgeous watercolors, while Brian Froud does the kinetic sketches (Froud was also the illustrator of Lady Cottingtons Book of Pressed Faeries--a funny and darkly humored picture book). Sidenote: Brian Froud's wife, Wendy, was one of the artists responsible for the very beautiful (if slightly dated) Dark Crystal and, I did not know this--YODA!! Who knew?! Wonderful news, too, the 25th edition of this book contains 20 new pieces by Froud and Lee.As for the nakedness: When I was six I thought everyone's body was beautiful and nakedness definitely didn't put me off. The only times it was disturbing was when adults made a big deal of it. That and finding a discarded copy of Penthouse behind an abandoned building both fascinated and freaked me out. But Froud's book is nothing like that. I'd no more be upset by the nudity in this then I would by the nudity in Renaissance paintings. I'm guessing adults must read more eroticism into it than any child would. If you're really worried, check out Brian Froud's website--it has some of the illustrations from Faeries and will give you a better sense of it. Personally, I think it's a wonderful book for children. Not to harp on, but I don't think un-erotic and un-sensationalized exposure to nudity is a bad thing (and I don't mean that in a let's all be nudists manner...just a hey, we all got skin underneath our clothes recognition).If there's someone in your life who has a fly-away imagination and appreciation for art or myth, this is a terrific choice."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I first saw this book when I was 7 when my dad, knowing I loved both art and faeries, brought it home for me from the library. Needless to say, I loved it but several of the more intense drawings scared me! I dog-eared the scariest pages so I could skip over them easily... many years later I came across a copy of it and simply had to buy it. Not only is the art and text inspiring, but it's the kind of book that sticks in your mind over time..."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"If you thought you liked Lady C's Pressed Fairy Book (now out of print), then you'll LOVE this one!! It is the best faerie book i have ever seen, and read. It not only tells you the history of faeries, but it also gives you an idea where Faerie -the land of faeries- is, it gives you detailed information about all the wee folk! If you thought faeries were the pretty winged Tinkerbell likes, think again, and read this book! You'll get surprised on how many faerie types there is!!The book is beautifully illustrated, and a must for every one interested in faeries, and art! This one should be in the bookshelf in every home! Buy it for yourself, for your mom, your kid and for your best friend!! It makes a great present!Definately worth the money, i'd pay the double price if i had to, it's that great!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I purchased this book long, long ago, and I now have a child who is very interested in faeries. So it was bought down from the bookshelf, the dust blown off it, and we settled down for a read. I had forgotten what a gem this book is.The illustrations alone are worth the purchase price. If you are interested in fine art, let alone book illustrations, you will apreciate this book. The text is well written and amusing, with a great deal of attention to the smaller details of the small people's lives. And let us not forget the less than nice faeries - the bad faeries who we think are best forgotten. They also get a slice of the action. It is sometimes pleasant to have that little shiver of frightening childhood memories.It is a delightful book. Its not strictly a children's book but you will be very fondly remembered by any child you present this to as a gift. Its not strictly an adult book either, but hey, let's live a little! Leave it on your coffee table and I guarantee everyone will pick it up. Maybe it has its own little bit of magic."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I first found this book in thge sci-fi section of my local bookstore, I had seen the cartoon short based on this book and I was interested in the what the book was like. I paged through it thinking it would be a well illustrated tolkien like story, like the animated version. Then after looking through about half a page I was hooked, I couldn't put it down, I stoped reading when the store was closed and the checkout clerk forced the book from my hands, two days later I was back with the price of the book in my wallet. This was the first book I had ever read that actually talked about the evil, dark faeries that your childhood storybooks never talk about, like redcaps, and the unseelie court. I have read this book cover-to-cover several times and I am still finding things in some of the illustrations I hadn't noticed before. If your interested by this book, get yourself a copy of the animated version."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"My mother gave my a copy of &quot;Faeries&quot; for Christmas 1980, when I was 11. I was instantly enchanted with the idea of faeries as real beings, and accepted much of the text as truth. I fantasized about spotting faeries in the woods and rocks surrounding my childhood home, and made many (sophomoric) attempts to copy Brian Froud's illustrations. As an adult I even had a flower faerie tattooed on my ankle in homage to his artMy origional copy of &quot;Faeries&quot; is tattered and dog-eared, most of the pages have fallen out, and are hopelessly out-of-sequence, but I can't bear to throw it away. I count &quot;Faeries&quot; as one of the most influential books I had as kid growing up, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any child (or adult) interested in faeries or mythology. The book is incredibly well-researched, and beautifully illustrated.

I lost it and recently found a copy in a bookstore. This book is so dear to me, invoking my imagination as a child and now dear memories.

It's absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I have never seen such gorgeous and detailed art with faeries! The entire book is fascinating. There's some regular handwriting along with typed text, so it gives the reader a break from uniform letters. A lot of the faeries have some sort of folk-tale to them. Some are simply described. The pictures come in such variety! There are paintings, extraordinarily detailed drawings... drawings that look inked. As an 18 year old aspiring fantasy artist (who loves to draw faeries ;o) ) Brian Froud's work is an incredible inspiration! I adore this book so much. It's something you can read over and over... read out of order... I could spend hours alone just looking at the pictures! This is the best faery book I have ever had the pleasure to come across! (So far anyway...:o) )"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This is a classic book illustrated by Brian Froud and Allan Lee - a cornerstone in my own faerie library! The book gives a very thorough overview of faerie, inluding faerie habits, haunts, flora and species. Marvelous illustrations are magically woven in with the text. This is not the lore of tooth fairies and Tinkerbells; rather, Faeries is based on historical beliefs from different cultures, and takes us through both the light and dark worlds of faerie. Whether you're new to the land of fae, or have already discovered it through Froud's newer books (Good Faeries/Bad Faeries, Lady Cottington's Pressed Faery Book), Faeries is a must-have!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I've had this book since forever, and 3 days ago I pulled it out from hiding and starting reading it again because I also started working with The Faeries' Oracle recently and wanted to compare it (They are both from Brian Froud, so I figured they should both have lots of insight). Although the book is beautiful, I find myself confused because unlike the cover, that has a pretty little fairy on it, 90% of this book is about bad and nasty fairies, their stories and pictures. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy it. If you are into fairy folklore and myth, then its a keeper, but if you want to compare it with Brian Froud's fairy oracle, then don't. First, you won't be able to, and second, you'll be afraid to use the oracle because of all the nasty things you read from the book.I love The Faeries' Oracle, and I won't stop using it since because of the scary stories from this book. But I do wish to know if fairies are as good and full of wisdom as the oracle says, or if they are as bad as this book says.Either way, if you love Fairies, you should buy it."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This is a beautifully detailed book that will delight and inspire the imagination for young and old alike. This year I purchased 2 copies- One as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old Fairy loving new stepdaughter (who lives a bit of a distance from us.) The 2nd I purchased for my Fairy loving 6 year old son; my husband who lost a copy of this book years ago; and myself-knowing how special a book like this can be to grow up around. As a newly blended family, I can already see my son and daughter engaged in a lively discussion over Fairy behaviors and habitats."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Bought this for my four year old granddaughter because 1/ She is soooo into faeries and 2/ because in the distant past, I remembered how beautiful the illustrations were. However, I did not give it to her upon receiving it because most of the faeries are based upon real folklore and have very scary background stories attached like the Jenny Greenteeth &#34;faerie&#34;. I'll keep it for a few years and get her the 'Gnomes Deluxe Collector's Edition' as a first step. Then again, if you are a parent who thinks that the unrestricted access to original Grimm's Faerie Tales is okay-dokey with some parental guidance, then have at it."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I've always wanted this book, it\`s a beautiful edition of a magical book. It\`s great for kids and adults. It came in perfect conditions."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"If you are a fan of Brian Froud, you mist get this book.

Timeless, wonderful faerie art - a must have book!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I received this book (original edition) for Christmas when I was eleven years old and was absolutely mesmerized by it. The book inspired me to delve into researching fairy tales, and particularly into exploring Celtic folklore around \\"faeries,\\" who tend to be ambivalent towards humans, but always fascinating and true to themselves. I have never stopped being intrigued by the subject. I'm SO delighted in this collector's edition. The extra artwork and the prints were a wonderful surprise, and the original artwork, which I have held in my mind's eye and my imagination's heart all these years is still enthralling to me, which is only fitting given that faeries are inveterate enchanters. If you had the original book like myself or if you didn't (horrors!) and you enjoy the subject matter, there is no possible way that you'll be anything but delighted with this collector's edition."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I'm in awe of this book, Brian Froud's art is glorious, and the version of Tam Lin in the back...oh my, lol"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I remember the original book, this one is the Collector's Edition which is a reprint but also comes with additional removable prints which are just beautiful. The price is less than the original book and except for one small spot/mar of ink on one of the pictures it is perfect. The drawings are beautiful and the stories are entertaining. I recommend this book for any child (brought up with The Hobbit or the original fairy tales by Brothers Grimm)or for any adult with imagination for superb fairy tales other than those pushed by Disney.The drawings are beautiful and some have that notch of horror that is so superb in any fairy tale. It is a beautiful reproduction of the original (though the reds may not be quite as red as I remember) and the additional prints are a lovely surprise."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This is a gorgeous book, a delightful stroll through the land of the fey. As a fiber artist I am constantly in search of nature muse and Brian Froud (of whom I cannot say enough wonderful things) and Alvin Lee (well, ditto!) deliver the world on a silver platter in this book. \\"Faeries\\" lives beside my bed so I can sneak a peek into the world of faery before I go to sleep.

Yes, as some negative reviews say, the cover is slightly misleading, but I think this \\"fairy glamour\\" is on purpose--if you take off the dust-cover, the actual cover is quite different! As a lover of all things mythology and folklore, I found that this book actually has mostly accurate information--Brian Froud knows his faeries, and actual folklore and mythology reference books contain similar information to this one--perhaps part of the reason I found it in a college library! The artwork is truly spectacular! Not sure if I'd recommend it for small children (scary images and nudity), but I sure do recommend it for any faery lovers, or those who want some cool drawings to go with their fairy lore!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I am a huge fan of Brian Froud and Alan Lee.

That copy (given by a favorite aunt) was well loved for many many years, using it even as a reference for university class...everything about the book is wonderful, possible and a true work of art...that was the original book and this edition is just like it with the exception of a new forward by Froud and Lee with new illustrations in their forwards. That's it. The remainder of the book is the same. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but feel one should know (especially if you are about to pay a nice chunk of change for this edition--2002--) you can be just as happy with \\"Faeries\\" as with this anniversary one.

I know liking fairies is very girly, but I just can't help it, for I have loved them since I owned Cicely Mary Barker's little \\"flower fairies\\" books as a young child. With its pencil drawings, numerous colour illustrations and witty text this book is a pleasure to look through time and time again, for one always discovers something new. This charming book dwells not just upon the innocent fairies; but encompasses all the denizens of the world of faery from the sweet natured and gentle nature sprites, to several of their much darker elemental cousins. Faeries is evocative of another era in time when people truly believed in fairies, elves, dwarves, brownies, hobgoblins and the like. Focusing primarily on the fairies and related mythical creatures of the British Isles, it is a lovely and at times eccentric journey deep into the Anglo Celtic folklore of these green and verdant island nations. This first collaborative effort by master illustrators Alan Lee and Brian Froud is probably one of their most beloved books; and one can literally immerse oneself in their imaginative world for hours, you really do lose track of time.Although both artists careers have gone on to grander things such as working as concept artists on big budget films and television shows, this first effort at the beginning of their careers stands as an enduring testament to their combined talents. The art of both men is quite different in style, character and tonal value, but in Faeries they complement each other in an aesthetic marriage of shared vision and imagination. Brian Froud after all these years is still thoroughly immersed in the world of faery with many books on fairies and goblins to his credit, such as Good Faeries/Bad Faeries. He also went on to work in film as a concept artist; bringing his idiosyncratic and unique talent to bear on two of the late Jim Henson's fantasy films, The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. Alan Lee went off on a different course illustrating books on ancient myths and legends; and perhaps painting his most famous book illustrations for the matchlessly romantic, sweeping and elegiac novels of J.R.R. Tolkien. In recent years Alan Lee was hired to work on the epic film versions of The Lord of the Rings as one of two chief concept artists (the other being John Howe) and his work on these three groundbreaking movies unquestionably gave them an aesthetic credibility they might not have had otherwise.Yet this wondrous volume is still for me one of their most outstanding achievements; and although many such books were published in the 1970s, Faeries is definitely at the top of the heap. This sumptuous 25th Anniversary Edition of Faeries has eight extra pages with twenty new pieces of artwork and newly expanded introductions, so it is definitely a must have for the serious fairy lover and fan of the original book. I only ever owned a softcover edition of this book, so when this special edition came out in hardback I quickly rushed to my local bookstore and purchased it immediately! Mr. Lee and Mr. Froud implore us to believe in the world of faery once again, and to be honest in this at times drab modern world it would be rather nice to believe it actually does exist. So sprinkle some fairy dust on yourself and go out and buy this wonderful book, I promise that it will entrance you and maybe even bring a little glamour into your life!"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Each and every page positively shimmers with magic. This is the book that made Brian Froud famous and has yet to be surpassed. Alan Lee's ethereal watercolors are just as breathtaking and provide a lovely counterpoint to Froud's more dramatic drawings. But don't let the glowing images fool you into thinking this is just another \\"art\\" book. The folklore contained therein is just as sound. The flora and fauna sections are especially worthwhile. There is also a dangerous aspect to this work, which adds a fascinating spicyness. Not all faeries are the shining winged beings that the Victorians were so fond of. Some are sharp toothed and clawed monsters that come creeping out of the shadows and muck to drag the unsuspecting to their dooms.One of the previous reviewers wrote that this book isn't for adults but not quite suitable for children either. I agree. IMHO it is a book for the inbetween people: young adults, serious children, and adults who have maintained some of their childhood innocence.Regardless how you look at it FAERIES is a classic."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Faeries: Deluxe Collector's Edition by Brian Froud and Alan Lee is a beautiful look into the world of faeries as illustrated by Brian Froud. If you ever wanted to purchase this book or perhaps already own the original copy, this is really a must buy for your collection of faeries.Faeries: Deluxe Collector's Edition showcases just how talented Brian Froud is when it comes to showcasing how he portrays faeries. These are not your run-of-the-mill faeries playing in a meadow in cute outfits. The 200 + illustrations featured in this edition are for adults to appreciate, and yes, some are nude.Although this is not a book aimed towards kids, it is worth the purchase for yourself (or to give as a gift). Each layout in the book is stunningly gorgeous and has captivating tales to go along with it. It is the type of book that could be devoured in a single night, or left to explore for a long stretch of time by only reading a few pages a day.Faeries: Deluxe Collector's Edition is a truly artistic view of faeries. It is perfect for any fan of fairies, book lover of artistic books, and anyone creative at heart.

One disappears into make-believe faery worlds which are so exquisitely illustrated by Froud and Lee that they seem real. One stares at the detail, always finding something new--sometimes humorous, sometimes scary--but always beautifully rendered. Their artwork is masterful and their imaginations know no bounds.The text, hand-written or typeset, describes these faery-creatures and their worlds even further. One learns how they feel, what tricks they like to play, the good that they do, what clothes they wear, and what their surroundings are like. The text adds to the fantasy, although the hand-written sections would be difficult for a child to read.I think the joy of the book is that one can pick it up time after time just to peruse the artwork and to read a tidbit here and there. It's one of my favorites and it's also enjoyed by my children and grandchildren. Not many books can span the generations. They've done an excellent job.Denise Hillman MoynahanThe Great Cavern of the Winds: Tales from Backbone Mountain"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I ordered this book from amazon not to long ago, I also enjoy the work of Brian Froud's enchanting but bewitching faeries.

I didn't buy them then because they were very expensive, and later, I was trying to find all three, but I manage to find only two. Now I have kids of my own and my son, who is three and a half, is apsolutly crazy about Dwarfes and Faires. All I can say is that finding the third book is my wish, and since this became impossible it is a task I would like to fullfil. So, maybe some of you, booklovers can help me with information where I can find Giants made by Brian Fraud and Alan Lee, by Hari 'N Abrams, published by N.Y. Rufus publication back in 1978. All I can say about this books is that I was looking for them 22 years. Two I have found, one I still miss. If someone is trying to find this books for so long - now for kids of her own, should I add anything more?"},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I love Alan Lee's work, always have. There is an ancient, ghost-like quality to his pencil sketches and his pale watercolors are like a spa for the eyes. Open the pages of \\"Faeries\\" and you'll see what I mean. Brian Froud's art contrasts markedly with Lee's. The subjects of his sketches and paintings are much more angular and solid than Lee's and his compositions are more chaotic. I do not find Froud's style nearly as enjoyable as Lee's, but it's not without merit. Froud excels at presenting the grotesque. His topsy-turvy goblins (the uglier and more expressive the better) are engaging and, more often than not, comical. I can't say I appreciate all his nudes, though. While I understand that fairies (if they existed) probably wouldn't flit about in leotards and tutus, I am rather disappointed with how Froud depicts these diminutive winged nudists. In my opinion, he focuses too much on the sensual aspect of fairies (I guess we all have our fantasies). Some images are, frankly, erotic. I find the overabundance of naked prepubescents in \\"Faeries\\" particularly unsettling. Had the designers been more discriminating as editors, \\"Faeries\\" could have edged into four or five star territory.If you like Alan Lee's work, check out \\"The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook\\" (ISBN 0618640142)."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"EVER SENCE I SAW THE BOOK AT MY BROTHER'SGIRLFRIENDS HOUSE I LOVED IT!

Both my daughter (9) and I have a great time reading it."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Faeries is the absolute greatest art book when it comes to fantasy, and that is because of the content, and the artists involved, as well as the quality in which it was printed and published in this, the 25th Anniversary Edition.The book itself is compiled like a visual atlas of the world of Faery, exploring all of the separate regions and, more importantly, the inhabitants living there. In this book, you are taught how to protect yourself during your travels through the lands in this book. It details some of the most majestic of faeries, including the watery Asrai--faeries who melt into a puddle of water when exposed--some of the more horrifying creatures, like the faeries of the Unseelie Court, and beastly goblins like the phooka, a creature that takes many animal forms but is mostly generous in spirit. There are many more, all highly detailed with both pictures and handwritten captions, and often depicted in the environments they call home.This is a keystone book in the world of fantasy art, and the authors and illustrators, Alan Lee, who made the concept art for the Lord of the Rings movies, and Brian Fround, who continues today to create more and more faery related art, have since gone on to flourish in their careers. If you have an interest in fantasy art, or are a lover of fantastical worlds or a believer in faeries, then pick this book up. If you just enjoy high quality art, like myself, then I'd also recommend this book."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This was a gift for a dear friend who is quite Faery-like herself. I've given several of Mr. Froud's faery books to people, and they are inevitably very pleased. Mr. Froud is a sensitive artist and captures the \\"Shining Folk\\" or \\"Lords and Ladies\\" very impressively, almost as though he were in touch with the Elemental Kingdoms himself, consciously or unconciously. These are splendid gifts for the imaginative, whether child or adult, and I recommend them very highly."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Absolutely wonderful writing and incredible pictures. I like the format of this book in that its a mix of hand written pencil notes along with regular type font for the main text. The drwaings are fantastic - wonderful expressions, outfits, colors. There are legends and such to set the stage before talking about each of the different faeries and other characters. Each faery discussed has a page devoted with a short text and drawings. The writing enlightens the imagination."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"This was the book where I first encountered the artists Froud and Lee, and also where I discovered that faeries are indeed either ugly or beautiful, old and young; everything I had ever hoped and imagined, and more. Froud and Lee's breathtaking and altogether masterly portrayal of the intrinsic, metamorphic world of fantasy forever hovering at our fingertips, is truly masterly, and I have never encountered another yet which rates quite as highly as this. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who loves faeries, and/or queries the 'pretty' flower-faeries we tend to be bombarded with today. s This book has all my dreams, nightmares and fantasies woven together in it's intricate, detailed illustrations, the thick, scrawling lead pencil script... I cannot find the words to speak highly enough of this simply unique, marvellous book. I am an avid admirer of Froud and Lee's works, the faery-kingdom, faery poetry, stories, tales, photographs, illustrations, and can never have enough information on that mystical kingdom where people such as Thomas the Rhymer and Tam Lin vanish to, where a cup of wine can bind you a prisoner, where the young are old, and the old are yound, where anything is possible whether you believe or not. I for one, do strongly believe in faeries, and wish that I could see one. This book is - where are the words to describe it? Magnificent/Fabulous/Beautiful/Moving/Terrifying/Fantastic/Eye-opening - they are only some...

From Faerie Flora to the hideous Jenny Greenteeth, all the fey folk are portrayed, both good and bad, pretty and ugly, helpful and mischievous. The stunning artwork is visionary in capturing the intrinsic mystery of this egnimatic, unseen world and its phantasmic population. The handwritten notes add to the captivating essence of the stories in an informal and comfortable way.If I could change anything at all, I would wish that the pages were numbered and included a table of contents, so I could more easily flip to my favorites.I would recommend this book to anyone who still wants to believe in magic, and to anyone who wants to reconnect with their childlike sense of wonder.

There are goblins, dwarfs, cluricauns, leprechauns, brownies, kelpies, pucks, witches, primroses....you see, its a whole different world filled with interesting little inhabitants that you may have never imagined!

The way this book talks about all kinds of faeries, whether they are good or bad, pretty or ugly, is really captivating. I love it."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Faeries, like the creatures it tries to describe, is hard to classify. Pick it up - it's a large, solid, beautifully bound coffeetable book for coffeetables you've no intention on putting drinks on - and flip through it once and you'll see fantasy art that beautifully captures the otherworldly-yet-very-familiar nature of its subject matter. Perhaps some of it will look familiar, as the art from Faeries has been used in many places and set the trends that other fantasy artists now follow.Pick it up later and you'll notice text. Words. Stories, in unobtrusive print that is big enough to be nicely readable but cunningly placed to make sure the art has gotten your full attention before you do any reading. The words retell key sections of faerie lore and elucidate faerie etiquette and the polymorphic nature of these beings.The subject matter is not sugar-coated or Bowlderized as if for children, but treated with the reverence and respect due to stories that have survived numerous invasions, migrations, and changes in the dominant religion. These are hardy stories, hearty stories that have lived for longer than any of us and that will outlive us all. These are stories and works of art that can be nourishing, that can enrich and enliven like a thick hearty soup on a cold day and refresh like a crisp cool drink on a hot one.After going through this mighty book a time or two, your attention might be drawn to the names on the cover. Brian Froud is one of them, and he went on after this book to help make movies (&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;) and make more books (some with the help of Terry Jones, like &quot;Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book&quot; and &quot;The Goblin Companion: A Field Guide to Goblins&quot;). Alan Lee is the other, and he went on to do cover illustrations for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that wound up becoming the definitive art for the movies. You might smile when you see them, and know hat anyone who saw this book before seeing any of those other things was in on the great secret about what those two can do, and if you get the book, you'll be in on it too."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"I am 15 years of age and I absolutelly LOVE this book.

There is no table of contents which would help locate sections/items you may find yourself favoring. You may want to take notes on something to make it easier to find the next time you get the book out.The text is a combination of the usual book type and hand written notes, I'm not sure why both are used.The artwork itself seems to run between sketches and very nicely done watercolors(?). Some of the art seems to be basically pencil work with little or no color but usually a lot of detail. The colored work is done the same way but more often has no background to the subject. The faeries themselves are most often depicted as either vaguely human or, some of them, very human like. Many of these last are at least partially nude, not much full frontal nudity, and seem to be mostly female. I prefer the more human types myself, nude or not.I don't know if I'll be getting more of Mr. Froud's work but this book has some nice stuff in it."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"this was the first faery book i ever bought. it created in me an love for faeries, their myths, and magical lore. brian froud is the best faery artist in the world. if you love faeries, then you must simply see these pages full of amazing artwork."},{"Title":"Faeries","review":"Faeries send you into a world of goblins and kelpies in the land of Faeries.

If I had just looked at the cover picture on this book, I don't know if I would have purchased it. But, as it so happens, they had it at a local bookstore.The cover picture is the goofiest in the book, there are much more serious pictures throughout. It is worth the price alone to get picture #38, entitled \\"Cat Crossing the Street in Traffic\\" - 1925 by Harry Warnecke. The picture has a policeman stopping traffic and several on-lookers are watching as a mother cat carries one of her young across the street. It's one of the most touching pictures I have ever seen. It gives you a glimps into not only the love a mother cat has for her kittens, but also the kindness of human nature (something increasingly lacking in today's world). That a police officer would stop traffic for a cat is amazing.Another whimsical picture depicts an animal shelter worker carrying a box with a cat in it. He is unlocking the door to the shelter, one would assume to put the cat in \\"jail\\", but the cat is jumping out of the back of the box to freedom. It makes me smile just thinking about it.There are a variety of pictures present in this book, some pictures of old, a few pictures that are staged with models (not many of these). Most of the pictures, though, are just candid shots of cats in their environments, such as the children sleeping on a fire escape and one is holding her kitten in her hand. Some are from far off locations such as Israel and Spain. And some are just with people who have an obvious affection and tolerance for the little buggers. :)It is well worth the price of admission into this whiskered little world."},{"Title":"Physical Chemistry (3rd Edition)","review":"I was assigned this textbook for a class in physical chemistry. The instructor who taught this course had been using one book for the last 4-5 years, and decided for a change of pace and so used this book. So many students hated the book that he went back to the old book (newer edition though) the following year. Unfortunately, that meant none of us in his class could sell our book back to the university bookstore. So I am now stuck with it. We only covered half the book in the class, so I read the other half, which turned out to be as bad as the first half.The book is comprehensive in its treatment: solids, liquids and gases all get a say here. Kinetics, quantum, crystallography, and thermo are all covered. There are lots and lots of equations, along with lots and lots of sample problems and homework problems at the end of each chapter. Unfortunately, there are also typos in various places, including the problems. The major drawback of this book is that it attempts to cover so many subjects, and provide a rigorous mathematical basis for each subject, such that the book is quite hard for someone learning physical chemistry for the first time. It would be okay for a graduate level course, but not as an undergraduate course. In all, there are better books in this area and so I would not recommend reading OR buying it."},{"Title":"Physical Chemistry (3rd Edition)","review":"I've used Noggle ten out of the past twelve years in my junior level physical chemistry course. It is very comprehensive, takes a rigorous theoretical approach, and I think was a leader in using an operator based method for quantum mechanics, as well as chpaters on Stat Mech. Having said all that I am alarmed by the student reviews here. I teach at a small liberal arts college with 5-15 students enrolled in physical chemistry, and I offer a lot of contact time for problem solving assistance. I guess I am hoping that the students who wrote awful reviews took the course at a much larger institution. I noticed that Noggle went to some effort to make the 3rd edition &quot;easier&quot; than the first two editions, so that the problems were a bit less challenging, and in so doing there were quite a few errors in the 3rd edition, as the students pointed out; this is a prime example of how making something easier makes it harder. In any case, I guess I would not recommend the use of this textbook in a large physical chemistry course where students do not have direct access to a knowledgeable professor who is available to them in abundant amounts. But I am going to keep using it, and praising Noggle as I do so for his mathematical approach to the subject of physical chemistry."},{"Title":"Physical Chemistry (3rd Edition)","review":"This is the best physical chemistry book I have seen.

My class used it for thermodynamics (wherein it was acceptable, but frustrating) and some of us used it (it conjunction with Goswami) for QM. Pretty bad. Finally the professor had to go through each problem and make sure that the answer(s) given in the back were approximately correct. Although mathematical rigor is sometimes hard to develop in physics books, it *is* needed. Why do some systems get solved with Laguerre polynomials, etc? Unfortunately, Noggle doesn't want to tell us. The best part of the book are the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.

Yendi is not my favorite Vlad novel, nor does it hang together stylistically as well as, say, Athyra, but this is the most characteristic of the series. If you are only ever going to read one Taltos novel, this should be it. It has the most complex plot of them all, and its massive scope gives the reader an excellent overview of Dragaeran society and history without bogging one down in pedantry. As with most of the early novels, Morrolan, Aliera and Sethra are all through this one, and as they are (or ought to be)everyone's favorite characters, that's incentive enough to pick this volume up. Future readers:Look for the allusion to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Enjoy; there's no way you couldn't."},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"Well, it seems opinions vary on this &quot;chapter&quot; of the Vlad Taltos series. People either think it is the best of the bunch or the worst of 'em (but they still like it). Even the author, Steven Brust, has stated that this is his least favorite of the series (which stands at eight novels, so far).I loved Yendi and it is one of my favorites of the entire series. Are &quot;hero&quot;, the assassin-mobster Vlad Taltos, gets involved in a mob war with another mob boss who is moving into his territory. But, as the mob war escalates, Vlad finds a deeper plot that could threaten the entire Empire. Fun ensues! Assassins and mobsters and wizards, oh my! What more could one ask for in a fantasy series? The Vlad Taltos novels are great fun and an interesting take on your &quot;average&quot; epic fantasy.Note: Yendi is the third novel (after Taltos and Dragon but before Jhereg) if your reading them in chronological order. It doesn't REALLY matter what order you read the Vlad Taltos novels in but, hey, I'm being helpful."},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"Steven Brust's Yendi is an even shorter novel than his first Vlad Taltos book, Jhereg, but that doesn't harm it in the least. Brust has a way of economizing words so that his plots seem a lot larger than they are. Brust also manages to give us even more backstory on the Dragaeran Empire and its political workings, the House of Dragon, and its relationship with the House of Jhereg. How he manages to pack all of this into a book, along with the plot itself, is a mystery to me, but he does it very well.This is a prequel to Jhereg, showing us, among other things, how Vlad met his wife, Cawti. It seems that a rival Jhereg boss, named Laris, is trying to move in on Vlad's territory. This basically sets up a war between the two of them, and things escalate to the point that the Empress sends in some of the Phoenix Guard to keep order. After being almost saved from one assassination attempt by his Dragon friends, Aliera and Morrolan, Aliera revives him as well as the two assassins (that's something that can often be done by the sorcery in the Empire) and Vlad learns that things are a lot more complicated than he had expected. Somebody's using Laris to further their own political ends, a conspiracy that could reach to the top of the Empire. And even worse, Vlad has fallen in love with the woman who killed him!I began reading this before realizing that Jhereg was written first, and while Yendi is certainly understandable without having read the first book, a lot of the background of the series is revealed in it. I quickly read the first one before coming back to this one, and I was much happier. That being said, it is a prequel, so we get to see how he met Cawti, which was quite surprising. Brust does a wonderful job with this relationship, making it so it doesn't really seem unusual. They find that they have a lot in common, and we get some personal detail on Vlad that tells us why he became an assassin. We knew that he hated Dragaerans but the reasons he became an assassin drive this point home. It was a nice touch, and I loved the scenes between them when he revealed himself to her.It amazes me how tight this novel is, considering the fact that it shifts gears in the middle to reveal the deeper and darker plot. The first part is basically concerned with the war between Vlad and Laris, and with the various assassination attempts. But when Vlad realizes that something else is going on, it really takes off and Vlad's mind is working faster than ours to figure out what is really happening, and who's behind it all. It's a tribute to Brust's characterizations that we can believe it when Vlad suspects that his Dragon friends may be behind some of it, because we can believe that they might be, even as we know they are Vlad's friends. As much loyalty as they have to Vlad, they are loyal to the Dragon House first, and when the plot quickly gets political, it wouldn't be that surprising to see them up to something.In fact, this showcases even more Vlad's isolation and how much he needs Cawti. Loiosh, his Jhereg familiar and friend, is the only sentient being that he feels he can totally trust, and their relationship is also brilliantly portrayed. The psionic bond between them (even though psionics are common with these people, and Vlad can pretty much communicate with anybody using them, his bond with Loiosh seems more special) makes for some interesting dialogues during scenes, such as when Vlad is wondering if Aliera could be behind the whole thing, and Loiosh tells him he's being too paranoid. Brust manages to make Loiosh very likable, loyal to Vlad but not afraid to talk back to him if he feels it's necessary. He's also Vlad's personal protector, which comes in handy a few times too.The plot is intricate (which isn't surprising, considering the ultimate plotter is a Yendi, and that's not a spoiler, because we don't find out who the Yendi is until Vlad does), but it does hang together. It seems to be a lot more convoluted than it needs to be, but evidently that's a trait of the Yendi, so it's not surprising. I'm glad that Vlad didn't figure out everything all at once, as I really don't like those mystery plots where one little piece of information all of a sudden brings the whole thing to light. Brust avoids that one, unlike the problem with Jhereg that I had. My only gripe with Yendi is that the Laris war almost becomes an afterthought, dealt with in a few pages at the end.After two books, I've become a big fan of Steven Brust, and I can't wait to read more of his stuff. Yendi is another winning addition in the Vlad Taltos saga, and it's small enough that it's also a quick read. Good for those of you with large \\"to-be-read\\" piles, that it won't take you very long. This one should be added to it.David Roy"},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"This entire series is incredible.

If you enjoy fantasy, sarcastic wit, twisting plots, and a cloak and dagger theme... Sit down for a page turner :) One thing that's extremely good to know about this series: There is no starting point, Steven Brust said so himself (I don't remember where, sorry). He also said the best place to start would be in the order of publication (So Jhereg would be a good place). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"Yendi delves into the backstory of Vlad Taltos, as he details how he came to be a player in the House of Jhereg, and bits and pieces about how he grew up and his life.He gets involved with a conflict with another Jhereg, Laris, and even worse than that Vlad and his associates discover that there is a plot by Sethra the Younger and the Sorceress in Green to put a Dragon Emperor on the throne, thus elevanting their own position.Vlad also falls had for Cawti, a human female thief with a dragonlord partner.Luckily, Sethra Lavode and Morrolan, with Vlad, Cawti and Norathar's help have the power to overcome."},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"I was completely enthralled with &quot;Jhereg,&quot; and eagerly began &quot;Yendi&quot; immediately upon finishing it, looking forward to once again being thoroughly immersed in the world Brust adeptly weaves around the reader. I was definitely not disappointed.I was a bit confused for the first few paragraphs, until I realized that &quot;Yendi&quot; is actually a prequel to &quot;Jhereg,&quot; taking place earlier in time. Vlad is just getting started in the organization, and naturally encounters some resistance in the process. While the formula is somewhat the same (mystery unravelled at the last second, after much intrigue set in fantasy world,) it works exceptionally well.Vlad's voice flows easily, and the words just kind of glide through the reader's head - as the pages turned, pictures and scenes formed in my head without my really being aware of having read the sentences. This is the mark of a truly gifted yarn-spinner. The same wit, humor, and clever banter that was so successful in &quot;Jhereg&quot; is liberally sprinkled through &quot;Yendi,&quot; as well, and the characters are highly-believable.The world Brust has created is vivid, and he doesn't go to extreme lengths to try to justify everything and explain all of the rules, spoon-feeding the reader, holding our hands through this thought processes; rather, he drops hints, and uses context to convey items of import. Sometimes, he flat out tells us &quot;it's none of your business,&quot; or &quot;that is a story for another time,&quot; or &quot;you really don't need to know all of it, but.&quot; It's great stuff, and I love his voice. He gives small nods to current culture icons such as Monty Python in places, and uses modern language instead of pained, stilted &quot;Hie thee hence, lass!&quot; &quot;Evermore, milady&quot; and other such stuffs, making it a much easier, more believable story and setting.A conflict within the House of Jhereg has Vlad being tossed hither, thither and yon, caught right up in the heart of things - would you expect anything less? In the process, he meets two of the land's best assassins, is killed by one of them, falls wildly in love, and of course hatches a plot so clever you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel.Loiosh has a bit more to say in this volume, but is still mostly confined to one-liners - I do wish Brust would give Vlad and his familiar a more substantial relationship. The co-stars in the story have depth, great lines, and play crucial parts in the Vlad's life and in the plot in general.A very entertaining next step in what will hopefully prove to be a great series. I'm tackling &quot;Teckla&quot; immediately!"},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"In which Vladimir Taltos, an assassin and minorcrime boss, has to defend his territory.

Yendi takes place in the earlier days of Taltos's life, and speaks of a major Jhereg war that he started. I liked the &quot;palace intrigue&quot;/behind the scenes power struggles that occurred throughout the book. I even had to sit down about halfway through just to catch up to what was going on, which i consider a good sign.There's even an amusing Monty Python reference hidden in there. Brust's writing style was getting better around this time, there is an improvement in style between this one and Jhereg. He fixes some of the details of the Taltos universe (for example, there are ways you can never be resurrected without using a soul killing dagger) and gets into character development, telling more about how Vlad's past made him the Boss he is today. Too bad its Brust's least favorite.So, if you liked the first one, and don't mind slightly-confusing tales of aristocratic power struggles, then definitely pick this one up."},{"Title":"Yendi","review":"Another excellent Vlad Taltos book.

It provides some interesting background on how the series' protagonist, Vlad, met his wife, and provides plenty of twists, turns and intrigue to go with it. However, I felt that of all the Taltos novels, this one was by far the weakest, with a forced plot, awkward dialogue and some truly silly things. This impression is heightened because the novels preceding (_Jhereg_) and following (_Teckla_) it are of much higher quality. On the other foot, Brust's worst is still a cut above most author's best.
