The story follows a young boy, Luke, who stumbles upon a group of witches plotting to kill all the children in the world with a formula that turns them into mouses! The grandmother of course knows about the witches and warns Luke. The leader of the witches is the grand high witch. No matter how many books I read on witches, this one takes the cake. I have never seen a book about real witches in the world. The movie was a lot better than the book, which is saying a lot! I have read this book over 20 times and I don't care for books. I have seen the movie over 100 times! One of the best stories of all times!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Oh, this book. It's one of the scariest books I've read, and I read it a long time ago. Much like the incredible The Thing movie, I thought that its power would diminish with age.. but having recently seen the Thing, and read Witches, I can say that I was wrong on both counts.It's a scary book, and the humor is the kind of humor that you might get from watching a drowning man fumbling for a stick to keep afloat in a raging whirlpool. In other words, you laugh because laughing is all you can do when you're helpless against the events that are transpiring beneath your nose.And oh, the noses those witches have... long, and curved, and able to smell a dirty child from yards away. The suspense that Dahl builds is incredible - when our protaganist is hiding, hoping that his unwashed body will not attract their attention... *shivers.*I've never seen the movie, and have no desire to.. the book is strong enough. The talk of a mouse's lifespan, the implications for the protaganist... looking back, re-reading this book, I have to say that it's one of my favorite books ever, not just my favorite Dahl ever."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"They are completely bald and always wear wigs, constantly sneaking hands underneath to scratch their itchy scalps. They don't have any toes and have really broad feet, but they force their feet into narrow, fashionable shoes to blend in. They have really long, curved fingernails that they usually hide by wearing gloves. They are the witches. And the meanest, nastiest witches live in England, where a boy has just gone to live with his grandmother after his parent's tragic death.His grandmother always warned the boy about suspecting nice women who offer him candy - check for gloves, wigs and pinched feet. He is able to avoid the witches until his grandmother becomes ill and they go to a seaside resort where the English witches are having a convention just like normal people in the hotel. Stunned, the boy overhears the grand witch's plot to eliminate all of the children in England by feeding them candy that will turn them into mice! When he is discovered, the boy knows that the witches are going to kill him, but they test the potion on him instead. Now in mouse form, the boy and his grandmother must use all of their wits and cleverness to defeat the witches' evil scheme!The Witches is a highly entertaining book by the always inventive Roald Dahl. You would think that a book about witches would be scary, but Roald Dahl has just the right combination of humor and lightheartedness to balance out the scariness. I loved this book when I was growing up and have enjoyed sharing it with my younger siblings and nephews. It is true that it has a couple of slow parts as the author takes the time to set up the story, but the storyline is just so imaginative that you get caught up in the story and don't really notice until you have read it a couple of times. With all of the many details, Roald Dahl can easily convince you that witches are real and that there really are women out there like that! Humor aside, it does show that you should never take candy from strangers - no matter what they look like! Although this book is great for reading alone, it is best when real aloud and shared with children, who always know the right parts to gasp at!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches is about a little orphaned boy who lives with his grandmother. Before bedtime each night his grandmother would tell him stories, and his favorite story was always about the Witches. His grandmother seemed to know everything about them and told him how to recognize and stay away from them. The boy never knew his grandmother to lie, so he listened and followed her advice on the subject. When the boy finds out that Witches really do exist, his grandmother's advice comes in handy to help the little boy escape them for a long period time, but they eventually catch up to him half way through the book and turn him into a mouse. You would think that this would be a very sad thing, but the boy loves being a mouse. Actually while reading this book to my five and seven year old daughters, the youngest one said that she thought being a mouse would be a very neat thing and asked if it was possible for me to turn her into one. I told her that even if I could I wouldn't since I would miss having my little girl too much. As a mouse the boy realizes he can do a lot of things he couldn't have done otherwise if he was still a little boy, so with the help of his grandmother they comes up with a plan to get rid of all the witches in England. It was a great story. Unlike Roald Dahl's other books which touch upon scary subject's but in a humorous way, this one without a doubt is trying to scare your kids. Rather then giving my girls nightmares however, it was more along the lines of them listening to a good ghost story around the fire while you are away at camp, and they just found it very entertaining. Quintin Blake once again drew some wonderful illustrations to capture the action which added to the story."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"A young boy's parents who dies in a car crash and he has to go and live with his grandma in Norway.

I loved it, and so did he; he has now read it twice. Dahl is a wonderful children's author for many reasons, but one of the biggest is that he doesn't talk down to his readers. The topic may be shocking or scary or confusing (witches, e.g.), but Dahl does not pretend that there is nothing to fear. Which is why, to an eight-year-old child, a book like this is a revelation; the child is being addressed as a confidant, an equal.

He is, to my mind, without a doubt one of the most imaginative human beings to ever live. He manages to write children's books that adults also love; books that are best categorized as \\"odd\\" yet also somehow timeless and classic.The Witchesis one that I had actually never read as a child - I picked it up at a used book sale recently and decided it was long past time I read it. And I was not disappointed. Dahl has a rare gift - the ability to turn an adult into a child again simply through the use of words. He paints his world so evocatively - his descriptions of the trials and tribulations of being a more-than-usually-clever child trapped in a more-than-usually-challenging adult world make it possible for even the most grown-up grown up to remember what it is to be small and uncertain and reliant on others. I, for one, will never look at \\"ordinary women\\" entirely the same again..."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Roald Dahl is a wonderful author, and I've read many of his books. This is definitely a good book, and if you've seen and enjoyed the movie, be sure to check out the book. The movie does a great visualization of the book, but the book contains a few details the movie is lacking in, and it's always best to check out the book any movie came from! The witches are presented in an amusing way - this story does have a few scary bits and is not appropriate for young children, but it is definitely appropriate for school-age children (and adults, too!)"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I purchased this book for the purpose of reading it allowed to my daughter who is 5.

We really really enjoyed this book and will be looking for his other works."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This is the third Roald Dahl book I have read. The first was called Matilda, and I think it is his most famous. I have also read George's Marvelous Medicine. The Witches is a funny book and has wonderful drawings.The witches in this book wore wigs and pointed shoes to hide their bald heads and square feet with no toes! The witches in this book had eyes that changed colours, and were mean and mischivious. The witches in this book where cruel to children and turned them into mice. They live in a castle in Norway. The other characters in this story are a grandmother, her 7-year-old grandson, and the grandson's friend, Bruno. The witches were having a meeting in the hotel where the others where staying.

Craziness ensues when the boy comes face to face with the real-life witches.It's hard not to love Roald Dahl. He was one of my favorite authors growing up. He is witty and tells a fun story. The Witches is no exception. Dahl has a clever imagination and children love him because he is endears children and elderly people, who are often looked over members of society. The Witches is an amusing and fun read. It also contains a sweet story of love between grandson and his grandmother.Roald Dahl may be pro-children and elderly, but he is somewhat anti-adult. Other than the grandmother, adults in The Witches are portrayed as evil, fat and stupid, ridiculous or dead. There are also some pretty graphic ideas presented- e.g. witches killing children by turning them into creatures and smashing them. I don't remember this greatly affecting me as a child, but I found it a little disturbing now."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches is a scary story about the lives of real witches. The author is Roald Dahl. My favorite part is when the boy thinks of a plan to deal with the witches. (I wish I could tell you more details, but that would give away the story!)

TadiparthyPeriod: 5In the beginning of this book there is a little boy who loses his parents in a car accident when he is about 7 years old. Then he gets sent to his Grandma to live with her. After a couple of days his grandma receives a letter that is actually the little boy's dad's will paper. When she says that they have to move back to his old house he gets mad. He knows his grandma doesn't like to leave her house, but he still goes because he has no other choice. When they get to their new house the grandma tells the little boy all about witches. She tells him how to recognize them and what they are like. Then the little boy goes wandering in their hotel and he finds a room where a meeting is going on. When he looks in the room their are a whole bunch of women standing there. He seems interested so he crawls in and hides behind a wall. When the women come and lock the door the boy gets a little scared. He is afraid that they will find him. The ladies take of all of their things and to the little boy's surprise, all the women are witches. They are having their yearly meeting about how to get rid of nasty little children. Witches think kids smell like dog droppings and their main mission in life is to kill all kids. This year the grand kid made a potion to change all the kids into mice. The little boy gets found and the witches change him into a mouse. When he finally escapes, as a mouse, he goes to his grandma and tells her all about it. He can still talk because his body was only changed. His grandma gets all scared, but he calms her down. Then the little boy comes up with a plan to turn all the witches into mice. He goes in the witches room and gets a bottle of the potion. Then, he and his grandma go to the dining area. He scurries into the kitchen where the witches food is being made. He dumps all the potion in each and everyone's bowl. He gets caught, but luckily, he escapes to his grandma. They then watch as the witches eat their food and turn into mice. His grandma and him move back to their old house and decide to spend the rest of their lives looking for and killing witches with the potion.I liked this book because it was very funny. One part that I found amusing was when the boy said, \\"Grandma, I want to be a mouse.\\" I found this funny because they also mentioned that he wants to be a mouse so that he doesn't have to go to school and take tests. He just has to stay home. He also wants to be a mouse so that he can go anywhere and do anything whenever he wants.Another part that I found funny was when all the witches turned into mice. They said, \\"What&#65533;s happening to me? AH!!!!!\\" This part was funny to me because all of the 89 witches turned into witches at the same time. When the witches turned into mice everyone started screaming in high pitch voices. They also ran around in circles like they were maniacs.My favorite part of the book was when the mouse went in the witches room looking for the potion. I liked because it was very interesting. It told the reader that witches are smart. They don't hide something like that anywhere. Actually, she hid it under the mattress. She made a small hole and put them there. The mouse found it because his grandma told him everything about witches."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The setting for this magnificent story is in England.

I admit that Roald Dahl's themes and sense of humor are edgy, but that's what makes his books so enjoyable to children. While a lot of children's books are written in a syrupy-sweet, sterilized style, Witches has a taboo, cigar-smoking grandma with a missing thumb who tells her grandson that the only way he can stay safe from witches is to never take a bath. It's refreshing. And, as with most of Dahl's books, the main character is a bright, tough, lovable kid who children can enjoy rooting for.Also, I've noticed that almost every one-star review is by a Pagan who thinks she owns the word \\"witch\\" and is offended that the author decided to use the word to describe a creature that is entirely different from herself. Lighten up, ladies. I don't think Roald Dahl was talking about you when he wrote this book."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Witches is one of the best books I've ever read.

It was included in a basket of elementary teachers' favorite books, that I won at a silent auction. I had seen it around, but always assumed that it must be relatively safe, in a PC-sorta way. Otherwise, it would not be found in the public schools!So, I read it, enjoyed it, and came away glad that there are still some edgy books like this still in the public schools. Fairy tales like \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" may be revised to remove the violence and unfavorable portrayals of wolves as \\"big\\" and \\"bad.\\" But what's this? A book about witches, in which they are presented in such a way as to make Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West of Oz fame, a minor leaguer!Had the past thirty years not transpired, and I were able to read the book for the first time, say, in 1979, when I was just out of high school; a time before Ronald Reagan was President; before text messaging and extreme sports; before 24-7 news coverage of all the gory details of life on Earth; before political correctness; but mostly, before the aggressive modern movement to remove the frightening and disturbing image of witches (that makes them so much fun as children's book bad guys) . . . I could have read this book and enjoyed it in innocent pleasure.But no - I have lived through the past thirty years, and with every turn of the page the thought crossed my mind: \\"How did this make it past the censors into our schools?\\" or - \\"Has our elementary principal even read this?\\"Hmmm - in these times of excessive protection of children from stories that might scare them, and of relentless pressure to be careful not to offend anybody . . . why is this book still in print?Oh well, it is in print, and I rejoice that it is! There is still one book out there, for CHILDREN, with scary, disgusting witches that do unimaginably horrible things to children. There is still a book in which one of the heroes (the grandmother), smokes. And right out there on the sleeve, is the concept of mortality and that things do not always turn out right. But the human spirit survives despite all this. Yes, in the midst of this terrible tale of images that no modern writer could get away with, children may learn the most important lesson of all: stuff happens. Now choose to be happy anyway.So get out there and read this book if you haven't. . . . Before they take it away!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I bought this for a gift for my 7 year old Goddaughter who absolutly loved it!! It came really quickly in the mail and it was on time for her birthday."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches is an old favorite that I've been reading and rereading since elementary school. You just can't go wrong with Dahl and The Witches is my absolute favorite of all his children's stories. It's a fun romp taking place in our own world where REAL WITCHES exist.Witches, in Dahl's story, are vicious, dangerous and bloodthirsty creatures who hate children with unmatched fury and whose dearest desire is to wipe them all off the face of the earth. There goal is to do away with one child a week and the worst part is that they look just like ordinary women. But there are certain signs, as our unnamed, seven year-old narrator's grandmother informs us, that can help you tell a real witch from an ordinary lady. And it just so happens that the ladies of Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, staying at the same seaside hotel as our hero and his grandmother, display all the signs.This original, quirky little book is perfect for readers of all ages. It has just the right amount of scary details to fascinate a child reader without being to creepy to give them nightmares (such as when Grandmamma tells about a little girl she knew who, after a run-in with witches, became a still figure in an oil painting that grew old and eventually faded away) and enough creative and ingenious details to hold an adult reader's interest.If you missed out on The Witches growing up, it's not too late! Grab a copy and enjoy the sheer imaginativeness of Dahl's writing."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I have to admit I actually have no idea this book exist. I actually thought the movie was an original and not a book adaptation. Nevertheless it was a pleasant surprise to actually read this book and it wasn't a let down either since it's the first time ever for me to read one of Roald Dahl's work.The main character is an orphaned 7 years old boy who lives with his grandmother who happens to know more than she should, of the secret world of witches. Not any other witches, children hating witches who wish to get rid of them from the face of the earth! He found himself trapped in a roomful of them while he was on a vacation with his grandmother. He watched as all of the describing given by his grandmother about witches comes true right infront of his eyes, while he is safely tucked behind the sceen out from their sight - but wait!

Armed with that, a grandmother that's an expert with the knowledge of witches and himself being as clever as a mouse, they have quite an adventure trying to foil the witches evil scheme.Quite an interesting story the characters pull you in with the pace of the plots.

When Grandmamma gets pneumonia, they have to cancel their trip to Norway and go to the south coast of England instead, like the nurse recommended. Since he is not allowed to play with his mice at the hotel, he finds somewhere where no one is watching him. He goes in to the ballroom where the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children will be held. While teaching his mice tricks, a large group of ladies come in, but they were not women, they were witches.There is no obvious theme or message of this book.Roald Dahl does o good job keeping the reader interested. It is hard to put the book down. He also wrote an interesting beginning and ending. He could do a better job of describing the characters though.Overall, \\"The Witches\\" is a fantastic book. I would recommend it to younger children. It is more of a children's book. If you like fantasies or other Roald Dahl books, then you should read \\"The Witches\\". The author did a great job, but he could have been more descriptive.-Alana"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"wow, I really liked this book it really is creative and i love the characters. I suggest this book for all ages, and for teachers reading to their students."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches, by Roald Dahl, is a wonderful book of how a seven year old boy and his grandma try to take on every witch in England. Of course there are only a few ways to tell if your nice next-door neighbor is just a friendly woman or an evil witch. But don't worry, this book gives you all the information that the professionals have gathered to give you an idea of what to do if there's a situtation where you think your neighbor is a witch or not. It will give you all the needed information to make a good choice and run, or just eat another cookie.Witches aren't just in England though....this is a global problem! These evil creatures have spread out all over the world. From Norway to the U.S.A, witches are everywhere. these witches are clever though, so taking them out won't so easy for our main characher and his grandma. This book is filled with twist so you'll never know what to expect. As far as the terrible Formula 86 delayed-action-mouse-maker to Bruno, the boy who can't stop eating, this book will have you begging for this page to end and for the next to start.The Witches is a fun and adventerous book that will easily peak your interest with the first words. It will definitely make it on your top 10 books list. Roald Dahl has also done other books, but this one takes the cake. He's really gone out of his way for you to have fun. If you've never read any of his books, jump into his world where the sky isn't high enough to be the limit."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I thought this book was amazing.

SO BEWARE!!!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Roald Dahl has written some of the best kid's books on the planet. Anyone who grew up (or isgrowing up) without them is likely to now be a cynical bore worrying about money, dignity andtheir weight. Fortunately, most of us have read at least a couple of his books (probablyCharlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, or the BFG) and have been exposedto a really hilarious and very sweet world. The Witches is one his best books. It's prettygross in a juvenile/toilet kind of way, like a lot of his others, but this one is evennastier than usual. Apparently Dahl knew how to read kid's minds. It's just as fun as anythingcan get, it's worth laughing over and crying over and reading in one ecstatic sitting."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I highly recommend The Witches to the young and old alike. It is a masterpiece of a book because it is sowed with layers of humor and philosophical seeds that each age group will fin and positively grown from. I've realized how Roald Dahl's writings have positively affected me after going over his works a decade after I read them for the first time in 5th grade.The Witches is about a child and his grandmother who has had an encounter with witches and thus explains to her grandson how to avoid these women (who look just like ordinary women but have blue spit, no toes, wear gloves to hide their claws and itchy wigs to hide their bald heads). Because of Grandma's sickness, the two go to stay in a hotel on the coast of England where it just so turns out that hundreds of these child-despising witches are holding their national conference to announce the plan to wipe out the existence of \\"dog dropping\\" smelling children by turning them into mice! The adventurous outcome, which I won't reveal, is very humorous and unexpected.The plot is both attractive and fascinating because it is out of this Disney perfect world. Because of this I think kids get the feeling like they've got their hands on something really hot and this gives them a lot of excitement and sparks their imagination. They're used to hearing about how witches get crushed under houses from Kansas and how terrible it is to smoke. And then they come across this book in which witches get away with hating kids and Grandma often offers her grandson a hit off her cigar. They're used to reading books written by authors who write very dryly and with vocabulary words that one may find on a college entrance exam. But Roald Dahl writes in a language that is enlivened by hilarious tongue-twisting and silly vulgar words, and most importantly, it is a language understandable by (but not limited to) children.For those parents who may have doubts in Roald Dahl because some of his books were banned by anal, unhappy, conservative, old librarians, from personal experience I'd like to say that his books will not only have a positive impact on the fortunate read, but that there is even a glowing difference between Dahl-readers and non-Dahl readers. I can't stress the importance of having a child, (or you as well if you haven't already) read Dahl books. Because of Dahl's creative language, imaginative and ironic plot, his books work like magical fertilizer that kids are nourished by. Once a child has experienced a Roald Dahl book his/her mind begins to open up and bloom, it's inspired to invent, create and accept all but to believe all with a grain of salt. They will become aware and be more likely to appreciate the multicolored reality of a world in which we live in and where everything and anything is possible. I can't think of more positive values for a child to grow on. If you don't understand what good an open-mind and imagination do, let me tell you that most vile acts that take place in this world are caused by narrow-minded people who's imagination was never inspired to look beyond their own desires and who, most likely and unfortunately, were deprived of Roald Dahl as a child."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I would give The Witches a 5.

It is clear that the author is writing from a point of view of ignorance and hate. It promotes stereotypes and the hatred that results from his uneducated opinion. No matter what your views on Paganism might be, this book also celebrates misogyny. Children are prompted to be suspicious and distrustful of their female teachers and even their mothers. This is a loathesome way for the author to sell his uninformed opinions to the public - through children."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Myself I'm atheist and don't believe in anything supernatural. I'm a very free thinker and have a keen sense of humor. Nonetheless I find Dahl's book to be offensive on multiple levels. Firstly, this book disparages women. The book states \\"Only women can be witches\\" and all witches are actively engaged in harming/killing children. Secondly, as stated by others here, there are many people who [think they] practice magic, some even to the degree of a religion, lifestyle or profession. I don't believe that there is magic, but it is a person's right to believe in magic and express that if they choose. It is spiteful to vilify them. Thirdly, some impressionable children will actually believe this crap or get nightmares, or it might get wedged into the subconscious as a lifelong fear. Dahl is instilling irrational superstitious fears into some of his readers/listeners. Fourthly, there are many wonderful stories of fiction in which witches can be a force for good. Do not let Dahl pollute your child's imaginations against such other stories.Perhaps Dahl would say \\"Take it easy. It's all supposed to be fun.\\" Yeah, minstrels in blackface said that, too.What motivated Dahl to write this book? Is he a misogynist? Does he hate his mother? Is he jealous of women? Compensating for something?"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"They're mean, nasty, evil creatures who hate children more than anything. No, they're not your older sibling, they're witches! In Roald Dahl's book, The Witches you can read the truth behind these terrible villains who look like normal women but really are a danger to children all over the world.The story takes place in Grandmamma's house in Norway, and in The Hotel Magnificent in modern day England. The main character is an orphaned boy whose Grandmamma tells him true stories of witches who try to rid the earth of children. He is afraid of witches, but he must be brave and determined when during a seaside vacation he discovers himself in the same hotel as all the witches in England!I definitely liked this book for once again; Roald Dahl takes a normal fairytale element and reveals the truth behind it in a hilarious way. I recommend this book to any fans of Dahl, fantasy, or humorous books."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This book is an action/mystery book by the great author, Roald Dahl. The pictures are done by the wonderful Quentin Blake.The little boy in this book lives with his grandmother in England after a very sad car crash that killed his parents. Every night she tells her grandson about witches, a subject she knows a lot about. The little boy soon becomes very cautious around women, for witches and women look a lot alike. For his summer vacation, they are planning a trip to Norway. Unfortunately, the grandmother gets very sick. Instead, they have to go to a nearby hotel in England. In the hotel, the grandmother gives the boy two white mice who he names William and Mary. While he is training his mice behind a screen in the ballroom, a large group of women come in to the room. While he watches quietly, he finds out these \\"women\\" are actually witches! What happens next? Read the book to find out!I think that in most of Roald Dahl's books he uses great word choice. In all of his books he uses wonderful voice. He puts so much feeling into his writing. Some of his sentences are confusing, but that is just because he is from England.

One day a witch catches the two boys in her room, and she turns them into rats.This book is fun to read when you like being scared silly.

It was the day our teacher started reading us &quot;The Witches&quot;, a popular book by Roald Dahl. A few days later I bought it and started reading. I would call this, next to &quot;The BFG&quot;, Dahl's worst book. First of all, how could they kill every kid in the world, while there was only 85 of them?(in England, at least.) Secondly, we never find out Our Hero's name, not even his parents or grandmama! Thirdly, a mouse? Stupid. If you want &quot;real Dahl&quot;, read the books that most people call &quot;Dahl's Greatest&quot;: &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and &quot;Matilda&quot;.

Would your child like a book about how Christians or Hindus or Buddhists or Druids are child-hating, deceiving people? I think not. Children are impressionable and it is up to you to show tolerance rather than ignorance. Educate yourself."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"What do kids like, according to Roald Dahl? They love being spooked, he once said. They love suspense. They love action. They love ghosts. They love chocolates and toys and money. They love magic. They love being made to giggle. That's very much true, and this Dahl classic has a little bit of everything that makes a good story. You know that just from reading the first paragraph, which reads:&quot;In fairy tales witches always wear silly black hats and black cloaks and they ride on broomsticks. But this is not a fairy tale. This is about REAL WITCHES. REAL WITCHES dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women. They live in ordinary houses and they work in ordinary jobs. That is why they are so hard to catch.&quot;As with many of Dahl's best books, the main character must stop evil beings from doing something awfel to children! (For example: Matilda must use her powers to stop The Trenchbull from doing horrid things to her pupils in MATILDA, his last work. In THE BFG, Sophie must help The Big Friendly Giant rid the world of evil kid-eating giants.) And here, an English/Norweigen boy and his all-knowlegeable grandmother must stop all the witches in England from turning all the children into mice, even at their own personal expense.There were only four minor things wrong with this book, and here I will describe them for you:1. SMOKING--Grandmama smokes cigars regularly, especially when she is telling her grandson about the witches. While it does describe the cigars as discusting, this is not enough. There should not be smoking in a children's book, especially a Roald Dahl.2. THE END--The end of this book sets up the plot for a sequel. (If you've read it, you know what I mean.) But, strangly enough, there is NO SEQUEL. This may enrage kids (and adults!) who, upon reading the ending, were anticapating finding the other book and reading about Grandmama and her grandson's further dealings with witches (or &quot;vitches&quot;, as The Grand High Witch says in this book.)3. NAMELESSNESS--The main character has no name! He is either refured to as &quot;you&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;grandson&quot;. Now that is disturbing!4. BONDING--Grandmama and Grandson are bonded here like no grandmother and son could ever really bond (I think so, anyway). In this way it's a bit unrealistic. But then again, if you want realisim, you're thinking about the wrong book. Dahl's masterworks are always so zany and weird--that's what you come to expct from him if you're a loyal Dahl fan.Well, there you have it. Except for those three things--great! This book is &quot;a fast-moving, well-paced adventure that children will undoubtably love.&quot; (School Library Journal). While foes of magic (and any real witches who must keep their secrets secret) will surely despise this books exsistance, ALL US ROALD DAHL FANS SHOUT HOORAY! (adapted from the last line on page 87)."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This book reminds me of a movie called Hocus-pocus. That night, after the movie, I was so scared, I wet the bed. That movie is kind of like this book, but the book is funnier. This was a daring story about a boy who lost his parents in a car accident. After that tragedy, he lived with his grandmother in Norway. Every night his grandmother told him real stories about real witches. Like how you can tell a witch from a real woman. Witches, she says, have big nostrils, wears gloves or have blue spit. He believes his grandmother's stories. In the summer, he and his grandma went on a trip to a hotel in England. There in the hotel he finds witches having a meeting. The meeting was about a deadly formula called &quot;Delayed Action Mouse Maker&quot;. Together, he and his grandma go through a lot of danger and excitement to steal the formula from the witches to save the world's children. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes action and suspense. Plus, it's amusing to read."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"We read this book as a read-aloud. We loved this book! It was funny because the boy as a mouse swings around the kitchen by his tail and then it gets chopped off. Bruno, the other boy/mouse is a funny character because he keeps shoving food in his mouth all the time. We liked when the all 84 of the witches got changed into mice. It was great to see the boy get even with the withes by using the secret formula.

The thing you offended Pagans are missing is this; that right-minded people- of whom there are many- make a DISTINCTION between 'Wicked Witch of the West' witches in the media and real Wiccans. They can realize that Witches are actual human beings!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"a wonderful book. both very cute and pretty funny.suitable for all ages. i am in my late 20s and I enjoyed it very much. not sure if it's good for kids under 10 due to the somewhat complex vocabulary."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches by Roald Dahl is a tale about real Witches. Witches who hate children. A boy and his grandmother go on vacation after his grandmother is ill and have a run in with The Grand High Council of Witches. They have come up with a potion to turn all children into mice. The boy and his friend Bruno and his Grandmother have to stop them before they can turn all the children into mice.My daughter Katelyn read this book and loved it. She looked forward to finding out what was going to be next every day. She loved the descriptions of the witches so much that she told me about them and even wrote a journal entry about how to tell a real witch from a regular woman.Appropriateness: This book is very creepy and like all Dahl books there is a bit of twisted disturbing humor involved in the end. The book has a kind of happy ending but it's not as picture perfect as most children's books. This is not a book for kids who scare easily or have a problem figuring out reality from fiction. For kids who like scary and weird stories this book is great. The lexile is 740 putting it at a mid fourth grade level, guided reading level R.

Filled with laughs and excitement...you and your children will be on the edge of your seat or falling off with laughter!!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers who have given this book a low rating, I'm not going to complain about the appropriateness of this book for children. The fact is that most children are much tougher-minded than we necessarily would like to believe. Many, if not most, children I've known have a somewhat twisted sense of humor, and nevertheless have grown up into compassionate and rational adults. Children are far more discerning than most of us give them credit for. The highly sensitive or imaginative children who may find this book a bit too scary aren't likely to pick up a book about witches anyway. My one precaution would be that this is NOT a book for children too young or immature to know the difference between fantasy and reality - but any child whose vocabulary, reading level, and attention span are equal to tacking this novel is almost certainly advanced enough to handle it.I can't say I didn't enjoy \\"The Witches\\" at all. I did. But it failed to captivate and delight me as some of Dahl's other children's books have done. I very much enjoyed \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and \\"Matilda\\" is one of my all-time favorites. \\"The Witches,\\" however, was just a little too silly for my tastes. I expect more wit and cleverness from Dahl. The premise is intriguing, and the beginning is fun to read, but once the actual witches made an appearance in the story, I found it increasingly difficult to suspend my disbelief. The conflict is fairly predictable, and the story itself is drawn out far longer than it needs to be; the novel could easily be trimmed by about 50 to 75 pages without losing anything important.Of course, the target audience for this novel may well appreciate its silliness, but even as a child I believe I would have felt let down by this one. It's not a bad book by any means, but if you really want to appreciate Roald Dahl's trademark twisted wit, pick up \\"Charlie\\" or \\"Matilda\\" instead."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"it's my favorite middle grade book of all time, so we can dispense with the review and get straight to craft. I don't think any children's book ever had a greater beginning than The Witches, so I've decided to reproduce the first page and a half in its entirety:A Note About WitchesIn fairy-tales, witches always wear silly black hats and black cloaks, and they ride on broomsticks.But this is not a fairy-tale. This is about REAL WITCHES.The most important thing you should know about REAL WITCHES is this. Listen very carefully. Never forget what is coming next.REAL WITCHES dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women. They live in ordinary houses and they work in ORDINARY JOBS.That is why they are so hard to catch.A REAL WITCH hates children with a red-hot sizzling hatred that is more sizzling and red-hot than any hatred you could possibly imagine.A REAL WITCH spends all her time plotting to get rid of the children in her particular territory. Her passion is to do away with them, one by one. It is all she thinks about the whole day long. Even if she is working as a cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman or driving round in a fancy car (and she could be doing any of these things), her mind will always be plotting and scheming and churning and burning and whizzing and phizzing with murderous bloodthirsty thoughts.\\"Which child,\\" she says to herself all day long, \\"exactly which child shall I choose for my next squelching?\\"A REAL WITCH gets the same pleasure from squelching a child as you get from eating a plateful of strawberries and thick cream.She reckons on doing away with one child a week. Anything less than that and she becomes grumpy.One child a week is fifty-two a year. Squish them and squiggle them and make them disappear......She might even--and this will make you jump--she might even be your lovely school-teacher who is reading these words to you at this very moment. Look carefully at that teacher. Perhaps she is smiling at the absurdity of such a suggestion. Don't let that put you off. It could be part of her cleverness.I am not, of course, telling you for one second that your teacher actually is a witch. All I am saying is that she might be one. It is most unlikely. But--and here comes the big \\"but\\"--it it not impossible.Wow, right? Just wow. I don't know of a child whose attention this wouldn't grab. Most young children have not consciously been introduced to conspiracy theories. They're still learning the way the world officially works--aren't we all--let alone how some would claim it works in secret. And yet, children are lied to on a regular basis and at some point they begin to pick up on it.For those children, here is Roald Dahl, an adult willing to say things, metaphorically, it's true, that reveal the world as it is within the relatively safe context of a story. Children are told that adults are nice, that public officials are just and have their best interest at heart (some do), and that they are safe. Adults tell children this because we wish it were true and we reason that they'll have plenty of time to worry over the truth in adulthood.But Dahl says that there are adults, who appear in many ways just like other adults, who want to harm and even murder children. And to be fair, there are. But lest we become morbid, let us focus on harm. I had a grade school teacher who routinely separated children by class. The children from wealthy families who this teacher wanted to associate with were put into special programs and given preferential treatment. The children, like me, who were not, were made to know their place in society from an early age. This was a woman who meant to harm children, but who received several teaching awards and appeared a normal adult to other adults. My father-in-law could tell you stories about the way his White teachers treated him in Mississippi in the 1960s that would make Dahl's witches seem harmless by comparison.In every generation, there are these adults who are bad, and often other adults cannot see it. So long as there are children and adults, there will be this problem, and so The Witches is likely to stay relevant forever. Fortunately, Dahl gives us some clues as to how we can spot them:\\"...a REAL WITCH is certain always to be wearing gloves when you meet her...\\"...Because she doesn't have finger-nails. Instead of finger-nails, she was thin curvy claws, like a cat, and she wears the gloves to hide them.\\"\\"A REAL WITCH always wears a wig to hide her baldness. She wears a first-class wig. And it is impossible to tell a really first-class wig from ordinary hair unless you give it a pull to see if it comes off... you can't go round pulling at the hair of every lady you meet, even if she is wearing gloves. Just you try it and see what happens.\\"\\"Witches have slightly larger nose-holes than ordinary people. The rim of each nose-hole is pink and curvy, like the rim of a certain kind of sea-shell... A REAL WITCH has the most amazing powers of smell.. An absolutely clean child give off the most ghastly stench to a witch... The dirtier you are, the less you smell.\\"\\"Look carefully at the eyes, because the eyes of a REAL WITCH are different from yours and mine. Look in the middle of each eye where there is normally a little black dot. If she is a witch, the black dot will keep changing colour, and you will see fire and you will see ice dancing right in the very centre of the coloured dot. It will send shivers running all over your skin.\\"\\"Witches never have toes... They have just feet... The feet have square ends with no toes on them at all.\\"\\"Their spit is blue.\\"To this day, I do not trust a woman in gloves. I check to see if she has a wig or if her spit is blue or if she has difficulty walking due to a lack of toes. Next week, I'll return to short reviews, but as this is my only post this week and my favorite book, we're going to go a little long.The main character in The Witches, who is also our narrator, is never given a name--a trick that would certainly not work in every book, but is fantastic here. He is a young boy whose parents die--of course they do, this is Roald Dahl and the man just had no patience for parents--and is sent to live with his Grandmamma, a plump old bird who smokes cigars (inspired):\\"Would you like a puff on my cigar?\\" she said.\\"I'm only seven, Grandmamma.\\"\\"I don't care what age you are,\\" she said. \\"You'll never catch a cold if you smoke cigars.\\"Grandmamma is a witch expert and tells our hero all he needs to know to spot witches and comforts him after a near witch attack. And then the story takes a seemingly unrelated turn. The two are looking forward to a vacation in Norway when Grandmamma contracts pneumonia, so they have to settle for a more subdued trip to Hotel Magnificent. It is imperative to the plot that our protagonists travel there, but why doesn't Dahl just have them head there in the first place? Wouldn't that save time? Perhaps, but Dahl is a master, as I've said, and he is focused on two things: character development and misdirection.We feel for this nameless boy who has lost his parents and now might lose his Grandmamma as well. But more important is the misdirection. Roger Ebert once said in a review of The Exorcist that the reason that film is so scary is that it does not want to be a horror movie, meaning that the characters were so well rounded and so focused on their individual lives that even if the scary stuff never came in, they could still have a fascinating story on their own. The detective in The Exorcist was also the basis for Columbo, and he was interesting for season after season without a single possession case to investigate.Horror doesn't work when the characters are nothing more than monster bait waiting around with no purpose except to be menaced at the appropriate time. In order to be effective, a writer must interest us in and compel us to care for their characters and their situation before the monsters come. We care about Grandmamma and her ward and their journey to The Hotel Magnificent is interesting on its own without need of any witches. They get into a scuffle with the hotel manager and the boy trains white mice for a future circus and it is interesting. Just when we would be content to read a story about a boy and his Grandmamma and their travels with a mouse circus, just when things are interesting enough and the reader is comfortable and enjoying a nice story, that is when Dahl and his monsters attack.While our hero is training his mice at the back of a ball room, hidden lest he be discovered with mice by management, the room fills up with a meeting for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Our hero is unable to get out and so must sit through their meeting. And all of those in the meeting are women. Women wearing gloves and hats with slightly irregular nostrils. And do those women eventually smell our hero at the back of the room? I won't say, but I must tell you that this sequence is the most scared I have ever been when reading a book as it was my first real brush with true horror.And that's where we'll leave it. If you're looking for a scary book to read this Halloween, this is the one for you. If you're just looking for a great book for anytime, this is the one for you. I have one more point to make, but I'm going to finish the review here as I have to spoil the book to make it.And now, my last point, which is filled with spoilers. If you haven't read The Witches, stop reading now. Seriously. I'm going to ruin it. Okay, I warned you. My most frequent complaint with horror fiction for kids as a kid was that much of it was condescending. The monsters weren't really scary, they were just lonely. Or the vampire bunny sucked the juice out of veggies instead of people (I love that book, but it isn't scary). No one in those books every really got hurt, and so whatever the monster, it was an empty threat. And even as a child, I knew people did sometimes get hurt and to say otherwise was a lie. Not so with Dahl. He told a great truth within the lie of fiction.The children in this story do get hurt and hurt bad. Several are murdered--in fantastical ways, sure, but still. One boy is drowned by his own father (again, under fantastical circumstances, but still). If I hadn't already talked for so long, we'd explore that event more in depth, but I believe it is one of Dahl's sharpest critiques of parenting. And finally, the protagonist does not come away unscathed. If you've seen the movie version where he gets made into a real boy again, well, that's Hollywood. But Dahl's tale ends with him accepting his impending death within a few years. Harsh, but, but, BUT, true.This is the point that will forever divide readers, I suppose. Some adults will think including these elements in a children's story to be reprehensible. If I read the book for the first time now, I might even agree with them. But when I read this book as a child it endeared Dahl to me forever. Here was a writer brave enough to write the truth and I hung to his every word thereafter because adults lie, but I knew I could trust him."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"\\"A real witch is wasily the most dangerous of all living creatures. \\"But, if real witches disguise themselves rather than flying around on broomsticks in pointed hats, how can you tell when you meet one?Roald Dahl's book The Witches was a wild tale about a boy and his grandma and witches that send them on an adventure. The story starts with the boy living with his parents in England. During Christmas, he travels to Norway to live with his grandma. One day the boy and his parents get into a car crash and his parents do not survive. Based on their wishes, the boy goes to live with his grandma. It's here where the boy encounters his first witch. These witches were not \\"normal\\" as we know them; they wore wigs, have no toes, and their eyes are different than a normal woman. These witches also hate children. When the boy and his grandma decide to take a trip, they encounter these witches at a convention in the same hotel they are staying. The boy hides out in one of their meetings and soon learns that they are all here turn the children of England into mice. The boy hears the plan and the recipe of the poison. Before he could sneak out, the witches catch him and they try out their poison on him. The boy sure enough turns into a mouse. The boy and his grandma have an adventure ahead of them to try and stop these witches from turning all the children into mice.Dahl sets the stage very well in this book because he puts the reader right in the middle of the action. This book is set in 20th century England so Dahl uses dialogue between the boy and his grandma that pertains to this era. He is very descriptive with his language and paints a vived picture in the minds of his readers.This books falls into the fantasy genre because it contains magic from the poison and the witches that create it. This story could never happen but it is a good book for children to use their imagination and expand their creativity. This book might be a bit scary for some younger children, but for the most part it is a fun book that can further children's thinking.I thoroughly enjoyed this book because Dahl gives us a fun story about very interesting characters. Dahl provides an opportunity for children to learn a little about the past through a young boy's adventure because Dahl brings his readers into the action. Even though this story is fictional, it provides a different aspect for children to read. Personally, i love to read about witches and other fictional characters because it provides insight and learning in another aspect than our own. This makes children able to predict and think critically about what might happen and what actually does happen; It provides a chance for creativity.*Mentioned on his official website, Dahl bases the grandmother character in his own mother.Dahl also wrote most all of his books in a small hut that was behind his house."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I enjoyed this book because the witches were funny. I liked how they got rid of the children. My favorite character was the grandson because he was very smart.

It is a fiction novel. The book was good. The book had a lot of excitement and a little bit of suspense to it. The characters were described very vividly. You could picture them in your head as you read the book.One of my favorite parts of this book was when the Grand High Witch turned Bruno Jenkins into a mouse. Dahl described the transformation perfectly. He outlined every detail. From the hair on the tip of his ears to the very end of his tail. Dahl made the book fun and exciting to read.The two elements that where best described in this book were the characters and the setting. You could see the characters performing in your mind. The settings where magnificent.

The grandson listens carefully and keeps watch. She almost makes me believe there are witches. The grandson does have an encounter with not one witch but an entire conference room full of them. He is turned into a mouse. He is a clever boy and is able to escape. Instead of being depressed that he is now a mouse, he and grandma hatch a plan to put the witches out of business for good. He is the one with the ideas and Grandma is always amazed at his cleverness and helps him carry out his plan.Another boy was also changed into a mouse. His parents are disgusted by him now that he is a mouse. Grandma is very sad that his parents don't love him just because he's a mouse. But Grandma continues to be loving and considerate. She re arranges the house so her grandson/mouse can be safe and independent. She carries him in her purse when they go out. The adventure with the witches is funny and clever but the real story was in the tenderness between Grandmother and Grandson. As the boy/mouse considers his new reality he asks her how long a mouse would live. She is honest as well as hopeful. A mouse does not live as long as a boy would. But he isn't an ordinary mouse so he will live longer than an ordinary mouse.I liked Roald Dahl before but this book sealed him as one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"i didnt choose this book,my 5year old granddaughter did,she started school in june and is already at an 8year olds reading level so this is a perfect book for her level.we snuggle up and both have turns reading, love it its hard to turn off at night."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I read this book before and saw the movie starring Angjelica Houston.

It is interesting how the witches think they can turn the kids into mice. It is also amusing how the witches have square feet, blue spit, claws instead of hands, and bald heads. They hide there pointy claws with white gloves and there baldness with wigs. How they find kids is by sniffing them out with their long noses.

I wonder if they are too intense for some of the members of the intended readership.Now if you will excuse me, I would like to read a little James Joyce."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"And you'll never guess where I found out about this book! OK. I confess. I was reading at an Internet \\"Hate\\" site where a blog commenter gave his theory about the real reason why Roald Dahl's book, \\"The Witches\\" is persecuted.He said the book has been banned and panned because although it's not a very good analogy of witches, it is a spot-on perfect analogy of the Jewish conspiracy against our civilization, including the alleged Jewish hatred of our children, as expedited by their attempts to have the little tykes all murdered pre-natally by the practice of ritual abortion, performed by \\"wise and learned Doctors\\" who are often clad in ceremonial robes and who sometimes also \\"just happen\\" to be Jewish, to boot. The alleged analogy with the so-called Jewish conspiracy to destroy our civilization also includes the alleged Jewish use of the COUNTERFEITING Machine, as found in the so-called \\"National\\" banks and phony fractional reserve banking scams that the Jews are said to be so wild about setting up in every nation under the \\"Son\\" (so to speak), and which the Jews have also set up in almost every nation under Mohammad and Buddha as well; and also the nations under that Hindoo elephant god-with-a-trunk, which you may have seen here and there!I could go on, but I'd rather leave it to you to do your own research about the alleged Jewish conspiracy against civilization -- which you can do simply by going to Google and typing in the search phrase \\"Jewish conspiracy.\\" And I'll level with ya: it really does seem to fit in some cases (and so does that cult-film, \\"They Live,\\" but that's another story -- literally :-)However, I do not think \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl is meant to be taken as an analogy of the alleged Jewish war on our civilization. Why not? Because there are too many inconsistencies, as you'll notice if you do the research I've recommended above.Rather than name and itemize those inconsistencies between \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl and the (alleged) Jewish conspiracy against our civilization (and everybody else's civilization), I will close by informing you about the nature of the REAL conspiracy behind Roald Dahl's book, \\"The Witches.\\"In a word, \\"SHOES!\\" That's right! Roal Dahl took money from the the International Shoe Manufacturers, and from several organized groups of podiatrists, to discourage women's use of SENSIBLE SHOES -- the type of shoes that tend to Liberate our better halves by enabling their free and unencumbered locomotion and perambulation to and from wherever it is they want to go! Instead, Dahl (or Dahl's \\"unseen Superiors\\") would have modern women shun sensible shoes and cram their tender tootsies into much more expensive and \\"high fashion\\" shoes -- shoes with dangerous and dizzyingly high heels; shoes with pointed, foot-crippling toes; shoes dreamed up and \\"designed\\" by male fashion designers (who are often woman-hating homosexuals, and, it is to be admitted, are sometimes even Jewish).Thus, perhaps Roald Dahl's book, \\"The Witches\\" may actually deserve banning, because it certainly is a Misogynistic piece of anti-woman propaganda, aimed at crippling women by coaxing them into expensive, harmful, unnaturally formed shoes (and emptying their husband's bank accounts \\"to boot!).Be that as it may, this is one book that you must read for yourself and decide about for yourself (the film is not bad, either). And don't forget to do your own research about the alleged Jewish plot against our civilization. In other words, think for yourself about that as well and don't just take the word of the (criminal) ADL and the (allegedly) Jewish controlled media!As for Pagans and those who follow the old ways, this book appears to be \\"against\\" them as well, because Pagans, in their ever-increasing numbers in our society, are -- as anybody knows -- into Sandals and Birkenstocks.(!)"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I finished reading this book for about the 3rd time in my life and I thought it was really disappointing - I suppose I was younger when I first read it and so that's why I didn't enjoy so much this time.Like most of the other reviewers say, this book has some problems - it is veryyyyyyyy unrealistic and too scary for children under the age of 7."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The boy in the story doesn't have a name.

(In general, every piece of literature has a protagonist and an antagonist as characters) It is not to offend anyone, it is to expose children to fantasy and allowing children to use their imagination.

The wonderful Roald Dahl (we miss you!) exhibits his fantastical imagination and we never for a second believe that any of it is make believe. Roald Dahl ropes us in to his story and we are spellbounded every step of the way. Roald Dahl nearly always creates a central character that his readers instantly loathe such as Mrs T in Matilda and the head witch here.This increases the suspense as the reader waits for the eventual demise of this &quot;evil&quot; character. He also incorporates irony and satire magnificently that adult readers can appreciate. Dahl is undoubtedly the greatest children's writer that ever was. His books leave lasting memories and are a legacy that will last for centuries. We honour your memory"},{"Title":"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES (Anchor Bible)","review":"\`The Acts of the Apostles' in the Anchor Bible series, by distinguished Jesuit scholar, Joseph Fitzmyer, is one of the better commentaries on Acts I have read (with the understanding that I have certainly not seen all those done in the last 25 years, especially the very highly regarded one by Ben Witherington. Fitzmyer's volume has an advantage shared with several others, in that the same author has also done a commentary on the Gospel of Luke, written by the same ancient writer who wrote Acts.I was quite surprised to discover that this work was but one volume long, since \`Acts' is almost as long as the Gospel. The reason is as mundane as an editorial judgment by senior editors at Doubleday, the publisher of the Anchor Bible series. Oddly enough, the foreshortened perspective this forced on the author may actually have been a very good thing for non-professional readers. That is, pastoral and lay readers, who may be using the book as part of a Bible study series. Fitzmyer left out much discussion on the wide range of opinions on many issues which, for the non-scholarly user is largely a waste of time.In spite of this loss, Fitzmyer still provides one of the most valuable resources, the detailed bibliographies after each pericope, giving sources of opinions in interpreting the text. Fitzmyer also includes several features which one does not find very often, and which are revealing, even if you do not read them in depth. The first is the complete text of his own translation of \`Acts'. This is an excellent feature, as one suggestion all advisors on Bible reading agree on is that it is wise to read the entire book through before digging into the details of individual verses and pericopes. It is unusual for him to do this, as he did not do it in his two volume treatment of \`Luke'.A second valuable feature is Fitzmyer's survey of all the different sources of the original Greek texts. Few commentaries on \`Acts' do this, and few commentaries on many books of the Bible do this. It is interesting to see this survey for at least one book, and Acts is more interesting than many, since there seem to be many more such sources than for, for example, the Synoptic Gospels.I have used Fitzmyer's commentary on \`Luke', and found it slightly less useful than some others, especially Joel Green's contribution to the NICNT series. In contrast, F. F. France's NICNT volume is also quite good, but not as deep as Green's, so Fitzmyer comes off (sans scholarly baggage) much more useful than his \`Luke' volume. Fitzmyer's \`Acts' (and everyone else's \`Acts') may also benefit by the absence of the many comparisons between the three synoptic Gospels, which may be interesting for textual analysis, but is not too rewarding for those interested in culling the pastoral lessons from the text. The other side of the coin is that since \`Acts' stands alone, it is much harder to get some sense of from where Luke's sources came. Much of this thinking seems pretty speculative. While Fitzmyer gives us a fair reading of current thought on this, he also wisely agrees that this is secondary to Luke's pastoral message. What is vexing is that we have only the barest sense of why this book was written. Why did no others write similar texts, just as there were four Gospels written. (Of course, I know of all the various apocryphal \`Acts of' this, that and the other figure, but none carry the interest of the book which made it into the canon.One of the few drawbacks of Fitzmyer's \`Acts' is that it relies on your reading his \`Luke' volumes, especially his long exposition on Luke's theology in Volume 1. This is fair, since the overwhelming consensus is that \`Luke' and \`Acts' are very much two volumes of a single cohesive work.I would not go so far as to say this was the BEST 'Acts' commentary, as you may simply want the less scholarly offering by F. F. Bruce or the social orientation of Wetherington, but this is very good, especially for serious Bible study."},{"Title":"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES (Anchor Bible)","review":"The Anchor series as a whole rarely ever disappoints as far as the authors and size of the commentaries that they put together. This commentary by Joseph Fitzmeyer fits this mold perfectly.The only drawback that I found to be with the commentary was that it felt like Fitzmeyer could have put more of his own voice into it. He does an amazing job of gathering resources and interacting with almost everything that he mentions, but it felt, at times, he could have expanded upon his own thoughts a bit more. Please do not get me wrong, this is an excellent commentary. Especially if you are looking for a commentary that is going to give you all of the facts without an exegete trying at every turn to force their own specialized understanding of the text upon you.If you are looking for a solid, approachable, and scholarly commentary on Acts you cannot go wrong with Fitzmeyer's Anchor Commentary. If you want something that has as much information but may be slightly less conservative in regard to the author sharing their own views on some of the more ticklish verses in the book, I would suggest taking a look at Bock's Baker Commentary. Or, you could always purchase both.Overall, probably the most accessible of the higher level commentaries that will show you the standard approach to the Book of Acts. A perfect starting point."},{"Title":"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES (Anchor Bible)","review":"If you plan to do a serious, in-depth study of the book of Acts without side-stepping the intellectual arguments, Fitzmyer's book on it is a virtually-essential starting point. He seems to have read everything that has been written by anyone on Acts, and gives detailed summaries of their arguments, followed by full bibliographic information.I was surprised to discover that in this book all Greek text is printed only in a Roman lettering transcription, when one really would have expected the Greek alphabet to be used for a book of this standing. In amazing contrast to this, a Norwegian source is quoted in the original language and without a translation. With theological works of a certain academic level (which this book presumably purports to be), quotations from German are often not translated, on the (arrogant? unreasonable?) assumption that any serious theologian will be able to read German - but no Norwegian would be offended if his words were translated for speakers of other languages - especially in a book where Greek quotations are always translated into English (except for re-quotations of words and phrases from a verse that has been translated at the beginning of the same section).Fitzmyer deals with textual and theological problems, instead of pretending (as do some commentaries) that such problems do not exist. An example of this is his discussion of the circumcision of Timothy as recorded in Acts 16:3 (cf. Fitzmyer pp 573-575). However, the best treatment of this is - as is often the case - in F.F. Bruce's book on Acts.However, because of his background (as a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit), Fitzmyer sometimes sees \\"problems\\" where there are none, for instance, in the phrase in Acts 1:14 referring to Jesus' brothers, and the subsequent references to \\"James, the brother of the Lord\\". On page 216 he writes, \\"Luke uses the same words that he used in the Gospel (8:19-20), where he took over a phrase from Mark 3:31, in which context hoi adelphoi autou [TRA: his brothers] at first sight suggests that blood brothers are meant.\\" Fitzmyer goes on to say \\"In Mark 6:3 Jesus is said to be the adelphos [TRA: brother] of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon.\\" He then says \\"That relationship is further complicated by what Paul says of James in Gal 1:19, \`the brother of the Lord' (cf. 1 Cor 15:7), and of the Lord's brothers in 1 Cor 9:5.\\" Fitzmyer concludes \\"the most natural meaning of adelphos is blood-brother\\", and subsequently in the book when this James is referred to, Fitzmyer uses the phrase \\"the brother of the Lord\\". All of this does however at least serve to show that Fitzmyer engages honestly with matters that he perceives as problems, and does not limit himself by presenting uncritically the traditional Roman Catholic party line.Another blind spot for Fitzmyer is any real understanding of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit. For him, the Holy Spirit is imparted (automatically and simultaneously) by baptism, which results in him having great difficulty with Acts 8, which states (in verse 12) that when the people of Samaria believed, they were baptised - but verse 15 states that they had not yet received the Holy Spirit.As one has a right to expect from a serious commentary, Fitzmyer gives very thorough references throughout to other relevant passages of Scripture, and this would be a great help to anyone wanting to prepare either Bible studies or serious, in-depth, Bible-based teaching on the book of Acts.There is also a wealth of relevant historical and geographical background (dates, locations of cities, etc.)Each section of Fitzmyer's book starts with his translation of the relevant portion of Acts. While this is generally very good, it is not always totally accurate, as can be seen, for instance, in his translation of 16:3: \\"Paul ... had him circumcised\\", which implies, incorrectly, that Paul got someone else to do this. In Acts 9:13 Ananias \\"apekrithe\\" [TRA: \\"answered\\"] is translated \\"protested\\" by Fitzmyer and \\"tois hagiois sou\\" [TRA: \\"your saints\\" or \\"your holy ones\\"] is translated \\"your dedicated people\\" by Fitzmyer, who is presumably inhibited by the (non-Biblical) meaning attributed to the word \\"saints\\" by Roman Catholics (and some other groups). While he clearly wanted to avoid misunderstanding by his readers, in a book of this standing one would have not expected him to side-step the issue, but to address it, explaining the Biblical meaning of the word \\"saints\\". Perhaps this would have been a step too far for a Roman Catholic theologian - or perhaps he thought that if he did discuss it, he would run the risk of not obtaining the RC Church's licences to print - the \\"Imprimatur\\" and the \\"Imprimi Potest\\" and the church's acceptance that the book was not harmful to the faithful, the \\"Nihil Obstat\\" - all of which are prominently displayed in the accustomed way at the beginning of the book.While Fitzmyer is conservative, and therefore rejects various outlandish theories concerning the text or the incidents related, he is of course in no way an evangelical, and those with a high view of Biblical inspiration will not like comments such as \\"Luke makes Paul formulate ...\\" (p. 609). Fitzmyer's position is that Luke has made up speeches by Paul and others.After his translation of the original text, there is a section with the title \\"Comment\\". Sometimes (e.g., p. 600) this provides additional information. But on other occasions (e.g., p. 722), it merely summarises what the text says, and one must then ask what purpose it serves.The \\"Comment\\" section is followed by a much longer section with the title \\"Notes\\". This generally goes into considerable detail and is frequently extremely enlightening. However, by the time that we get to chapter 22 or 23 of Acts, we begin to get the impression that Fitzmyer is tiring of his task (or perhaps he realises that he is in danger of exceeding the word or page limit imposed by his publisher), as the Notes sections are a lot shorter and go into much less detail.I can appreciate that some of Fitzmyer's supporters might be outraged that I have not given this magnum opus five stars. I hope that this review explains the rationale behind that."},{"Title":"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES (Anchor Bible)","review":"Fitzmyer, once again produces a herculian work for the serious New Testament student.

While there is one 9 page chapter on St. Brigid out of this 20 chapter 178 page book, most are of Irish priests who went sailing elsewhere as missionaries or who dealt with scary situations. The writing is not particularly good, though it is not bad writing. The version I read was published in 1955. I have found that a number of books on saints written before Vatican II were not written as well as those written after Vatican II, though I do not know the reason for that. Maybe before Vatican II reading books on saints was more popular, so the writing did not have to have the same quality for selling as those written after that time. There are very few pictures in this book and the ones which are there are black and white, so the child would need to be of an age where pictures are not important.This book includes stories on the following saints:Adamnan.......Benignus.......Brendan.......Brigid.......Canice.......Ciaran.......Colman of Kilmacduagh.......Colman-Elo.......Columbanus.......Columcille.......Cormac.......Finbarr.......Finnian.......Flannan.......Gall.......Laurence O'Toole.......Modomnoc.......Patrick.......Thaddeus MacCarthy.......The monk who heard the bird sing for 150 years."},{"Title":"Twenty tales of Irish saints;","review":"Twenty Tales of Irish Saints by Alice Curtayne is a delightful book for people of all ages. Fascinating, interesting, and edifying, you will not want to put this book down.The author puts finishing polish on each story so that it's bedside-ready for telling to your children. You don't have to be a teacher or experienced storyteller to make the story understandable and accessible to young minds. She includes any explanations, context, or other necessary information before the story proper. Moreover, like any good storyteller, she piques the interest of the reader (or listener) before she tells the story.The tales themselves are delightful. Most are edifying as well as enthralling. Again and again we meet with fervent Irish men wanting to serve God in the most complete manner by becoming a priest -- and pursuing that goal with typical Irish zeal. We see heroic examples of trust in God, obedience, the virtue of religion, and many other virtues. The book is a cross-section of the Golden Age of Ireland, when the Emerald Isle's main export was fervent Catholic priests.Reading this book was a real pleasure. I would highly recommended it to Catholics who want to become acquainted with sanctity. Reading about these saints helps us to know how a real saint speaks and behaves, and we are edified by their behavior. Getting acquainted with these early Irish saints helps us develop a deeper love and appreciation for the Catholic Faith, which meant so much to these holy men and women that they were willing to give up everything for it. It would be even more special for those who have some Irish heritage."},{"Title":"Twenty tales of Irish saints;","review":"I read this book when I was ten years old; and I remember feeling sad when it ended. My mother was from Ireland and my father was American Irish, thus the saints were a part of our family life. In those days most of the stories of saints were of bigger-than-life characters from Italy, Spain or France. Awareness of the Irish saints was hard to find.After I read the book, and reported to my fifth grade class, each of my parents read it: they shared a similar delight.I have read my book many times over the past fifty years. I was delighted to find this new issue in bookstores. As a teacher I often read the stories to my classes, even at the university level, because they are so rich in cultivating a sense of history and imagination. These are not rich in historical detail, but set the heart afire with the special use of folklore. While some may see these tales as childish, I would disagree. These are charming tales that folks of any age, particularly the Irish, will enjoy, and enjoy, and enjoy.THOMAS PATRICK HULL,CHICAGO"},{"Title":"Twenty tales of Irish saints;","review":"I recently had the pleasure of reading Twenty Tales of Irish Saints by Alice Curtayne. This book is a lovely collection of legends about some of Irelands saints.I found all of the tales to be well written and quite delightful. My nine year old daughter has been enjoying reading about Ireland's saints. She's used to reading books about saints that are a bit more dry, so she was surprised at the lighter tone of this book. Of course, just because this book is fun doesn't mean your child won't be learning about the saints. Children who read these stories will still learn what makes these twenty saints so special and how they chose to serve our Lord.This book is best suited to an older child who will happily read a book that isn't illustrated. There are many little illustrations worked into the capital letters that are \\"illuminated\\" throughout the book, but there are no full page illustrations found in the book. The lack of illustrations does not detract from the book in my opinion, but I know such things are important to some people when they are looking for a book for their child.I found the author's storytelling to be very engaging. A child who is interested in reading about saints and Ireland will be sure to delight in reading this book. I liked that my child was able to learn a bit about her Irish heritage while reading this book. I believe the original intended audience of this book was Irish children based on the fact that the author makes many references to regions of Ireland and local customs that she references the reader already knowing about. In those instances, a reader who is not native to the emerald isle may feel like they're out of the loop. I suppose when it comes to references to specific regions, it might not be a bad idea to have a map of Ireland so your child could plot out where in Ireland each saint lived.Overall, it's a nice book that is sure to captivate and enthrall many young minds.I was provided with a complimentary review copy of this book from the publisher, Sophia Institute Press, in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"Twenty tales of Irish saints;","review":"Wonderful stories @ Irish saints, some quite obscure.

I was raised in a family that rarely showed emotion and never talked about feelings. Although my former girlfriend tried several times to get me to talk about my feelings, I refused to do so and told her that was silly.After she left me, I tried unsuccessfully to win her back. That's when I realized how terrible my communication skills were. I communicated the only way I knew how, which was usually either by attacking or by being defensive. Yet amazingly, until reading \\"Saying What's Real,\\" I didn't realize this. I just thought I was logical. After all, I could win any argument with her or anyone else.This book taught me that healthy communication is not about being right or getting people to do what we want. The author, Susan Campbell, makes the case that most communication comes from the (mostly unconscious) intent to control through manipulation, trying to impress others, lying so as not to hurt another's feelings, etc. She says that, conversely, healthy communication is about, \\"Creating mutually beneficial solutions... and sharing what we feel and think.\\" In other words, healthy communication is about relating, which Campbell says builds intimacy and connection.Since I wasn't comfortable with talk about relating and sharing, I initially thought the book's advice wasn't useful to men like me. After all, what man on this planet talks about how something made him feel? However, I kept reading and eventually become convinced Campbell is right. It became obvious that had I been able to really communicate and relate to my former partner, things would have turned out differently. She once commented how we often didn't seem to \\"get\\" each other. Now I know why.After finishing the book, I went back and took 21 pages of notes. I plan to review them on a regular basis until I completely break my old patterns and make \\"real communication\\" and relating a habit. I'll also read this book with my next girlfriend when the time is right. It may be too late to salvage my old relationship, but I'm going to make sure communication is not a problem the next time around."},{"Title":"Saying What's Real: 7 Keys to Authentic Communication and Relationship Success","review":"It sounds cliche, but it is the truth - Susan Campbell saved our marriage.

We have learned that assumptions about the other persons feelings are very often inaccurate while being present and honest about ourselves and being OPEN to the other is almost magical when practiced by two willing partners.

By saying \\"I'm having a reaction...\\" you communicate to the other person that you are present in the moment.\\"If you can name your buttons, they are less likely to have power over you,\\" writes Dr. Campbell who suggests that we write down instances in our past relationships when our buttons have been pushed and try to discover the origin of these triggers from scary or disappointing events from childhood that may have instilled the fear or anxiety.Then Dr. Campbell says we should write alternative ways we might have reacted had we been more aware.Finally Dr. Campbell suggests that we write down any actions we've taken to get back at someone for pushing one of our buttons.\\"The ideal partner is not someone who never has unconscious reactions,\\" she writes. \\"It's someone who can take responsibility for her own reactions without blaming you.\\""},{"Title":"Saying What's Real: 7 Keys to Authentic Communication and Relationship Success","review":"I read this after her first book \\"Getting Real.\\" For couples who find themselves in communication impasses and when they continually fight the same fight, eventually they get disappointed (and angry) at one another pretty quick.

If you've ever been in a long term relationship, words (and resentments) do sometime get in the way. In addition for those who withhold or have fear of speaking up, or who don't quite know how to put it in words, Dr. Campbell gives you \\"word stems\\" to help you fill out the blanks. It may sound a little automatic, but after witnessing how it's used at one of her \\"Honesty Salons\\" I was very impressed. People really tune into to what they're really feeling and they are very careful articulating so as to be as clear a possible to the receiving party.

It has been an eye-opener for me."},{"Title":"Saying What's Real: 7 Keys to Authentic Communication and Relationship Success","review":"Reading a book is never going to make your relationship better; only you and your partner(s) can do that. So if you are looking for a book to solve your problems, just stop right now. However, if you are looking for suggestions about what you can do to help your relationship develop better communication, then Susan Campbell's \\"Saying What's Real\\" claims to offer such advice.In the introduction, Campbell discusses what she believes are the barriers to good communication: First, being raised to devalue ourselves and/or others, and second, the defensive response to that, which involves controlling others and the situation. I think these are good observations. She briefly discusses nine benefits you may develop using her seven key phrases to begin and promote good communication. However, I was hoping for an introduction to the author in terms of her authority or background on the issue. She is a therapist, but what type, where was she educated, and what other sources did she use other than observation of her clients for 35 years?After the introduction, the next seven chapters all focus on one of the key phrases Campbell has used and urges her clients to use to help them communicate more honestly. Repeatedly she emphasizes that using these keys will require practice, suggesting that getting a \\"coach\\" or professional help can be useful for that. She offers several snippets of how people she's known have used these keys and the effects they've had on their lives. All these effects are positive, and that makes me a bit suspicious. Where are the failures, and why did it fail? We learn not only from our own mistakes but also from those of others.Most of the time Campbell refers to her own clients, but from time to time she makes a general psychological claim. I doubt she is the first person to develop those claims, so I expect some citations of where those generalizations come from. Yes, there is a list of resources at the end of the book, but no bibliography listing what other research she is drawing upon. I know that for a general self-help book this may seem silly, but I never think that respecting other people's work and citing it is silly; in fact, not doing so can get one into legal and professional trouble. One can write a nicely flowing book for the layperson and still be academically sound in citation by using endnotes or footnotes.I think these seven openers for communication can be useful, though given the fairly mundane examples of how they are used it will not be easy for those with more complex problems such as survivors of childhood abuse. The more traumatic the past that created your defense mechanism, the more you will need professional help. Campbell repeatedly says that you will need help to practice these skills, but I wish she had spent time on the rather large number of people whose pasts go beyond the routine denial of emotions found in most families.For those people whose backgrounds are that routine sort, I think these keys are most useful. However, I would add that one person cannot make things work; you need everyone aboard with the program. Again, Campbell does not spend time on that reality, suggesting instead that once one person is using the phrases, the other will pick it up. I don't think that is necessarily the case, and if you are with someone who is unwilling to change or develop empathy, you will need professional help and potentially the ability to do what is best for you. Reading this book can be a good first step, but you'll need to do more than simply read it or attempt to use the phrases on your own for a while."},{"Title":"Saying What's Real: 7 Keys to Authentic Communication and Relationship Success","review":"When you get a book like this unsolicited from the most underhanded person you ever met, you tend to read with a critical eye, yes.This book tells you not to manipulate people and then goes about for a couple of hundred pages telling how, exactly, to get maximum control over a relationship by calculating what you say and how you say it.This is real? This is honest? Um, no.I would say to those who like it, I don't want to insult you, and I think a book like this does have some uses: Almost any book that encourages you to think about what you're saying, what kind of listener you are, and how you're heard can give you some really good insights.But I find these ideas are really about how to homogenize your personality and control of your relationships. Which is pretty, well, scary. Read it if you want to, think about it, let it bring up some ideas for you. And then read a different book, and think about that one, too.Don't be afraid to take what you want and leave the rest, take some chances and be willing to lose, and allow your gut to lead you."},{"Title":"Saying What's Real: 7 Keys to Authentic Communication and Relationship Success","review":"What's \\"real\\" to one person may not feel the same to another. Three years ago I was having the time of my life writing to and receiving emails from a local (the 'best' in Knoxville) writer. In a way, it went to my head that someone so 'brilliant' and 'erudite' would send me such long involved epistles. Until, one day, when he'd concluded that he and I were speaking different languages. Of course, we weren't, but we were on different levels, he in the literary use of some words and I in the factual above-board definition. So, I took offense and retaliated 'in kind' which in turn caused him to accuse me of having 'moods.' Sounds familiar. It has taken me until now to realize exactly what he was referring to, as the same words meant different things to each of us, and there is an age difference to make matters worse. I now agree with his interpretation (from his stand point), but that does not make his version 'real' while mine is 'far out.'This book shows ways to communicate verbally in easy-to-understand language, giving skills on the process to let your stressor know what he or she is doing wrong (some I can do, others I wouldn't want to -- because of Southern belief in humility and the Biblical belief not to hurt others on purpose.) Yes, he hurt me in many ways with his accusations which I felt were 'unfounded.'To bring some kind of peace to a relationship, volatile or otherwise, here are her seven \\"keys\\" in a nutshell. Her instructions (not suggestions) are to start a conversation with \\"Hearing you say that, I feel...\\"; I want...; I have some feelings to clear.\\" (Don't we all!) \\"I'm getting triggered (absurd -- how can that bring peace to any situation?); I hear you, and I have a different perspective (a woman never says that to a man she cares for!); Can we talk about how we're feeling? (Now, that is a \\"no-no\\" when it comes to men!); but I do like this one, \\"I appreciate you for...\\" Trouble is, they won't believe it when you get into a combative 'mood.'Thoughts are worth sharing, but not demands or controls. These are things, she says, we should not do: deny pain when you're hurting (no one else can feel your pain so why bring down their day with complaints!); being nice to avoid a hassle, keeping silent to avoid conflict (I don't agree with these as no one wants damaging emotional confrontations in a situation she can't handle.) and lying to protect someone else's feelings (preposterous! sometimes it is better to tell 'little white lies.') Why hurt someone intentionally.Mainly, you yourself must decide if it is a relationship you just can't live without. Unclear communications and unexpressed discomfort about them are a major source of stress in our lives. How often have you wasted energy worrying about what you should have said or wondering what someone really meant? Why lose sleepless nights over a minor thing. Major -- yes, it is worth some discomfort to work things out with the least damage to either participant.Instead of saying what's real, we need to be real human beings with emotions, intellect, reasoning, bargaining power, understanding of the other's viewpoint, and \\"live and let live\\" response when it comes to fight or flight."},{"Title":"Mr. Moto's three aces (The Collected stories of the world's greatest writers)","review":"Mr. Moto was sort of a Japanese version of Charlie Chan, (the latter being a Chinese character). Probably the chief reason that Mr. Moto ceased to be popularly read, (while Charlie Chan went on to greater fame), was due to the Pearl Harbor Invasion! John P. Marquand's timing could not have been worse, (although there is at least one post WW II Mr. Moto entry). These three stories (novella-length mysteries) were written in 1936, '37, and '38.However, now that we are back on great terms with the Japanese people, it's a good time to explore these fine mysteries of international intrigue. Mr. Moto is an ultra-polite, but shrewd and determined, world-class detective. And John P. Marquand presented him masterfully -- his character development, story ideas, and settings are just superb.This is a very nice compendium of three of the very best Mr. Moto tales. They include \\"Thank You, Mr. Moto\\", \\"Think Fast, Mr. Moto\\", and, \\"Mr. Moto Is So Sorry\\". The three stories take up a total of 447 pages, sporting a fairly small, but very readable, font.If you would enjoy a nostalgic, pre-WW II trip into the doings of spies, high adventure in foreign lands, and compelling mystery, you'll love this book. This is a great volume to curl up with on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed it very much, (and will re-read it), giving it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Mr. Moto's three aces (The Collected stories of the world's greatest writers)","review":"Why don't we hear much about the Mr. Moto stories?

Now, however, once you read this series, you'll wish that Marquand had written a lot MORE Mr. Moto mysteries. Mr. Moto was very slick, analogous to Charlie Chan, (who was Chinese, and therefore remained popular), but not quite as corny.

Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Mr. Moto's three aces (The Collected stories of the world's greatest writers)","review":"Is a pulp still a pulp if it is well written? Well, John P. Marquand actually won a Pulitzer. He also wrote for some of the slickest of slick magazines, like the Saturday Evening Post.Somewhat incongrously, the Mr. Moto stories are about as formulaic as you can get. The main ingrediants seem to be a young American hero, an exotic background, a deadly peril, a love interest. The twist is that Mr. Moto always enters the story from the background. He is a bit like the shark in Jaws, and I believe this is a very clever device for preserving his dynamism. In contrast, the many Sherlock Holmes clones are more or less all failures in my opinion.There is a lot of PC sensitivity when it comes to these old Asian character detectives, but I believe it is much ado about nothing. No nation-character (even be he European) is ever really accurate or even generally non-stereotypical. Indeed, no fictional character (I don't care what others say) is anything but 2-D.Mr. Moto is unmistakably a good guy, though he is also, probably of necessity, (when it comes to the villains and settings) utterly ruthless. In one story, he uses the word \\"liquidate.\\"Interestingly, there is an contemporaneous political element that sometimes enters into the background. Mr. Moto is a friend of America and, in the background, he sometimes struggles against the political forces that seem to be leading Japan to war. I would not call Marquand prescient though: more likely he was just following the regular news of his time.Though the plots are formulaic, it is an entertaining formula. Marquand's prose here is not exactly poetry, but it is well above average -- almost uniquely so -- for pulps. The writing quality and short length of these novels (both lost arts today) combine to make this a fun and compelling read."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"On a Friday night at Honeybee McColor's you will find a \\"gather\\" which includes good food, good conversation and good music among some of the best black musicians in Harlem. Set in the early 1960's, Friday Night At Honeybee's is a musical anthology of that time.This story revolves around two characters that arrive at Honeybee's brownstone after literally running away from home. Told in alternating chapters, Forestine Bent and Viola Bembrey are running from the consequences of their actions in their homes. As a child Forestine always relished the music around her. She practiced with the best and dreamed about a life of singing and traveling. Her Achilles heel is her narrow-mindedness. Viola has an angelic voice but was relegated to life as a deacon's wife. One incident had her branded and forced from her southern hometown. Viola, provided with the name and address of Honeybee McColor, arrives in Harlem under duress and fear. Together, these two woman deal with their demons and their guilt to form a friendship rich in loyalty. With the assistance of Honeybee, Willa and Vernon, the other inhabitants at Honeybee's brownstone, Forestine and Viola definitely come into their own as woman of that time.This is an interesting novel told in a fluid, symphonic and dramatic tone. Ms Smith provides the reader with Forestine and Viola's family history, which guides the reader in understanding their plights. The reader is also provided with a wealth of musical knowledge as it pertains to the history of blues and finally jazz. This is an excellent portrayal of 1960 Harlem, its music and the musical accomplishments of that time.Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"This story is joyful and heartfelt simultaneously, exciting as well as realistic. It was gripping to the extent of not wanting to put the book down and to continue into the lives of the characters. Reading about the lives of the two women that was vividly told, I found that I was able to relate to parts of their lives. Parts that were sad as well as celebrated. I cried, laughed and felt the many different emotions that were expressed through the characters. I wish that I were there at Honeybee's house to experience some of the joys, food, music and ambience of the house. This book is worthy of five stars and more. The new author Andrea Smith has the techniques and skills to inspire further contributions to literature."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"THIS EXCELLENT, WELL WRITTEN PIECE OF WORK KEPT MY ATTENTION THROUGHOUT. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. THE AUTHOR'S WAY OF WRITING REMINDED ME SO MUCH OF MICHELE A.

I knew and know those places, people, their thinking, their expressions, their dialects each so wonderfully infused herein. Only the proper nouns were changed.My parents and older relatives are from S.C.. I heard and hear their stories and expressions; I was born and raised in New Jersey. I was too young for the rent parties but heard [and still hear about them]; I was old enough to and so attended the \\"Pay mama to get in socials\\".I snuck into and later strutted or slide into the juke joints and socialized with the musicians and the people. I knew and know people with each of the personalities, situations, habits and characteristics of each character that this author so knowing, sensitively and wonderfully described.If you are growing up or grew up around \\"down home\\" folk and were raised or are now growing up in a city then you will find yourself as I did laughing uncontrollably, smiling, and or wiping away tears in different moments of your reading. In some places because of this author's wonderful storytelling I felt as if I were a fly on the wall in the various scenes while in others I felt as she was \\"peeping in my window\\" or \\"stepping on my toes\\".This story will stay on my mind for sometime. I also read [during the same week] her other book \\"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner\\". This one {Friday Nights at Honeybee's)tore at my mind, my memories; the other tore at my heart. Read them! You will enjoy."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"Two female singers who live in two different worlds are drawn together -- their lives take unexpected turns and they're forced to grow and learn and hurt and love in a manner that celebrates and/or examines their existence.I loved everything about this book. The author's descriptions make you feel as if you're in NYC, in the 60's, smelling the smells of greens and potato salad, and listening to the sounds within the clubs - the loud musical instruments, the moans of jazz songs, and the funny/naughty/down-home conversations.Vibrant characters, a compelling plot, and plain old good storytelling make Friday Nights at Honeybee's a commendable and highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"Forestine and Viola are two women with very different lives but similar dreams. Forestine grows up in Brooklyn, in a home she feels less than welcome in, with a dream to one day become a singer. As Forestine grows older, her dream to become a singer is her only true passion, quite often at high costs. Viola is raised in the country, the daughter of a preacher and his \\"proper\\" wife, she is less sure of what she wants out of life but knows she will have a hard time finding it in the small constrictive town in which she was raised. Miss Honeybee was from the same small town, Jasperville, North Carolina that Viola is from but made her escape to New York City where she built a life for herself that the people in Jasperville talk about in hushed voices. Honeybee's \\"gathers\\" have become notorious as a time where there is good food and good music come together, almost any musician of any merit has passed through Honeybee's home at some point to take part in a \\"gather\\". Through Honeybee both women overcome heartbreak, find healing and ultimately discover themselves.This tremendous story will take you back to a time where jazz was in full swing, and carry you through to a time when the music form became overshadowed by its more contemporary counterparts. While you are immersed in a world of music, you are also drawn into the lives of the characters as they experience, heartbreak, love, sadness and happiness. Andrea Smith's eloquent writing, gives the story just the right literary flair to keep you engrossed in the world of gathers and gigs, taking you back to another time. Emotions run high in the story and as you become more drawn into the story; you can't help but experience the ups and downs right along with the characters. Saying I highly recommend this book would be an understatement, it will no doubt be one of the best reads of the year.Reviewed by Stacey Seay"},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"i read this book after reading \\"the sisterhood of the blackberry corner\\" I am a member of the \\"no name yet book club\\" this was our choice for Dec. 06. we all agreed that this was a very good book.

It is good to have someone affirm you when those in your family cannot, and in the instances of Forestine and Viola, that was the case. Both of these girls were not understood by either of their families, and Viola's case, they marry her off to an eligible bachelor at their church to get rid of her. Even though she questions and asks whether or not she could love this man, no one really answers these things to her satisfaction. To be honest, the union should have never happen. In Forestine's case, she had no support, no backing by her mother, who should have given her what she needed and didn't. Only by her father and Nick, who taught her how to sing and project the gift that she had. Perhaps if she received the nuturing and love by BOTH parents, none of that stuff with her and her brother in law would have started. A great book by a debut author I hope to hear from again."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"This was our selection of the month. It wasn't what we thought it would be. We found it started off slow but we stayed with it and enjoyed the book. We loved the feel of the &quot;gathers&quot;, the jazz and blues feel through the story. We felt deeply the wounds of both women and could see how they would both end up at Honeybee's. It started slow, but we did enjoy it in the end and we had a good discussion about the women, their family life, old Harlem, The music scene back then. It was a nice stroll back in time and heartfelt...A nice read."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"Andrea Smith transports the reader into the lives of the women &amp; men of the early 1960's. As most of us know, this was a time of change in our country. Not just with civil unrest, but also women liberation and new &amp; wonderful music styles. Ms. Smith weaves a little of this history into the story of two womentrying to find peace.First, we have Viola. Viola does not truly live life as much as doing what is expected. Viola attempts to venture out and learns a valuable lesson. However, the choice she makes as a result of her experiences have far-reaching consequences that significantly change her life. The reader has to decide if it wasfor the better.Next, we are allowed the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Forestine. Forestine has the voice of an angel which does not exactly match her physical appearance. Forestine has to deal with an overbearing, bitter mother and a beautiful older sister.Nevertheless, through the love of her father &amp; music,Forestine finds a means of &quot;escape&quot; from the day to day challenges of walking the earth as Forestine Bent.Viola and Forestine meet up at Honeybee's. Honeybee is the voice of wisdom and love at a time when Viola &amp; Forestine are at their lowest or at a time of change, depends on how you look at it.I enjoyed reading this book. But, I believe that Ms. Smith could have allowed us to see more into the characters' thoughts. There were also a few supporting characters that held a lot of untappedpotential. Ms. Smith could definitely write a sequel to Friday Nights. I believe the characters still have a lot to teach us.Leanna BaileyR.E.A.L. Reviewers"},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's was an enjoyable read. Although I enjoyed the book, I gave this book 3 stars because I was disappointed that Viola did not return to her birthplace to confront her parents. One might say it wasn't worth it; however, it was never discussed in the book how she overcame (other than physically removed) the situation with her parents. Overall, the book was delightful. I enjoyed the author's description of the jazz and blues lifestyle."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"Set in the early 1960's, Friday Nights at Honeybee's is the tale of two women, Forestine Bent of Brooklyn and Viola Bembry of Jasperville, South Carolina. Two women with vastly different backgrounds that meet at Honeybee McColor's Harlem Brownstone and develop a wonderful friendship. Viola is the daughter of a preacher man. Raised in the strictest of households, her mother prides herself on being the wife that does whatever her husband wants. Nelvern wants her household to be an example of a perfect marriage with a perfect child to boot. Viola desires other avenues but is forced into submission to her family. A loveless marriage, a moment of passion and an expulsion from the church find Viola on her way to Honeybee's. Forestine on the other hand, is a girl that lives in the shadow of her pretty sister and a mother who makes no bones that Forestine is nothing and never will be. If not for her father Willie, Forestine's hopes would be dashed. Her father insists that she is a good jazz and blues singer and she is encouraged to follow this pursuit. This eventually leads her to Honeybee's as well.Once the convergence on Honeybee's takes place, both women seem to develop into their own personas. Forestine has a promising career, which is only enhanced with her performances at Honeybee's \\"gathers\\" in the Big House. Honeybee and her other housemates are a hoot. Who wouldn't mind living at the Big House. Viola comes into her own, a mature young lady who at last follows her heart and does what she wants to do for a change. The reader can really feel the atmosphere of the Big House with Ms. Smith's writing. I think she's done a wonderful job of bringing in the essence of blues and jazz into the story. Friday Nights at Honeybee's has a cadence of its own that starts at the front cover and moves throughout the entire book. I'm a jazz and blues fan and some of the names mentioned of other performers in the book were real which leads me to believe that Ms. Smith did her homework in preparing for the book. This always makes a book more grounded for me and I enjoy it a lot better. The melding of reality and fiction make for an interesting read. I really took pleasure in learning about Forestine and Viola, how two vastly different lifestyles yield similar results based on good values put forth by two families in two different ways. Read Friday Night's at Honeybee's, you will be thoroughly caught up and entertained."},{"Title":"Friday Nights at Honeybee's","review":"I needed to read more than the run of the mill African American literature, and this book met my expectations.

The book painted a picture of the life and times of when jazz and blues were \\"in\\". The \\"gathers\\" were very interesting and I could imagine the excitement of meeting the movers and shakers of the music during the time.However, I kept waiting for something to happen to excite me, for the story to take an unexpected turn that would \\"wow\\" me, something that would hold me for several days after finishing the book; and it did NOT happen.

Now I am committed to the Norton Critical Editions for EVERY Shakespeare play I teach in the future! My students were amazed and sometimes enthralled with the incredibly rich background material which supplemented their study of Macbeth. They especially loved comparing Lady Macbeth's invocation of evil forces, and her declaration of imagined infanticide, with Seneca's Medea, in which Medea declares she will sacrifice her children to punish her cheating husband. They were incredulous that Macbeth's witches were actually mentioned several times in Holinshed's history. The factual background for Macbeth's rise and fall, set within the context of the eleventh century, gave them a deeper understanding of his inherent brutality. They also were better able to appreciate the modern aspects of his personality as interpreted by Shakespeare by contrasting the Bard's Macbeth with Holinshed's details of the actual historical Macbeth. And they really enjoyed learning that Lady Macbeth's real name was Gruoch. (Several said they're going to name their dog or their first daughter after her! Ha, ha!) WHAT A SUPERIOR SOURCE for any teacher! Please buy this if you are reading, studying, or teaching Macbeth!Added note: Now it's years later, and I have used the Norton Critical Editions for teaching EVERY time one is available for the work I'm teaching. They are simply the best in providing depth and analysis via the historical documentation, critical reviews (both historical and contemporary), and other source material.

Also, her brother had threatened her, the hero promised to keep her safe, then when the brother sends a messenger he sends her off to him with a few guards, who promptly desert her as soon as they get there.She also supposedly healed so many people in the village that they stood up for her towards the end, yet we heard next to nothing about her relationships with them.And while I love a bunch of good sex scenes in this type of book, I think she cut and pasted the same one in about a dozen times.

It could've been good but I just couldn't connect with and like the hero and heroine. Some words within the book wasn't in keeping with the general feel of Scotland of that era, as the heroine asking for a report of what was discussed between the lairds. All the hero and heroine seemed to be doing was having sex. The hero could only think with his _____. The heroine knew about the risks about being called a witch and yet she didn't do anything to at least temper her activities so that she gets accepted first.

In the end I deposited this book where it belongs, in the garbage."},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"This book was so bad I couldn't finish it. The writing was atrocious. The plot was so thin. The author just repeated the same things over and over: Blair insisting she couldn't love Graeme because of the Prophecy; Graeme forbidding Blair from practicing witchcraft; Graeme vascillating between being turned on by Blair ... and turned off by her powers. That was basically the whole book in a nutshell. None of the characters had any depth and, therefore, they were all boring and tedious. To her credit, the author at least tried to tie in the historical aspects, but even this was handled in a very cursory fashion. Essentially, it seemed that this book was written by an ordinary person who had read a lot of romance novels and thought, \\"This doesn't look so hard, I bet I can write a romance novel,too.\\" Well, this deficient effort proves that writing a solid, interesting romance novel is harder than it looks, and takes much more talent than this author possesses. I definitely will not bother reading any more of her books."},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"I enjoy the way Connie Mason writes her leading ladies. This book was another example of why. Rather than another helpless little waif, Blair is written as a strong and powerful woman. She is a faery woman, with the powers of healing and foresight. A nice mystical twist that makes the story unique. Blair must fight against people who try to take her life, claiming her to be a witch.The hero is so hot! Brave, honorable, strong, everything you want in a man. You'll get good laughs out his imagined idea of what Blair must look like, before he met her face to face. Having heard the rumors that Blair is a witch, Graeme's mind brings up images that will crack you up.Terrific love scenes! The relationship between the two main characters is believable and passionate.This story never once slows down. Exciting battles and triumphs.This was my first Connie Mason book.

THIS IS THE STUFF OF ROMANCE. THE SEX IS HOT, THE PLOT IS ENTICING (WITH A TOUCH OF MYSTICAL), AND THE CHARACTERS COME TO LIFE. CONNIE MASON HAS A WAY OF PULLING YOU INTO A BOOK; WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF CLOTHING, CUSTOMS, AND THE MIND SET OF THE TIME PERIOD. I FEEL AS THOUGH I AM THERE.

The lass would be tested by the elements and if she survived, would truly be blessed. However, if she should fall in unrequited love, she would lose her abilities.Her dying father believes Blair MacArthur is the legendary Faery Woman, but he worries for her safety from her hateful brother Niall who is jealous of her prowess. When their father dies, Niall plans to wed her to cruel Donal. Instead, her sire asked Laird Graeme Campbell of Stonehaven to protect his beloved daughter by marrying her. Niall and Donal readjust their plans even while Graeme decides to make Blair fall in love with him with no reciprocity so she will lose her powers and be safe because he's not in love.This is a charming mix of a wee bit of magic inside an engaging Scottish historical romance. The story line moves forward rather quickly while Blair serves as the center as the subplots evolve through her. Though the villains seem uneven, the hero is a wonderful character whose refusal to love belies all he will do to keep Blair safe sort of like that 10CC song \\"I'm Not in Love\\".Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"If you are a Connie Mason fan--well then you won't be disappointed with this story either. I LOVED the mystical feel of this book. Now I just want her to write more to continue on with the family....So, Connie if you are reading this....please write a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"Connie Mason did a good job in making her book a little unique than the others. Laird of Stonehaven is about a Faery women, Blair, who is a healer and a seer. People consider Faery women to be evil, and a witch. Whenever she is around people, they draw away from her and curse her for being a \\"witch.\\" Yet, somehow Blair manages to win most of the villagers' hearts. Blair's brother Niall and friend Mccay partner up to control Blair's wealth and her \\"powers.\\" Knowing of Niall's evilness, Blair's father urges Graeme, Laird of Stonehaven,to wed her so that she would be saved from Niall's evil plans. Blair refuses to love him, for that will break her healing gifts if she loved, and the love not returned. Only way for the healing gifts to keep intact is if they both love each other. Blair thought he was uncapable since he told her of his broken heart, and loving a pure woman. He takes her to his home, and tries to protect her from harm. However, some accidental events took place that caused her harm. She has to face fire, water, and stone in order to pass the test. Graeme has a hard time believing that she's a healer who has good intentions. He also has a hard time fighting back his emotions for her.I enjoyed reading this book. I love Connie Mason's books, so I know this book wouldn't disappoint me. The storyline was a little iffy for me, since I'm not really into reading books about spirits, witchcraft. But I gave it a try since Mason wrote it. I'm glad that I bought it. It's definitely a little different from her books, but refreshing to see a little variety from the normal story plot. She did a great job with the characters and the plot, yet I thought she kind of did most of the sex plots the same, kind of like cut and paste in certain places. But overall, I would say it's worth buying and a good read. If you are Connie Mason's fans like me, then you already have a copy of it! If not, get it!"},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"Connie did it again. I could not put the book down. The story is about Graeme Campbell and Blair MacArthur. She is a Faery Woman and healing was her life. But legend foretold she would lose her powers if she gave her heart to the wrong man. So the last thing she wanted was an arranged marriage. Especially to the Highland Laird Graeme Campbell who already haunted her midnight dreams. I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"If you're looking for a love story with lots of love....this is the book! This couple just couldn't get enough of each other....almost to the point that it got in the way of the storyline a little for me. Don't get me wrong, it's the reason I enjoy reading romances, but when a woman has had an attempt on her life and she's laying there sick and burnt but you're still trying to figure out a way to couple.....you have to draw the line! hahaI did enjoy the book and would recommend it, but it isn't a do over in my opinion.Blair McArthur is a Highland Faery (magical) Woman that is bethrothed to the Laird of Stonehaven by her father in an attempt to keep her safe from those who call her a witch. They meet and of coarse it's instant attraction which later becomes respect, admiration, and love; but her husband, Laird Graeme Campbell, did not like her to use her powers and forbid it that it might be thought witchcraft. Blair must endure trials of fire, water, and stone AND only love a man who will return her love in order to keep her powers. The story is full of her trials and tribulations and his unrelenting (except for 1 brief time) protection and nurturing of her which made it a sweet read.......that and all the lovin!! haha I love the way he wanted to wash her hair!Anyway....good read, strong characters, a little suspense, a little magic, good lovin, and a happy ending.

The Laird of Stonehaven was a steamy historical romance featuring a strong heroine, a sexy hero, deplorable villians, breath taking love scenes, nail biting adventure and a gripping narrative which kept me on the edge of my seat frantically turning the pages. I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading more books by Ms. Mason!"},{"Title":"The Laird of Stonehaven","review":"I couldn't put this down from the moment I picked it up.

I am so excited that Connie is venturing into the paranormal. I knew she would be awsome at it. As with all her books, I have never, ever been anything but elated with her work. When I have one of her new books in my hand...the family may get dinner and they may not! And if they do...I hardly remember fixing it. I simply can not stop long enough to do much of anything else. The knowledge of the era she spins her tales around are unlike any I have ever read. She does her homework! And I don't think anyone could ever top her love scenes. Hot! Hot! Hot! And she pulls it off without ever sounding crude or vulgar. As always!

They are facinated with Stormfur for some reason, and it becomes apparent in the form of a dark sliding shadow.Back home, the destruction of the forest begins. Leafpaw is getting confused about her duties, until a certain StarClan medicine cat that not even Cinderpelt met helps her along. ThunderClan is starving and an ambitious cat waits in the strongest Clan of them all. As leaf-bare approaches, it seems that no hope is left for the dying forest.Will the journeying cats make it back in time? Who really is Mothwing's and Hawkfrost's father? And who's the \\"silver cat?\\"Find out in Warriors: Moonrise!I really loved this book. It was truly deeper. Romances flare up, especially between Crowpaw and Feathertail. At the end a cat dies.

The 6 cats come upon strange cats that are in a tribe.

The warriors series is my very favorite and CAN'T wait for the next one that unfortunately doesn't come out intil Jan.1st.......These are the best books I've ever read and advise many people to read them. I personaly liked the 3rd book \\"Forest of Secrets\\" as my favorite with Moonrise coming in at 2nd but, all of the books are still great. Make sure to read starting from the first book or you might not catch on to the rest and a lot happens in every book that is exciting and you can't afford to miss out in the action.Anyways, speaking of just Moonrise, I have to say it was a great book full of action and sadness. The book was based on 2 different characters point of veiws, Stormfur and Leafpaw.It's singling them put as telling of what is happening to the 2 groups, the traveling and the ones at camp. With Stormfur, it's telling what's happening with the 6 traveling cats and with Leafpaw, it's telling what's happening back in Thunderclan camp.All of the clans are suffering from trowlegs except for Riverclan who hasn't been having problems. Cats are still greiving over the dissappearing cats. Leafpaw is trying to keep the heavy burden of what the missing cats really went to do as Firestar fears over squirrelpaw, his daughter, and Brambleclaw. Graystripe is also fearing over his 2 children, Stormfur and Feathertail who had also gone missing.Both groups, Traveling and at home, are having troubles and mysteries that do and don't come clear.It's up to the 6 cats to save their clans and unite as one in order to survive through their journey back to their home and guide their clans to safety.This book was thrilling and full of action.

But instead of going through the Twoleg area, they have decided to go through the mountains. During their journey, they cross paths with The Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe is like the Clans, but with different customs. The Clan cats don't know why they are so nice to them and they don't know what they want from them because they surely want something.The cats find out about a prophecy that Stoneteller, both the leader and medicine cat of the Tribe, had. It says that a silver cat is to save the Tribe from Sharktooth, a huge cat that looks like a lion without a mane and preys upon the Tribe. Brambleclaw, Squirrelflight, Feathertail, Stormfur, Tawnypelt, and Crowpaw are kept against their will and when they finally get away, they know they have to go back and save the Tribe.They come up with a plan to kill Sharktooth. Their plan unfortunitly didn't work and Crowpaw is trapped on the ground with the angery beast. Featertail, out of love for Crowpaw, jumps from her hidingp place, bringing a sharp piece of rock down with her. To all the cats' disbelief she kills Sharktooth, but killing him made her loose her life as well.This is a wonderfull and suspenefull book about what loyalty and love can bring you.

Part of the story occurs in a forest along some highway that is being cut down by humans. The rest of the story is on snowy mountains very far from the forest. In this story the groups of clan cats have made there way away from the beach and are now climbing through some snowy mountains. One night when the group decides to stop and sleep in a cave, Brambleclaw sees a figure outside. It was a cat from a mountain cat tribe. The leader of the tribe speaks to their warrior ancestors. The warrior ancestors say that there is a silver coated cat that will come and save them from Sharptooth. A vicious, bloodthirsty, cat, named Sharptooth, attacks at random the peace loving mountain cat tribe. When the group of cats passes the mountains the tribe cats think that Stormfur is the cat that shall kill Sharptooth and save them. When Stormfur finds this out he tries to get away, the guards of the mountain tribe stop him from leaving. Then Brambleclaw and the rest decide to fight Sharptooth altogether. Stormfur catches a rabbit and stuffs it with deathberries to kill Sharptooth. But Sharptooth doesn't take the bait and comes and attacks the tribe cats. While Feathertail tries to get away from Sharptooth, she climbs up the wall to a rock sticking out of the wall. When Feathertail gets on the rock the rock detaches from the wall and Feathertail falls with it onto Sharptooth. The rock kills Sharptooth but Feathertail dies from the fall. Stormfur is sad because Feathertail was his sister, and Crowpaw was also very sad because he liked Feathertail. A vicious, bloodthirsty, cat, named Sharptooth, attacks at random a peace loving cat tribe. The tribe leader talks to their warrior ancestors and the ancestors say that a silver furred cat will come and kill Sharptooth and save the tribe cats. The tribe sees Stormfur and his friends passing through the mountains and the tribe cats think that Stormfur is the cat stated in their prophecy. Stormfur catches a rabbit and stuffs it with deathberries to kill Sharptooth. But Sharptooth doesn't take the bait and comes and attacks the tribe cats. While Feathertail tries to get away from Sharptooth, she climbs up the wall to a rock sticking out of the wall. When Feathertail gets on the rock the rock detaches from the wall and Feathertail falls with it onto Sharptooth. The rock kills Sharptooth but Feathertail dies from the fall. I recommend this book to all animal lovers even if you don't like cats. This suspenseful book will make you think you know everything, and then there is a turn you didn't expect.

I like the way they hunt the eagles and hawks. Stormfur finds out another prophecy that he has to lead! While on this prophecy something so heartbreaking happens!

So many secrets were revealed, and it left me hanging for the next book!"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"This is the second book in the second Warriors series called The New Prophecy. There are 6 books total in the series. This book followed the style of the first book but wasn't as good. Not as much happened; the plot line seemed a bit stuck.This book begins right where the last book left off. Brambleclaw and crew are trying to make their way home from the ocean. Leafpaw and the Thunderclaw are trying to figure out why the Twolegs have started destroying their forest. That is basically the whole story right there.The book was well-written and engaging. In fact so far these books have written in a very precise way. They alternate between two viewpoints and when they leave a viewpoint they leave it hanging at a critical point. This style does propel the reader through the book effectively; although it makes it hard to put the books down.I was disappointed that the story didn't make more progress. This book was basically a slow and torturous story about how bad things are getting for the Clans. I found it a depressing read; but tried to remember that a lot of series need to hit their low point in the middle.The most irritating thing was that the book ended with nothing resolved; not even minor story points. Personally I find this irritating. I kind of feel like some parts of the story should progress and be resolved in a book, even if the main story isn't. Anyway that's my biggest beef with this book. It ends mid-everything. I suppose this will make the reader run out and buy the next book to find out what happens (regardless of whether or not they actually thought it was well-written). Personally if I didn't already have the next book and had to wait a year for the next book to come out I would probably have stopped reading this series out of sheer irritation.It is a good series though. And since I have the next book I can continue the story. So far I feel like this should have been one book and not 6. I suppose if all of these story-parts were put in one volume the sheer size of it would intimidate the bravest of souls. If you've read the first book chances are you will read this one just cause you don't want to die of suspense and you will also read the next book and the next one..."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"I think this is an astonishing book!

Stormfur, (you get his perspective in this book) is worried for his sister's safety on this journey, especially when he sees her closeness to (get ready to gasp) Crowpaw, the WindClan apprentice.Meanwhile, back in the forest, Leafpaw watches, the only cat who knows what's really happening, as the boundries between territories begin to fray, and formerly noble cats are beginning to resort to stealing. Even worse, ThunderClan's leader, and her own father, seems uncertain of what he can do, and his own Clan is beginning to protest against his desicions.This is the first book that you get the prospective of a cat outside of ThunderClan. I haven't even gotten hlafway through the whole book yet, but I figured I'd write a review so that the people waiting for the book can get a little synopsis.PS- I was going to order this off Amazon, but I found it in a bookstore before it was even out on the website!"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"This book was great.

They come upon a Tribe of wildcats in the mountains- cats with different anscestors and different lifestyles, yet Stormfur feels strangely at home with them.Meanwhile, back in the forest, Leafpaw watches, still the only cat that knows of Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw's journey, as the clans begin to panic as the Twoleg monsters invade their territoyr, chasing prey away and ruining thier home. The clans are starving and beginning to battle with one another- and, worse yet, her own father, Firestar, seems to have not idea what to do. And in the midst of all this, she learns that it might be possible that her father's worst enemy, the villian Tigerstar, may still have his bloodline alive in the forest.Like most other readers of warriors, I am eagerly awaiting the next installment, called Dawn!"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"The Warriors cats are back!

She also begins to examine the mystery of her friend Mothwing and her brother Hawkfrost's origins. The book is told from Leafpaw and Stormfur's point of view (and in one chapter, Feathertail's) for their respective side of the story. I found both sides equally interesting, and can't wait to see them intertwine in the next book, Dawn. I find the addition of the \\"tribes\\" to be very fansinating, and it makes the plot much deeper. I wonder if the tribe cats will be featured again in this series -I especially wonder about the tribe cat, Brook - it seems like she should be in it again. One of the main characters from Starclan was featured in this book again after his/her absence in Midnight, which I was glad to see. That part of it (the parts featuring Starclan) was very well done! The ending is very tragic, so be prepared, and the ending also leaves a big cliffhanger for readers to suspence over while they egearly await Dawn. Between Midnight and Moonrise (this one), I have to say I like Moonrise better. I found it more suspenceful, and the Tribe really held my interest. This book also had more action in it than did Midnight - with an intense final battle. Bottom line: another great addition to the Warriors series as a whole, and the best Warriors: The New Prophecy book so far."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"...But Erin Hunter once more has her readers in her grip. In this second addition to the New Prophecy series, action and excitment reach new hieghts, uncovering yet another generation of romances and frightening new possibilities.Armed with the wise words of Midnight, a badger, our six heros set off for their forest and their home. Predictably, this return journey is no walk in the park; the characters struggle with that famous inward conflict, love, and the more serious battle with a \\"tribe\\" of cats with a prophecy of their own.Back at the forest, Leafpaw watches as the threat of destruction climbs ever nearer. The Twolegs and their machines vanish both the trees and even some Thunderclan cats. Will our hearos arrive in time to save the forest?This story is rich with plot-twists, excitment, and yes, it won't disappoint you-- a firey battle. The tribe of cats is an interesting addition and takes the plot to new hieghts; and while not as good as the Midnight, Moonrise is sure to delight fans."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"Warriors is really good for cat lovers. This next one in the second series, The New Prophecy, really ventures out into the worlds that are not exactly Warriors, and you get to see the outside of Warriors. When I first discovered that there was a new SERIES, I was like 'Oh my gosh, really, thats really new! I never heard of two series in one!' I think Warriors is really great and should be read all over like Harry Potter and I can't believe it when someone does not like the series, Warriors."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"I just recently finnished this book and i thought it was great! I am really looking forward for the newest one 'DAWN' to come out. I recommend this book to all warriors fans and it is worth the money and time. I won't say too much about this book because i don't want to ruen anything for anyone but I will say this book touched my heart and i thought it was very good."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"The new addition to the Warriors series is considerably shorter than the previous ones, but it is still very good. You get two cats' point of views- Stormfur, Graystripe's son and the half-Clan RiverClan warrior, and Leafpaw, Firestar's daughter and apprentice medicine cat.The book starts right where Midnight ended- the questing cats are now heading back home, wondering as they go how they will break it to their clans that they must leave the forest that they have lived in for generations. They come upon a Tribe of wildcats in the mountains- cats with different anscestors and different lifestyles, yet Stormfur feels strangely at home with them.Meanwhile, back in the forest, Leafpaw watches, still the only cat that knows of Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw's journey, as the clans begin to panic as the Twoleg monsters invade their territory, chasing prey away and ruining thier home. The clans are starving and beginning to battle with one another- and, worse yet, her own father, Firestar, seems to have not idea what to do. And in the midst of all this, she learns that it might be possible that her father's worst enemy, the villian Tigerstar, may still have his bloodline alive in the forest.Like most other readers of warriors, I am eagerly awaiting the next installment, called Dawn!"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"I've read all the books that are out, and Moonrise was a fantastic continuation of Midnight. The story is narrated by Stormfur, Graystripe's kit and brother of Feathertail, and Leafpaw, Firestar's kit and sister of Squirrelpaw. The six cats continue the journey home, meeting a tribe of cats with a prophecy they need to fufill. Feathertail has a growing admiration for Crowpaw, which Stormfur doesn't like at all. Back in the forest, ThunderClan is beginning to realize all the devastation of the forest. Cats are beginning to dissapear, and Firestar worries for the Clan. The book left you hanging with lots of questions, like if the 6 cast will get back in time to save their Clans, and where are the missing cats? How can the Clan leave when Cloudtail, Brightheart and Leafpaw are missing?"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"This was a really great book. It's narrated by Stormfur and Leafpaw. I liked it a lot except while i was reading it i stopped for a moment to think about the cats parents and whos related and realized that Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw can't be mates because Squirrelpaw is Brambleclaw's half neice. At least i think so. But i hope not. But anyways it was a really great book. i cant wait till Dawn comes out."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"it was too short! i liked it a lot, because brambleclaw was a boring main character for \\"midnight\\", and stormfur was more interesting! i actually didn't think it was too sad, as others have said, because the characters didn't show enough grief towards the situation. if i were stormfur, i'd be way more sad than he was!"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"May I cry my farewell to the death of _____.For Stormfur @co it's goes fine until they meet the Tribe Of Rushing Water.

Essentially, it is a character that is too perfect, cliche, and dominates the plot. When I read this book, I saw that many of the characters were Mary-Sues. This immediately turned me off from the book. In other Warriors books, the plots were more realistic, and based on real cat behavior. I enjoyed this aspect of the series. However, in this book, there is a lot more typical fantasy, and not nearly enough realism. It's just not a convincing book."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"My two friends and I were so sad when we found out that we were done with the six books. Then, I heard about Midnight, and I almost cried for joy! No one knows how much I love these books. At first, my friends and I were disappointed that Firestar was not in that book.

Cinderpelt had her warrior life taken from her, as a monster ran over her leg at the old Thunderpath.The moment Cinderpelt, then Cinderkit, opened her blue eyes she must've wanted to be a Warrior.Cinderpelt was a young, slim, and sleek with a smooth gray pelt and blue eyes.The she-cat was courageous, helpful, and very pretty.At the time Cinderpelt was struck on the Thunderpath, Yellowfang was the medicine cat.Yellowfang knew that young Cinderpelt would never be able to be a Warrior because of her leg.Sh was left with a permanent limp. Cinderpelt became Yellowfang's apprentice. Sadly, Yellowfang was killed in a fire that filled the hollow. At this time, Cinderpelt was about 9 moons ( months ).At one of ThunderClan's darkest hours, and also Cinderpelt's sad death, Cinderpelt was about 11 moons.Sorreltail, a queen, was expecting kits. TunderClan was lucky for that; they were running out of apprentices. StarClan had warned ThunderClan that a dark time was coming. No one knew when this would be, or what was coming.&#34;Badgers!&#34; someone yowled. Badgers stormed through the thorn Barrier. Young Cinderpelt stared in horror. More badgers pounded into the hollow. Cinderpelt knew what she had to do. She positioned herself outside the Nursery. Cinderpelt gave Sorreltail a stick to bite down on when the pains came.The medicine fought a badger off.&#34;You will not destroy my home!&#34; Cinderpelt yowled angrily. Another badger lumbered up to the Nursery. Cinderpelt slashed it in the nose. Blood splattered on the ground. The badger cried out in pain and lunged away from the hollow.The gray she-cat tried to soothe Sorreltail. Another badger charged to the Nursery.Young Cinderpelt bared her teeth. &#34;I'll show you to invade our camp!&#34; Cinderpelt hissed. The badger yowled angrily and, with long, sharp, unsheathed claws raked Cinderpelt. The young, gray she-cat's cry was cut off as the badger swiped its paws into Cinderpelt's ribs and killed her. Cinderpelt was very young, way too young to die.But StarClan gave her a second chance. When the she-cat was killed, A gray bundle dropped out of Sorreltail's belly.Sorreltail named this kit &#34;Cinderkit&#34; in honor of Cinderpelt.No one knew that StarClan had sent Cinderpelt back to the Clan as one o Sorreltail's kits.Later, Cinderkit, now Cinderheart, met Lionblaze. She wanted them to be mates as soon as she saw him. They loved each other.But then, Lionblaze told her about a prophecy Firestar was given.&#34;There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws.&#34;Cinderheart believed that they could not be together because Lionblaze was too important. How could a Warrior go into a battle, worying about a mate and kits? But Jayfeather, Lionblaze's littermate and also one the three, made her realized they could.She and Lionblaze could shape their one destiny. They became mates, and Cinderpelt's spirit inside Cinderheart went to StarClan."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"The cats journey back. Period. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Warriors series, but Moonrise was slowly paced, and nothing much happened except Leafpaw was captured by Twolegs and Feathertail died. But still, I have read it 3 times, so it was good enough to reread, although this is one of my most disliked Warriors books. But I still recommend you read it if this is the first time reading the series, because you might not understand the Tribe later, and the Crowfeather and Feathertail relationship.

When my dad lets me get the next book, I'll probally love it too. No spoilers, sorry =-]."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"For others who read Midnight and Moonrise back to back, did you notice there was a replication of an entire chapter from Midnight (one of the last when the cats are leaving the sea cliffs) to chapter 5 of Moonrise? I don't know what on earth happened but I'm assuming that it was done deliberately since the story flowed through both chunks of either book in the right places and the details for terrain description were adjusted. Rather annoying realizing a whole chapter was transferred over. I personally liked Midnight better than Moonrise as this book moves a lot slower and the way the story functions with the mountain cats, at the moment feels like filler. Hoping that changes in the next one. I don't know how intentional it was, but Sharptooth also seems like he could've been named better. I had a really hard time trying not to picture a tyrannosaurus rex (Land Before Time) as I was reading."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"Summary: The 6 traveling cats: Stormfur and Feathertail (they're siblings)of RiverClan, Crowpaw from WindClan, Tawnypelt from ShadowClan, Brambleclaw and Squrrielpaw from Thunderclan, are returning from the sun-drown-place where Midnight, the badger, told them that their homes are getting destroyed. This time they're going through the mountains instead of the Twoleg place where they were lost many times.After getting lost in the mountains many times too, a group of cats found these 6 Clan cats. These group of cats are a Tribe called the Tribe of Rushing Water. They have their own ancestors called the Tribe of Endless Hutning. These cats are all fascinated by Stormfur and he doesn't know why. Stormfur has a friendship towards a Tribe cat called Brook where Small Fish Swim. While Crowpaw and Feathertail are getting really close and may be togehter, but towards the end everything changes. Something terrible happens to one of the Clan cats, and then something leaves the reader heart-broken.Meanwhile, Firestar, the great leader of ThunderClan and his Clan suffers to survive. while Twoleg monsters (bulldozers and other machines) keep on tearing apart the forest.I think this book is really good and has many evnets that keeps the reader intersted. I finished this book in less than a day. I couldn't put the book down. But this book is also really sad."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"The book starts right where Midnight ended- the questing cats are now heading back home, wondering as they go how they will break it to their clans that they must leave the forest that they have lived in for generations.

Moonrise continues the story of the six traveling cats going to sun-drown place. Brambleclaw finds himself closer to Squirrelpaw then he had ever thought that he would be. Crowpaw and Feathertail are becoming a bit more friendly. And Stormfur finds himself a place whre he thinks that he belongs. The story makes you want read,read,read,read and NEVER stop. I love all of the Warrior books. Recommeded to any reader!"},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"Moonrise is a really good book, and I give it a five star rating. The cliffhangers keep you guessing: What's going to happen next? The Tribe of Rushing Water is mysterious, but also very generous and friendly. I have been a fan ever since book 1, \\"Into the Wild,\\" and I will continue to be a fan. I highly recommend this book to those who love the series. i'm not going to reveal any spoilers, but I'll say that this book was probably one of the saddest, as a major character dies. Meanwhile, back in the old land, the forest is being destroyed. The hostilities and boundaries begin to wear off in this book, and I think that the journey and series itself is a change woth reading about. This book continues that marvelously spun series, and Erin Hunter triumphs again. You'll just have to read in order to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"This book continues the story of the four warrior cat clans where Midnight left off. It is written in the same way that all of the Erin hunter Warrior books are written-Ending each chapter and book at a suspenseful time so that you just HAVE to read the next book. You should not, however, read this book without reading the others that come before it in this series, starting with Into the Wild, or at least reading the other new prophecy book, Midnight. The book will make sense if you read it alone, but you will probably like it more if you read the other books, the same story is carried completely through all of the books.I recomend this book to anyone who can read, even if you are older than what it says the reading level age is (9-12). Also, if you are a fan of cats, these books are perfect."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"They are still traveling and all six cats run into a cat \\"tribe\\" that believe alot differently than the Warrior clan cats. This \\"tribe\\" saw a prophecy too that they would meet the clans cats, and somehow they're most fasinated with Stormfur than the others. He doesn't understand why until they explain to him. Truth reveals in the most tragic ending ever. If you're intrested, get the book and read this mysterious/sad/suspensful story of the year."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"The story begins as Brambleclaw, Crowpaw, Stormfur, Feathertail, Tawnypelt, and Squirrelpaw depart from their prophetic message from Midnight the badger. In the mountains trying to get home, the crew runs into a tribe of cats who have their own beliefs. The leader of this tribe, Stoneteller, has had a vision of a silver gray cat coming to save them from a deadly black panther named Sharptooth. Stoneteller believed Stormfur was the cat whom the Tribe of Endless Hunting has spoken about. The Tribe of Endless is like the tribe's heaven and that's where their cats go when they die. Stormfur tried to leave, but Brooke and Crag wouldn't let him, and made Brambleclaw and the others leave. Leaving Stormfur behind with the tribe, Brambleclaw and the rest come back to the tribe in secret to free the enslaved RiverClan warrior later that night. In the process, Sharptooth attacks the tribe. After narrow escape from injury, they run knowing this was their chance to free Stormfur. One day later, Stormfur stopped in his tracks and decided to fight Sharptooth and save the tribe. Stormfur was worried about Brooke, the cat he left but loved within the tribe. The rest thought Stormfur was crazy, but they agreed as they set back out to save the tribe. I will not spoil the ending, though. All I can say is one of the six clan warriors will die.I really liked this book overall, but there was a few things I disliked. I hated how the viewpoints kept changing from the six cats to Leafpaw back at home. The end was satisfying, but sad. Erin Hunter does a great job expressing details in her books.The people who would really like this book series would be cat and fantasy lovers. I could compare these books to Redwall or to Harry Potter in a way because the animals talk like in Redwall, and there is a lot of action, adventure, and mystery like in Harry Potter. For those of you who crave for action and adventure among animals, this would most defiantly be the ultimate choice for you."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"This one was the best I have ever read.

Going a \\"quicker\\" way home, they encounter a tribe of cats. Stormfur can't understand their fascination with him, but when he learns about it the effect is devastating. Meanwhile, Stormfur is feeling interesting pangs for a tribe she-cat, and he is feeling pangs at seeing Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw so close. He is feeling very protective of his sister, who is in love with the wayward WindClan apprentice, Crowpaw.Back in ThunderClan, Leafpaw's world is crumbling around her. The WindClan cats are getting more and hostile, while ShadowClan's hostility doesn't rise. RiverClan is full-fed and happy, the only Clan that is. When Leafpaw figures out who Hawkfrost reminds her of, it shocks her. Could Tigerstar really be Hawkfrost and Mothwing's father? He certainly could be, and Hawkfrost's ambition isn't making Leafpaw any less suspicious."},{"Title":"Moonrise (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 2)","review":"This book was AWESOME I loved every minute of it.

Like i mention in my review for the French Dictionary, it covers topics rarely covered by other dictionaries like people, appearance, health, services, home, shopping, food, studies, transportation, sports, leisure, environment, etc.It goes to such specific words as the different parts of a computer or camera, or as the different players (positions) in a football game or members of a rock band.Excellent source, but a very important note: Spanish is a very complex language, and althouhg it is spoken in many countries, the dialects and words for specific items may change. For example, the word for cake in Puerto Rico is a bad word in Mexico and is not the same in Spain...The Spanish words presented in this dictionary correspond mostly to the spanish spoken in Spain, but fear not! Most words presented are universal and mean the same in any Hispanic country.Excellent book, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"I have been studying Spanish for over 5 years and I found this book to be a thoroughly engaging and practical way of reviewing vocabulary.

I especially appreciated the photography and the lay out of the book which is vibrant and appealing."},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"The Spanish English Visual Bilingual Dictionary is filled with colorful images of all the items listed with English and Spanish words. I find it is much easier to remember the words when presented with pictures. At times so many of the Spanish words are similar to the English (telefono/telephone or la nectarine/nectarine) so it makes it even easier to remember along with the pictures.The areas covered include: people, appearance, home, services, shopping, food, study, work, transport, sports and environment.Very helpful dictionary when you are learning a language or to look up specificwords. There is a Spanish and English index to simplify searching for words.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"This dictionary appears to be a minature, softcover, two-language version of the Five Language Visual Dictionary sold by DK (Five Language Visual Dictionary). This book is small enough to be called a pocket visual dictionary and has an exceptional variety of clear, well-organized, indexed images.While some categories, like the human anatomy section, provide detailed vocabulary well beyond my needs, other sections are wanting of some basic classroom vocabulary. Words like binder and binder paper are not included, but I have yet to find another visual dictionary that includes them. It is still a great dictionary, and I recommend it to my Spanish I students as a means of linking Spanish vocabulary directly to images rather than always translating to English."},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"Oh, this dictionary is so awesome! I have so much geekish fun with it you wouldn't believe it. A genius-like idea (words grouped by theme, each with a matching picture), flawlessly executed.Though a slightly worrying side-effect is that one starts to lust after the items in the pictures (not the people, who are all remarkably healthy, (except if you're looking at the section about going to the doctor, or being in the hospital), but in a completely cheerful, non-erotic kind of way).But the things. Everything is so top-of-the line. If DK include a photo of a bathrobe, it's so klassy you immediately start to krave it. Their pastry display makes you drool. You don't just want to know that \\"la masa brisa\\" is filo pastry, or that \\"trifle\\" is \\"el postre de soletillas, gelatina de frutas y nata\\", you want the damned trifle itself. Even the fast food (\\"comida rapida\\") looks uncommonly mouth-watering. The \\"albaricoque\\" picture is of the most perfect apricot you have ever seen. Even the ugli fruit (\\"el ugli\\") is beautiful. Over in the section about the bank, \\"el director de banco\\" is kindly and avuncular. \\"Las plantas podadas con formas\\" (topiary) are uniformly exquisite. Even the watering can (\\"la regadera\\") is an aesthetic delight. \\"La monta&ntilde;a rusa\\" (the roller-coaster) is a canonical example of roller-coasterdom.You get the picture. Actually, you get thousands of them, each more attractive than the next.The only slight disadvantage is that verbs don't quite get the emphasis they deserve.File under dictionary-porn."},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"he conocido este producto al comprar el diccionario ingl&eacute;s - franc&eacute;s.Lo encuentro muy &uacute;til, ya que es todo el vocabulario cotidiano el que aparece, y addem&aacute;s es ilustrado, lo cual identificas exactamente loq ue quieres buscar.Estoy muy contenta y se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo."},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"This is a wonderful visual dictionary.

From what I can tell, this dictionary has about 6,000 words. The firefly Spanish mini dictionary has 20,000 words. For that reason I would give it 4 stars instead of 5. (If I could I would give it 4 1/2 stars, because I do love this dictionary.)If you have never used a visual dictionary before, I highly recommend this dictionary.

This little book uses actual photographs with the vocabulary words. This is very helpful, especially if you are a visual learner. My wife has been a Spanish teacher for over 20 years and she loves this book and uses it both with her Spanish students and her ESL students. It has a nice index which is also very helpful for finding specific terms. The main body of the book is divided into 14 different sections covering vocabulary words which are one will most likely need to know, although there are many words which you probably will not need to know until your Spanish skills are more advanced or unless you are planning on spending an extended amount of time in a Spanish speaking country. These categories are:PeopleAppearanceHealthHomeServicesShoppingFoodEating outStudyWorkTransportSportsLeisureEnvironmentReferenceEach of these chapters are further broken down into more specific categories that have to do with the main topic. Overall, this book is well organized. The nice photographs are a big plus - much better than trying to learn from illustrations. I think that this book would be a great aid for anyone trying to learn Spanish. Of course you will not learn Spanish from this book alone, but it is a great supplement. I highly recommend it.Bohdi Sanders, author ofWisdom of the Elders"},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"Really good visual dictionaries are hard to find.

The human brain is very image oriented and this dictionary will imprint objects and their spanish names into your memory quickly. When you learned English, or whatever your first language was, your parents would point to objects and say their name. The images in this book are absolutely beautiful and entertaining. I was surprised at the detail this book goes into. A lot of it is way more detailed then you will most likely ever need. (i.e. the name of that clapper thing that film directors use when they yell \\"action!\\") The book is also small enough to take anywhere. The words are arranged by themes so it is easy to take it with you and open up to the section corresponding to your current situation.

This book is especially helpful if you make flashcards from the lists.My first and only major complaint about this book is that it doesn't provide a whole lot of verbs, and for a book of this size, it could include considerably more adjectives for physical states, personality traits, etc. It's not totally devoid of these things, but there are no categories devoted to these types of items.My other complaint is that there are a few words and phrases which just... aren't... correct. Actually, there's very little that could be considered downright WRONG - but there are some phrases, here and there, which do not reflect the most common way of saying something.Overall, though, I think this is quite possibly the best visual dictionary on the market. It's got a lot of stuff, but it's not overwhelming (like the Firefly dictionaries) and it isn't riddled with useless vocab (like the Milet editions)."},{"Title":"Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"The more senses involved in learning the better and visuals of concrete things makes it some much easier.

If a general-use word is needed and a picture helps for context verification confirming an expected relationship to English, then this is the dictionary for you.The only error, and maybe not an error, I ran across. is for \\"rappelling.\\" In two of the dictionaries a very uncommon word (abselling) is used for \\"rappelling\\" (see page 248 in the three dictionaries mentioned above).I would recommend these three for anyone needing a basic way to communicate where English is not spoken. It's easy. Find the word in the index, go to the page, point at the picture.

I didn't take any Spanish classes in college because I was afraid I'd be behind everyone else since it had been four years since I'd taken a class. I ordered this book so that I could at least learn some vocab beforehand and lessen the load a little just in case I became overwhelmed with grammar.This book is not for someone who has never taken a class in Spanish, but I don't think you'd need more than a month of class before this book would be realistic. At minimum, simple concepts like pronunciation and masculine/feminine terms need to be understood first. This is not a book with overall vocab; it is rather extensive for beginners and it will take a lot of time to commit all of the words to memory. Also, this is not a stand-alone book. Without actually conversing and writing in Spanish, the words won't likely \\"stick.\\"If you aren't willing to put a substantial amount of time into committing these words to memory, don't buy this book! It will sit on your shelf and collect dust after you give up.

Dr. Baker's accurate and vibrant depiction of the earnest and dedicated Sir Glyn Jones, the last Governor/Governor General of the Protectorate, is a highly readable tribute to a most skillful and tenacious Civil Servant.Since I knew Sir Glyn and the book's entire cast of characters for many years, I have a particularly keen sense of appreciation of this biography. The reader will be absorbed with Sir Glyn's masterful orchestration of colonial Nyasaland's transition to independent Malawi, tactfully working with the brilliant but mercural Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, Malawi's Founding Prime Minister then President, outraged European settlers, bumbling Colonial Office officials at Whitehall and the jealous Nyasa elite vying for personal power.Professor Baker's outstanding books are written against a background of exceptional documentation and scholarship, yet are all thoroughly enjoyable reads by anyone interested in British Colonial and/or African history.

A genius turn of the screw examination of women's inner desires. She is not afraid to rollerblade along that envelope and does so with the grace and deftness of a magician.When I picture Julie Elizabeth Leto in my mind (having seen her picture and been a big fan for a couple years of her steamy, sizzling books for Harlequin's Blaze series), I see her in a t-shirt with the words \\"Good Girl's Do\\" emblazoned across her chest and Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild\\" blaring in the background!! I don't think there is a writer anywhere that touches the cord of women long told that good girls don't, but knows secretly in their hearts and fantasy THEY DO!! She gives the reader an empowering okay to indulge in being the aggressor - not that the males she creates are wimps, quite the contrary - but Julie's newly liberated females push the envelope. Maureen O'Hara said in THE QUITE MAN she was not a woman to be honked at and to come a running. Well, Julie picks up that banner and lets her characters wave it proudly! As you might've experienced, often the envelope gives paper-cuts, but what the heck...they heal quickly! It's the challenge and the risk, that skating on the razor's edge, which makes her books so sexy and distances her from the pack of other Harlequin writers. She creates very down-to-earth females, flesh & blood women that jump off the pages and introduce themselves. Whether the bad girl who is sooooo GOOD or the nice girl cutting loose, Julie believes in GIRL POWER TO THE MAX!In her current book, LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, June 2003 Blaze #92 (and its sequel UP TO NO GOOD, August 2003 #100), Julie has the chance to use both the Bad Girl and Good Girl as the focus of both stories. Twins, they are raised by their grandmother, an overly repressive woman determined to see Rory and Micki not follow in their mother's footsteps. Mama was the \\"bad girl\\" of the small Southern town; hurt by this shame, strong-willed Nanna is determined to make sure her granddaughters remain \\"nice\\" girls. As often happens, the harder you try to prevent something, the more you drive that person to rebel, and that is what happens to Rory Carmichael's twin sister, Micki. She ran away from home when they were fifteen, leaving Rory to be the \\"good girl\\". Rory loves her grandmother, and willingly stepped into the \\"good girl\\" mold to please her, but she is twenty-five now and she wants to have so fun in life. Rory knows cutting-loose from the nice girl image in the small town would be impossible, so she takes a stand and moves to the big city where she can be a little wild without poor Nanna having a heart attack. Rory might be out of sight, but not out of mind as Nanna is still trying to control her life. She arranges for Rory to get a new apartment with the son of her doctor, thinking this will keep her in a safe spot. Only, Nanna had not locked eyes with Dr. Alec Manning!Never been one to stand back from the invitation in a woman's eye, Alec is a to-die-for hunk. However, having lost his job because of an indiscretion with his Dean's wife, he has taken a vow of celibacy to prove to himself there is more to life than one woman after another. However, he did not count on Rory turning up to live under his roof. To kick off her new life, Rory tore two pages from a book called Sexcapades: Secret Games for Wild Adventures for Uninhibited Lovers. The book is housed where she gets her new job and it is 1001 exciting ideas to jazz up a steamy romance. Created so you cannot tell what the fantasies are beforehand, they are sealed in plastic and you're instructed to open them only when you are ready to put them to use. Rory's were called STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT and SLIPPERY WHEN WET. Determined to kick loose from that nice girl image, she cannot imagine a better target on which to hone her feminine wiles than her new sexy landlord. Alec's vow is suddenly having a hard time standing up to the breathy sighs, tight jeans and come-hither looks of sexy Rory."},{"Title":"Looking for Trouble: Invitations to Seduction (Harlequin Blaze, 92)","review":"Rory Carmichael has spent her whole life living the life of a good girl to please her grandmother who raised her and her twin sister after their mother abandoned them.

Her \\"Read to your Bunny\\" campaign rolled out across the country a few years ago. Wells addressed a group of librarians recently and passionately discussed the education challenges facing our schools and our nation. Young children are struggling more than ever in school. The reasons are numerous and familiar to most of us. Rather than continue to bewail the whys and wherefores of the issue, she used a brilliant analogy to explain what we need to do.She pointed out that if a building was on fire and hundreds of people needed to be saved it would take the clear voice of a fireman, issuing simple commands to evacuate everyone to safety. (Instead of dithering about discussing why the fire started and how fires really are a problem for certain kinds of structures, the important thing is to get safely away.)Her book \\"My Shining Star: Raising a Child who is Ready to Learn\\" was written with input from teachers and librarians all around the country. Wells lists ten virtues which parents should promote to prepare their child for the most wonderful adventure of all, education.She addresses parents in the preface:\\"All children bring to school what they learn at home.This book is about creating a home full of harmonyand the preparation of a successful child.You are your child's first teacher.\\"Her virtues include Respect, Listening, Patience, Trust, Work, Honesty, Time (\\"Children spell love T - I - M - E,\\") Reading, Writing, and Habits.This little book is only 13 pages long and only has about 25 words (at most) per page. Wells's lovely rabbit drawings warmly illustrate each virtue. She lays out a path for raising a child who is ready for school. It seems so simple and so obvious but so many children arrive in Kindergarten ill-equipped to learn.If you know a family with young children, present them with a copy of this tiny treasure.This little book is going to be my gift to new parents along with Goodnight Moon and a Mother Goose book.During her speech she also related a story about a principal she knows who works tirelessly to awaken parents to the needs of their children. He tells them to \\"Grow up! Pay attention! Be Responsible for your child!\\" I did not know that, nationally, only 26% of all parents attend their kids' Open House or Back to School nights.The alarm has sounded and Rosemary Wells has given us ten simple steps to help children get ready to learn."},{"Title":"My Shining Star: Raising A Child Who Is Ready To Learn","review":"In \\"My Shining Star: Raising a Child Who is Ready to Learn,\\" it's parents who learn what's important when it comes to raising their kids and getting them ready for school. This book features ten simple, but very important lessons that can be a cornerstone for raising kindly, well-mannered children.The book starts right off with Rule #1 --- Respect. It says basically that when children are treated with respect, they will have self-respect and will learn to have respect for others. Another great rule is #6 --- Honesty, which says that children need to be taught to respect the truth and see justice used at home.Never heavy-handed, but plainly put, these lessons are golden. The book of the book contains endorsements from Robert Coles (a child psychologist at Harvard University) and Jason Kamras (2005 Teacher of the Year.) But I think after you read it, one if its biggest endorsers will be you. The book is illustrated in the familiar Rosemary Wells style, using her classic rabbit characters seen in book such as \\"Read to Your Bunny.\\""},{"Title":"My Shining Star: Raising A Child Who Is Ready To Learn","review":"While most of Rosemary Wells' books are for kids this is definitely for parents.

This book, full-color throughout, is not a \\"guide\\" to the collectibles, as it does not include price values or manufacturers (it does give the year and dimensions for each piece pictured). And it's by no means all-inclusive (hey, not even a third of the \\"Animated Series\\" merchandise I own was in there!).

The book was adequately, but not well, organized. Their recommended restaurants are adequate but not worthy of recommendation. In this area, Fodor's South America was much better.

Where is Clifford was a great book for people to read. The author of this book was Norman Bridwell. He did a good job writing this book by making the children guess if Clifford was under the flap on each page or not. There really wasn't much too it because on every page it just asked a question if and then you lift up the flap and look to see if Clifford is there or not. I recommend this book to children 12 and under. Over all this book took me about three minutes to read and was easy for my project"},{"Title":"Let the Children Come","review":"The basis of the sermons in this book is that people learn best by doing, rather than by being talked at. The sermons are intended for children, but some may be applicable to all ages. They might be considered more like activities than sermons. This book is not 'how to' or theoretical. It is practical, detailed activities for teaching the Bible to children by engaging them in activities through which they will feel what the biblical characters felt. While the book provides details for the conduct of the activities, you must be flexible when dealing with children because they will not always follow the 'plan' for the activity! This is an excellent resource for anyone teaching Christianity to children of any age."},{"Title":"Let the Children Come","review":"This book describes a wonderful approach to the Sunday morning children's time in church. It's simply the best resource I know.The author describes how we can meet children where they are and engage them so they become part of the story. This is not about object lessons. The book also includes a number of excellent stories that I have used with great success with groups of 3 kids or 30 kids.More importantly, it inspired me to new creativity and effectiveness in my brief time with children each Sunday."},{"Title":"Marcus Alonzo Hanna;: His life and work,","review":"Biography written in 1909 about one of United States most interesting business and political figures.

As such, it holds many chapter excerpts from wonderful books rather than complete stories. Still, it's a great resource for young readers to \\"try out\\" a book, but they'll have to go to the library or bookstore if they want to finish the story."},{"Title":"The World Treasury of Children's Literature: Book 3 (World Treasury of Children's Literature)","review":"My husband and I got this book the day our daughter was born.

Offered to railroading enthusiasts is an impressive and expertly detailed description of how the steam engine of a locomotive is constructed, including an informative exploration and delineating of the workings of every part ranging from slide valves and steam injectors, to lubricators, pressure gauges, pneumatic brakes and more. Every single aspect of locomotive construction is studied, in considerable but accessible technical depth.

But if you are needing breeding, grooming, etc. questions answered, look for another more complete Maltese book."},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Maltese (Re Dog)","review":"This book is filled with useless information. The advise on how to care for your new puppy is horrible. The author tells you to put your new puppy on the floor and not to handle the puppy unless it's absolutely necessary. The author also advises you to leave your puppy in the kitchen and let him cry all night if that's what it takes.

Unfortunately this author seems to have disappeared. It has been a few years since I've read this book, but I recall being surprised by the ending, and the details in the book. It was an odd story, and kept me wanting more. Not a mystery, but a suspenseful and kind of creepy story. I recommend this to anyone who loves suspense or thrillers."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"This was a fun book to read. Kind of predictable, and could have omitted writing their full names all the time. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the storyline in this book."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"When things are too good to be true, they almost always are and that is the premise of this rather unrealistic book. It starts out well and the story is strong for the first half of the book. The story centers around Gunn Henderson, an enormously successful salesman, who receives an excellent job offer with perks far beyond anything that he had ever expected. As with something this good, there are always many things that will be expected of him as well as sacrifices that will be made by his family. The story loses its momentum when the writer begins explaining the machinations as well as the motivations of the characters behind this elaborate charade. The story is so far fetched that it is laughable in many ways. It is somewhat like a poor B movie, at the sake of being impolite to the genre. Although this book is placed in the Suspense Category, it never really makes it. The characters are not well developed and it is difficult to comprehend one who is successful in his line of work making such a radical career move. All in all, this is fast harmless reading ehich, if taken as such, is passable escapism. It would be folly for the reader to for much more."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"I couldn\`t put this one down!

Just when you have it figured out Thomas Simpson throughs a new twist in there.

Maybe it would have been bettter if the central theme had been kept more of a secret. Possibly it would have been better if the husband of the protaginist had more positive character traits. Certainly it would have been a better read if the author had used more complex sentences; the narritive did not flow, style was an obstacle to enjoyment.

Not only was the plot far fetched, but it was dull, dull, dull. If &quot;Brady&quot; was so obsessed with revenge, he did a poor job of showing it; it's hardly considered revenge when you put your enemy into an expensive luxury home while paying for his children's private school tuition.

Buy something else."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"Since the first page till the end, this book has the perfect crime, &quot;More know the devil for old than for devil&quot;, is the first book that I read that since the beginning is telling you part of the finish, that keeps you interested in the story all the time, and as I like from many writers, T.W. Simpson doesn't put Sam like a woman that doesn't know what to do and how to handle any particular situation, I like when the women can defend their selves alone or almost alone, and at the end you will see how to do a perfect crime... many times.SIX STARS FOR THIS ONE"},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"Inch by inch, layer by layer, Mr. Simpson builds upon a story that, more than anything else, reveals the frailties of man's character to allow revenge, greed, suggestion, and lust interfere with his own success. The Caretaker shows how even the most elaborate bluff resorts to chaos, manipulation (even by those you'd imagine or appear to be the most unlikely to twist one's life) and death. Allowing hints to creep into the narrative Simpon produces a story that will keep the reader turning the pages, allowing the mind to carve its own story. The ending, though mostly not a surprise, will lend the reader to sigh a big &quot;oh, oh&quot;, wishing that the next book by Simpson produces a sequel to The Caretaker. All in all, a book well done."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"Strange that this book was either praised or considered as trash by earlier reviewers.

It is poorly written and the shifting point of view(sometimes within a single paragraph) is extremely annoying. The author's habit of having the narrator inject his own commentary is also incredibly irritating. I am a Creative Writing major in California and I have read better stories from beginning writers. The only saving grace for this book is the fact that if there are editors out there willing to publish this drivel, I can look forward to being published as well, easily.

It's not worth the price."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"The first 200 pages I was tempted to just take it back to the library, but I stuck it out to the bitter end probably hoping that it would improve.

A huge salary, and amazing new home, and a product that should be a huge seller--it all sounds too good to be true, and it (of course) turns out not to be true.Lurking in the background is a caretaker with an old score to settle, and the salesman, an obnoxious jerk, will be the one who suffers most, but not until he makes his wife's life miserable.&quot;The Caretaker&quot; does not deal with a life-or-death threat throughout the majority of the salesman's torment, and the writing is not crisp enough to make the story one worth caring about. Nor is there any reason particularly to care about the financial and professional destruction of the salesman."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"I picked this book with several others at my local bookstore, I started reading it right away, I have the habit of switching books whenever I lose interest in a book, but this never happend. The story is interesting fast paced, neat plot twists, it's really a page turner. Even John Grisham would be impressed.. Only problem I had was the the forshadowing by the author, that was done in such a cheesy way..We know that there is more to the caretaker than meets they eye..but does he have to keep repeating it!

I found the ending very disappointing, and leaving a lot of loose ends. For example what happened to Gunn's parents? It also seemed to me as if the author had had enough of writing the story, and just wanted to get it over with. I don't think the ending was logical and not at all in character of the main characters. Gunn is not a very altruistic guy, why would he take the blame for the murder? And his wife. I didn't find it believable her killing the caretaker.

The characters are typical, though because Simpson is as untalented as he is perverted, he manages to make them ten times more boring than if they'd been modeled by someone else. For some reason, he believes he can make up for his lack of interesting content by repeating the full names of his characters and their alternates without cessation. This grows dull rather quickly, as does his writing style (if it could be called that), his plot (or the lack thereof), and the entire mess in general. If anyone has enjoyed this &quot;book&quot; (is it even?),I seriously question their ability to form any sort of opinion at all.

The characters are typical, though because Simpson is as untalented as he is perverted, he manages to make them ten times more boring than if they'd been modeled by someone else. For some reason, he believes he can make up for his lack of interesting content by repeating the full names of his characters and their alternates without cessation. This grows dull rather quickly, as does his writing style (if it could be called that), his plot (or the lack thereof), and the entire mess in general. If anyone has enjoyed this &quot;book&quot; (is it even?),I seriously question their ability to form any sort of opinion at all. If you haven't had the misfortune of reading this waste of paper and ink, then please don't make the mistake of doing so now."},{"Title":"The Caretaker (Nova Audiobooks)","review":"Interesting plot with a story that moves with good speed. Characters are slowly fleshed out which holds the reader to the building suspense."},{"Title":"How to Start and Manage a Printing Business: A Practical Way to Start Your Own Business","review":"The book is too basic and it is more focused towards buying any kind of business. I was expecting more."},{"Title":"How to Start and Manage a Printing Business: A Practical Way to Start Your Own Business","review":"I am sad to say that anyone who thinks they will learn anything about the current state of the printing industry will be sorely mistaken.This is one of about one hundred (100) titles that are listed by Mr. Lewis and his co-author Mr. Leslie Renn.The sparse amount of information in the book goes back to the mid-seventies, and highlights the basic steps to starting a business. Then, using \\"search and replace\\" technology, the authors remove \\"lemonade stand\\" and replace it with \\"printing shop\\" through the extremely dry text.1. I can only guess that the text is 25 or more years old, despite the use of a 2007 copyright inside of the cover, since the equpment list shows a pick-up truck for $5,000.00, a calculator for $75.00 & an electric typewriter, (which has been replaced by an item called a computer) that only exists in most outdated or highly specialized businesses.2. The book's principle text seems to to incorporate typographical errors as a standard. I know, think about all that money you saved on proofreading. (\\"Authority is the fuel that makes the machine go when you delegate WORD and responsibility.\\" Page 56, 2nd Paragraph ) [Editor's Note: A review of the page by a discerning literate person will suggest the word \\"work\\" is the most likely replacement available.]3. The text is not consistent with our times, since \\"keymen\\" is not only a typo, but is considered sexist language. (Therefore, key/men should be \\"key people.\\")4. The statistical data referenced in Appendix C refers to dates like 1978...making the information herein practically obsolete.I have saved my greatest grievance for last;5. The text in the non-appendiced chapters has nothing to do with the title of the book, and were written in an overly simplistic language, perhaps the only language that the authors had available at that point in their respective lives.Throw away Appendix C & one can use this text to run any business.The language in this book on printing shops should have primarily focused on business-to-business basics. (Do I really care whether my business-owning customer has a son or a daughter for a child?) More importantly, the authors should have interviewed a series of print shop owners to provide a list of relevant pitfalls as well as opportunities.Purchase this so-called book, only if you are needing a bound pseudo-tome to absorb any spilled liquid in your place of printing."},{"Title":"How to Start and Manage a Printing Business: A Practical Way to Start Your Own Business","review":"There is no legitimate reason to purchase this book.Do not be fooled by the 2007 copyright. It is based on an entire series of books that are published on cheap paper using the \\"search and replace\\" method of writing.The data is from the mid-70's and makes no serious mention or effort to qualify what effect technology has had on this industry. The main body of text is general and has no benefit to the potential print shop operator.I hope you'll find a better resource somewhere else."},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"Underneath that sunny smile and cheery voice is an intelligent and determined woman with a good sense of humor. Thanks to Eleanor Burns and her long term dedication to her craft, strip quilting keeps getting better and better. This hardbound book is filled with great pictures of many of her best ideas- \\"simplify the process, be brave, and enjoy your own creativity.\\" Quilt top piecing becomes a breeze because her directions are explicit, logical and easy to follow even if you are a novice. Warning, if you ever listen to her on t.v. her voice and demeanor may drive you a bit bonkers. None the less, Eleanor is a quilting expert worth her weight in gold. Her methods always make patterns that look difficult, easier for big chickens like me!"},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"I just received this book. Flipping through the pages - I am very impressed with the instructions. This book can be used by beginners and seasoned quilters alike. The book has finished quilt pictures and illustrations to go with the instructions (which makes it much easier to understand). It gives the yardages and finished dimensions of each quilt. There are approximately 17 patterns. The book also has a suggested general supplies list (rulers etc.) and finishing instructions (which include binding instructions). I have not attempted any of the patterns yet, but am looking forward to it. This book is very organized and is very easy to understand."},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"As many people have said, the book gives measurements for several sizes of quilts and while that is very helpful, it gets tiring having to go back to the pages to see which size piece you need. After giving you this information and allowing you to precut all of your pieces, she really ought to refer to the sizes of the piece in the instructions, ie: Using the 2 1/2\\" Star Point strips... do this.... I found it distracting to have to go back to those pages and hunt for the description of the piece I needed. Also... the corners on one quilt don't work out as well as you would believe from the instructions in the book, I spent about two hours trying in vain to get nice flat seems from a point that had eight pieces of fabric joining together."},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"The book was received in good time. A company I'll do business with again. Unfortunately the postal service folded the book in half, ruining the spiral binding as well as wrinkling the front and back covers.

Very irritating but definitely NOT the fault of the seller."},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"I'm new to quilting(just one year) and I found this book to be extremely helpful.

Could have saved lots of money if I had purchased this book first."},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"This book has good photos of the 13 quilts and one pillow sham included. The instructions also appear to be simple enough for a beginner like me, and include fabric selection advice as well as places to glue scraps of the fabric you plan on using for your own reference. Each quilt instruction has multiple drawings illustrating the step-by-step instructions.There are several different size options given for each quilt, including: \\"Single Block\\", \\"Pillow\\", \\"Tablerunner\\", \\"Wallhanging\\", \\"Lap/Twin\\", \\"Full/Queen\\", \\"King\\", although not all quilts included in the book have every size listed. As a note, there are several pages where some of the directions have been covered by stickers giving slightly different measurements, this seems to have been done by the publisher and doesn't really detract from the book's value as a teaching guide.However I could do without all the \\"memories\\" and photographs of the author's family and business sucesses, but as far as actual quilting patterns and directions the book looks helpful. This is a book which should give every level of machine quilter from beginner to experienced something new to sew."},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"This is a great book for a beginning quilter. As is true with all of Ms. Burn's books, the instructions are clear, the book includes a lot of fantastic illustrations and the quilts are easy to make with strip piecing. I have made three of the quilts and they go together very quickly and easily.I downgraded the book to three stars because of the physical quality of the book. The copy I received apparently contained many, nmany errors, which had been corrected by pasting small pieces of paper with the corrections over the original type - I counted 25 \\"pastings\\" in all! The book LOOKED like a patchwork quilt on some pages! It also had some misnumbered pages (that were not corrected), as well as headings that were incorrect (wrong name of quilt in the heading). I also found errata sheets for one of the quilts on the Quilt-in-a-Day website.This was a hardcover copy and I was very disappointed that the publisher (a) let so many errors thru to final copy; and (b) made me pay so much money for a book that had so many typoes and \\"patches\\".

I have ideas for all the bedrooms in our home also and fell in love with a lovely quilt that I simply MUST make for a queen size bed,,,,and b/c I am not so great at getting those colors together yet,,,I will probably use the same color scheme for one or 2 of the quilts just b/c they are SO pretty!,I ordered the DVD from Quilt in a day and it helps but is not necessary b/c the book is really filled w/ all the information you will need~I cannot speak highly enough about Eleanor Burn's teaching style! She makes you feel comfortable whether you are going thru the book or watching one of her DVD's, and actually this book is* So* well written,,,,,that you really would not have to have the DVD to help out!Being so new to this ,, I am surprised that I could understand this clearly~ I wonder why so many other books make it look SO difficult? Is it b/c they want to look complicated?? I just dont understand that~Just follow the directions in this book and you will be fine~I very much appreciate the different quilts in this book, and plan to make most of them for our home, for the grandchildren and for a vacation home also~ ( that place has a northwoods theme, so the new log cabin quilt in there is PERFECT for our quilt just what I want! )I was not going to do the heart quilt but after studying how cleverly this was done, I decided to do a few pillows for the window seats in our BD(at home) in our colors when I get to our quilt ( oh yes,,,,,,I DO plan to do one for us this year!)I have always dreamed of a dresden blue and yellow quilt and while It does not follow thru w/ the rest of the colors in our home I have to do this b/c I bought a lot of lace for window treatments in Germany( they have really different kinds than we have here) and I want to be reminded of our trips and memories there! DH is asking me to start picking out paint colors and the window treatments are already sewnI also see some patriotic wall hangings for various times of the year as well as a Christmas tree skirt in my future!( the tree skirt is not in the book but I do not need a round one , I can easily drape a rectangular quilt nicely under the tree~)I am starting the 9 patch party for my DGD as she wanted something more contemporary , and I thought about colors that would work for her that would carry her for a few years( she is a tween) I was totally LOST! I had the lovely ladies at the QIAD shop in Kentucky help me out w that,,,, and will forever be a customer b/c of their kindness and help! THe kit they put together is something I could not have done ( yet!) but I am sure I will get to that point soon~To my delight I also found another quilt( and color combo) that I have to make! I have really wanted this for our foyer for a long time,,,page 97 in the book, the quilt w/ the dark green background~ DH will be making me a holder w/ a shelf after we searched the net and saw how easy it was ( for him) to do,,,,,,time to put all those wood tools in the garage to good use!I do sew more than a few hours each evening , so I can get these projects done in good time~,I know that it is up to the individual to select their own colors and their own patterns to make their quilt to please themselves. that is what makes each quilt pattern so lovely and why you wont get bored w/ this book, I have decided to do all the quilts in this book in one way or another ( bed, hanging , lap throw etc)NONE of these quilts in this book are very difficult to cut and stitch up, any beginner could jump right in there and get it done ,,,,,,in fact the 9 patch party( which I am sewing) may be a great teaching tool for my grandaughter~We will be doing a small doll quilt on her little sewing machine~( which was a gift from us this year,,,,I really wanted her to start sewing and she had talked about it for quite some time~I appreciate all that Eleanor Burns has contributed to the quilting industry , if it was not for her or her way of simplifying methods, I would have ZERO desire to quilt!I have 3 of her books now,,,,,,the Log Cabin in a Day book, the Quck Trip book( which I LOVE!) and now this one! I am good for many years to come~Now,,,,,,if only the price of quality cotton would come down just a bit,,,I would be very happy b/c this is very habit forming and the quilting cottons are SO cute they make up the cutest summer skirts EVER!Love the book,,,Love Eleanor's teaching style and love the finished quilts,,,what more can you ask for?? Maybe to meet her someday and tell her myself just what a difference she has made in terms of me quilting??,,, Or that I think she is simply a treasure and has helped many like myself have confidence enough to start and finish some lovely hand made heirlooms for our families???I guess I can only hope to meet her at one of the quilt shows and tell her myself~If you read thru how she built up her company from absolutely nothing( literally scraps!!) and the hard times she endured, you will have nothing but the utmost respect for her as I do.What an inspiration she is to women who find themselves in terrible circumstances beyond their control, and how she took that negative time in her life to turn it around ,to build a life for herself and her 2 sons!Think of what she taught her sons! I have to believe that they deeply admire a mom who took on the job of raising 2 boys completely on her own~ I believe that all those cornerstones in her life were given to her by God, to help her be where she is today!We all love you Eleanor,,, and thanks for making it easy for us who have a harder time learning some techniques , you have made goals attainable for us! I hope you are blessed w/ health and happiness for many years to come! Your story ( and quilts ) are as amazing as you are!"},{"Title":"Still Stripping After 25 Years","review":"Eleanor Burns is wonderful.

So, this was a really great way to introduce her.Since she liked this one so much, she's checked out at least 7 other Dolittle books, so I'm quite grateful to Books of Wonder that they re-did this one and the Story of Dr. Dolittle with the Michael Hague illustrations; they opened a whole world to my daughter, and she can read through a couple of pages at a time herself now that she's 8. Also, we read aloud as the bedtime story, and there's plenty to talk about as far as different time, era, animal behavior, friendship etc. I'd never seen any Hague illustrations before and I was bowled over by them myself.

The whole series is a fantastic adventure, this one keeps the tension up right from the start. The book is filed with great characters, the Doctor and all his animals are beautifully written as is Bumpo the son of an African King.

A great classic"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"Some brief words about the Kindle edition (the $0.00 one taken from an etext in the public domain).First off, no illustrations. My five year old does not seem to mind even though we started this book on a library edition with great color plates (that we had to return because of a hold!) Unlike some other classics, though, the illustrations were never the main event with the Hugh Lofting books.Secondly, in terms of the objectionable language, with respect to racist terms we try to avoid using with our kids in the 21st century. The \\"N\\" words have been excised from this one, but the contexts are still racist, with a lot of referrals to Dolittle as White in contrast to somebody else's implicitly inferior otherness. It's quaint and difficult to read without context, so I find myself reading ahead as we read aloud to make on-the-fly changes to keep the really odd stuff out. While I feel for the people who decry censorship of classics, this is a kid's book, and without the context of reading, say, Tom Sawyer, or even Rudyard Kipling, there's no way younger readers aren't going to get a little taste of vinegar if they read an unexpurgated version. The Kindle edition is perfectly adequate on this front, if not optimal.Finally, typos: there's about one every sixth or seventh page, more or less. I don't know whether this was the original etext, original edition, or the kindle-ized version, but they're moderately annoying. However, I am not complaining based on what I paid for this version!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"Doc Dollitle is a very good book it has a total adventure backlot.

I will definitely use this seller again if I have a choice."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"&quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; is the 1923 winner of the John Newbery Medal, the annual award given to the author of the fictional work which makes the most outstanding contribution to children's literature among all books published in the U.S. The Newbery Medal was first awarded in 1922, so it was a very new competition when &quot;Dolittle&quot; was selected.I'll go out on a limb here and disagree with practically everyone who's reviewed this book: I found &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; to be utter nonsense from beginning to end. Preposterous situations, ridiculous conversations between animals and people, a talking dog on the witness stand in a courtroom, and a snail whose shell holds enough oxygen for several humans to travel underwater from the South Atlantic to England all combine to create a story too fantastic for me to stomach. There were far fewer books written specifically for children early in the 20th century; the competition must have been nothing compared to today!This book is, however, an easy read and perhaps would interest younger readers who like animals and who can embrace the idea of animals who can talk like--amd with--humans.Synopsis: 10-year-old Tommy Stubbins meets the famed Dr. John Dolittle and begins working for him, then convinces his parents to let him be apprenticed to Dolittle. Tommy then accompanies the naturalist on a two-year research mission to Spidermonkey Island, their intended destination in the South Atlantic Ocean, to investigate the disappearance of Long Arrow, son of Golden Arrow. Their ship the &quot;Curlew&quot; is broken up in a tropical storm, but Tommy, Dr. Dolittle, and Bumpo Kahboo, (crown prince of Jolliginki and old pal of Dolittle's) wash up on Spidermonkey Island. The floating island's inhabitants, the friendly Indian tribe Popsipetels, are attacked by the Bag-jagderags and the Terrible Three defeat the Bag-jagderags and make a peace treaty. Dolittle is crowned King Jong Thinkalot, and the natives' cheers cause a boulder at Whispering Rocks to fall into the Deep Hole, making the island stationary (and therefore safe). The Great Glass Sea-Snail is injured in his escape from the Deep Hole and is nursed back to health by Dolittle. The snail then transports the English party back to Puddlesby-by-the-Marsh by crawling along the ocean floor, thus helping Dolittle escape the Indians and their island. The doctor's parrot Polynesia carefully plans their getaway to be disguised as King Jong's &quot;vacation,&quot; when in reality he just wants off the fantasy island.Man! I would too!! See, doesn't it sound like somebody ate too many raw onions before going to bed one night? What a nightmare! Now, before you think I'm just an old crank, you should realize that I didn't like the book when I was a kid; why would I like it now? Some things never change--and neither do some people."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"This was a very fascinating book.

However, when the hardcover copy printed by Kessinger Publishing (no date) arrived, I was disappointed to find that not only does it contain no illustrations, but it looks almost like a textbook. It is housed in an a very unattractive plain blue cover, and the font and layout made me feel like it was a homework assignment.

I did like this better than the first book as having the young boy as the narrator made the story more interesting. Some things like polar bears in the Atlantic make no sense, but there are a few clever twists that make up for it."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"It was great.

It is a wonderful gift for a child. I gave it to a 10-year-old for Christmas. We'd been reading the book together from my old copy, so he loved getting his own copy with pictures. He finished it on his own right away. I never get tired of this book or the history behind it. I highly recommend it. This is a lovely edition of the book."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"Best book that I ever read I couldn't put the book down and I read it twice. Great book! Woohoo!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"It's hard to beat this book for all-out imaginative craziness. Oddly enough, other than talking animals, there is very little fantasy in this book, rather, Lofting chose to make Dr. Dolittle and his surroundings a calm place, a place where the animals talk to him, a place where adventures happen, but where there is never any brutal violence, unlike the adventures of Alice in Wonderland or Dorothy in OZ (both of which I like, BTW). What is really nice is that Lofting was able to make this formula WORK!This edition, pink covers with a credit to Christopher Lofting, has been edited from it's original issue to remove some now offensive racial stereotypes and illustrations. I'm glad to say that, while I generally do not support this type of editing, in this case it was well done and did not subtract from the entertainment value of the book.Note: The original Dr. Doolittle books have almost nothing in common with the Eddie Murphy movies, other than talking animals. Don't get them confused!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"This is the second Newbery Award winner. In an effort to read all the Newbery books in order, I picked this up at my local library. I read this book as a child and it held me captive. Now (age 30) I finished it in two nights instead of one, but that's because I'm a &quot;responsible&quot; adult. I'm going to stop and peruse the rest of the Dr Dolittle books. This is a wild ride of adventure that's so much fun you'll willingly suspend belief that shellfish can talk. My favorite character is Bumpo because he's so well-educated. You'll have to read it as an adult to really appreciate that. Sorry kids."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I read all the Dr. Dolittle books as a child and LOVED them-- I was captivated by the premise of being able to talk to animals as well as by the exciting adventures. However, I was not prepared for what I found in &lt;The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle&gt; (1951 printing) as I was reading it to my son the other night. In Chapter 5 (p. 36), Polynesia the parrot is catching Dr. Dolittle up on the goings-on back in Africa. She tells him that one of the African kings they know has sent his son to study at Oxford. She further comments that the Prince didn't want to go, fearing that he would be eaten by white cannibals. She then states, &quot;You know what those niggers are--that ignorant!&quot; Judging by the fact that this is not mentioned in the other reviews that I read on this site, I imagine this troubling line has been excised from more recent printings (such as those available on Amazon.com). I suggest that you make sure you purchase a more recent printing of this book, particularly if a child is going to be reading it on his/her own. As I continue reading the book to my son it will be interesting to note whether or not the portrayal of black characters in the book will be problematic as well . . . amz"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L.

It has creatures that you only see in your dreams and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys animals."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"This 1922 childhood classic by Hugh Lofting is related by 10-12 year old Tommy Stubbins, the son of a poor cobbler. Totally swept up in the new science of Natural Studies, Tommy rises from client (with a wounded squirrel) to apprentice, despite his parents' reluctance. From the moment the boy meets Dr. John Doolittle of Puddleby-on-Marsh Tommy's life will never be the same; he will experience the natural and geologic wonders of the world as he accompanies the learned Dr. Doolittle on voyages of exploration.Respected as an eminent Naturalist this middle-aged bachelor keeps a veritable menagerie in his home and in his private, backyard zoo. Animals truly love this man because of his kindness and compassion, his medical skills, plus his generosity with his time, talents and modest resources. But there is a more compelling reason for his zoological success: this man can actually Talk with most species of the animal kingdom!Eventually Tommy finds himself onboard a newly-purchased ship called THE CURLEW, as the Doctor embarks on a voyage of discovery and rescue across the Atlantic. Seeking a mysterious, floating isle called Spider Monkey Island, and the vanished Long Arrow--an unappreciated naturalist in his own, Native American world. The pair enlist the aid of Bumpo, an African prince who has studied in England. But it is the Dcotor's devoted animal companions who prove invaluable, on both sides of the ocean: Dab Dab the housekeeper Duck; Jip the dog; Chee Chee, the African chimp; Polynesia, the brains of the outfit; and Miranda, the exotic messenger bird of paradise.Tommy faithfully records these incredible experiences for generations of children (of all ages) to enjoy: the trial of a man accused of murder in a Mexican mine; a wager about bull fighting on a Spanish island; stowaways and a shipwreck; rescue of trapped Indians; a war and reconstruction--white man style; Indians buried alive; the dilemma of the white man's burden, and a fantastic submarine, trans-Atlantic crossing. Lofting includes a mild satire on British institutions, food habits and climate. Yet he offers a serious sub-theme of the role/effect of White man upon native cultures: is it morally necessary to \\"Civilize\\" native cultures? This delightful fantasy is easy to read and this 1950's edition offers curious pen and ink sketches typical of the early 20's-a true Kid Klassic!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I loved the Dr. Dolitle series as a child and am glad to see some of it is still available.

The trick is to only get Dolittle books with a second author. So we have Scholastic Junior Classics version - it's terrific, and you can count on Scholastic to scrub it clean."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"Although I loved the story about a man being able to talk to and understand animals, I found the racial stereotypes offensive. This is similar to the situation I found when I read Huckleberry Finn many years ago. Also, I found the use of a Jew as the pawnbroker to be offensive (although I haven't read any other comments about that situation). While I didn't read Dr. Dolittle to my children, I am debating reading it to my granddaughter just because it was lots of fun to read and brought me lots of smiles. It is a very easy book to read, very lighthearted and although it is not a short book, I read it very quickly in less than two days.

My kids like Polynesia the best -- she's a straight-talker. This book offers insight into human nature, through the non-threatening commentary on how the animals are acting.The animals in this book are really people... I guess I can understand where people would consider this an animal-rights type of book, but the fact that these are talking animals who make shopping lists, and use reason, and pay the bills... it's a frolic."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"This book was one of the first books I ever read cover to cover in grade school. This book, and the others in the series, made a reader out of me. There is no comparison to the Eddie Murphy movies. I even begged my parents in 1967 to take me to the movie staring Rex Harrison, and was sorely disappointed, even then.

This one is about his travels with the interesting animals who are his friends and companions. Hugh Lofting has managed to capture the human characteristics we sometimes see in animals and turn them into memorable figures. Dr. Dolittle's mode of travel is intriguing; the places he visits are fun and funny and exciting.Continue to read this series. The many attempts at cinematic shortcuts to the stories fall short when compared with the real work. The charm of his adventures can be captured in no other way than a good read."},{"Title":"World Class Teams: Working Across Borders","review":"Lynda C. McDermott, Nolan Brawley and William W. Waite present an excellent guide to creating effective cross-functional teams that operate across international boundaries. This hands-on book is directed to those involved in setting up, leading or coaching teams. While the authors include some intriguing examples of successful teams, this is more of a workbook that describes the procedures for setting up teams and measuring their performance. Practical executives will find lists of questions to ask and steps to take in this well-organized description of the managerial process, from setting up teams to rewarding successful efforts. The book is clearly written, despite some long, unwieldy sentences. We [...] recommend this solid book to managers and executives, team leaders, human resource and organizational development professionals, and other participants who contribute to or benefit from the work of international teams."},{"Title":"DARK GHOSTS RISING","review":"I was surprised by this man's great literary span.

I think I will be thinking of these characters and the situations they found themselves in for a very long time.

It goes beyond women's studies alone, maintaining that elements unnatural to Native ways of knowing have been imposed on the study of Native America elements consisting of European prejudice and male privilege.

A fine approach which adds different perspective to Native history and issues."},{"Title":"Memory (Phoenix Award Book (Awards))","review":"This is an amazing portrayal of the relationship between a ninteen year old &quot;loser&quot; and an old woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Margaret Mahy's young adult books are all wonderful, but &quot;Memory&quot; stays with you long after you have read it. Mahy manages to put magic into her novels even when not dealing with magic. When she does deal with magic, it seems natural and everyday. Try her novel &quot;Changeover&quot; if you want to see this in action. This is a book that you can read as a young adult and reread as an adult and it hasn't lost anything."},{"Title":"Memory (Phoenix Award Book (Awards))","review":"I love this book. I bought it for myself this spring and I'm giving it for a Christmas present. Mahy always writes with a powerful emotional impact. It's true her stories have some hints of real life sadness in them. But those touches are the reason why the efforts and triumphs of the hero or heroine are so satisfying and triumphant. Mahy's books aren't just for young adults. I'm no young adult, nor is the person I'm giving the book to for Christmas. This story is one a mother could enjoy reading with her daughter. There is so much to dicuss in this story of a kid on a drunk who shows compassion to a stranger. When we realize the stranger has Altzheimer's we know the woman could have been our own grandmother. The terrific story has more impact that a hundred lectures on kindness."},{"Title":"Memory (Phoenix Award Book (Awards))","review":"On the fifth anniversary of his sister's death, 19-year-old Jonny Dart is looking for someone. He is drunk and beat up and searching for someone he has not talked to in five years but with whom he shares a moment he cannot forget. He is searching for Bonny, the only other witness to his sister's death. He manages to stumble through the streets to the house where her parents live.Drunk and bruised and bloody is not the best way to show up at someone's house asking for their daughter's address, so instead they have a friend take him to the nearest main road where he can catch a taxi home. But Jonny never makes it to the taxi. He wakes up the next morning on the traffic island where he was dropped. Sick and disoriented and with little memory of the night before, he begins to wander.\\"Suddenly, with childish horror, he saw another movement in the [storefront] glass...Something rippled towards him... another inhabitant...A stunted person in a long coat was pushing a supermarket cart along the diagonal opposite to the one he was taking. A moment later he made out a short, thin old woman wearing a hat like a crimson chamber pot without a handle. Strands of grey hair hung around her ears... He hesitated and stood completely still so that the old lady could walk past him, but instead she cam right up to him, staring at him, smiling, as if she were waiting for him to begin a conversation. Jonny remained silent. In the end she was the one who spoke first. \`Are you the one?' she asked.\\"And so the first of many small events of fate or destiny or some strange supernatural power occur to pull Jonny Dart into Sophie's surreal world of missing memories, mistaken identities, misplaced people and a world out of time.Jonny thinks he will just follow Sophie to her home, to make sure she gets there safe, but when she invites him in for a cup of tea (which she never remembers to put the tea in) he is sucked into a world which to Jonny is both repulsive, fascinating, and strangely comforting in its disorder. He is immediately assaulted by the smell, the possible sources of which are too many to sort out: Sophies many, many cats that share her house, unwashed dishes, wet bedsheets, perhaps the dead bird in the pie plate which has occupied the refrigerator for who knows how long or maybe it was just Sophie herself. Nothing is as it should be in Sophie's house. Cheese is in the soap dish. The pigeonholes of the desk are occupied by an assortment of eggshells, orange peels, an old toothpaste tube, a crochet-covered coat hanger, and hair curlers. The only food to be found is the tea-less tea and several opened bags of cookies. But the \\"as it should be\\" world is something Jonny longs to escape, or maybe it's that he's never felt a part of it, and he feels a strange kind of comfort and safety in the unnatural order of Sophie's house.More than once, Jonny decides to leave, and more than once something prompts him to return. He becomes Sophie's reluctant yet self-appointed protector, and the forces that pulled him into Sophie's world of lost memories lead him at last to Bonny and through his own haunting memories."},{"Title":"Memory (Phoenix Award Book (Awards))","review":"Margaret Mahy's charaters think in unusual and compelling ways.

He also uses standard histories of the time, such as Josephus' Antiquities, the works of Philo, and the Dead Sea Scrolls.What makes this extensive work such a relief and a delight are the extensive annotations of the author: accurate citations are always given (I checked); end notes are given, describing all sources, and giving dates, or approximate dates. There is a bibliography of modern sources as well. Most importantly, each time a midrash or other commentary is inserted into the text of the Torah, Kugel gives us a most essential bit of information: he tells us what the problem is with that text that the commentator feels needs explaining.It is not always obvious to a reader 2,000 years later what a certain rabbi's problem was with a text that prompted him to write the several lines of commentary he left us. The work Kugel has done-- his gift to us, is to climb into the minds of these people in a different place, discover what their concerns were, and deduce what parts of the texts would have caught their attention and for what reason. Since none of his interpretations (at least none I have looked-- and I've looked at most of them) seem forced or overly creative, I believe this is the work of a great scholar. I cherish it, and I thank him much."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"This book would be more accurately titled &quot;The Torah As It Was&quot;, but this minor complaint aside, I can only say, &quot;What a book!&quot; The extremely informative introduction lays out the plan: Mr. Kugel is giving us a glimpse into how the Torah, or at least a number of major events in it, were interpreted by a wide variety of authorites during the so-called intertestamental period, from approximately 200BCE-100CE. He takes an event, the Flood, say, and martials an array of quotes regarding one or another aspect of the story from a truly dizzying variety of authors. Extra-biblical interpretive strains are indicated by words or phrases printed in boldface type. It is fascinating to witness the process, as ambiguous texts metamorphose into moral instruction via interpretive discussion. The variety of creative, and sometimes mutually contradictory, uses to which the texts are put is amazing. It's also surprizing how many of these interpretations have stuck with us into the modern age. In addition to over 500 pages of well-presented interpretation, the 50-page listing of Terms and Sources, as well as the 30-page Bibliography, and comprehensive Index of sources cited, make this a truly useful and valuable resource for anyone interested in the Bible or the thought of this pivotal period in history. If all this isn't enough, the book itself (and keep in mind that I'm talking about a paperback here!) is a delight: from cover, to paper, to typeface, to engravings and illustrations, everything about this volume gives me pleasure as a reader and owner. Hats off to Harvard/Belknap. Too bad more publishers don't follow suit."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"This is a marvelous book. For readers of the Bible who think seriously about it, questions arise constantly. Some of these are old, well-known problems like &quot;Where did Cain's wife come from?&quot; Others may be less familiar like &quot;Why was the Brazen serpent which Moses made to cure snake-bites in the wilderness not a violation of the commandment against making images?&quot; One of the many wonders which Kugel reveals to those unfamiliar with biblical interpretation in antiquity is that such questions are not new. They were occurring to readers of the Bible more than 2000 years ago. Kugel has selected some of the most mystifying passages from the Torah and has collected ancient attempts to interpret these texts and fill in the gaps they create. Often, ancient interpreters, both Jewish and Chrisitan, were attempting to defend the biblical accounts against difficulties and inconsistencies. Some readers, like myself, may find that the ancients were a bit too eager to resolve all the tensions that arise in the Torah. Nevertheless, Kugel's compendium allows us conveniently to read the Bible along with some of the great Bible readers from the period within a couple of centuries on each side of the turn of the eras, and such an opportunity is a delight."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"\\"The Bible as it was\\" is a wonderful and exhaustive work regarding scriptural interpretation and the first five books of the Bible. Early Jewish tradition was to fill in interpretive information when necessary to resolve items that were ambiguous or unclear. In addition, notes and commentary were often passed along with the texts and over time tended to become a part of the text. As a result, the Bible of today includes a lot of commentary as well as the original texts.Kugel's purpose is to try to reconstruct the Bible as it was in its original form as closely as possible. While we all know that no copies of the original Bible exist today, the King James version was based on the Textus Receptus which was a Greek translation of the Bible and considered the oldest reliable source at the time. Since then there have been many archaeological finds of manuscripts from earlier points in time and in the original Hebrew language. Many of these passages differ somewhat from current translations. In theory, the older versions should be closer to the original version. Working from the oldest texts he examines some of the differences in the way passages were interpreted and what that could mean. This gets us closer to an original version without all the intervening thoughts and interpretations that earlier writers had added in an attempt to make it more understandable and applicable to the people of their time.Dr. Kugel thoroughly documents his work complete with quotes, sources and annotations as appropriate.A fascinating book that sheds new light onto many passages it should be read by anyone attempting a serious and scholarly study of the Bible."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"The author shows how Jews living in the years before and after the birth of Christ interpreted the Pentateuch and why they did so.

By pointing out the many ways that the modern reading of the text differs from the reading in the early rabbinic period he is able to document the ways that our apporach to the text as changed. Most interstingly, he shows how christian and muslim readings of the Hebrew Bible has colored Jewish understandings and thus deeply effected Jewish theology."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"Dr. Kugel sets out to produce a mixture of ancient and modern interpretations and does a wonderful job at it. While most of the interpretations are ancient coming from interpreters such as Philo, and others, Dr. Kugel helps explain them more smoothly by writing a brief analysis of each interpretation presented. The Bible as it Was, is truly a great way to learn about different interpretations other than the ones you hear in church. It offers a variety of interpretations, so that the reader can make up his own mind. While this book offers interpretations of the text, it might also offer some hard times to the devoted Christian, if they are not willing to accept that there may be other interpretations of these narratives.This is a definite must have when studying the Old Testament, in particular the Pentateuch, or first five books. It does not go into later books of the OT, however, with the references provided, if the reader wanted to do more research on their own, then the references that Dr. Kugel lists in the back of the book will allow them to do so. If you are serious about learning the Pentateuch then pick this book up."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"f you have studied the Torah along with any major commentary you may note lots of ideas that are not obviously supported by the plain meaning of the text. In this book, Prof. Kugel discusses the historical roots and ideological assumptions underlying these ideas.To begin with, Kugel notes that the Hebrew Bible (including the Torah, as well as the Prophets and Writings) does not interpret itself. While all texts contain ambiguities, the Bible is especially so because it was originally written in vowel-less Hebrew, without punctuation. Thus, it is not even obvious what words are in the Bible, let alone how they fit together. Moreover, the Bible is hundreds of years older than its first post-Biblical interpreters whose work has survived.These interpreters disagreed on the meanings of much in Scripture. But they all shared four assumptions: (1) that the Torah is essentially cryptic - that is, that it has meanings that are not obvious from a quick reading of the text, (2) that the Torah, as a Divine document, is eternally relevant, (3) that the Torah is perfect, i.e. not internally inconsistent, and (4) that the Torah is Divinely written or inspired.Kugel's book has a chapter for each of about two dozen major Biblical episodes. As to each episode, he describes a few ambiguities and then explains how the earliest commentators whose work has survived addressed the issue.For example, the Torah writes that after the Golden Calf was shaped \\"Aaron saw, and he built an altar before it\\" (Exodus 32:4-5). The Hebrew letters for \\"saw\\" could also be read \\"was afraid\\". So some interpreters suggested that Aaron saw disorder that made him afraid.Most of Kugel's case studies come from the Torah's narrative portions; however, he occasionally addresses halachic issues, sometimes with fascinating results. For example, most informed Jews know that the \\"eye for an eye\\" reference in Exodus 21 has generally been interpreted to require monetary compensation for torts. But shortly after the Second Temple was destroyed, Josephus wrote: \\"One who mains someone will suffer the same ... unless the one who was maimed is willing to accept money. For the law permits the victim to establish damages for the incident, unless he wishes to be particularly severe.\\" This implies that some physical punishment was allowed in Second Temple times if it was not unreasonably \\"severe\\" and that the law later evolved towards a pure reliance on damages. (Because this statement occurs right after Josephus' discussion of kicking a pregnant woman, Kugel suggests that this rule was limited to intentional torts).What makes this book especially interesting, from a Jewish point of view, is that rather than focusing on medieval commentators he focuses on the very earliest commentators, people such as Philo and Ben Sira who wrote before the Mishna and Talmud (and in some cases, even before the destruction of the Second Temple) and are unknown to most modern Jews. The only thing I didn't like is that this is a pretty long book; I wonder if Kugel could have had fewer case studies and gotten the same issues addressed."},{"Title":"The Bible As It Was","review":"James Kugel states that the purpose of this book is \\" to offer a detailed look at how the Bible was interpreted in antiquity, to show what the Bible essentially was in that period.\\"The period in question was the closing century B.C. to the first few centuries A.D.Most of the material in THE BIBLE AS IT WAS relates to the Pentateuch or Torah. He covers some of the mysterious aspects of those books. Some of those subjects were:When were angels created? Where was the garden of Eden located?What was Nimrod? Who buried Moses?These are some of examples of the many subjects the reader will find in the book.I found this book to be fascinating and the author did a fantastic job of examining more than one perspective. He used both Jewish and Christian sources to look at various different interpretations of Scripture. He showed some subtle differences between the Septuagint and Hebrew.Terms and Sources is a helpful resource tool. You can read a description of some interesting, ancient literature.The 35 page Index of Scripture passages and other literature was another feature that I appreciate.This is the best Scripture-related book that I have read in a long time.

I think one should take advantage of any opportunity to gaze at religion from an ancient set of eyes.

The question is not one of proof, but of drawing conclusions based on a limited body of evidence, both from within the Bible and outside of it.\\" --James Kugel*In Kugel's own words:Kugel's guide to the Hebrew Bible unlike most others, guide the reader through its most important stories, demonstrating how a group of anonymous, ancient interpreters radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that exists today. Modern scholars have been sifting through new evidence for more than two centuries, into a growing body of writings discovered in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere. The extensive findings of archaeologists, whose excavations have been carried throughout the historical territory of the northern and southern kingdoms, in addition to adjacent Territories. Linguistic analysis of the historical development of biblical Hebrew, are of crucial importance, and the assignment of different biblical texts to various historical periods on the basis of their lexis (vocabulary) More recently, biblical texts syntax; close reading of specific biblical passages for agreement and disagreements with other passages, as well as their relationship to material outside of the Bible; and an increasingly detailed knowledge of the entire history of the ancient Near East.What God means to say?Professor Kugel declares, \\"Where I think they have been, on the whole, short-sighted or narrow-minded(Kugel means German Protestant Julius Wellhausen's discovery of the foursource Documentary Hypothesis model: Jahwist-Elohist-Priestly-Deuteronomist) is in the decidedly Protestant bias that has informed the whole orientation of modern scholarship and its understanding of the relationship between biblical research and Scripture's traditional place in our religions.\\" Dr. Phyllis Trible, president of the Society of Biblical Literature, a prominent Jewish scholar replies, \\"Inspired by Kugel's own research, it shows a line between interpretations within the Bible and those outside it, a line between the Bible as It Was and the Bible as It Was Not. In an interpretive twist worthy of Kugel's ancient predecessors\\"When was the Bible written?As a reply to my question, \\"In what inscription was the Decalogue written?\\" Moses did know but little spoken Hebrew, according to the book of Exodus. As proposed by Harvard's Cross, \\"Proto-Sinaitic, also known as Proto-Canaanite, was the first Hebrew consonantal alphabet. Most of the alphabets known today are descended from Phoenician. The immediate offspring of Phoenician were the old Hebrew alphabet, and Aramaic, as well as Archaic Greek. The Hebrew alphabet was also used by Moabites as well as Israelites. This alphabet, though, eventually disappeared from the mainstream, surviving as the Samaritan script, while Aramaic became extremely popular, and many Lavant people adopted it, at the time of Jesus.Even a quick and cursory glance at its inventory of signs makes it very apparent of this script's Egyptian origin. \\"The process of determining the original Hebrew alphabet is similar to the field of archeology where one digs down to hidden depths to determine the origins of an ancient culture.\\" (Ancient Hebrew Research Center)Mission not accomplished?James Kugel shows how a group of anonymous, ancient interpreters radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that has come down to us today. Kugel's main purpose for his book, is to provide a detailed look at how the first five books, the Torah, was interpreted, when revelation ceased (during the four hundred silent years). Unhappy with what he describes is 'a Protestant captivity of the (Hebrew) Bible', and of biblical scholarship over the last centuries, in contrast, to recover the ancient tradition of Midrash interpretion that gave us the Bible as it was. Professor J. Barrera wrote, \\"To assume that the Bible was central to the Jewish community and that it gave rise to intense midrashic activity is tantamount to refuse to acknowledge the importance which other institutions had in that period, such as the priesthood and the traditions transmitted by the priests. ..There is not enough information to state that reading the Torah in the synagogues favored the development of midrashic interpretation. Nor can it be supposed that the creation of midrash was an act of prime importance in Palestinean Judaism before the first cent.

It's about the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait and refuses to pull out. Why? Why risk an almost certain defeat....or is it? Is there something he knows that we don't know? This is the question bugging the allies. Enter Mike Martin, a brilliant SAS major who can pass as an Arab due to skin colour, hair and fluent arabic. The allies send him to Kuwait and then to Baghdad to run the Iraqi spy Jericho and seek out information. In here are the vintage Forsyth trademarks:great detail, engrossing plot and great blending of fact with fiction, combining to produce his greatest books since &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;! I hope that they make a mini-series instead of a movie as a 2-hour movie cannot do the book justice, it is simply one of the best books I have ever read! 10 out of 5 stars, definetely! A must-read!"},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"Before commenting, let me indicate that I am reviewing the abridged audio cassette version of this book performed by Mr. Simon Jones.This audio cassette version clearly deserves more than five stars. It is the most enjoyable one that I have ever listened to. In addition, this is my favorite of the Forsyth novels.Frederick Forsyth is a masterful plotter. In this case, he has woven a story that unusual complexity with delicate balance of perspectives using real details. I remember reading about everything mentioned in this book in some press report related to the Gulf War against the Iraqis after the invasion of Kuwait. The plot is so well done that it will add new depths to your understanding of the political considerations that played such a large role in the Gulf War. If government studies were written as interestingly as this novel is, all college students would be government majors. There is fascinating technology in the story, but the novel is reined in by large doses of realism that make the material more interesting for its relevance.If you are like me, you have often wondered about the following questions:(1) Why did Saddam Hussein survive the successful prosecution of the war by the allies?(2) How might target planners determine where weapons of mass destruction were being developed and housed?(3) Why did Saddam Hussein prepare so poorly for the U.S.-led attack?(4) Why did the Iraqis stop with Kuwait, when the more attractive target of Saudi Arabia lay just ahead essentially undefended?Mr. Forsyth offers a number of plausible and interesting possible answers to these and other questions you surely have had and may still have.To me, the drawback of a Forsyth novel is that they can become bogged down in too much detail. Foreign names can also quickly cause the eyes to glaze over as well. You will be pleased to know that this abridgement (approved by Mr. Forsyth) overcomes both of those potential problems. The elegant plot is tautly maintained, and moves along rapidly. Mr. Jones takes all of the tongue-twisting, unfamilar names and pronounces them in accented ways that capture the lyricism inherent in the various Middle Eastern and European cultures displayed here.I have only one complaint. Unfortunately, Mr. Jones chose to characterize many Americans as &quot;cowboys&quot; so those characters' raw, harsh accents will be the least attractive to listen to for you.Some of the most interesting aspects of the book for me included Major Mike Morgan's (of Britain's Special Air Service) operations behind enemy lines in Kuwait and Iran, the psychology of the inner council that served Saddam Hussein, the complicity of Western sources in making dangerous weapons available to the Iraqis, the methods by which many different types of intelligence sources can be used to build a composite picture of an issue, the morality of trying to save lives in combat, and the political agendas of the Americans. Israelis will find the operations of the Mossad described in ways that are highly complimentary about that country's intelligence operations.One of the really intriguing thoughts you will have after reading this book is what secrets are still being kept about American intentions towards Iraq.After you finish enjoying hearing this book read to you, I suggest that you find a veteran of the Gulf War who feels comfortable taling about it, and ask what her or his impressions are of what happened there. Although most of us watched this nightly on CNN, we have perhaps become too distanced from the fundamental horrors of war. This will be a good way to be sure that we learn the lessons that should be learned from this experience, and also honor those who served the world in the desert.May the fist of God always be relaxed into the open hand of God's peace."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"I usually do not post my reviews of books, but this book was so good I feel obligated to tell other potential readers to buy it.

From start to finish, this book kept me captivated with its characters and how they all interact and are intertwined. Forsyth does a great job in this book and paints a very grim picture of how close Iraq came to having a weapon of mass destruction.

Set around the time of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm in Iraq in 1990-1991 the story consists of several strands which come together through the novel as the existence of a secret weapon by Saddam is discovered by the allies.The central character is Major Mike Martin of the SAS who can pass for an Arab (having been brought up in Iraq with a half-Indian mother) and his brother Terry, an Arab historian who nevertheless helps SIS with identification of Saddam's weapons. The story includes the American CIA and an American bomber pilot, the British SIS and SAS and also the Israelis and their complicated plot to rob an Austrian private bank. Jericho, the Iraqi insider who is initially feeding information to the Israelis, is unmasked at the end of the book - and in fact I had forgotten who it was in this reading and was surprised again.Forsyth doesn't spend a lot of time on characterisation - this story is about detailed plotting with fascinating insights into how the Army, SAS and Intelligence communities work (at least fictionally). There's also some politics but it's not too overt (as, say, in a Patrick Robinson novel).

Was she the one who kept talking tough, convincing Bush that the US had to stop Saddam and go into Kuwait? Was our President as wishy-washy as this segment suggests? It would be wonderul to know just how close to the truth all these inside incident really are. I found myself intrigued with Forsythe himself - wondering if he had been in the Secret Service, or is just the best researcher ever. You find yourself pulling for Martin, marveling at his quick wits, and the way he managed to elude capture. Then you start thinking like a spy yourself...&quot;who's in that car behind me?&quot; Is anyone following me?

The basic story plot of does Saddam Hussein have an atomic bomb or not which he might use against the gathering Allied Forces all being located in a relatively small zone of the Saudi Arabian desert before they seek to retake Kuwait, is spread over 600 plus pages with many interlinking story lines.However what is shown as making the difference to the storyline is the wealth of data which Forsyth has researched or obtained and that adds sufficient authenicity to what otherwise in isolation one suspects would read as a very far fetched basic story premise. The plethora of technical details (especially on the operations of the US air force and the US, UK and Israeli secret services) give an overlay of authenicity to the whole story that does move the book along as a great read. While his love of the SAS comes on a bit too thick at times (he has been open in a recent interview as to the great access they granted him), his right wing biases show through (his covering of Thatcher's downfall as Tory Leader while the war was in preparation) and a story of the Gulf War that has no mention of any friendly fire incidents (given more Allied armed forces died this way than under Iraqi fire) seems blinkered, these do not attract from what is a very entertaining work of fiction.Sadly the poor follow up of his subsequent book \\"The Afghan\\" shows that we may have to wait some time for a repeat performance."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"This is, without a shadow of a doubt, a suspense novel of the highest extreme.

The exact same trick was used a decade ago by another British author, Gordon Stevens, but with more subtle clues.Apart from that, Forsyth should really have exercised some restraint. The narrative frequently halts for passages of pedantic detail. Also, some threads are needlessly long, the worst offender being the Israeli intrigue in Vienna, which is largely inconsequential. This really hurts the pace later in the book when brevity and smart use of narrative shortcuts would have helped in fostering the sense of urgency that the situation deserved."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"I have never read any of Forsyth's books before but this book encouraged me to go and search for more of his books.well done Monseiour Forsyth.

After reading this book, you will realise why Saddam Hussain took on the Bush regime and the Mossad and thought that he could win the Gulf War and so refused to pull out of Kuwait.

This book is a delightful synopsis of the original Gulf War; it's difficult to separate the fictional storyline from historical fact. Forsyth's account reads extremely well, with (boring) detail, unpronounceable and unmemorable Arabic names, and credible peeks into the workings of military intelligence.A few pieces that are not credible, though, is the insouciance with which military and intelligence analysts overlook and then dismiss as meaningless a weapons scientist and a nuclear plant. Only through the irresponsible and loose sharing of classified photos with more than a handful of inconsequential personalities is the &quot;dread truth&quot; understood and repeatedly brought back under the nose of the CIA/SAS folk. This reads like a Ms. Marples adventure and presents US and British intelligence as being dumber than sheep. Or maybe...It begs the questions: Was the demolition of Iraq in the early 90's incomplete, missing major weapons development sites? Are spies watching bank secretaries and ignoring WMD designers who roam freely elsewhere in the world for viable employment? I'd like to believe Forsyth's storyline is fantasy. Yet, more than a decade later, it seems George W. is using the plot of this thriller as justification for invading Iraq: to destroy all the other WMD facilities that nobody recgonized.If today's allied military technology can miss an elephant hiding in a pear tree, even though allied reconnaissance and surveillance systems are &quot;accurate enough to measure the inseam of an Iraqi pilot,&quot; then we could have saved the invasion, many lives, and more than $87 billion by sending Angela Lansbury's Jessica Fletcher to Iraq for a week or two."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"Forsyth once again shows why he is the master of espionage novels.

Forget Ludlum, Follet, and specially Clancy. No other writer manages to assemble the level of research - technical, historical, and biographical - that support and illustrate his stories. He is absolutely believable - he draws amazing plots and solves them without calling the reader stupid - Forget the sci-fi gadgets, rambo actions, and other easy way-outs that the Clancys of life plot to escape their own literary traps. Forsyth is subtle, smooth, classy - and yet you just can't drop the book. He knows all the tricks of the trade on spying.This book is the Master's masterpiece. Placed within a real context (as in Day of the Jackal, Odessa File, Fourth Protocol, etc.), with real, and accurate historical bacground and people, Forsyth's makes you believe that the underlying story he devised to account for the Gulf War has indeed happened .At a certain point, there is a mention of Bibi Netaniahu, former Israeli prime minister (even though Bibi had only a marginal appearance in the story), with full, accurate, biographical information (such as his brother commanding and dying at the Israeli rescue at Entebbe in the early 70's). The interesting part here is that the book was written much before Netaniahu took ofice and became well known - such is the degree of research and realism that Forsyth manages to assemble.A classic book, a must read. After Forsyth, you will find Ludlum OK, Follet nice but simplistic, and Clancy poor. Sure, Clancy knows military equipment like no one else.

There is his usual admiration for Mossad (the Israeli secret service) shining through, and in his explanations of various facets of all the secret services involved there is always the ring of truth (unlike Tom Clancy who reads like he read it in 'Time', Forsyth reads like he was actually there).

I liked the book a lot, especially the first half. The last half of the book begins to drag, and one ends up feeling that it is too long and that Frederick Forsyth himself was a bit tired of it by the time he reached the end.This story works very well at two levels - a high level conflict and various individual conflicts. The high level conflict involves Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the build-up to the Gulf War and the decisions being made by President Bush Sr. and Margaret Thatcher and the CIA and the British MI6. This conflict is very exciting, even though we know the final result: a coalition victory and Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.The individual conflicts consist of the fights between the various good guys and the Iraqi soldiers and agents of the Iraqi secret service and Iraqi counter-intelligence. There are also some Israeli Mossad agents involved just to make things more complicated.At the individual conflicts level the main good guy is Mike Martins, a British SAS soldier who is recruited by MI6 and who is inserted into occupied Kuwait and later into Baghdad. Mike Martins' adventures are certainly exciting enough, but it seems too contrived that the same hero gets sent on three different missions. In particular, pulling Mike Martins out of Kuwait to send him to Baghdad has the negative effect of making the Kuwait operation seem unimportant. Similarly, his escape from Baghdad just at the time when someone is needed for a third mission is too big a coincidence.The basic story involves the British discovering that Saddam Hussein has some kind of secret weapon, code-named \\"The Fist of God\\". So then the British (and Americans) have to determine exactly what kind of weapon it is, and where it's located. The story is a bit farfetched, but not totally implausible, so it's easy to get involved and feel a desire to keep reading to find out what's going to happen next.One thing I liked a lot was that certain historical facts are mixed into the story, although perhaps not in a completely accurate way. For example, the Canadian weapons expert Dr. Gerry Bull and his death in Brussels in the spring of 1990 are woven into the story. Similarly, the Manhattan Project (the American nuclear weapons effort during WW II) and the Oak Ridge laboratory play a role in the story, and I found the information presented to be very interesting.Among the things I wasn't so happy about was the emphasis on the British involvement in the Gulf War. Yes, the British did play a significant role, but still the Gulf War was basically an American show. But to hear Frederick Forsyth tell it you'd almost think the Americans couldn't have gotten anywhere without the British, and he even has a scene where Margaret Thatcher tells President Bush to pull himself together and do something about Saddam Hussein!Another negative aspect is the description of the third mission that the hero, Mike Martins, is sent on in chapter 22, the second-last chapter of the book. Frederick Forsyth tells about this operation in such a dry and factual style that it's almost like reading a telephone directory. I definitely got the feeling that Mr. Forsyth had gotten tired and just wanted to wrap up the story.Still, I liked \\"The Fist of God\\" a lot, and recommend it, especially if you're interested in a fairly modern thriller interwoven with a major real-life conflict.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"Frederick Forsyth has for a long time been the hand that has penned some of the greatest espionage thrillers ever written. But with the Fist of God, he definitely defines himself as the master of his craft. He weaves fact with his own fiction so deftly that you never know whether the Gulf War might actually have been the way it was in his book. The escapades of Mike Martin will keep you turning the pages right until the end, a brilliant climax of the best literary tension blended with credible action. A definite read for all Forsyth fans."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"Just before finding \\"The Fist of God\\" in a pile of beach books while on vacation, I read Forsyth's latest book \\"The Afghan\\" - see my Amazon review please. As soon as I picked up Fist I felt like a found a old friend. Here was Mike Martin in his best yet SAS role - before his retirement! This book is all about the intelligent and special ops that led up to the first Gulf war - we take back Kuwait but leave Saddam running Iraq.Forsyth may be singlehandedly responsible for the 2nd Gulf war. If George Bush, George Tenet and Donald Rumsfeld got this book mixed up with their intelligence reports then it is possible that this is where the threat of weapons of mass destruction originated after the first Gulf war. The book is very credible from the design of the Calutrons to the excellent camouflage developed by the Russians. Not without errors - US pilot training in 1983 did NOT still have the T-33 but the T-37. I flew a T-33 in training in 1966. At that time it was replaced in Undergraduate Pilot Training with the T-37. And ,when listing the planes that did major damage to the Iraqi armored columns, Forsyth left out the A-10 Warthog - the deadliest tank and convoy buster in the inventory. The A-10 brought a new dimension to the term \\"shooting gallery\\"!Overall, this book is a very worthwhile read. Get a copy and put it on your night stand. After the first five pages you will not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"The fist of God has a decent story, with a little too much super-agent antics, featuring an agent in Iraq that has everything going for him a little too smoothly to be realistic.The story invloving the secret weapon is in fact almost non-fictional, since anybody who knows the story of Gerald Bull will pretty much be able to guess what the weapon and how it would be used right from the start.The main problem for me, as usual with Forsyth, is that the characters are virtually non-existent, and there is zero characterization (how do they even look like?!) Another problem is that most characters seem to be mindless drones that can't figure out what the reader has long ago. They are supposed to be intelligence officers, but really can't figure out 1+1.The strong point is the research, and an impressive (although superficial) account of espionage, the structure and workings of various intelligence and control bodies during the Gulf war, and the description of coalition military might, all of which would greatly satisfy readers who enjoy this sort of fiction.The writing is workmanlike, and lacking the wit, humor and intelligence of Le Carre's. Still, a strong novel."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"I've been reading a few of Forsyth novel such as 'The days of the Jackal', Odessa File and Dogs of war. But this one has to be my favourite. Being a former military man myself, it really interest me how accurate and knowledgable the author was on the military intricate strategy in mass desert warfare which are made up of alot of separate operations which have the same objective...to make sure the fist of god was never operational. There was really no hard concrete evidence it exist, but there was also no hard concrete evidence that it didn't. As the saying goes 'Absence of evidence, is not evident of absence. I watch and observed the gulf war event with great interest and as much as possible with out prejudice and bias to any side. This book does bring the other (fictionally ?)missing puzzel which make up the bigger picture of how the conflict was negotiated with extreme prejucide. On the books, the character build up of the key people in the novel was most impressive, giving the reader an almost sympathetic attachement with the character along the journey of the story. The author's ability to tie in all the individual character to one plot in the end, produces an adrenalin climax and a good closure. Highly recommended to those who missed the actions, you know who you are."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"Definitely a captivating read, Fist of God is a great way to relive the Gulf War. Forsyth's writing is fast-paced and laboriously researched. At times, however, the length of the book and the depth of the detail become mildly irritating. As a first time Forsyth reader, I found the author's habit of detailing every scene an unnecessary waste of space and words. Overall, however, this story about espionage during the Gulf War and Saddam Hussein's attempt to beat the odds very compelling - - at times it becomes very difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in getting a taste of Forsyth."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"After reading \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" for the first time in over 25 years, I decided to read \\"The Fist of God\\" for the third time to see how the two stacked up. Both are superb pieces of work, but I think I'm going to give a slight edge to \\"Fist\\". Not that comparisons need to be made.The novel covers the period from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and ends about when the ground troops invaded the country to take it back. In between it tells a story to try and explain why Saddam Hussein just let the forces come in and do this. He could have temporarily backed out, and re-invaded at a later time, when momentum to build more forces would not have been as high. Was this just a bad military move, or did he have something extra up his sleeve?Whether or not this secret is true or not is not important, although it would not be unbelievable if true. What makes it a great novel is all the places it takes us during this period. This was a big event that happened not too long ago, that still has world-wide ramifications to this day.Yes, we see the historical figures such as George Bush Sr., Margaret Thatcher, Norman Schwartzkopf, and yes, Hussein. But except for Hussein, these are minor characters. It is the ordinary characters, most of whom are very interesting that make it great reading.Although there are many characters, the main one would be Mike Martin, who is most instrumental in pulling off the plot. He is a British soldier of Arabic ancestry who begins the war going to Kuwait to be an almost one-man underground resistance movement. When a mole is discovered in Hussein's inner circle that wants to sell the good guys information, Martin is transferred to Baghdad to get this information. He has his share of tense moments as his contribution to the war effort.We are also taken into the world of Saddam Hussein, although we have to imagine a good part of it comes from the author's mind. Let's face it. They don't exactly have \\"People\\" magazine there, so information like this is extremely tight. But we do get to meet his generals, his cabinet, and his torturers. The tactics used to not only get information from people, but to keep the population itself properly scared out of it's mind are done in detail graphic enough to convince me that we indeed are the good guys.And, like all good spy novels, we do get to see that it's a very dirty business, and often the good guys get their hands just as dirty as the bad ones when it comes to the tricks of the trade. It is historical fact that if the CIA had played fair with one of great designers of big guns in the world, he would have never gone to work for the bad guys. And there is also a subplot involving the loss of at least one innocent life, done by the \\"good guys\\", that makes you respect \\"our side\\" a lot less.Like I said, I just read it for the third time. I will no doubt read it again some day."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"\\"The Fist Of God\\" is one of the most exciting white papers I've ever read, wrapped around the spine of a pretty routine thriller.It's the last days before the first Gulf War, and Iraq's Saddam Hussein seems to be courting disaster by refusing to back down from his occupation of Kuwait. Is he just nuts, or does he have a plan? SAS officer Mike Martin is sent behind enemy lines to figure it out.Starting out with one of the great opening lines in thriller writing (\\"The man with ten minutes to live was laughing\\"), \\"Fist Of God\\" covers a lot of ground in its nearly 600 pages, from an arms scientist trying to help Iraq enter the nuclear age to Kuwaiti resistance battles to the inner councils of the Coalition High Command and Saddam's all-Tikriti amen club.Forsyth discourses knowledgeably about the problem of Iraq, noting the factionalism among Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd; visiting Abu Ghraib prison; and analyzing how Saddam counted on Arab disunity and U.N. dithering to bail him out. He gives us an engaging tour of everything from Swiss banks (a favorite Forsyth topic) to Mossad spycraft to atomic bomb development.Forsyth makes for impressive company; he seems to have pored over every map and read every history book in existence, and is willing to discourse with dry detachment about what he has learned. I just wish he'd channel his inner Alistair MacLean more and rediscover his leaner, yarnspinning self. What action is here is papered over with acres of explanatory commentary, and the characters, namely the shadowy Martin, are one-dimensional bores. Even when tension mounts, it's hard to care when you don't really know the people you are rooting for.We all know that the central threat of the book, Saddam attacking Coalition troops with nuclear arms, never came to pass. Forsyth works the narrative briskly enough over that inconvenient if fortunate fact, by focusing on the real-life plots and counterplots that went on and spinning some interesting alternative ideas for how the whole thing might have gone down.Martin starts off in Kuwait, then goes into Baghdad, his boyhood home. Forsyth has Tom Clancy's way with technology, but one wishes he did more with the backdrop of the war. Martin's leading a group of Kuwaiti children into battle is too pat and swiftly handled, and his travels through Baghdad amid air raids lack tension.Like Alistair MacLean in \\"Guns Of Navarone,\\" Martin eventually leads an SAS team to find Saddam's big weapon, but its no big thrill when his main action involves pointing an invisible laser at a hill. When the team runs into Iraqis, the foe is swiftly dispatched, a tribute to SAS fortitude but dull writing.There's other parts of this overlong book that could be trimmed or chopped outright, like a Mossad operation to discover the identity of an Iraqi mole that never really factors into the rest of the story and just left me confused and feeling sorry for a poor Swiss secretary.I don't know, though, it's still Forsyth, and very interesting reading. His way with the pen is still remarkable, as is his store of knowledge. \\"A mercenary in the intelligence world is like a whore. No tiresome candle-lit dinners and sweet nothings are necessary. A fistful of dollars on the dressing table will do nicely.\\"Forsyth's better than most thriller writers; he's not just in it for the money. But he seems to be straying in his eminence years from the sort of storycraft that serves his genre best."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"To me 'The fist of God' is the best of all Forsyth's books, and a MUST read.

It is one of my favorites. Far superior to The Fourth Protocol or The Devil's alternative, it grips you from page one and doesn't stop.In a sense, it is two novellas, as the two main story lines don't merge very much. The first part introduces the character and vets him; the second part provides the main plot line.I rank the different Forsyth novels I have read in this order:Day of the JackalDogs of WarFist of GodThe DeceiverThe Odessa FileThe AvengerThe NegotiatorThe AfghanIconThe CobraFourth ProtocolThe Devil's Alternative(The short story collection \\"No Comebacks\\" is outstanding, up there with Fist of God.)All in all, I find The Fist of God to be riveting and satisfying Forsyth."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"I have read one other book by Frederick Forsyth and it was pretty horrible. If my memory serves me the title of that one was The Cobra. That said I have heard nothing but high praise for his books and so I thought that I would grab one of his earlier ones as the early books always seem to be the best work of any author who has had a career this long. I went for The Fist of God and it was infinitely better than The Cobra.The book takes place during Desert Storm and includes an assemble cast of soldiers, politicians and intellectuals. On the \\"page turner\\" level this book delivers in spades. There are night missions by Special Forces, spy work, airplane and helicopter raids, thefts and plenty of all the other shenanigans that we imagine must go on behind the scenes. However what I particularly enjoyed about this book was its historical accuracy. Forsyth approached his subject matter in much the same way that an investigative journalist would. He then added just enough fiction to keep you turning pages wondering what would happen next. I know that it is an interesting idea but I suppose one could make the argument that this is now a historical fiction novel even though the first gulf war was not that long ago in the eyes of many.Recommended"},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"A spell-binding read that's nearly impossible to put down.

Forsyth writes with a passionate 'between the lines' feeling to this riveting true story, which relates much to the politics of the world's second Gulf War in 2003. In 1994 director Robert Young, inspired by Forsyth's book wrote and directed a summary-like script to the story in the form of HBO's original docudrama 'Doomsday Gun'. Whereas Forsyth's novel begins with a third-person account of the assassination of Dr. Gerald Bull, HBO's film turns the story towards the life and death of Dr. Bull. 'The Fist of God' may read like stereo instructions towards the body of explanation; (The Iraq weapons program, the violation(s) of international weapons embargo laws), watching the film first can make reading Forsyth's version so much more intriguing. Parts in the film played by actors Michael Kitchen, Francesca Annis and Marianne Dennicourt are abolished, for the book will make you see the entire story for what it was outside of the Space Research Corporation and Dr. Bull's massive (put poorly constructed) weapon. However Forsyth does'nt make an attempt to swing left of that aspect, 'The Fist of God' is simply a more detailed and much more credible source for information on what continues to be a growing mystery within the US and British governments...and of course Iraq."},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","review":"I could not put this book down.

I wanted to know more about Saddam Hussein's invasion on Iraq, so I picked up this book. I am not disappointed. This book tells lot of facts in an interesting way. I now know more about the internal working of the organizations such as Mossad, CIA and MI6. This book also gives details on war bombs and war planes. I especially liked the part involving Mossad work. Overall the story revolves around the how the allied forces (US, UK, and other Middle East countries) prevents Saddam Hussein's from using the nuclear weapon. Mike Martin, protagonist and a UK's spy, is planted into Iraq to get internal information. Mike's is an intriguing character and parts involving him in the book are interesting. Parts involving Jericho, an Iraq defector, are also interesting.On the other side, I found the book very detailed and lengthy. Writer goes at a stretch and describes how Iraq made the weapon of mass destruction in first 20% of the book. I was not hooked to the book, because the book is very detailed.

There is a large amount of accurate technical information regarding war machines, strategies, and the personalities in the war.The main hero of the book is Mike Martin, a member of the SAS - Special Air Services of the British Military. There are spies involved in the plot who are selling information about Iraq. Some accurate information about the ruthlessness of the Iraqi regime and leader is comprehensively covered. A key subplot involves the fear of the Iraq leader's use of lethal gas or possibly nuclear weapons on troops in concentrated areas.The writer of this book produces compelling scenes but what I think puts it over the top is his attention to detail. It is very comprehensive and based on reality, making the core/fictional plot as believable as could be and engrossing. He obviously spent a tremendous time on research, and I think this book's price is an absolute steal for the obvious amount of hard work dedicated to it.I'm so glad I found this book!!!

For the next week we both shared the book for 1-hour at a time inbetween doing our sailing chores.

The Day of the Jackal is a classic, but I think this tops it. It is a most intriguing novel with a great plot.Like many other Forsyth novels, this brings in factual history and mixes a fictional thriller into it.If you don't know history well (particularly during the American-Iraq conflict in the 90s), do not fret. You may actually learn a bit and be treated to a great story. Forsyth does not just throw you into this story, he introduces everybody and everything.The only downside of this novel is that it is not linear at all. Expect a lot of jumping around in locations and occasionally, times. You may question the introduction of some characters, but fear not, the story is wrapped up very very well, and no character goes left unmentioned.Forsyth's style is very much apparent in The Fist of God. Mini-cliffhangers are aplenty, and you will not want to put this book down.

I read this book because I was impressed at the depth of the two movies mentioned above. After 9/11/01, I also wanted to read something which relates to the going ons in the middle east.The obtjectives of the story are simple: First, to find out if Saddam Hussain has any weapons which may pose a serious threat to the allied forces in the gulf. Secondly, if he has any weapons destroy them before he plans to use them. The story becomes somewhat complex because in order to meet the objectives, a well coordinated intelligence operation involving people in the US, Europe, Iraq, Israel and Kuwait must take place. The entire operation involves scholars, spooks and sneeks (special ops and spies) and even someone with close connections to Saddam himself. The whole story of how an SAS man was able go deep into Iraq incognito was fascinating and believeable. The SAS man whose name is Mike Martin was sent in Iraq to gather intelligence on the weapons and then help to destroy them. The information Mike gets is not first hand however. Mike must depend on another mysterious character known only as Jerico.

The story is multi-leveled and centers around British and American attempts to sabotage the production of an Iraqi atomic bomb. The characters range from a British commando behind the lines in Kuwait, to a Mossad agent romancing a European banker, to the butcher of bagdad himself, Saddam Hussein. Along the way, the reader is treated to Forsyth's unique style that keeps the pace moving from page one. Like the novels of Tom Clancy, this one makes you wonder just how much the author knows about the inner-workings of Washington, London, and other centers of power throughout the world. How much of this novel is true? I don't know.

This source is being used to locate Saddam's secret nuclear bomb facility. The true identity of Jerico is stunning. The ending of the book is a true classical manner in ways to end a book.

His encounter there with the realist movement led to the first three truly realistic (defined as against the prevailing moralism and/or melodrama of Victorian fiction) novels in English literature proper: A Modern Lover, A Mummer's Wife and Esther Waters.Of the three, Esther Waters is the most fully developed and it is certainly the most engaging for a modern reader. In it, a woman has a child out of wedlock, and not only survives (through a variety of trials that are dispassionately but unflinchingly depicted) but in a manner of speaking prospers (Compare this for example with Elizabeth Gaskell's *Ruth*, written some 40+ years earlier).A great read. An important milestone in the transition from moralism to realism in English fiction. An Irish writer who played an important role in the Irish literary renaissance in the early years of the 19th century.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Esther Waters","review":"A nice insightful look into the life of a working class umarried mother of the late victorian period who copes with her misfortune of falling in with the WRONG PERSON and struggles to rise from the situation towards her self redemption.

By the end of the novel she&#8217;s accepting the most degrading misfortune as almost a birthright.The Victorian writing requires careful reading. The paragraph where Esther has premarital sex is so opaque that it&#8217;s uncertain what exactly happened until later when the pregnancy is revealed. And certainly the word &#8216;pregnancy&#8217; isn&#8217;t used (&#8220;Yes Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m 7 months gone&#8221;).Finally a pet peeve about phonetically spelling dialects.

Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"Burke Davis presents his mastery of research and history with Gray Fox, a book detailing General Robert E. Lee's endeavors throughout the American Civil War. Gray Fox is flooded with immense detail and numerous accounts of people who existed alongside Lee, from journal entries to letters. The book is able to connect with the reader in such a way that one actually feels as though they have entered the 1860s; emotions are conveyed strongly as well.But more than simply an example of excellent writing, Gray Fox brings to the reader someone that all Americans should revere: the man of Robert E. Lee. Though written objectively, the reader cannot help but gain extreme respect for the bearded general; his humility, loyalty, and faith demonstrated by Lee are prime examples of what all men nowadays should strive to be. After reading this book, I have a great deal of admiration for not only Lee, but the whole of the Confederate States of America; believe me when I say that there was a lot more there than racist rednecks. Davis also examines Lee's views on race and the CSA, as well.In short--get this book. Not just because you are a Civil War buff, or a CSA sympathizer, or love Robert E. Lee, but because you owe it to yourself, as an American, to entertain yourself with one of the greatest men in history, and to learn from his wisdom.Thank you Burke Davis!"},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"The book does a great job taking one along side this great American general in good and bad times, victory and defeat, and public and private moments. The reason I gave 4 stars was because of Davis's constant blaming campaign toward Longstreet whenever things went wrong for the Army of Northern Virginia(mainly at Gettysburg). Somehow its seems like a common theme observed with some of Lee's biographers. This book is a must read those interested in the history of Civil War as well military history."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"I wouldn't say I disliked this book, but I did find it pretty short on both style and substance. It presents a good chronology of Lee's ACW campaigns, and might make a good prelude to a more detailed account if one wanted to get that chronology straight. However the prose is limp at best and details lacking. In his descriptions of the battles (especially) Burke Davis brings very little to life. For example, in the description of Chancellorsville, one never gets a sense that the battle is slipping out of Lee's control before his and Jackson's daring and innovative masterstroke changes the outcome completely.Credit should be given for good use of excerpts from Lee's correspondance which paint a picture of a gentle and humane man doing his duty bravely despite a mounting sense of the long-term hoelessness of the situation. But, more interesting material can be found than this historical overview for anyone who wants something serious on the subject."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"While limited in scope, this is a very good book about an extraordinary figure in American history. Beginning only a few days before Fort Sumter and concluding with Appomattox, Mr. Davis' narrative is not designed as a biography of Robert E. Lee, and only limited dimensions of his character and his life are revealed in it. What the book does achieve is to paint a vivid picture of Lee's role in the Civil War and, through this vehicle, to reveal something essential about this bloodiest of American tragedies, which is a story of many sad paradoxes. A genuinely kindly and self-effacing man, Lee the military commander was nonetheless a wily aggressor who, along with his Union counterparts, invented a new kind of warfare which at the time had no precedent anywhere in the world for the degree of mass slaughter it unleashed. Lee adamantly opposed slavery on moral grounds and was appalled at the decision of the southern states to succeed from the American nation, the service of which he had devoted his professional life to. Despite these misgivings, he took up the Southern cause for the purpose of defending his native Virginia. Having reluctantly committed himself, he took up command of the Confederate army with such determination and skill that, prior to Gettysburg, he was arguably within range of accomplishing the Southern victory that he himself always believed to be unlikely. One of the strengths of this book is that the author seeks neither to romanticize nor debunk Lee. He lets primary sources speak for themselves through much of the narrative, and the portrait of Lee that emerges is one largely consistent with the popular image of the man as one of history's great tragic heroes. This books biggest weakness, at least for me, was it's failure to flesh out the strategic context for Lee's actions during the war. The narrative follows him through the major engagements in which he participated, but gives minimal perspective on military or political events occurring outside of Lee's camp. A comprehensive history of the war is beyond the scope of this short study, but the marvelous story it tells falls somewhat short due to the lack of background information. Still, the book is very well worth reading, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"I remember reading &quot;Gray Fox&quot; many years ago, and for some reason it didn't leave a major impact on me then... Then I recently bought the &quot;new&quot; version, and found it extremely gripping, and more importantly - quite readable.The first chapter sets the tone of the book - it tells of the inner crisis that Lee faced with Secession, the attack on Fort Sumter, and his decision to reject President Lincoln's offer of a command of the Union Army.One can sense the full drama of the moment, as Lee turns his back on his love of country and army in favor of his state, about to join the Southern Confederacy.Above all, Burke Davis is a master storyteller - and his Civil War Histories, though basically written from a Southern perspective (he has also written biographies of &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and Jeb Stuart, as well as the wonderful &quot;The Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts&quot;)are on a par with those written by Catton, Foote, and McPherson.By emphasizing both the history and the human interest aspects of Lee, Davis makes the reader feels a part of the story; as if he were at Lee's side at Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomattox...For those interested in learning both the realities as well as the legend of Lee, I would strongly suggest purchasing this book, as well as Alan Nolan's controversal &quot;Lee Reconsidered&quot; (which presents a more sobering view of Lee the man) as vantage points to begin reading about the man considered by many to be America's &quot;finest General&quot; - though I'm not so sure about that opinion myself."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"Davis is one of those rare authors who has the magical ability to to breathe life into the past through his writings. In addition to being a truly gifted writer, he is also an insightful and even-handed historian. Davis depicts Lee as a great, but not perfect general, as a complex figure who was willing to fight invading Northern armies, but who also hoped for an eventual end to slavery, as a man who while being vulnerable to pride sought the ideal of Christian humility, as kind and humane, but also willing to see men die in their thousands for the cause which he and they fought for. Moreover, while the book is written from the perspective of Lee and his army, the Northern side is still treated with respect and the same depth of understanding. Since many books on the Civil War are filled with hatred, blame, and arteficial and foolish one dimensional standards of morality, this is refreshing. I do not at all regret buying this book. I only regret that the author did not write more books. In addition to Gray Fox, I also highly recommend Davis's biography of Stonewall Jackson."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"This is a 'must read' for all Civil War book worms. Not only does it show the true man, Robert E. Lee, but a fine, historical review of the entire war. Prepare yourself for the last 35 pages, as you will read the best account of the surrender at Appomattox that I have ever read by ANY author."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"Gray Fox follows Lee through his campaigns during the war. It is as much a history of certain parts of the war and a biography on Stonewall Jackson as it is on Lee. This book also examined the life of a soldier during the war. This book saw my level of thinking reach new heights, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a genuine interest in the Civil War."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"An excellent read on the life of Robert E. Lee. Davis does an good job in portraying the general's life, not overloading the reader with details. Those who have read more detailed books on Lee might find this one lacking, but I believe it to be worth your time and would make an excellent addition to ones Civil War library."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"Nicely written clear and concise facts from beginning to end. Burke Davis quotes and paraphrases several first hand accounts of civilians Confederate, and Union officers. Mr. Davis also recites several letters from General Robert E. Lee to family, Jefferson Davis, Confederate officers and General Grant.The reading of this biography permeates vast knowledge of Robert E. Lee. Starting with his birth, education at West Point, emergence from the Mexican War, \\"with a reputation as the army's most talented young officer.\\" Mr. Davis does a great job of conveying General Lee's concerns about the possibility of civil war. Robert E. Lee made the difficult decision to resign from the U.S. military. Here is a sample of General Lee's letter of resignation. \\"I have devoted all the best years of my life and all the ability I posed. During the whole time-more than a quarter of a century-I have experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors and a most cordial friendship from my comrades. To no one, General, have I been as much indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration. I shall carry to the grave the most grateful recollections of your kind consideration, and your name and fame will always be dear to me.\\"The book is worthy of reading I'll probably read it a few more times. Therefore five stars seems appropriate for a truly amazing book. This book is for folks from any geographical area. Whatever your race, creed, culture, religion is this book can be an enjoyable read. I leave you with one last quote this is Robert E. Lee's opinion of slavery. \\"There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil...I think it greater evil to the white than to the black race.\\""},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"Davis does for Robert E. Lee what few biographers can do--provide the reader a present-tense sense of General Lee's emotions. In the Gray Fox, Davis shows Lee's stoic character, gently melded with a loving heart. Perhaps most important to the fledgling Confederacy, Davis demonstrates how Lee, like no other, could remain supremely cool and calm while under intense pressure as well as during those &quot;moment of truth&quot; decisions upon which the future of the Rebel nation depended."},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"In a war some fought for principle and others for property, Robert E. Lee's ironclad character emerges as source of inspiration for both federalist and confederates. Battle diarist and Lee's faithful pet hen compellingly reveal the dreams and the drama that clothed the southern soldiers when little else did"},{"Title":"Gray Fox; Robert E. Lee and The Civil War (Signed)","review":"The Gray Fox was a new kind of biography for me. Actually it isn't even a real biography, more of a reflection of what a very wise man saw happening around him and how he tried to steer through all of it. Davis writes in a clear and accessible manner and does not overfeed you with data, which makes the book also a must for non-Civil War experts. The only thing which disappointed me was the extremely poor analysis of Longstreet. In The Gray Fox Davis blames Old Pete for almost every battlefield mistake the Confederates made. After a while, I almost thought Davis had some sort of grudge against Longstreet, because at some point his accusations become absurd. But apart from that, I can recommend this book, because of its slightly unconventional approach to biography writing."},{"Title":"Pestos!: Cooking With Herb Pastes","review":"Pestos! by Dorothy Rankin is THE essential book in my herb filled house .

There are classic pesto recipes as well as some unique combinations. There are also some recipes in which to use the pesto."},{"Title":"I Have Spoken","review":"This is one of those books that you find laying somewhere burried in the back of the library perhaps covered in dust that has been long forgotten! Nevertheless, this is a little gem of a read! The main reason why I liked it so much was because of the eloquent creative and heartfelt ways in which the Native Americans conveyed all their messages. So genuine, trusting, and true were their words and not conjured up by money or greed.Thie book Just might have even Americans of today looking at themselves and questioning our seemingly prevailing atrtitudes that &quot;we are the best&quot; and that &quot;more&quot; and &quot;bigger is better&quot;... It will have the reader questioning a Government's activity towards national expansion in the name of freedom, while opressing many others at the very same time. These &quot;others&quot;, who, the reader will learn, actually taught settlers how to survive in the new frontier.Among other reasons I liked this book is that it made me look at myself and learen something in how I live. &quot;I Have Spoken&quot; had me looking at our current lifestyles that we so embrace as &quot;having it so good&quot;, as perhaps the total opposite, and that perhaps it is we, the people of today, who struggle more to survive in this convenient lifestyle, more so than ever did the native peoples to sustain their lifestyle!As many at the time in history which this book covers, looked at Native Americans as &quot;inferior&quot;, the reader will learn why many Native Americans began to look at the settlers as inferior. This is a refreshing change of opinions we may have been used to hearing in history, and a welcomed one at that!Through the many eloquently expressed words of Native Americans the reader will guess that they they viewed our lifestyle as somewhat being &quot;enslaved&quot; by adopting and living in such a system that has us &quot;working for..and oweing money&quot; to be able to sustain ourselves and lifestyle. They recognized a stressful life in this resulting in menatal and physical sickness of which was virtually non-existent in their lives.This book is a really thought provoking read and at least for me, has left me looking around at all so called &quot;progress&quot; in our culture and questioning whether it is really progress at all if it destroys the very gifts nature &quot;God&quot; or &quot;The Great Spirit&quot; has bestowed upon us to make ALL life possible.I strongly suggest this read to anybody, especially those who seek to not see the world as something we &quot;own&quot; and can see that this notion is really the root of all humankind conflict with each other.Another final thought this book inspired in me was perhaps looking at history through the eyes of other cultures around the world, and seeing how they came to be, so we shall better understand each other and accept each other's customs without forcing them to live and think as we do. Maybe this can go a long way in preventing conflicts with other nations. Read the book &quot;I Have Spoken&quot; and this review will then come into perspective for anyone who is reading it now!"},{"Title":"I Have Spoken","review":"We used this text at the University of Minnesota back in 1971 for a Native American History course. The book voices treaty interpretation and words used by Tribal representatives. I won't use the word &quot;Chief's&quot; because the Government did'nt always get the real leadership to sign treaties. But, we noted a lack of aggressive language at the beginning of colonization (east coast), but by the time we read text from treaties from the Plains Natives the verbage used more aggressive and warlike themes. Sum it up! Indians found the need to be aggressive and began to use words to voice their frustrations with negotiations with Government respresentatives."},{"Title":"I Have Spoken","review":"Any &quot;red blooded&quot; American citizen would surely have a &quot;red face&quot; from embarrassment after reading the compilation of words and speeches from original settlers of our beloved country in &quot;I Have Spoken, American History Through the Voices of the Indians.&quot; From those documents so meticulously collected by Virginia Irving Armstrong and introduced in this book for all to read, one concludes that even here in America, an atrocious holocaust took place.The book tells the truth. It will make you mad. It will make you sad. You will feel ashamed to belong to the culture that was responsible for the near extinction of the once prosperous, peaceful people who just wanted to live life as they had been taught by their ancesters. Simple and earth loving.&quot;I Have Spoken&quot; should be offered in every school as a learning tool on an important aspect of our American history. We made a mistake. We cannot bring them back, but we can read aloud what they said and feel their spirits.The photos that were included in the June, 1971 and August, 1972 editions are sadly not included in the most recent copies for sale now. It's more of an impact to see their faces as well as read their words. I hope subsequent issues will reincorporate those photos, especially of the ones of the Wounded Knee massacre. &quot;...I will fight no more forever.&quot; Chief Joseph, Nez Perce nation, 1877."},{"Title":"I Have Spoken","review":"This is an emotionally provocative book about the plight of the North American Indian as they were systemically and forcefully driven from their homeland by the plague of white settlers that cut down the old growth forests, over harvested the game the Indians relied on for food, clothing, religion and cultural purposes; damned and over fished the rivers and stole, bought or hoodwinked their Native land through deceptive treaties and unkept promises.It is a story told through a series of speeches by Indians in reaction to the deceptive practices the English, French and later the American Government used to seize Native lands; some are by famous Indians like Geronimo, Sitting Bull and Red Cloud and many are by lesser known Indians; but all powerfully present the anguish of a proud, culturally rich people that were subdued by disease and superior technology until their numbers were reduced from the millions to remnant bands, many numbering only a few dozen.I was struck by the layout of the speeches; some only one sentence long, others more in depth, all smart and to the point, that showed a proud people becoming resentful, then hopeful that the treaties will be honored, then submissive, pleading to the Great Father (either in England or the U.S. President) for justice, to finally acceptance that their land, their culture, their future as a race, their ancient burial grounds and the game and great herds of bison and the bountiful rivers that sustained their people for countless generations were all forever gone.This is a story that sheds another not so honorable light on some of the heroes of American history like George Custer and General Crook and most Presidents; showing the insidious side of a Nation that at the front door is proud of individual liberties and freedoms for its immigrant occupants and at the back door ruthlessly and methodically treating Native Americans as non-entities, non-persons, whose rights were not protected under the U.S. Constitution.To any and all Native Americans I want to say I am so very sorry this egregious injustice was pronounced on such a peaceful, honest and trustworthy people, by immigrants that you initially befriended and without your assistance would have perished their first year on this continent."},{"Title":"Little Golden Book Collection: Farm Tales (Little Golden Book Treasury)","review":"I think every one likes childrens books.

It was interesting how Adoff writes from the perspective of a girl. With such strong sentiments, I couldn't help but wonder if there is any relation to his own life or that of someone he knows. I have read other poetry books by Adoff, and this was one of my favorites. In &quot;I am making a circle for my self,&quot; I enjoyed the references to Golda Meir and Moses. In &quot;The way I see any hope for later,&quot; Adoff powerfully addresses issues of race and gender, saying that we need to &quot;stop looking&quot; and &quot;start loving.&quot; What a powerful poem! Even the layout of the words adds to the effect. &quot;Remember:&quot; makes an interesting reference to the fact that way back when there was only one race--a fact that makes one wonder how we ever became so divided."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"This is one of the best collections of short stories I've read in a while. The settings and themes vary, but each has at least some element of magical realism. Many of them are creepy, not in a blood-and-guts horrorshow kind of way, but more in a strange, unsettling way. Many of them are sad; \\"Elephant and Boy\\" especially touched me. But there is also quite a bit of sly humor, as in \\"Sales,\\" in which traveling salesmen in some future time are captured by a family and kept penned, and still continue their salesmen-like ways. One of my favorite stories in this volume was \\"Preparedness,\\" an ultimately rather hopeful tale featuring a world leader who seems quite familiar.Budnitz writes beautifully. Her writing is filled with interesting images, and yet she never forgets her characters and plots. These stories are rich but not dense. I can strongly recommend this book, and I look forward to reading more of Budnitz's work."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"Judy Budnitz dares make the genre of allegory palatable again by stretching her metaphors to absurd lengths. In \\"Where we come from,\\" the first in this excellent collection of short stories, a mother's need to provide the best for her son leads her to delay giving birth until he can be born in the right place - and even then she can't let go. Compared to this, the shenanigans of parents trying to get children into \\"feeder\\" nursery schools seem downright sane.The anxiety of motherhood runs through the best of the stories in this collection. In addition to \\"Where we come from,\\" the teasingly titled \\"miracle\\" (first published in The New Yorker) describes a situation in which the normal ambivalence of new parents is magnified by a decidedly unusual child.For Budnitz, motherhood is the flip side of daughterhood: \\"Where we come from\\" starts with the mother as young daughter. \\"Flush,\\" perhaps the best in the collection, is a straightforward, poignant story of the intertwined fates of mothers and daughters, while \\"Visitors\\" examines the gap and alienation (perhaps literally) between them. And \\"Motherland,\\" which begins as a thought experiment about \\"an island of mothers,\\" suddenly transforms into an evocative wish to transcend the roles we are assigned as daughters - and sons.The weakest stories in the collection explore the consequences of motherhood gone wrong - the Big Spoiled American Baby. \\"Nadia\\" highlights the ego- /ethno-centrism of the Baby when she's all grown up, but it soon veers too far into caricaturing the unsympathetic narrator. \\"Elephant and boy\\" suffers from a similar weakness in exploring a similar theme. On the other hand, \\"Preparedness,\\" featuring the President as Big Baby, successfully repackages tired hippie sentiments into a gentle fairy tale.Not fitting neatly into any of the above categories are two meditations on artistic endeavor: \\"The kindest cut,\\" which has a certain old-world charm, and the melancholy \\"Saving face,\\" one of my favorites.Budnitz's vivid imagination makes these stories fun to read, but it's her observations about the human condition - our vanity, our anxiety, and also our morality - that make them worth reading."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"I really like the way Judy Budnitz writes. I picked up Flying Leap years ago and was hooked. She is one of those authors that when I go to a bookstore I look up to see if anything new is released. I don't know if she is for everyone though. Her stories tend to be highly . . . imaginative. They are almost like fairy tales, allegories that may or may not have a deeper meaning. To be honest, I've never really looked. Her writing is just so rich and full of flavor that I tend to just devour the stories in a sitting and not think about them later. Her writing has matured and \\"Nice Big American Baby\\" has a darker feeling than Flying Leap. I would even argue that it is darker than her novella, \\"If I told you once,\\" which has its dark parts, but really straddles the space between Flying Leap and Baby. My favorite story by far in this collection is \\"Saving Face\\" a story about two people living in an imaginary authoritarian regime ruled by a benign Prime Minister. Perhaps it is a sign of her maturation as an author (or perhaps me as a reader) that I do keep this story percolating in my head going over themes of true love, devotion, happenstance, and self that play in this story. It is really very very good. \\"Visitors\\" is also a nice diversion wherein she uses an interesting flash-cut narrative routine that never gets boring or staid due to the fact that after each transition you are left wondering what NEW bizarre twist of dialogue or scenery she going to appear. You really can't go wrong with a Budnitz book so if you are looking for something of an interesting read I would highly recommend her."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"It annoys me that the pieces have such strong beginings and weak ends. It's a buzz kill."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"It will be interesting to see what other reviews of this work will be like; I imagine that there will be many that are extremely positive and some that will be very negative. That tends to happen when someone reacts to something novel. Reviewers will try and type Ms. Budnitz's stories as political or magical realism. Her work does not fit neatly into any genre.What Ms. Budnitz does amazingly well is despite fantastical plots and truly hilarious writing, she taps into the reader's feelings and the result is not always pleasant. In \\"Miracle\\" we are exposed to a baby of fantastic density and ambiguous race. Although the events are extraordinary, the feelings of burden, disconnection, love, and guilt are commonplace to the reader. The effect reminds me of Tim O'Brien's magnificent \\"How to Tell a True War Story\\" as Ms. Budnitz allows herself complete freedom in her plot to achieve her goal to get the reader to feel wants she needs you to feel. There will be some like my mother, who after reading \\"Miracle\\" in The New Yorker, called me very troubled by the story with the review of, \\"you are not suppose to tap into those feelings about your own baby\\", but what is undeniable is how affecting the stories can be.The result are stories about people who prefer nuclear holocaust drills to real-life (as in \\"Preparedness\\" my favorite story in the collection) or racism turned in the spreading of plague or supposed do-gooders doing repulsive acts. Each of these stories requires reflection, re-reading, and conversation. I made more phone calls to friends while reading this collection than any other that I can remember.What is also undeniable is how truly skilled Ms. Budnitz is with language. There were many phrases and passages that the reader will want to read outloud because of their simplicity and power.

Be warned these are not nice stories of the naturalist kind, say a mother and daughter who learn to apreciate each other through talk and by staring at oaks. They are viscious, powerful stories that pack all the punch of, well, a lot of punches. While many of the stories could be seen on their face as political allegories, these are not political stories, but real fiction, stripped of most everything save the most basic: a narrator, a vague setting and the highest of consequences.The writing is brutally efficient; poetic where it needs to be, spariongly expository and always moving the plot along, the stakes, in these too beautiful stories, ever increasing. Bravest of all is the short story format. I, who've always leaned on a good marathon of a novel for reading, was swept away by the strength and grace of budnitz's sprints and have remained since, branching out to read many of her contemporaries, most of whom this still not known well enough talent towers above."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"I am enjoying reading these short stories. Each one is very unique, and quite creative."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"A mixed bag of short stories. What one reviewer called \\"inventiveness\\" often strays into manipulation, pseudomysticism, and nonsense, yet there are several gems among these tales. Ms. Budnitz has a gift for language and understanding people. Maybe in the future she'll depend on those solid skills and get away from ventures into the bizarre."},{"Title":"Nice Big American Baby","review":"The fundamental problem with each of the stories in this collection (NICE BIG AMERICAN BABY), is that the author is trying to force what she wants in the world by illustrating archetypes that only in a clich&eacute;d sense, the reader would have sympathy for; and reaches the lowest in the final story \\"Motherland\\" that is silly, just plain silly.The writing is weak and doesn't do much except make me think that the author didn't properly revise her work, or simply in the case of the many film screenplay like jumps in which a short paragraph is used to illustrate something about a character, it just seems like she is a very lazy writer.On the whole, the collection of short stories comes of as a weak form of magic realism, but the problem is that there is not innate spirituality in her writing and even though I don't care much for Marquez, the dean of such writing, he at least imbibed passion into his vivid, colorful world and that is what is needed for that type of story to work; as is, Budnitz's deadpan delivery makes it seem as the author simply has little interest in the world around her, but, moreover, a simple wanton desire to deconstruct the current society for all of its problems, due to the fact the she is merely bored, and if she is bored she should simply stop writing, which is sad as her first novel held such promise, now it appears Bunditz is simply in retrograde."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"Every adult-in-the-making goes through at least one \\"difficult year.\\" For Vicky Austin, that year comes when she's 14. She hasn't been able to do anything right (or it seems that way to her, at least!) for months, and now her parents have decided to tear her previously secure world apart. Dr. Austin is taking a temporary research and teaching position in New York City, leaving his small-town medical practice in another doctor's hands. The Austin family's home in Thornhill, Connecticut will be occupied by that other doctor's family, and that's where their pets will remain, too. But before they move into a New York apartment, the Austins embark on a cross-country camping trip - from Atlantic (Grandfather Eaton's home on Seven Bay Island) to Pacific (Laguna Beach, California, where they visit Uncle Douglas and Aunt Elena) and back.It's an eventful trip during which Vicky has her first taste of romance, as she meets and is followed all the way across the country by a troubled and sometimes frightening rich boy named Zachary Grey. Zach's angry, hopeless response to life (which he fears losing at any moment, thanks to a rheumatic fever damaged heart) forces Vicky to confront twin demons that are making her own life miserable, in what L'Engle sensitively yet unsentimentally presents as something more than typical teen-aged angst. Vicky is part of the first generation to grow up under the shadow of the atom bomb, becoming aware of world events and their significance at the Cold War and nuclear arms race's height (this book's copyright date is 1963). She's become old enough, during her \\"difficult year\\" of being 14, to realize that she and everyone she loves can die at any moment; and she's also become old enough to ask herself whether or not God is really there. The love and respect she has for her grandfather, a minister and former missionary, can't save her from wondering if Zachary and others like him may not be right.Although I didn't find THE MOON BY NIGHT as enjoyable a read as other L'Engle books because it was a bit too introspective for me (I'm used to more action and dialog, and missed it sorely as I ploughed through page after page of interior monologue), it is nevertheless the one I would most recommend to today's young readers. I was just a little bit younger in 1963 than Vicky Austin, and I remember only too well how it felt to know that my generation might not live to grow up - much less middle-aged or old - thanks to a world suddenly grown far smaller and more dangerous than the one in which our parents came of age. The children of post-911 should find plenty to identify with in Vicky's crisis of hope and faith, and much encouragement in its resolution."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"This is one of my favourite books,and I know I will never grow too old to enjoy it. I identify strongly with fourteen year old Vicky,who tells the story. She and her family are travelling around America,before they move to New York.On the way Vicky meets Zachary,a very confused and troubled boy,who almost envies her naiveity. Vicky is not sure if she likes Zach as much as he likes her, but she learns a lot from knowing him. While journeying through new places with her family, she finds out about friendship and courage, and understands more how to love people (including herself) for what they are, not what they could be. This book has helped,(and is still helping,)me to grow up.I would reccomend it to anyone as a wonderful read, and I send a big thank you to Madeline L'engle for writing it!"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Meet the Austins\\" and hoped \\"The Moon by Night\\" would be half as good. It was even better. I like that \\"Meet the Austins\\" gave an introduction to the family, and I found them a very nice family in deed- loving and Christian but still very believable, with realistic problems.\\"The Moon by Night\\" takes place about two years later. Mother and Daddy have decided to move the family to New York, but to soften the blow they get there by way of a summer long cross-country camping trip.It is on this trip we get to know Vicky Austin even better. She is fourteen now, and going through a very confusing phase. She's not sure what she believes about God, or the world outside her safe home on the hill. Complicating things even more is Vicky's relationship with Zachary, a boy who seems to show up wherever they make camp.I could really relate to Vicky-every confusing emotion she had about Zach I felt too, as I read. I understood her questions about God, and I know I've had similiar ponderings. And I was very satisfied with her conclusions.I would HIGHLY reccomend \\"The Moon By Night\\" to any teen looking for a good read. I would definitely suggest reading \\"Meet the Austins\\" first, though this book has enough background you can enjoy it without any previous introduction to the family."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"The Moon by Night, written by Madeleinel L' Engle was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. This is a story of a troubled boy (Zachary) who has found interest in a very simple girl (Vicky), and both are trying to distinguish themselves. Vicky has always been overshadowed by her younger sister and older brother, and is now being followed by Zachary, who which none of her family appears to like. The Moon by Night is a lovely book about a girl growing up, and a boy trying to find himself."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve. I had never read a book I enjoyed more or met a character with whom I identified more. I borrowed this book from the library at least once a year and enjoyed it every time. I bought a hardcover copy as an adult, and still re-read it often. The Austins are, to me, the perfect family: intelligent, thoughtful, loving, and living in a world filled with books and music. (I told my husband he had to read this book to know how I wanted to raise our children.) When &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; came out, I couldn't imagine that it could come close to the quality of &quot;The Moon By Night,&quot; but it did. But that's another review."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"At the tender age of 14-years-old, Vicky Austin is filled with uncertainty about her life. She feels out of place, and, unlike the rest of her family, she feels unsure about what she wants to make of herself when she gets older. But when her parents decide to take a cross-country camping trip, she couldn't be more exciting. On the way, for the first time ever in her life, she meets up with a boy (a gorgeous one for that matter), named Zachary, who is actually interested in her. And she's interested in him too. But as he pops up at every one of the Austin family's camping stops, the family begins becoming aggravated with the boy. Now Vicky is becoming even more confused, what with suddenly having a boy's attention on top of everything else. Will Vicky ever be able to sort out her problems, or will her &quot;difficult year&quot; last longer than she actually thinks.Another excellent novel in the Austin series. Madeleine L'Engle has touched on a subject that affects people of all ages, and adds a bit of romance to liven things up. A must-read book for everyone, especially for girls ages 12-16.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"Vicky Austin is the main character of this touching novel. Her family is moving to New York; and to help soften the blow, they decide to camp all the way across the United States. Vicky takes this especially hard, because the move from rural Thornhill, to New York means ripping out everything she's established. Vicky slowly matures over the summer, and is exhilarated when she's followed across the country by Zachary Gray. Over the summer she learns many things about entering the adult world. I found this book to be yet another masterpiece by Madeleine L'Engle. She tends to carry characters over, and Vicky Austin reappears in several other books. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and one of the things I found to be the most interesting was the character development. I can't wait to read another one!"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I own about half of the books that L'engle has written, and I love each and everyone one of them. This may not have been my favorite, but it was very good and an essential read for anyone who loves her work. It's following Vicky Austin and introduces Zach, who is in at least 2 other of her books, which makes this even more important to understanding his character, and Vicky's, more fully."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I think this book is one of L'Engle's best. It gives you the feeling that you're in the book and that you know the characters personaly. Vicky is drawn to Zachary Gray who is very troubled, and much older. While Vicky and the rest of the family are on a camping trip that will lead them to California, Zachary follows her, leaving notes at all of the campsites that he passes. Vicky meets Andy, who makes her feel comfortable around him. She doesn't know whether to stay with Zachary, the unpredictable one, or with Andy, the normal teenager looking for love. I can identify with Vicky in almost every way and i highly recomend it to anyone. A Ring of Endless Light is a good coice to read after this one because Zach's back........"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"In this book we first meet Zachary who we persist in messing with various heroines for book upon book. In general this book is very straightforward except for the rather bizarre ending. Overall a good read."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"This story is about the thoughts of a young girl as she goes through life, finding who she truly is.What's happening? Where are you, God? Why me? ... Ever thought this before? Vicky Austin has. Being 14 isn't easy, and that's why I liked this book. Beautifully written, explaining a teen girl's life through this young girl's emotions. \\"The Moon By Night\\" deals with many situations that a young woman may come across, particularly the choice between boys. A romance written for teen girls seeking understandment, this book is a best.Thinking of what I didn't like about this book, I can't. I guess what annoyed me was that throughout the whole book, the Austin family is moving from one place to the next, which gets kind of old. Also, Vicky seems to just go off with any guy, not knowing what exactly they are like. This is seen through my eyes, since I would not just let any boy kiss me. So it isn't very fair, since that is just me and everyone is different. I enjoy romance with heart, that make me think. In the end, my resolution is, \\"Read the book!\\""},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"This is another great book from Madeline L'Engle. It is again told through the eyes of Vicky Austin. She is 14 now, and her life's changing forever. Maggy has been living with the Austins for two years, and is going to live with Uncle Douglas and Aunt Elena, recently married. The Austins will then go on a cross country camping trip, and return to not their safe haven of Thornhill, but New York City where Mr. Austin will do research. On the trip Vicky meets Zachary, who exposes her to life's sorrows. She also meets Andy, who becomes his rival. This is another classic from Ms. L'Engle!"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I thought that this was one of L'Engle's best, right up there with A Ring of Endless Light and A Wrinkle In Time. Vicky Austin has always been a thought provoking charecter to me, her vunerability is, I think, more than possible in our current world, but overall, she is a good role-model, and The Moon By Night is a wonderful example of her."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"Madeleine L'Engle gives us something to think about. It may be God, or death, or love.This book does this better than any other. I've read this book 3 times now and like it better every time. Vicky is a character that any woman of any age can identify with. It is timeless literature. The best scene is her religious discussion with Uncle Douglas. Any and everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I think it's very hard to find a book by L'Engle that is bad. And this book just furthers that point along, it is very very good for being a young adult novel. There's just so much information and wisdom packed into the series that it's hard not to like them.The Moon By Night is the 2nd book in the \\"Meet the Austins\\" series. I've read all the books out of order and as stand-alones (A Ring of Endless Light was perhaps my most favored book through my teenage years) and it's never really bothered me or kept me from enjoying the book. That being said, I always do recommend reading books in order. This particular book has the main character Vicky as a fourteen year old going on a camping trip with her family. Along the way she meets the exciting and terrible Zachary Gray who dazzles her and frightens her all at the same time. Her family doesn't approve of the friendship, but quietly lets her sort things out as she is trying to grow and figure herself out at this point in her life. And the camping with her family too brings them a sort of closeness and respect that makes her appreciate them more.Vicky is a great character. And she's so great because she's real and she reminds me of myself at that age. It's hard not to feel special in a family as unique as hers, and even more difficult is learning to appreciate yourself for who you are. She also has a natural appreciation and innocence about her that is refreshing. So even though her teenage years are happening during the 60's in this book, she feels like she could be your best friend in any time period. Zachary I'm not as fond of, but I don't think he's supposed to be a likable character. Girls are attracted to the troublesome dark type of guys and he fits the bill for that. I've been guilty of falling for a few guys like that myself until I realized I much prefer a sunny personality. Her family seems close-knit and while there is one sexist comment in regards to her father preferring that women don't wear pants, I excused it as the time period of the book and tried not to dwell on it too much.The plot is simplistic. It's a camping trip with a family and a somewhat love story. But what I think really makes this book stand out is that the theme of growing up is predominant in it. It could allow someone the same age as Vicky to really relate with her and get inside her head. And that's what makes it a valuable read. The writing is good, although there is quite a bit of religion incorporated into the book and I got tired of it in parts, but there was also a lot of poetry thrown in and I did appreciate that. I'm not much of a poetry person but L'Engle always seems to find poems that fit perfectly into her books.A very good read, as is the rest of the series. I highly recommend all of the books for Meet the Austins and some of L'Engle's other works as well.The Moon By NightCopyright 1963255 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I discovered The Moon by Night in a high school library. After devouring it, I was hooked on Madeleine L'Engle. I love all the introspective passages from Vicky's viewpoint. Her thoughts hook me from the very first page: \\"Indoors there was excitement and confusion and I guess a lot of happiness. I was the only one who seemed to be unhappy because nothing would ever be the same again. Up to a few days ago my life had been all of a piece, exciting sometimes and even miserable, but always following the same and simple pattern or home and school and family.\\" From this point onward, Vicky faces the confusion of change starting with the decision of her parents to move the family to New York. Then there's the fact that her Uncle Douglas and Elena have gotten married. There's also the fact that Maggy, who by the point has lived with the family for two years, will now move in with Uncle Douglas and Elena. To cushion all these changes, the Austin parents decide to take the family on a camping trip to California to visit the newlyweds. Along the way, however, Vicky encounters even more changes, starting with the car that sped through their campgrounds. As the car passed \\"something was flung out of the window and shattered against the side of our station wagon with a sound like an explosion.\\" This event leads to showdown with a gang, along with questions about stereotypes: Should the Austins be frightened by teenagers? Or should they resent Tennessee, the state in which this gang appeared? With the introduction of these questions, Madeleine L'Engle sets the stage for the arrival of troubled boy Zachary Gray. Through him, Vicky is forced to deal with the reality of evil and therefore questions about God's part in it. Being a teenager facing my own first doubts when I first read this book, I found great comfort in Vicky's conversation with her Uncle Douglas about faith. Since then, I have spent much time sorting through my questions about God. Oh, and I have also thought a lot about the nature of love, a topic that is naturally a large part of books for young adults. Yet I don't know if anyone ever truly has all the answers about faith and love. For that reason, even as an adult, The Moon by Night still resonates with me."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"This book is the sequel to \\"Meet the Austins\\", but you can easily read this book even if you haven't read the preceding one. Here, the Austins are on an extended family vacation, driving across the USA, seeing natural wonders, and camping out for a whole summer. Vicky, now 14, is having the usual angst that comes with being 14, feeling like she doesn't quite fit in anywhere, not sure if she believes in God (this is a bit of a problem given that her family is quietly but definitely Christian), and worried about the future of the planet. Regarding the latter, this book appears to be set in the Cold War atom bomb era of the early 1960s, around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis but before Viet Nam became the most pressing youth concern.Much of the book deals with Vicky's thoughts about these matters, whether interior to herself or expressed and discussed with family members and friends. A major device of the plot involves two boys who are interested in Vicky. One is Zach, a rich boy with a potentially fatal health problem and a jaundiced view of the world that may be partially caused by his own fear of death. Zach constantly gets into arguments with Vicky about the world and philosophy, and she professes to find him annoying, but on another level seems to enjoy the intellectual sparring. The other boy is Andy, a much more down-to-earth and positive guy, whose company Vicky is able to simply enjoy without all the sturm und drang she gets from Zach. Zach, who has decided he needs Vicky in his life, gets jealous and creates all sorts of havoc and hassle for Vicky in trying to get her away from Andy. At times Zach is so annoying that you really wish Vicky would give him the boot for good, but he makes a good foil for Vicky to express all the feelings about life, death, the future of the planet and so forth that are rattling around in her head.Interspersed with Vicky figuring out the world and her place in it are various adventures the family has on the road, including budding doctor Suzy saving a kid from bleeding to death, and another little girl coming perilously close to a bear. Once again the author skillfully crafts chapters to hold the reader's attention, often giving them a cliffhanger ending.This is a good book for teens and pre-teens knowledgeable enough to understand the historical context of Vicky's worries. It's likely that young people of today have some of the same fears and concerns, except theirs is tied to the post-9/11 era rather than the long-gone Cold War, so much of what Vicky worries about is still relevant today. I'll confess to skipping through a lot of the overly \\"thoughtful\\" parts of this book as a young reader, being in a hurry to get to the exciting parts about rockslides and bears in the park, but once I got old enough to have patience with Vicky's musings, I enjoyed those as well."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night","review":"I loved the book I read it over the weekend after I read A Ring of Endless Light.

There was a huge following of this sport in England at this time despite the fact that even watching was illegal.

All together it makes for a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Detective Wore Silk Drawers : A Sergeant Cribb Adventure","review":"The second of Peter Lovesey's Victorian mysteries (now reissued) plunges Sergeant Cribb and Constable Thackery into the underworld of bare-knuckled pugilism. In 1880, fighting with \\"the raw \`uns\\" has been outlawed in England for a decade, yet matches in out-of-the-way locales still draw huge crowds. When the headless body of a man with scarred knuckles washes up on the Thames Embankment, Cribb recruits a young policeman, Henry Jago, to pose as one of these midnight pugilists. But young Henry, good-looking, fit, earnest and callow, is no match for the seductive, sadistic Mrs. Vibart, who manages a stable of brutal fighters on her estate. And when Mrs. V. is herself found brutally murdered in her bed, the evidence points to, of all people, Henry. Will Sergeant Cribb crack the case--and hopefully before the unfortunate Henry is beaten senseless in the ring? Read on.Like all the Sergeant Cribb mysteries, this one is deftly plotted, lightly ironic, and full of the color of Victorian sport."},{"Title":"Detective Wore Silk Drawers : A Sergeant Cribb Adventure","review":"I have read a lot of Peter Lovesey and read any of his books I can get.

In fact, they may even be more difficult than the actual exam, which I feel makes it all the more valuable to those preparing for step 2. Another aspect of this book I really enjoyed was that the question blocks were broken up by subject (i.e. peds, surgery, internal medicine, etc.).

It came at a time when, at 57, I had been widowed for5 years and recently let go from my job of 27 years[which did not provide for my retirement] and I was embarking on a NEW career and life. It opened my eyes and provided me with a new and fresh perspective with humor and heart - just what I needed . Thank you Karen, all of &quot;US&quot; need a fresh perspective.I am looking forward to intermission and Act 2,3,4......"},{"Title":"For My Next Act. . .: Women Scripting Life after 50","review":"Meet Karen Baar, mother, women's health advocate, writer and woman of the \\"fifty-something\\" group. Baar has been involved in women's health issues since the 1970s. She holds a masters degree in public health from Yale University School of Medicine. She is the author of countless articles in such publications as The New York Times, Health, Cooking Light, Parenting, Self, Good Housekeeping, and Natural Health. She has co-authored three books: Women and Pain, The Circadian Prescription, and American Indian Healing Arts.In For My Next Act, Baar \\"compares and contrasts life before and after 50, offering readers a clear-eyed perspective on the way life changes for women as their roles and relationships evolve.\\" (Excerpt from the dust jacket)Shortly after the author turned fifty, her husband of many years left her. Life as she knew it was in complete disarray. Her children were grown, her career was successful; but her sense of self was challenged. Add to that mix, the fact that she was perimenopausal. She questioned everything about who she was and how she would continue with so many changes assaulting her at once. In the Introduction, Baar states, \\"I don't have all the answers yet. But, I've begun to reclaim my center, the solid core of me. More than ever before, I know who Karen is. And For My Next Act is the result of that journey.\\"The book begins with Baar's personal \\"fifty-something\\" story and builds on that by using interviews with women in the same age bracket conducted by medical, social and psychological experts. After much research and the study of the interview materials, Baar concludes that \\"most women emerge from their fifties feeling better about themselves, experiencing higher levels of happiness and satisfaction than women at all other stages of life.\\"Neatly sectioned into chapters on critical topics and subtopics for the fifty-something woman, the book also provides the reader an opportunity for self-assessment on each chapter's subject matter. These opportunities offer food for thought, and some also may be excellent journaling prompts.Chapter 1, \\"What do I want to be for the rest of my life?,\\" is a logical starting point. The following chapters takes the reader on the rollercoaster ride of traversing the 50's and making sense of it individually, including such issues as the Empty Nest Syndrome, friendships, religion and spirituality. Baar's final chapter poses the challenge to readers that they need to stop reading and start acting.From the author's afterword: \\"We fifty-something women are putting all aspects of our lives on the table. There are no established rites of passage to mark our journey. Instead, as we stand poised on the threshold to the next act of our lives, we learn from each other how to reclaim or reinvent our best and truest selves.\\"by Lee Ambrosefor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"For My Next Act. . .: Women Scripting Life after 50","review":"This books is a very easy read and address all the issues of this time of a woman's life.

I have done extensive field work with a Shuar related group and was impressed on how accurate Harner's account was, even though the group I worked with was separate in both time and space from the untsuri shuar. This is a must read for anyone interested in the ethnography of lowland South America."},{"Title":"The Jivaro, people of the sacred waterfalls","review":"Harner's Jivaro is a very interesting book. I cannot attest to the ethnographic veracity of the text as some other reviewers, but I can speak to what I thought about the book. This book is one of the most fascinating ethnographies I have read. It is very \\"sexy\\": violence, drugs, death, decapitation, shrunken heads...edgy stuff. What utterly fascinated me was the description of how this state of affairs came about. Harner claims that head-hunting raids didn't take place, or at least not with the frequency as reported in this book until the introduction of firearms by the Spanish. At this point rival tibes were better able to kill each other, and violence increased. I found it all very interesting, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Jivaro, people of the sacred waterfalls","review":"The title is good -- the Shuar (Jivaro) indeed have a special reverence for sacred waterfalls -- but the rest of the book captures little of the true flavor of Shuar culture and character. (I spent several months among the Shuar many years ago.) As an example, Nunkui is the spirit of Earth when referred to as a living being, but the author refers to Nunkui as &quot;a female crop fairy.&quot; Even if one does not speak Shuar, the relationship of the word &quot;Nunkui&quot; to the word &quot;Nunka&quot; (land or territory) should be obvious. There is much superficial observation in this book but very little true insight."},{"Title":"The Jivaro, people of the sacred waterfalls","review":"Michael Harner's &quot;Jivaro&quot; documents a society marked by excessive use of hallucinogenic stimulants.

The relatives, lovers, and friends of those who die faceinevitable bereavement. For many, however, the grieving thatfollows death is poorly understood, and hence, poorly handled. ***Thomas Attig's recent book, How We Grieve: Relearning the World(Oxford University Press, 1996), offers a powerfulconceptualization of bereavement and grief, and thus offersimmediate help to those who may have come across only the facilegeneralizations of some of the &quot;death and dying&quot; popularizers,such as Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. ***Thomas Attig is President of the Association for Death Educationand Counseling. In a series of six intertwined essays, each witha slightly different emphasis, he develops his central metaphor:&quot;relearning the world.&quot; Attig argues that bereavement is a&quot;choiceless event&quot;; grieving, by contrast, is full of choices,all of which require tremendous amounts of directed energy.Grieving, in other words, requires that survivors choose torelearn the world. And this relearning--this making of choices--is an active, difficult, and not always successful, process. ***Relearning the world encompasses a frighteningly wide range ofchoices. Attig illustrates these choices through the ingenioususe of a small number of case studies (i.e., concrete instancesof grieving), each of which occurs over and over in variouscontexts as the notion of &quot;relearning&quot; is unpacked and deepened.If you now think of grieving as simply a matter of &quot;feeling sad,&quot;you need this book. ***In less than 200 pages of clean, concrete, sharply focused prose,Thomas Attig illustrates and explains what it means to relearnthe world (i.e., what it means to grieve): 1)We relearn our physical surroundings; 2)We relearn our relationships with our fellow survivors; 3)We relearn our places in space and time; 4)We relearn our spiritual places in the world; 5)We relearn our selves [one entire essay is devoted to grief and personal integrity]; 6) We relearn our relationships with the deceased[another essay is devoted to love, grief, andseparation]. *** The brute reality of death remains, no matter what. No book canprevent bereavement or block the pain of bereavement when it doescome. No book can make grieving easy. No book can remove themystery of life and death. Still, reading does help. ThomasAttig's How We Grieve: Relearning the World may help survivorsthink a bit more clearly about grieving and make more positivechoices as they struggle with their bereavement. *** As a bonus, the book is beautifully printed. I recommend it toyou."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"This is a very, very good book. It helps immensely in understanding why grief can be so difficult and absorbing. It teaches how to be patient and understanding in dealing with grief, our own grief or the grief of others. It offers deep and valuable insights into the many aspects of the grief process--including why the world seems so strange after somebody dies, the importance of stories in grieving, our choice-making in bereavement, the ways we remain connected to a loved one who has died, even why so many of us want to read about grief when we are grieving."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"I was widowed at the age of 29. In the months that followed I read every non-secular grief book that I could find. Attig's was definitely the most helpful book I came across. It repeatedly enforced the point that things had changed beyond my control. It also then pointed out to me what I still had some control over. At a time when I was lost and feeling rather helpless it did a great job of showing me how I wasn't helpless. I gained a lot of motivation for facing the challanges ahead of me from Attig's book, I recommend it to others who's lives have been turned upside down from grief."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Is grief an illness? Are there stages of grief? Does time heal all wounds? For Thomas Attig, the answer to all of these questions is NO! Grief is a process by which one relearns his/her world, a world that has been permanently altered by the death(s) of significant persons in one's life. Using the stories of eleven persons, Attig demonstrates the active nature of grieving. For Attig, the stories are the heart of the matter. The reader is introduced into the stories at the point of the loss experiences. Attig takes us through their coping behaviors as he develops the model of relearning the world; including relearning our selves and our relationships with the deceased. How We Greive is a very special book. It does not simply restate the stages and phases of grief so frequently outlined in like texts. Attig presents a different and important perspective to the understanding of how one copes with the death of a loved one and why grief occurs. Although Attig's book may be perceived as a resource for the professional caregiver, it can motivate all of us to examine the nature of our own relationships and assess our own coping styles and support systems."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"This is a profound and immensely practical work on grief.

Attig brings this topic a step further in discussing not only how we grieve, but in suggesting that in doing so, we must relearn the world. We have lost a loved one and our world has been vastly changed in just a few quick moments. We need to cope, to allow ourselves to grieve, and ultimately to create or &quot;relearn&quot; a world that can never be the same. The wonderful case studies Attig presents are the most helpful in helping the grieving reader to do this important life task. They tell real stories of real people that we can identify with and relate to. They evoke emotional responses that help us grow and believe we too can relearn our world in the face of grieving. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is grieving the loss of a beloved relative or friend, or to those who wish to prepare themselves in advance for the inevitable."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Grief is a topic that has been explored only in recent years, with Kubler-Ross getting it all started.

How often we say, when somebody has died, \\"If there is anything I can do...\\" We're sincere, but usually, after we've prepared a casserole, we feel so helpless to do anything more. Then I discovered \\"How We Grieve: Relearning the World.\\" Since then I've been giving it to bereaved friends. They take comfort that others have shared their experiences. They learn the ways that others have begun putting their lives back together. Several have conveyed to me what reading \\"How We Grieve\\" has meant to them. It gave them a sense of being understood and it provided many useful clues to understanding themselves and discovering how to reengage in the joys and burdens life brings. So, in truth, I no longer say, \\"If there is anything I can do.\\" Instead, perhaps three months after the funeral, I write a heart-felt inscription in a copy of \\"How We Grieve\\" and send it to my friend. I commend the practice for the solace and healing it has provided."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Thomas Attig, a former professor of philosophy and recent past-president of the Association for Death Education and Counseling, would like us to believe that he has introduced a new approach to the world of grief counseling, the idea of &quot;relearning the world&quot; after loss. One feels like the target of a salesman as the author repeatedly seeks to convince us why his approach to grief work is unique. The more powerful portions of the book are the real-life stories of grieving that are used to illustrate the ways in which we grieve.It's not that Attig's ideas are off-track or even disputable, but rather that they are not revolutionary. They have been addressed by other writers, though without a catchy name being applied. More importantly, the process of &quot;relearning the world&quot; has been experienced by all who have suffered the debilitating loss of a loved one and eventually found their way back to a life worth living"},{"Title":"Dream of Freedom (American Dreams, Book 1)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of history provided in this new series. I have read other books by this author and believe this was the most in-depth fiction book I've encountered by him, so far. I look forward to the next installments of this series. The book follows the viewpoint of 4 families during the years leading up to the Civil War: A Northern family with no slaves, a plantation Southern family that mistreats their slaves, a forward-thinking Southern family who frees their slaves, and a runaway slave family. These families intertwine to give a wide spectrum to the stories within the series."},{"Title":"Dream of Freedom (American Dreams, Book 1)","review":"With Dream of Freedom Michael Phillips has achieved what most authors never accomplish in their lifetimes-his 100th book published! At this writing, he has already surpassed that mark and shows little sign of slowing down.This is volume one in the \\"American Dreams\\" series, which chronicles events leading up to the Civil War. Lucindy Eaton's journey from slavery to freedom brings her into contact with Virginia plantation owners, Richmond and Carolyn Davidson, whose faith makes them question the validity of continuing to own slaves. They find themselves immersed in a polarizing regional and national debate over slavery. What they decide is carefully thought through and has far-reaching implications. It leads to a fascinating glimpse into the workings of the Underground Railroad.Phillips highlights the historical with occasional footnotes of actual events that bear on the narrative. He is an experienced storyteller, but one who requires patience from his readers as he develops characters and provides welcome realism.He nails the slave dialect and at times provides unconventional thought. Richmond and his wife are not your typical Christians. They don't go to church or consider themselves religious. In a conversation with an acquaintance, Richmond makes a distinction between \\"obedience and dogma\\" without further explanation. Carolyn speaks of Christianity as \\"a way of life. Jesus taught us how to live, how to treat one another, how to think.\\" It's something that anyone can practice, she says. Other subtle references to the importance of obedience are scattered throughout.In another verse, three ladies from a church set out to convert an unchurched young woman. Their religious language and cliches confuse her and cause her to make a swift retreat. She does not see in them what Phillips portrays through the actions of Richmond and Carolyn Davidson-a loving Father who is good.Good writing, thought-provoking ideas, historical realism, and a careful look at the issues make this especially enjoyable for those who want a little more from their fiction."},{"Title":"Dream of Freedom (American Dreams, Book 1)","review":"I have just finished both Dream of Freedom and Dream of Life.

Of all the different decades of her writing, the 60s is the one in which I would have liked most to have known her, and even though her development had taken a different direction, she was still very much at the top of her game at certain moments. She had long ago left off writing the Mary Westmacott novels, and the great days of her playwriting career had recently come to a halt with the superlative RULE OF THREE in 1962. And yet some of the mystical, as well as the shrewdly observant, the qualities we read \\"Mary Westmacott\\" to enjoy in bulk, still clings to the material of STAR OVER BETHLEHEM, and in fact in some ways it's Christie's most nodernist, fragmented, and yet far-reaching work.The poems aren't much, and really if these poems are new then she hasn't progressed much since her very first book of poems from back in the 1920s--a remarkable case of intellectual paralysis if you ask me. But the stories seem very much of a piece, and very much contemporary--even to such internal details as the talk about the \\"ban the Bomb\\" marchers, or the Japanese sci-fi structure of \\"In the Cool of the Evening,\\" in which water contaminated by a nuclear power plant accident has mutated the animals and plant life of a small English village into innumerable new monstrous yet beautiful species.One story, \\"The water Bus,\\" doesn't do it for me, it's a little too contained and foreshortened. A typically self-satisfied English bourgeoise, like Joan Scudamore in Westmacott's masterpiece ABSENT IN THE SPRING (1944). goes for a cooling ride in a London water bus and finds herself jostled by a variety of loud, shrieking lower class peasants. At first they repel her, then under Christ's influence she comes to accept them as wholly human.The remaining stories, from the Nativity themes of \\"The Naughty Donkey\\" and the title piece, all the way through to the modern pageantry of \\"Promotion in the Highest,\\" are superbly satisfying, testaments to Christie's magnificent storytelling abilities.She was to write, as far as I know, only one story after these, the Mr. Quin adventure of \\"The Harlequin Tea Set.\\" She was like Prospero, tempted to break her own rod, a master storyteller now giving it all up for the pleasures of silence. She is, I think, our very greatest writer, and this book a puzzling sidelight to her genius."},{"Title":"A Star over Bethlehem and Other Stories","review":"In her autobiography, Agatha Christie remarked that in her mystery books, she wanted to include ideas of right and wrong and religious faith, but her publishers wouldn't go along with it. So in this book, Star Over Bethlehem, after she had achieved success greater than any other writer in the world, before or since, she exercised her prerogative to write about her faith. This is a short collection of sweet, charming stories of spiritual significance, interspersed with a few poems. One story is about Mary growing old, taking care of the beloved disciple John, and his taking care of her, as Jesus asked them to as He died on the Cross. Another story is about a handicapped child who is pitied (and prayed for, to be made whole) who in fact has a closer personal relationship with God than those who are praying for him. All the stories have a bit of the Christie twist. It's another dimension to the great author, or rather, a deepening of the dimensions we already saw, her sensitivity, her kindness, her compassion, her love."},{"Title":"A Star over Bethlehem and Other Stories","review":"This is not a bit of Hercule Poirot about a murder or something.

Buying without checking for appropriateness and suitability is a clear indication of bad news for the gene pool.NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER STATES IN THE SERIES...--Possibly true; nonetheless, out of all the similar publications [for South Carolina] that I have seen, this one is, IMO, the best game in town. It is a great complement to the also-excellent South Carolina Wildlife Facilities Atlas that is available from the SC DNR.PLUSES:**Large Format - [this is essential to this kind of product & makes reading it MUCH easier]**GPS Grids - This means that the entire state is broken into equidistant grids which, in addition to making the product easier to interface with GPS devices, makes for an excellent and rapid \\"table of contents\\" for moving around inside the atlas quickly. For instance, let's say that one knew where Georgetown, SC was and wanted to immediately go to the correct LARGE TOPO map for that city... One would simply go to the 63-grid map of the entire state that is just inside the front cover, locate Georgetown in Grid 49, and turn to where that entire grid can be found in numerical sequence. Bang! That was quick! [and THAT makes this kind of map extremely pleasurable and useful to use!]**Updated Regularly - This is the 2006 Edition; when buying this kind of publication if you want the roads to be up-to-date in a fast growing state such as SC, you better be sure to find the latest edition available.

There are many more lakes that we will explore next summer using this atlas.

It covers all of the basics needed to work in the field of Bergman spaces, plus a whole lot more for those who are already experts. The proofs are very clear and the exposition is fantastic. Most math books are terribly written, but this one reads like Hemingway went and got a PhD in math!"},{"Title":"Bergman Spaces (Mathematical Surveys and Monographs)","review":"I decided to write a review after noticing that it has three reviews by two readers who demonstrated good knowledge of fine literature but none of the mathematical theory at hand.The first author is an outstanding mathematician with excellent ability of exposition as demonstrated in his previous books and the second one is his very talented young student who already made himself a name. I have written the first (and so far the only) review of Duren's book \\"Theory of H^p Spaces\\" on Amazon and stand by my five star rating of that book. Unfortunately the newest one, \\"Bergman spaces\\" is a total opposite of that.The first thing that puzzles the reader is why the book is devoted almost exclusively to the \\"un-weighted\\" case. The authors try to give a very unconvincing explanation in the Overview by saying that not all the results extend to the weighted case but that hardly could be a satisfactory answer. When there were two other books devoted to the same topic published earlier, that treat the general case, this new one seems a little mistimed, to say the least.Next, even the results for un-weighted case are not always given in the most general case. For example, the theorem about boundedness of Bergman projection is proved for the case p>1 only and the fact that there are bounded projections in the case p=1 also is basically ignored. This last fact is one of the highlights of the differences between Hardy and Bergman spaces and the reader does not get that at all. As a result, the next section about dual spaces is incomplete: Whereas the duals are known for all values of p>0, the reader finds out only the almost trivial case p>1. Then it becomes even worse in one of the subsequent sections on harmonic conjugates. This time the result is formulated for all values of p>0 but the proof is carried out for p=1 and p>1. There is no explanation why is it impossible to include this \\"old result, due to Hardy and Littlewood\\" (to quote the authors) of 1931. The proof could easily fit in a couple of pages.All the above examples are from the same Chapter 2. There are many more in other Chapters too, but I will mention only one more, that also demonstrates another trend in this book. Instead of mentioning original authors, in many cases the book ignores them and mentions instead much later authors and much weaker results. In Section 4.8, Theorem 13, proves basically, that if the zeros of the function are on a radius, then they should satisfy the Blaschke condition, and then later on they mention that the result is true also in a more general case when the zeros are located in a Stolz region. What the authors fail to mention is that the latter result (the more general one) was done much earlier and also who did it. So, the reader thinks that H. Shapiro and A. Shields proved Theorem 13 and somebody else just made a minor modification. Unfortunately, this is not a minor omission by the authors but a very visible intention and it starts as early as page 2, where in the Overview they give a clumsy explanation why the spaces are called as they called.There is a kind of justice that after all the authors hurt only their book. It came out pretty bad and intentional omissions only made it worse."},{"Title":"Bergman Spaces (Mathematical Surveys and Monographs)","review":"Great stuff.

But when I read that she had a new book published called, 'A Golfer's Day With The Master,' I was dissapointed, thinking that she was trivilizing her remarkable talent by writing a book about a golfer's day with God. I was Wrong...Wrong...Wrong.In my estimation, on the book jacket it should read, author Sr. Dorothy Ederer in collaboration with the Holy Spirit. I know you will also sense this as you read the beautiful prayers and reflections that are in this book. She has taken an ordinary subject, a day in the life of a golfer and made it into a spiritual treasure. This is a must read book for anyone who would like a better understanding of what can happen when one allows the Holy Spirit to abide in one's life. This book could have just as well been titled, 'One Day In Your Life With God' because it encompass's everything one needs to know about how we can relate to God in every aspect of our life.I highly recommend this little treasure.

I find the bait-and-switch on authorship somewhat disingenuous to start with. Of course it's Fawn Brodie. No, I didn't buy the book. Neither do I intend to. I've read enought to know that it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.\\"No Ma'm, That's Not History,\\" by Hugh Nibley, came out shortly after Ms. Brodie published her book originally. Previous reviewers have listed other debunking sources. I used to lump anti-Mormon literature into three categories: outright lies, half-truths and truths made to look foolish. Ms. Brodie's skillful blend of all three have caused me to wonder if I should maybe establish a fourth category. But a name for it escapes me at the moment."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"While it was an interesting read, though to be fair quite negative of the Mormons, further research into her sources reveals that she does appear to pull some of them out of thin air. Some of the sources simply do not exist that I can find. A few are quoted accurately. Others are quoted out of context or misquoted entirely. Some are second-hand accounts from people who felt slighted or were disgruntled. Such accounts do not make for very objective research.I did read Hugh Nibley's rebuttal, and while it is somewhat polemical, it does answer ms. Brodies half-hearted effort to discredit the Mormon church, which she belonged to as a child. While some Mormon practices do seem weird, they are no less peculiar than those of any other faith, such as Islam or even Reformed Presbyterianism.What strikes me most is the virtual absence of any positive information about the Mormons founder Joseph Smith other than a token \\"he meant well.\\" Despite her access to official Mormon archives, ms. Brodie failed to bring out any original material from the single most authoritative source. The Mormons have spent tens of thousands acquiring documents, some true and some discredited forgeries, regarding their history, and have perhaps the most complete history of any church, so far as original documentation is concerned.When reviewing this book, don't simply look at the fact that she cites everything, look into those citations to ensure that they really are accurate, and that they truly exist.If you are looking to educate yourself about the Mormons, use a balanced approach. Read material from both sides, preferrably that which is written from an objective point of view. I would also recommend reading from Hugh Nibley's extensive writings (particularly \\"Tinkling Bells and Sounding Brass\\") if you are interested in Mormon theology. While it is geared for the Mormon believer, it can offer valuable insights to the Mormon church.Don't take this book at face value."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I read this book because of it's notoriety. With both staunch Mormons and anti-Mormons screaming bloody murder at each other over this (as can be seen in previous reviews), I knew there was something to discover. What I found, however, was extremely disappointing.I read this book thinking it was history--it's not. That thought was quickly dispelled from the start when I read, with no small degree of wonder, just how much Brodie claims to have known from inside the mind of Joseph Smith. Where true history relates the event, Brodie touches upon it and then proceeds to tell why Smith did it, what he was feeling, and just what he hoped to accomplish by it. What's even more disturbing, she has the arrogance to present her wild speculations as facts.Whether or not you believe that Smith was a prophet, Brodie's story is too much. Does she really believe that he could have dictated the entire Book of Mormon, without stopping or revising, and in the sentence structure in which it now appears, and do it so fluently that those writing for him did not know he was just making it up as he went along? That's fine if you don't believe in the veracity of the Book of Mormon, but at least come up with a more plausible story than that one. By making this allegation, she attributes to Smith a literary talent above most any other person in history. Who else can write a 500 page book that lasts over 150 years without revision?Of course, those who see Smith as a fraud anyway will see this as a wonderful standard under which to rally. But those of us who seek real history, without the zeal of religion (or anti-religion) will be utterly disgusted by the author's blatant negligence of sources. Many quickly praise that she has \\"done her homework\\", and, upon scanning the bibliography, it appears she has. Upon closer examination, however, it is easy to see that the bibliography does little more than take up space.The majority of her allegations, as well as the inferences she draws, have no source. They are either not documented, or simply products of Brodie's imagination. When she does give a source, it is many times the testimony or work of a bitter enemy of Smith which, though such testimonies may be useful, should not compose the bulk of the work. As for her other sources (Church History, newspapers, etc.), they leave much to be desired.As I was reading, I was so shocked by some of her claims that I checked up on some of her sources. What I found was a great example of document-splicing. In many cases she manipulated her sources to an almost unrecognizable extent, often insinuating things the author clearly did not intend. Sometimes, she misquoted the source altogether. Come now, Mrs. Brodie, did you really think that noone who ever read your book was going to have access to any of your sources?In my opinion, this book was nothing more than a feeble attempt of the author's to lash back at the society by which she felt restricted. The work is so saturated with the author's bias and speculation that it can scarcely pass as non-fiction.Mormon and non-Mormon alike should avoid this book, simply because it's a horrible attempt at biography. In giving this book one star, I take none of my personal feelings on the subject into account. It simply is bad history. Rather you believe in Smith or not, this book will profit you nothing."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Let me save you the time of trying to read every review on Amazon. Each review falls into one of two categories. Non-LDS individuals who want to slam Joseph Smith and LDS individuals who support Joseph Smith. Depending on which camp the reviewer is in will dictate their review of the book. Anyone who tells you they are indifferent is simply avoiding the truth. Only Mormons or anti-mormons would take the time to read this worthless book.Anti-mormons will point to Ms. Brodie's scholarly reputation. Because this book wasn't written by Ed Decker or (Dr.) Martin it somehow doesn't fall into the anti-mormon category. Rather, this now becomes pure history. Please keep in mind that just because Ms. Brodie attempts to be scholarly doesn't actually mean that she is scholarly. Putting worthless footnotes after every sentence doesn't make you a historian or a good writer. But being able to discriminate between reliable and unreliable sources does. Ms. Brodie, from a scholastic perspective, fails miserably.Some have argued that she didn't have an axe to grind or that she was still a friend to the Mormons even after publishing this book. Yeah right. I have yet to meet a Mormon who has read her book and thought that it was an unbiased review of the life of Joseph Smith. It sure sounds good to claim that Mormon's in high places have read and enjoyed your book. I just want to know who those people are.The moral of the story is simple. If you want to &quot;debunk&quot; the LDS church then go ahead and drop some change on this classic. It is full of things that aren't true, but they sure sound good. The information can prove to be very useful in writing a good anti-mormon sermon or gearing up for a crusade night.If you are a latter-day saint don't waste your money on this. It is the same old recycled garbage that has floated around about the church for almost 200 years. Rumors, stories from apostates, anecdotes by individuals who had a clear agenda to bring down the church line every page of this book. If you want a truly critical and accurate review of the life of Joseph Smith there are a hundred books better suited for your sincere quest for knowlegde.Ms. Brodie has succeeded in one thing. This book, above all else, shows just how pathetic scholarly attempts at bringing down the LDS church have been. When you have to resort to half-truths, lies, and fables, it only verifies and validates my belief. Christ always taught by truth. Those that oppose him taught with hate and inaccuracies. Christ doesn't need to support his position by making things up or by relying on people that lie at every chance they have to distort the truth. In the end the ultimate source of truth won't be found in the books written by man. In the end an answer to a prayer will lead the pure in heart to our Heavenly Father's truth."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I'd compare this book to the movie, Shakespeare in Love. It's based on a lot of facts, but she's used some creative liberties. Fawn Brodie is totally inept when it comes to real scholarship. For example, one of her sources was a group of people who had claimed to see ghosts and claimed that Joseph Smith was some sort of sorcerer... she also uses a source from a man who described Joseph Smith as short and dumb-looking and claimed Joseph Smith used phrases like \\"can't not.\\" (Joseph Smith was over 6' tall and very distinguished looking as well as extremely articulate). Both sources were proven liars, but she used both of them even though their stories completely contradicted other reliable sources that she left out! Furthermore, she ignored countless first-hand witnesses and simply took from a grab bag of contradictory testimonies, even though yellow journalism and discrimination were rampant. Her novel is entertaining, but that's partly because of her amazing mind-reading of those who died 150 years ago and her intuition about what people REALLY meant when they spoke. Fawn Brodie is a nerd and is obviously an atheist/agnostic. She's not even a scholar... she could probably write fiction or work for Enquirer magazine. If one wanted to buy this, one might check the ridiculous book she wrote about Thomas Jefferson... critics spotted that one as a sham immediately... the exact same scholarly follies are practiced in this novel as well. She's a rotten scholar, but her writing is interesting in a Jerry Springer sort of way. Don't get me wrong, she takes a lot of facts and things that people ACTUALLY said. However, Joseph Smith was the target of so many contradictory reports, you can make up just about any theory and simply pick and choose sources at your leasure. At least she put something coherrant together, which is almost a mircale. That's the only reason this book is highly regarded. She was apparently the first to figure out that as long as you had a theory about him, you could put a coherrant book together using evidence... however, the evidence could support about ANY theory, strangely enough. Joseph Smith is still a mystery to historians and will continue to remain so, unless they are believers. If one were to follow the trail, like the skeptical Martin Harris mortgaging his property right after showing Professor Charles Anthon the Book of Mormon, or actually including the testimonies of those closest to Joseph Smith (all of which were believers), one would be writing like a historian. If your book about Joseph SMith is believable to atheists, you didn't utilize proven scholarly methods. Proven scholarly methods would be forced to go to people like David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdry and Joseph's immediate family, all of whom directly contradict Fawn's central thesis and unproven theory."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"When this author somehow supplies what Joseph Smith &quot;must have been thinking&quot; and puts together a senario from that, as to why things happened instead of looking at what he and others said is the reason, then readers should take care. If you have read other non prejudiced books then you will be able to see the distortions here. If anybody REALLY wants to know facts, get The Encyclopedia of Mormonism by McMillian, it is only four volumes and was not put out by the LDS (they took a year to review it before they endorsed it!) though many LDS were asked to submit articles (only makes sense if it is about them) there is even a whole subject on Anti-LDS of over several pages which gi ves titles of Anti-LDS books and authors!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"How tiresome.

If you are an anti-Mormon, then have at it, but remember that none of the references withstand empirical investigation.

Brodie has been able to dig up some little known and little talked about events to be sure, but she places primary importance on these facts and pieces them together in a fashion that exposes a pretty strong personal agenda. Brodie is a master at brushing by events that do not support her agena. Much more than her poor presentation of facts, I am concerned that Brodie seems to &quot;know&quot; what Smith and others were thinking when the events unfolded. Most of her conclusions could be argued if not absolutely proven false. If you are looking for the truth about Mormonism, there are much better books out from both Mormon and Non-Mormon sources."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This no biography, although Brodie would like you to think it is.

She also did some hatchet jobs on some of our nations' founding fathers. She presumes to read Joseph Smith's mind, omits important information, distorts and abuses the facts. A couple of little books written in rebuttle have been No Ma'am That's Not History, by Hugh Nibley, and Exploding the Myth about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, by F.L.Stewart. A fair book about Joseph Smith I would reccommend is Joseph Smith, an American Prophet by John Henry Evans (a non-Mormon) or the The History of Joseph Smith by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith.

I could take more time explaining but I've got lots better things to do than waste time on this collection of fictional tidbits. I think the words \\"trashy\\" and \\"amateurish\\" would best describe this book that includes long lists of footnotes that are in some cases outright fabrications and in other instances refer to fabrications printed by some other author who also fabricated information regarding Joseph Smith when they couldn't find anything bad.If you are truly interested in Joseph Smith or the origins of The Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) I suggest Donna Hill's (author is not a Mormon but an Historian) \\"Joseph Smith:The First Mormon\\". Even better would be to read Joseph Smith himself in \\"The Book of Mormon\\" or \\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith\\". The Library of America, in a volume entitled \\"American Sermons\\", has included a complete funeral sermon given by Joseph Smith just prior to his murder called \\"The King Follett Sermon\\". (King Follett was a friend of Joseph Smith's and Smith gives an overview of theology that is nothing short of astounding.) Ms. Brodie's book is really only a collection of discredited psychobabble and distortion that is quite disorganized and boring.And isn't it fascinating that this brief, year's old review that is buried way back in the list of reviews receives so many negative votes?

Daring, smart, and relatively neutral, Brodie unveiled the true story of the origins of Mormonism through the life of its original prophet, Joseph Smith. When I first read No Man Knows My History, it launched me toward change I could never have imagined. Now that my life is changed, and with the eyes of a writer, a re-read of this material gives me new appreciation and respect for Fawn Brodie's genius and courage. Joseph Smith was just a man, not a prophet. He was a remarkable man, however, and the timing of his life and death sparked the fastest-growing world religion ever known.

She is a very talented writer with the ability to share historical facts and still be gripping.I sense from some LDS responses that there appears to be a level of doubt relating to the truthfulness of her text.In looking at the evidence, the foundation of the LDS church risks being likened to one built upon sand whereby, the floods will come, and the winds will blow, and will beat upon that house, and it will fall, and great will be the fall of it.

Brodie has done some good research into the life of the founder of the LDS church.It also describes an early LDS church that was quite charismatic - certainly different from the gerontocracy that governs the church today.Although this book does specifically refer to accounts that are damning to Joseph Smith, I did not find this book to be a total character assassination of him. The book portrays a very human person in what the LDS believe to be a true prophet. I particularly find warming such accounts as Joseph caring for babies that he and Emma agreed to take care of or coming short of promising to cure an ailing infant during the many blessings he gave when the church was first established. Even Brodie's assertion that Smith was writing the Book of Mormon to try to save his family's farm provides the reader with an even-handed explanation of his character. The book of course stops short of extolling him as a great prophet who restored \\"God's kingdom on earth\\", and that's what I imagine does not sit well with the LDS faithful."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This is a very well written book, which accounts for some of its considerable impact. Readers should know, however, that it was written from a profoundly naturalistic perspective. Some, of course, will love that. Others, however, will (or should) find it troubling. It's amusing, for instance, to see some of the apparent evangelical Christians below praising the book. They don't seem to realize that Mrs. Brodie's attitude toward their beliefs would have been essentially the same as her attitude toward the beliefs she herself had rejected. She was an outspoken agnostic or atheist. The other fundamental flaw of this book is its practice of psychohistory -- the same technique that she used in her approaches to Thaddeus Stevens, Richard Nixon, Sir Richard Burton, and, rather disastrously, to Thomas Jefferson. In the cases of Smith, Stevens, Nixon, and Burton, Mrs. Brodie was dealing with marginal, unfashionable, or even unpopular characters, who had no influential constituency to defend them. When she took on Mr. Jefferson, however, many scholars (my personal favorite is Garry Wills) came down on her like the proverbial ton of bricks. The methodological flaws that they identified in her Jefferson book were precisely those that her earlier critics had noted in her earlier books -- when nobody was willing to listen. Final verdict: Well written, worth a read, not to be trusted as the final word. Nor anything close thereunto."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Brodie's book is a MUST-READ for those interested in Mormonism. She provides information about Joseph Smith that the Mormon Church doesn't want you to know."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Have you noticed who hates this book? Why do you suppose that is? Those in the Church will naturally rail against Brodie's sources and facts--if that's possible. How do you rail against someone who cited everything she has written? Say nothing for the fact that it's a little difficult to get your hands on things written 200 years ago. However, the FACTS are (and you may not like them), but Fawn Brodie left no stone unturned. She listed everything that we have to document the life of Joseph Smith, so any unsuspecting Mormon inquirer could form his/her own conclusions. Fawn Brodie has written a wonderfully detailed book that capitvates the reader. She cites every single source, including those from the LDS church itself. Perhaps Mormons would prefer the kind of History one can find in the \\"Book of Mormon\\" or the \\"History of Mormon Church,\\" published by the LDS Church.

Her scholarship is fair and balanced. With her access to the LDS church's archives,(her uncle was one of church's &quot;prophets&quot; ) she was given and invaluable look into that church's history .The substanciated information and details she gives in her book is something that the church prefers that its membership not know about.If someone is truly and objectively looking at the LDS church, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is one book that is a must read as they consider what the LDS church has to offer."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"It's not often that a book's first few paragraphs confirm its vaunted reputation, but Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" is one of those works whose greatness is obvious from the very first page. With tight, artistic prose, and the masterful use of evocative, archaic American words- gazetteer, midwives, scryers, schoolmasters- she transports us, almost as involuntarily as Joseph Smith's powers made the faithful see his visions, to a distant setting, to the beginning of our story in old New England. The cast of characters are not, however, made up of those stern Pilgrims or Revolutionary icons in powdered wigs so familiar from shorthand history, but of a different and lesser known people- those sturdy Anglo-Saxon farmers, from whom Joseph Smith descended, who cleared the western forests and, in the freedom of their isolation, discarded time-honored religious orthodoxies and made their own terms with God. Some became skeptics and rationalists. Some practiced magic, dreamed dreams and lost themselves in the delirium of ecstatic Christianity. Some, like Joseph Smith, went completely beyond the boundary walls of the imagination and birthed entirely new cosmologies on the American frontier. Surpassing all other such homegrown seers, gurus, and shamans, in the breadth, beauty, and continuing vitality of his universe, Joseph Smith is the apotheosis of the American mythmaker, in a country that practically breeds them. In Fawn Brodie's classic biography, we are treated to the authoritative study of the man whom I regard as perhaps the most fascinating character in American history. If, as some impartial scholars estimate, his church might claim over 200 million adherents by the end of the century, he may well be regarded as America's most influential figure as well.As excellent as the prose is, as previously mentioned, it is matched only by the author's research. Being the first non-LDS biography of Joseph Smith (although as an ex-Mormon, the author had a natural understanding of the more recondite LDS concepts and controversies), this book is no regurgitation or compilation of other authors' works. Mrs. Brodie blazed a trail through a mountain of diaries, letters, newspapers and public records to paint an original biographical portrait of beating, breathing vitality. Scholarly, scientific and painstakingly thorough, I can't conceive that very many details were missed. You will know the facts of Joseph Smith's life to the last available jot and tittle, and gain some understanding of his mind to the extent that it is possible to extrapolate theories from the evidence.I don't know Mrs. Brodie's religious beliefs, besides the fact that she was an ex-Mormon, but never for a moment in this biography does she give the slightest credence to Joseph Smith's supernatural experiences. That's not to say, as some online sources have, that she is necessarily \\"secular\\" or \\"atheistic.\\" Even the most credulous theist must dismiss Joseph Smith's claims after examining the weight of evidence. The contradictions and absurdities of his Scriptures and prophecies are just too overwhelmingly damning. However, it's hard to resist some speculation, psychological and historical. Was Joseph Smith a complete fraud? After all, his own friend testified that Smith admitted to him that his story about the golden plates started out as a prank on his family. Did he start to really believe his own story (as Mrs. Brodie conjectures) or was Smith fully aware that his revelation was a pure imposture from the beginning to the end?Or, to be even more provoking, is it possible that Joseph Smith actually did experience \\"something\\" on that hill in New York? Demonic influence or even possession can't be discounted, especially considering Smith's youthful necromantic experimentation. If one wishes to be completely rationalist, we can still wonder whether he might have found \\"something\\" on Cumorah Hill. Mrs. Brodie briefly muses that he could have found a bronze (I think) breastplate, as such artifacts were not unheard of in the region. What if he did find some sort of engraving? Surely not the Book of Mormon, but some tangible artifact around which he chose to weave an imaginative and profitable story, rather than submit it to the prosaic interpretations of linguists and scholars? After all, the evidence for a pre-Columbian European presence in North America, from Washington to Minnesota to New England, is too numerous and compelling to ignore. Eight witnesses testified that they had seen the golden plates, not in a state of \\"entrancement\\" as had the Three Witnesses, but in reality. Did Joseph Smith show them some Viking carving or Irish engraving? It's a fact that even though most of the witnesses broke with the Mormon church, they never denied the existence of the golden plates. On the other hand, John Bennett testified that Smith asked him to go to New York City and have golden plates secretly made so that they could be exhibited for profit. What accounted for all the visions and supernatural experiences of people close to Joseph Smith? Was the Prophet an expert on the effects of psychedelic mushrooms, as is common with shamans? Did he use them himself or surreptitiously have his friends ingest them? Or did he merely possess an unnaturally strong power of hypnotism? Or was the whole thing a moneymaking conspiracy? None of these explanations can be ruled out.One criticism I have is the author's rejection of the Spalding-Rigdon theory, which posits that the Book of Mormon was plagiarized in part from an earlier work of fiction. I agree with Mrs. Brodie that, based on the chronology, Rigdon probably had no part in it. However, I disagree that Spalding's influence should be ruled out. Let's not forget that it was the people of Conneaut, OH who approached Philastus Hurlbut with their suspicions and rather specific memories, not the other way around. Also, the discovery of the \\"Manuscript Story\\" is irrelevant; the Conneaut witnesses specified that the story they heard Spalding read was entitled \\"Manuscript Found\\" and contained many distinctive parallels with the Book of Mormon that just couldn't be a mere coincidence, such as the unique names of the protagonists Nephi and Lehi and other uncanny similarities in names and incidents. We don't know how Joseph Smith got a hold of Spalding's manuscript, but I think we can be sure that he did. It's also likely that \\"Manuscript Found\\" is lost forever, as there was probably no more than 1 existing copy of Spalding's handwritten novel, and Joseph Smith would surely have destroyed the evidence of his plagiarism.To sum up an overlong review, never mind the condemnation of religiously-motivated critics. This is a masterpiece of biography. This book is a necessary component of any education about Mormonism."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book, now nearly 60 years old, remains the definitive source on Joseph Smith and serves as a key source for more recent works, notably John Krakauer's \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\". The book provides a remarkably tangible portrait of Smith, from his early days in Vermont and New York through the growth of his church and his murder in Carthage. A fascinating character, Brodie's Smith is a far more human and fallible character than the sanitized version in official LDS histories (the LDS church has offered pointed rebuttals to this work). Brodie's work remains definitive in large part because official church records and documents are off-limits to unofficial (read: non-LDS-sanctioned) historians.For a 60 year old biograhpy, \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" reads beautifully, a testament to the author's superior writing. This, as is noted by a reviewer on the book jacket, is an outstanding example of the biographer's art.Anyone who has an interest in the world's fastest growing church should read Brodie's book."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"If you want the best biography ever written on Smith,this is the one.No punches pulled or apologies.And it is readable,is it ever you'll have trouble putting it down cause it reads like a novel,not like a choppy biography,and even better the story is true.Smith comes off as a circus barker promoting the greatest show on earth,that is \\"his own\\".Brodie mentions strongly that with Smith's family's penchant for seeking treasures in the earth,quests for lost pirate's gold,divinig, etc. the book of Mormon may have been an attempt to create a bestseller in colonial times. Hence the Book of Mormon may have been a cult classic that became so big people believed it to be true.This is not entirely unplausable seeing that Poe was able to manufacture a ballon travel hoax at the same time that the general public believed to be true. This is not to mention Orson Welles \\"War of the Worlds\\" hoax which so many people initially believed it was a scandal.Brodie has written a classic and it was written 50 years ago.i particularly liked the picture of the Canopic Jars used by the Egyptians for storing mummified organs.According to Smith's telepathic interpretation these jars are representations of biblical beings.No mention of organs.Caught red-handed in a speculation presented as a pronounced truth.And this is just a surface observation,Brodie goes alot deeper and even more probing..Then every other page as the book progresses later on someone is being denounced who 3 pages earlier was proclaimed a saint.(How can this be)?The big draw for Smiths followers as i see it from reading this book was free land and a fresh start in the American west for working paupers of old Europe and the new world.Security and family first. Theology? well maybe later.By the way I was turned on to this book by an Amazon reader!I read the new Bushman book but it was too sanitized and when there are only a limited number of primary sources available any omissions can present a completely different portrait in a biography.Then instead of reading a bio,you get a source book,and that's a bottomless pit.If you can only read one book on Smith,read this because it is a genuine attempt to portray the whole Smith family from people who lived with them.There are some good pictures of Joe's kids by his multiple wives and on some of them,the baby face of Smith is so obvious that a DNA test would be superfluous.I would like to see more info in a biography about Smith regarding the Great Awakening period in American History(1830's),apparently religious fervency was heightened by an expectancy of the \\"final times\\".Stump speakers and prophets were a dime a dozen,rising and disappearing equally as fast just like the 1980's in the USA.I get the feeling it must have been amusing hearing those preachers barking their condemnations with the animation of a circus carney.Smith was THE MASTER,pulling off his own Greatest Show on Earth,complete with a book and an organization, still intact when he was assasinated.After reading Brodie you would have to conclude that Smith was either a prophet or a sophisticated,calculating,charlottan,who may have slighty miscalculated in regard to himself, but he couldn't be both.But Brodie never answers the why of Smith's subterfugic polygamy.The most simplest answer:so the others don't find out-at least until they're already captured.The true caliph's collection --how ego flattering."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Brodie is very fair to Joseph Smith and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It's a real and amazing look on how Smith became the prophet and seer of his own church."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is the very first book to take a detailed look at the life of Joseph Smith. It is ground breaking and it revolutionized the way Mormons study their history. Unfortunately it is a deeply flawed work and there are now many far better works. Instead, I would recommend the book \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" by Richard Lyman Bushman which has been described by numerous (non-Mormon) critics as the best or the definitive biography of Joseph Smith.Meanwhile, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has flaws in the following specific areas:1. Sources and Research2. Methodology3. ObjectivityI will discuss each one of these problems, but only in summary fashion, since most people do not want to read a big long report here on line.RESEARCH AND SOURCE CRITIQUESThere is no doubt that Fawn Brodie wrote a detailed blockbuster of a book. She researched very hard and because her uncle was a leader of the LDS Church she was given access to very private records. It was the first book about Joseph Smith to be so carefully researched. The depth of the footnotes makes the book large and impressive. Unfortunately not all of this research is honest.Almost immediately after the book was published, a brief response to it was also published. Hugh Nibley, a famous Mormon apologist wrote it and in that critique he gave many instances where her research was simply not as it appeared. She intentionally misquoted her sources and ignored statements from sources that did not agree with her theories but then used those same sources when they did agree. And of the book's popularity he said, \\"Having been presented to the world as a work of literature Mrs. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith enjoyed with its reviewers the license of creative writing (which it was) and an indulgence that would never have been accorded it had those reviewers been historians and not literary men.\\" (You can read his full critique at http[...]) He meant, of course, that the reviewers who praised the book did not have a grasp of the true history or historical methods; they enjoyed its writing style, which Nibley admitted was good.Another problem with her sources is that although she had access to a wide variety of sources, she relied most heavily upon sources that were enemies of Joseph Smith. While no historian should reasonably disregard an enemy's perspectives, they should not give them undue credit. To paraphrase Art Linkletter \\"Enemies wills say the darndest things!\\". One of those few historians that Nibley said should review the book was Vardis Fisher. Even Dale Morgan, Brody's good friend and virtual co-author agreed that Vardis was one of the three most competent men to discuss Mormon History (Dale being one of the other two). But when Vardis reviewed the book he found it flawed because it relied almost exclusively on the statements of apostates and enemies. (Vardis' review greatly distressed Brodie at the time).METHODOLOGY CRITIQUESIn the 20th century a new process for conducting history was developed that goes by the name of psychohistory or psychobiography. This is a process that is supposed to use psychological insights to understand the motives of historical figures. I am not sure that it is possible to read the minds and motives of living people around us, much less people who are dead, so I have some problems with this whole notion anyway. But even if you accept this concept as valid, Brodie has problems. She was only in her 20's when she wrote this book; hardly an age with great and deep experiences from which to inform a \\"psychological\\" imagining of what Joseph Smith was thinking. This shows in her writing, where, not finding enough to work with in psychological speculation, she just removes the psychology and goes right into shear speculation and fantasy with theoretical ideas. But this is where her writing skill combined with selective sources helps move the book along. She simply *asserts* things as true that cannot be known or worse... are known to be untrue! So she just out and out says things like this without any substantiation at all:o Dream images came easy to this youth (She states but has no knowledge)o He was immune to religious influence of any sort (She imagines, but contradicts herself later)o He did not have the inner turmoil that preceded the spiritual fervor of so many great religious figures of the past. (She reads the minds of both Joseph Smith and other unnamed Religious leaders here)o The Book of Mormon must have been a source of secret worry (Yet he never indicated it was)o He knew that (Emma) thought him a coward. (How on earth did he know that - it probably was not true -- and how does Brodie know?)o Mormon ritual doubtless had its roots in the same unconscious drives that led the prophet to polygamy, (note the word \\"doubtless\\". She affirms something but it is absolutely unsupported.)She also writes her history by insinuations that are her way of letting her imagined events get told. For example, tells a story of an attempt by Joseph Smith to walk on the water. She admits the story is not true and was never told by any Mormon or Joseph Smith but still, though it is false, she says \\"Baseless though this story may be, it is none the less symbolic\\" The reader is told that though no justification exists for believing the story, Joseph Smith must always have been doing silly things like that, and that makes it \\"symbolic.\\" She does that sort of thing a great deal, often quoting stories that even she admits are false or untrustworthy but then using them to draw conclusions. In another example she quotes a bitter enemy of Joseph Smith, and draws conclusions from those statements about Joseph Smith's character, but she admits that her source is an \\"unreliable witness to say the least\\". It is perhaps reasonable at this point to mention that Brodie herself said that she \\"always wanted to write a book of fiction\\" and \\"More and more I am coming to realize that the great biography of Joseph Smith will be a fictionalized one.... To bring to life the mans inner character, to display all the facets of his infinitely complex nature, requires I think the novelists perception rather than the historian's digging.\\"When she wrote her biography of Joseph Smith, she was plowing relatively virgin territory. Not even very many Mormons were familiar with that history, so if she said something, it was taken as truth. But with her book on Thomas Jefferson, she ventured forth into territory where hundreds of recognized scholars already knew a great deal. And her technique of psychobiography was roundly criticized:Michael Kammen who was actually a friend said that she was: \\"a historical gossip incapable of distinguishing between cause and effect.\\"T. Harry Williams said that Fawn Brodie had \\"badly set back the calling of psychobiography.\\"The most biting and accurate critique was from Gary Wills: \\"Two vast things, each wondrous in itself, combine to make this book a prodigy --- the author's industry, and her ignorance. One can only be so intricately wrong by deep study and long effort, enough to make Ms. Brodie the fasting hermit and very saint of ignorance. The result has an eerie perfection, as if all the world's greatest builders had agreed to rear, with infinite skill, the world's ugliest building.\\"OBJECTIVITY CRITIQUESPsychobiography requires a degree of objectivity. But Fawn Brodie admitted many times that she was far from objective. Her writing of this book was not the work of the ordinary historian, writing about an historical figure. It was instead an act of rebellion (she called it liberating) on her part. She admitted that she wrote the book looking for ways to prove that Joseph Smith was a bad person and to destroy the beliefs of the Mormons. Here are some quotes:\\"Writing the biography of Joseph Smith was a *desperate effort* to come to terms with my childhood.\\" (emphasis is mine)\\"I was convinced before I ever began writing the book that Joseph Smith was not a true prophet.\\"\\"I was angered at the obvious nature of the fraud in his writing of the Book of Mormon; I felt that the revelations all came out of the needs of the moment and had nothing to do with God. \\"\\"Just as the autobiographical novel serves many other writers, (writing the biography) has been a kind of catharsis (for me).\\"\\"I am trying to make a move against (the Church)\\" (said about an earlier effort before the book was written).She said that Joseph Smith \\"Did not deserve\\" his good reputation. Later, when writing another biography of a person who had been badly treated by history, she made an overt attempt to historically rehabilitate him (another obvious example of her bias leading her history) and she said that she was doing \\"a total about face\\" vs what she had done to Joseph Smith.Thus we see that Fawn Brodie created a work with a goal. That goal was to be as negative about her subject as she could be. And so she selectively uses sources. And she allowed her imagination to run away with her and then called this research. An historian does not have to believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet, but a good historian will suspend personal beliefs and work for accuracy. Fawn failed to do that. It was too emotional for her.SUMMARYIt is a deeply flawed book, but it has been extraordinarily valuable. Brodie's efforts caused a great many Mormons to re-examine the history of their Church and Faith. This has led to greater openness and honesty and a greater level of true and accurate research in the origins of their beliefs. Even though Brodie;s work is flawed, it had a good influence. Because it is so flawed as a history it would get zero stars. But because it is influential and it is a fairly good read, it gets 3 stars.Incidentally, to understand at least some of the root causes for Brodie's slanted view of Joseph Smith, the following incident may be helpful.M Wilford Poulson, a psychology professor at BYU had studied the secret coded writings of J.J. Strang, a rather unusual character, He was a renegade Mormon who who crowned himself King of Beaver Island in Michigan and was shot and killed by his followers. Fawn Brodie knew Poulson well and was interested in his research. From this research Brodie read about Strangs dictatorial and licentious ways. At this time, Brodie applied Strang's attitudes to Joseph Smith. So, in some ways, the biography of Joseph Smith is a conflation of the historical Joseph Smith and the imagined Shadow of JJ Strang cast upon Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I am only 70% through reading this book and I would like to say that I already learned a lot of details about the background in which the Mormon religion was invented and modified over the years by Joseph Smith.

He also loved life. He loved women. He was not a conventional prophet.Brody's book will take you through all this. I believe the journey was as long for her as for Smith. Read the Epilogue.

Today, as I've learned more about him, I easily acknowledge Joseph Smith as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.Who knows? Sometimes the message is conveyed in mysterious ways."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I have a first edition of Brodie's book. She inscribed it to her parents:\\"From your ever wayward daughter.\\" Her mother wrote below that:\\"From our ever forward thinking daughter.\\" This is not only a great biography about Joseph Smith, it is a great biography period. What a tremendous researcher and writer!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"When Fawn Brodie began her research for this book she was an active, believing Mormon with no ax to grind. She simply wanted to write a book of the history of the Mormon church.With blessings from the church hierarch including all the apostles and prophets she was given full access to all official church history and records in the church owned vault at their headquarters in Salt Lake City.During her research of the church archives she made a shocking discovery that all Mormonism was based on a lie began by the founder Joseph Smith and his 1st vision which included the Golden Plates, the Book of Mormon, polygamy on and on.As she was about to publish her book and make public the factual findings and history of her church she was threatned with excommunication from her faith if she followed through with publication of the book.Upon publication of the book the Mormon church made good on their threat of excommunication and she was dishonorably kicked out of the church and declared persona-non-grata.Since its publication in the mid 1940's it remains one of the most definitive and accurate accounts of the actual beginnings and history of the Mormon church. Although she is now deceased her book is still used as source material in modern day independent church history publications.Try to find a copy of a recently deceased Mormon apologist's book (Hugh Nibley), where he unsuccessfully tried to discredit her and you will have extreme difficulty in locating one.Her book on the other hand is still widely available even after more than 50 years since it's 1st printing. I think that pretty much says it all.This was one of the 1st books I read which led to my de-conversion from the Mormon cult dogma. It is high on my list of recommended books documenting the real and factual history of the Mormon Church."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Read this book 30 years ago and it kept disappearing from local libraries.

She is not like those anti-mormon books where they only say bad things and they only say bad things and look for every bad thing they can find. sometimes the writing gets a little slow and dull."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith is still the best book ever written about him that has been published. In a way, that's a shame. &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was published in 1945, so historians have had 56 years to write a better book. For some reason, that hasn't occurred. Other books written about Smith, such as Donna Hill's &quot;Joseph Smith, the First Mormon&quot; are not nearly as critical and insightful as they need to be.Legitimate criticisms of the book include the fact that it is written more to be interesting than a strictly scholarly work. Brodie does use interesting language and sometimes draws too much on the flamboyant and theatrical parts of Joseph Smith's personality. Additionally, while its been proven Brodie reached a pretty accurate conclusion, in the first edition of her book she relies too much on the so-called &quot;Pearsall transcript&quot; of Smith's 1826 trial for money-digging in Bainbridge, NY. Although, subsequent research bears out most of the conclusions.&quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is not without a number of weaknesses. It is clear that Fawn views Smith as a fraud and an impostor. Perhaps, she didn't look hard enough to find some &quot;middle ground&quot; between &quot;Prophet&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot;. Maybe, Smith really believed he was transcribing ancient scripture and had been annointed by God to be Prophet, when in fact he did not. Some people do suffer hallucinations. In fact, a number of people who are terribly rational most of the time claim to have dreams or revelations occasionally which can only be described as &quot;supernatural&quot;. Another possibility is he really believed he was inspired to lead people to Christ, but invented the Book of Mormon to get the attention of people.Brodie does not adequately take into the account the following in my estimation:1. The sincerity expressed in the writings in Joseph Smith's own journals which have been published and are available to read.2. The fact that the three witnesses to the Golden Plates, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris, never retracted their statements about the Plates and the Book of Mormon, even on their death beds. (although they admitted they saw the Plates with their &quot;spiritual eyes&quot;, as opposed to their &quot;physical eyes&quot;).3. The fact that Smith was willing to face being persecuted, tarred and feathered, and killed rather than give up what he was preaching.There is a puzzle to Smith claiming to be a &quot;prophet&quot; that has never been adequately explained by anyone. Although, there is plenty of evidence refuting Smith's claims and those of his church.The weaknesses, though, are more than offset by the research she did and the material she found. She documents the fact that Smith's father had a dream which later appeared in its entirety in First Nephi in the Book of Mormon, that Smith was tried for being an impostor and moneydigger in an 1826 court proceeding in Bainbridge, New York, that Smith routinely used to seer stones and claimed that with these stones he could see buried treasure underground, and in her 1971 edition, reported the three conflicting accounts that have been given of Smith's First Vision. Finally, she talks about the fact that Smith did not translate other scripture, the Book of Abraham, from Egyptian Papyri as claimed.However, Brodie's greatest contribution is in establishing the context and background in which the Book of Mormon was produced. She talks about the many millenial religious movements where Smith grew up, the commonly held views that Indians were really descendants of Hebrew tribes, anti-catholic prejudice, anti-free masonry prejudice, and prejudice against people with darker skins. One can find elements of all of these in the Book of Mormon if one looks closely enough at it. One who wants too, can see how the Mormon religion and the Book of Mormon arose from this context.No Man Knows My History is a classic. While it would be a mistake to read nothing else about Joseph Smith, skipping the book is missing the best biography that currently exists about him."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Mormonism, described by Fawn Brodie as &quot;a potpourri of American religious thinking spiced with the fundamental ideal of inevitable progress,&quot; is a religion that couldn't have planted roots anywhere other than America. Its founder Joseph Smith grew up in the eclectic religious stew of early 19th-century Vermont and New York, fertile ground for what Brodie calls the &quot;flotsam of the godly.&quot; Religious eccentrics of every stripe were springing up in his day: Ann Lee's Shakers, Jemima Wilkinson (the &quot;Universal Friend,&quot; who thought she was Christ), John Humphrey Noyes' Oneida community (who practiced free love and communal living), William Miller's Adventists, Joseph Dylks (the &quot;Leatherwood God&quot;), and many other assorted faith healers, &quot;prophets,&quot; circuit evangelists, millenialists and revivalists of varying degrees of eccentricity and ability. Most were short-lived, but the influence of this atmosphere of religious enthusiasm and innovation on Joseph Smith and the religion he invented is unmistakeable. Fawn Brodie's biography of Smith remains a classic, penetrating study even after over half a century. This book is indispensible for an understanding of this peculiar, gifted man and the peculiar religion he created.Joseph Smith was no sideshow preacher, as Brodie convincingly demonstrates against those Mormons who unjustly emphasize his lack of education to give his achievements a more divine appearance. Far from being a simpleton, Smith was a talented man. His exceptional gifts and likeable nature &quot;made the ordinary frontier evangelist seem by comparison all sound and fury.&quot; His theology, &quot;a patchwork of ideas and rituals drawn from every quarter, became in his hands a thing of color, warmth and originality,&quot; though spiritually barren at its core. Brodie rightly remarks that &quot;within the dogma of the church there is no new Sermon on the Mount, no new saga of redemption, nothing for which Joseph himself might stand.&quot; The appeal of Mormonism was then and remains today something not altogether connected with Smith himself. His was an optimistic theology tied to material success, a blend of various Protestant and other doctrines woven together and so heavily injected with Smith's own fantasies and the frontier mythology of his day that its Christianity became only a surface veneer. There is little resemblance between Smith and the religion Jesus founded.In recounting how Smith evolved from a small-time treasure-hunter and magician into a &quot;prophet of God,&quot; Brodie details his many fabrications. There's the &quot;First Vision,&quot; which changed at least three times as Smith built upon it in later years and was almost certainly a late invention to explain earlier events. There's the familiar Mormon albatross of polygamy, initially denied by Smith with great vigor but then promoted as a commandment of God with equal vigor before being conveniently abandoned (also by revelation) by his successors just when Utah was trying to win statehood. Less familiar, perhaps, is Smith's adaptation of the local theories of his day to identify the many American Indian mounds in Western New York and Ohio as the remnants of an advanced North American civilization predating Christ (not an original idea, I was surprised to learn -- many people in Smith's day refused to believe that &quot;savages&quot; were capable of building such things, similar to the modern belief of some that only aliens could have built the pyramids). And of course there are the famous &quot;golden plates&quot; from which Smith allegedly translated the Book of Mormon (seen only &quot;with the eye of faith&quot; by a few friends and family members), and the fragments of the &quot;Book of Abraham,&quot; later shown to be ordinary Egyptian funereal documents. Smith's embarrassing linguistic innovations got him into a lot of trouble, particularly after Champollion solved the mystery of ancient Egyptian writing by deciphering the Rosetta Stone in Smith's lifetime; fortunately for him, many of his followers were astonishingly forgiving and readily believed him over &quot;Gentile scholars.&quot; Brodie discusses all of this and much more. It's remarkable that Mormonism survived such discoveries, and that many continue to look beyond the powerful proofs of its human invention. One wonders whether Mormonism would have gone the way of so many other 19th-century sects had the early Mormons not been so savagely persecuted and had Smith himself not been &quot;martyred.&quot; Even in Smith's own lifetime the evidence against the divine origins of his religion was devastating, but as Brodie indicates, &quot;There was a great hunger in his people, and they accepted him for what he set himself up to be.&quot; The legend of Joseph Smith long ago outpaced the reality that Brodie presents, and the religion he invented ultimately got along well without him thanks to persecution and the leadership of able men like Brigham Young. Clearly Mormonism has never depended on Smith's personal credibility -- in many ways its origins are unimportant to its adherents, I've discovered. Smith's life is a remarkable tale, captivatingly told by Brodie.Given that Fawn Brodie was excommunicated by the church, one might expect this to be a venomous anti-Mormon book. Instead she produced a thoughtful, fair and balanced biography that demonstrates no small degree of admiration for Smith. Her exhaustive research made extensive use of court records, county histories, newspapers, and Smith's own writings (particularly his lengthy History of the Church, based largely on his own journals). The results are solid and convincing. Many have accused Brodie of excessive psychological speculation, but I found her conclusions sensible and balanced given the evidence; only in the Supplement added to the book in 1970 does she tend a bit toward the psychoanalytical musings in vogue at that time, but mostly she presented further evidence to support the conclusions she drew in 1945. The appendices are especially useful, further exploring the &quot;First Vision,&quot; Smith's many wives, the &quot;Book of Abraham,&quot; and other topics. Above all, Brodie's fluid and lively writing style makes this a superb biography of a remarkable man."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"It took me a long time to finish, but I've finally turned the last page of the book the Mormon church would prefer never be read. I won't pretend to know the Church Of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints' official position on Brodie's work, nor that of the Reformed Church of the same birth; but based on discussions I've shared with Salt Lake Mormons, it's obvious that No Man Knows My History is in direct conflict with the sanitized history the LDS church and its members accept and worship.I picked up No Man Knows My History, first, because I wanted to learn more about Mormon history; and second, because Brodie is a large source of information for many other books on Mormonism, including Under the Banner of Heaven by John Krakauer.Fawn M. Brodie's writing style is dry and academic. Nearly every page features a citation in the footnotes. Most of her sources, in fact, come from church documents like History of the Church, or the published journals and letters of the characters themselves. Joseph Smith created a religion in the time of the printing press, and Brodie built a book on the evidence of the printers.She approaches Joseph Smith as a man, rather than the perfect mouthpiece of God as many Mormons view him. In some ways, this is an unfair approach. Abraham (of the Biblical Old Testament) looks like a crazy person if the reader doesn't accept that Abraham believes he hears the voice of God and acts on His words. On the other hand, Joseph wasn't a perfect man; he wasn't God. Brodie outlines mistakes and failures as well as successes, and this makes Joseph look a little more human that Mormons wish. It makes him more human, which should be a bad thing. Paul (of the New Testament) knew he was a retched sinner, but he's revered almost next to Jesus in the Christian faith (but not quite).I learned some interesting things while wading through this book. Joseph Smith was an interesting man, strange, but still interesting. He ran for President of the United States. I never knew that. He sent Parley P. Pratt, an elder in his church, on a mission to England and then married the man's wife while he was away. He was a Mason and adopted many Masonic practices and rituals into his religion. He was arrested many times, and fraud was often the charge; but on one occasion, warrants were written on the charge of murder. Joe was the mayor of Nauvoo and wrote his own laws, outside the scope of common law, his city charters, or the Constitution of the United States. Although Nauvoo was a dry community, Porter Rockwell (Smith's burly bodyguard and \\"Destroying Angel\\") ran a saloon in Smith's home and hotel until Emma (Joseph Smith's first wife of nearly fifty wives) put an abrupt stop to it. Smith had a love of the finer things in life and lusted after adventure, power, and the ladies (married or not, church members or otherwise). His death was tragic, but his actions in life may have predicted his earthly demise.Fawn M. Brodie's No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith is an interesting book. Her work, no matter how controversial is worth consideration. Although it crashes against the re-crafted history of the Mormon church, I recommend it to anybody interested in LDS history--especially present members of the LDS church."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Long reviled by Latter-day Saints, Fawn Brodie's life ofJoseph Smith is still impressive for its depth, itsthoughtfulness, and its struggle with the exact nature ofSmith's calling. Her respect for the man is undeniable;what stung when the book was released in 1945 (and must stillhurt today) are her religious naturalism and her conclusionthat Smith's spiritual legacy was &quot;barren&quot;. Yet the book isfar from an anti-Mormon tract or an exercise in debunking;one finishes it with a sense of Smith's extraordinary giftsand a great appreciation for the complexity and confusionof American life in his time, a psychological and religiousferment of which Mormonism is both a product and a legacy."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I first read this when it first came out based on Ms. Brodie's reputation as a researcher and biographer and a historian. As much as the LDS church has tried to discredit her and others who write truthful albeit unflattering books about them and their faith, one has to wonder if having an objective quest is to be avoided at all costs?! This book will open many readers' eyes as to the unvarnished portrait of a very charismatic man. There is no Joseph Smith bashing here: the author lets contemporary, eyewitness accounts stand on their own. One person who knew Joseph Smith might give a rancourous version of something, but Ms. Brodie found many accounts of the same events by various people, including those adherents to theis new religion, even from his wife. If you want to see what this man was all about, where archeological and historical facts bolster or diminish this intriguing person, read this book. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"A well-researched and documented book. Ms. Brodie did much of her research in the Mormon Church's archives and library, and because David O McKay (a former president of the Mormon Church) was her uncle, she had access to documents that other researchers did not. This biography portrays Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism) as a fraud, a con-man, and a seducer of women. For instance, Brodie documents how Joseph Smith defrauded his church members in the Kirtland Anti-Banking scandal, swindling them of their money and their land. Brodie also documents how he sent various men on church missions and seduced their wives while they were away. These are just two examples of frauds Smith perpetrated. The book is controversial because many Mormons feel that the book is an attack on their church founder, and they claim that it is bad history. Ms. Brodie attempted to enter the mind of her subject and explain what motivated Joseph Smith, in this regard she crosses the line between history and psycho-analysis. An excellent read."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I grew up 20 miles from Palmyra NY and thought I knew about the Mormon Church, having written reports on it. Then in the '50's I lived 5 years in Salt Lake and knew Mrs Brodie's sister and brother-in-law. These girls were neices of David O MacKay, President of the Mormon Church, and after they served their &quot;missions&quot; in Switzerland, Fawn and Louise each married and Fawn attended the University of Chicage. We were told that Fawn had written the book as a disertation for the University of Chicago and her uncle had allowed her to use the church records for research. (Records not on display for the public.) As a result of her research, she lost her faith in the church and she and her sister and their husbands were what I would call excommunicated. I finally found the book to read in Rochester NY in 1960 by special order because it was not available in Utah and was out of print in other places. I'm happy it has been reprinted but I'll bet it isn't on bookstore shelves in Salt Lake City!!!!! Fawn Brodie has since died. She was a thourough researcher. Her Jefferson biography was well received and reviewed."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie, former history professor at UCLA and former Latter Day Saint, in her above-titled book gives a fair and honest history of the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Joseph Smith. From his early days using folk magic as a \\"treasure hunter\\" to his first vision and beyond, Dr. Brodie tries to present all sides of the enigmatic founder of Mormonism (which isn't always done in books about Joseph Smith). Court transcripts, afadavits of former neighbors, testimonies of faithful followers, witnesses to the golden plates, Joseph Smith's own version of events - Dr. Brodie allows all these voices to speak in this biography. Her writing is interesting, entertaining, informative, and she isn't afraid to draw conclusions based on the evidence at hand. Perhaps she reaches a bit too far in psychoanalysis of J.S., but that's part of what makes this book the page-turner that it is. One doesn't have to agree with all her conclusions to enjoy this book. Overall I would rate this book as \\"excellent.\\""},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I had always been under the assumption that this was a mean-spirited book about Joseph Smith. I was surprised to find that it wasn't. Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so this book is written from that perspective. But I found that she was very simpathetic and offered some interesting insight into his life. I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I owe a debt of gratitude to the late Fawn M Brodie. It is largely through this book that many of my questions about Mormonism were answered. It is largely due to her that I left Mormonism.My feelings towards Mormonism are fairly neutral. I certainly do not wish any ill towards Mormons. I continue to hold many of them in very high esteem.However, this does not change the fact that there are very serious historical questions regarding the founding of early Mormonism. I've not yet seen a reasonable, balanced, and scholarly (as opposed to polemical, and Dr Nibley's work on this topic does fit in this category) response to Mrs Brodie's pioneering work."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's book was a landmark book in Mormon studies that forced Mormon historians to write their history a little different than how it was traditionally written. Brodie is a very gifted writer. The book is well written and is very readable. No one interested in the life of Joseph Smith can help but read this book. However the book does have many problems and limitations. Brodie depends on books like E.D. Howe's book \\"Mormonism Unveiled\\" and John C. Bennett's book \\"History of the Saints.\\" These are two primary historical documents but Brodie does not use them with caution as other biographers of Smith. Howe's book was suppose to be statements by the Smith's neighbors and others who knew Smith and his family written in the 1830s, but many historians believe that a lot of Howe's book are forgeries written by the same person. Bennett's book was written to expose Joseph Smith's evil doings in Illinois. The document is clearly written by a very angry fanatic anxious to destroy Joseph Smith. Most every historian knows this type of document needs to be used with caution, something Brodie does not do. Bennett was also a very shady character (see Bennett's biography \\"The Saintly Scoundrel\\" by Andrew Smith).Brodie sometimes does not give good documentation. On page 32 she says Emma probably noticed as Smith's other followers that when Smith spoke with intense feeling the \\"blood drained from his face, leaving a frightening, almost luminous pallor.\\" There is not document or any evidence that Emma ever noticed such a trait.Brodie also goes too far with the amount of wives Joseph had. She should be commended for being the first person to attempt such a thing, but recent scholarship has shown her numbers to be erroneous. She says 48, but it was likely much less, anywhere from 29 to 33 (see \\"In Sacred Loneliness\\" by Todd Compton and \\"Farms[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies] Review of Books\\" Volume 10, Number 2, 1998).When dealing with the witnesses that claimed to have seen the plates the Book of Mormon came from Brodie gets a little stupid. 3 witnesses claimed to have seen both the angel that gave Smith the plates along with the plates. 8 others claimed to have seen the plates. Over half of these 11 witnesses later became angry at Joseph Smith and left his church. But none of them during this time tried to expose Joseph as a fraud (see \\"Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses\\" by Richard L. Anderson). With this fact Brodie does reject the idea of the witnesses being co-conspirators, but the men became victims of \\"Joseph's unconscious but positive talent at hypnosis\\" (page 77). That has got to be the most ludicrous idea I have ever heard! I challenge anyone in the world to unconsciously or consciously to make me see a vision. She has got to do better then that. I understand that when doing secular history (the history I personally prefer) that it is difficult to deal with the witnesses. But the idea that Smith could have put 11 people, many at the same time, under hypnosis sounds stupid to anyone with a brain.A long with reading Brodie's book I would suggest also reading \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History\\" edited by Newell G. Bringhurst. The essays in this book both praise the book and deal with the books problems. I would also suggest reading \\"Joseph Smith: the First Mormon\\" by Donna Hill which is much more well balanced biography than Brodie's. Brodie tries to get inside the mind of Joseph Smith too much, something Donna Hill does not do. I would also suggest reading \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism\\" by Richard Bushman. This book is only about Joseph's early life but is very scholarly written. Bushman is currently writing a full biography about Joseph which will likely be better than any others written before. Bushman is a historian on a much higher level than Fawn Brodie or Donna Hill. I would also suggest reading a more recent biography of Joseph Smith by Robert V. Remini"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I'm not a Mormon, but I am fascinated by Joseph Smith, Jr. And if you want to know more about the man there is no better book than Fawn Brodie's outstanding biography. Filled with relevant and damaging facts, interesting quotes, and information the Mormon church would probably like to keep hidden, it's the book you need to read if you want to know more about the Mormon prophet. Even though it can get bogged down in detail it's still a great read. She has certainly done her research on the man and it shows on every page."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie is a scholar with no ax to grind in this fairly accurate reconstruction of the life of Joseph Smith, the star-crossed founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. For Mormons, the book has always been considered a reproach to official church biographies about Smith, but recent historical findings weigh heavily in Brodie's favor in assessing the actual motives and activities behind the polygamist prophet of Mormonism who said &quot;No man knows my history.&quot; Brodie's other tomes on historic figures constitute scholarly, careful analyses of their lives, as is also the case with this effort. The style is pedantic,and could benefit from updating, but the book is well organized and paced. For the serious investigator of Mormonism, Brodie's book is important because the story of Joseph Smith is told in an era before the current visibility and church-line biographies of Smith combined to obfuscate embarrassing or conflicting details in the life of this controversial and charismatic Mormon prophet. For anyone interested in a biography of Joseph Smith that does not have the approval of the LDS Church, yet remains respected among scholars and biographers,No Man Knows My History is a definitive, quotable, and invaluable resource."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Mrs. Brodie, a highly respected historian, has written what must still be the definitive book on this charismatic and controversial American figure. Since she was raised a Mormon and had access to documents that the Church normally forbids to outsiders, she is able to separate out aspects of the &quot;official&quot; biographies of Smith from the realities of his life and times. I was struck by how admiring, in many ways, she is of him: unlike the Church's view, which paints him as completely unlearned (thereby strengthening the argument that the Book of Mormon had to be the word of God), she celebrates his energetic inventiveness, the facility with words and ideas that might have made him a novelist had he had a more conventional education. She also has meticulously researched the trends and climate of the times which inform practically every word of the Book of Mormon. A fair and admirable piece of history writing."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Picked this up at my local library after having an interesting discussion with my grandparents. One of my great grandfathers escaped from a Mormon family in Idaho. He had a very rough family life. Back in the day, the Mormons were notoriously anti non Mormon. His mother was a real witch from the accounts of my grandmother. Nevertheless, this interesting piece of family history led me to realize I know absolutely nothing about mormonism. Being a non mormon, there is no reason for me to know anything, but I was hoping this book would go over all the things I never really understood about mormonism especially the history and the rise of Joseph Smith.As a non Mormon, the book only confirms what I heard about Joseph Smith: a total crank. It gets worse or better depending on your view. Joe Smith used \\"seer stones\\" to look for ancient artifacts. He was a well known rebel rouser in the community. Joe Smith, a trouble maker, born into a life destined for farm drudgery was desperate to be somebody. That is at least how I interpret his life. Mormons may be put off by this work despite the author combining the hard facts of his early life. From my perspective, seer stones and necromancy (activities Joe Smith was routinely criticized for engaging in) spell lunatic. Now, Smith was actually a bright guy. Unfortunately, he did not have access to formal schooling. He educated himself much later on life after he could establish schools for his settlements. The fascinating part is how much help he needed to write the book of mormon. However, he routinely jumped the gun and flat guessed on some things, including trying to quote languages he did not quite understand.Every page of this book is filled with dense facts coming together as a long historical narrative. I got dizzy imagining the author combing over all the sources, looking to write a narrative without jumping over the place. I would imagine there is still facts left out. The book moves at a fairly brisk pace, despite how dense it really is. There were a few sections I thought got boring. This could just depend on personal preference, but you really need to pay attention early on. Brodie does not repeat herself. There are some sections I found confusing because I was not entirely sure who she was talking about. This was true in the beginning when she is explaining the Smiths and his family. His Father was named Joe as well as Smiths own son. She jumps from one to the other without notifying. There are also a lot of important side characters who can be hard to remember as the book goes on. There are several aids to Joe Smith, his wife, alleged mistress and side lovers, enemies, right hand men, family members, a college professor who tries to decipher egyptian documents, generals, politicians, and plenty of other people. New people are introduced throughout who are just as important as earlier ones who fade off and then feature prominently later.Overall, this is a masterful work. It's truly impressive how much research went into this. I read the original from 1963. There were some photos in that one. They don't particularly help that much but they are interesting to see. I would definitely recommend reading this."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"You may get the impression, from many reviews below, that \\"No Man\\" is a work of angry polemic, \\"twisted\\" and \\"fabricated\\" with hardly a word of \\"positive information\\" about Joseph Smith. It did not seem that way to me. Brodie's tone seemed far more judicious and moderate than that of most critics, and her research extensive and thoughtfully sifted.If you expect a white horse, a zebra's dark stripes will surprise you, but if you look for a black horse, his white stripes will likely catch your eye. My impression of Joseph Smith was pretty negative, before reading this book, which may be why it seemed more positive to me than to many Mormon readers. I had noticed parallels between Smith and \\"religious revolutionaries\\" like Mohammed and Karl Marx; Brodie persuaded me though that unlike them, he was not a violent man by nature. I knew Smith manipulated women, and (like Mohammed) quoted God to justify hoarding them; Brodie showed that he also seemed to really care for his (first) wife, and defer to her at times. From the Book of Mormon, and one rather wild sermon, I got the impression that Smith completely lacked literary talent; Brodie again argued me wrong. (\\"Now he was developing into a preacher of uncommon talent.\\") All in all, while I still think him a scoundrel, Brodie forced me to modify my prior impression of Joseph Smith in a more positive direction.It is human nature to make excuses for successful tyrants: criticism of Marx or Mohammed usually draws the same ire as many reviews below display. Brodie is mildly affected by this weakness. Brodie tells of disreputable deeds, or quotes words that sound a bit mad, then follows with a paragraph that says in effect, \\"Boys will be boys,\\" insisting on (and arguing for) Smith's greatness despite such contrary evidence. But for her, the facts seem to come first; interpretation is kept distinct. All in all, she has written a fascinating, readable, and fairly believable work of historical narrative.And what a story she has to tell! If you doubt truth can be wilder than fiction, ponder this tale of the \\"peep stone\\" artist who invented a theology, founded cities, recreated polygamy and polytheism almost from scratch, wrote an alternate history of the Americas and persuaded twenty million people to believe it, and died in a shootout with a lynch mob, leaving dozens of grieving widows.While Brodie shows that Smith was not inherently violent, the story does confirm other commonalities that struck me when I studied Marxism, Islam, and the Tai Ping Rebellion in China. She describes Smith's theology as a \\"potpourri\\" of influences; true of the ideological genius of Mohammed and Marx as well. She relates the evolution of Smith's thinking on economic \\"communism.\\" Parallels between Smith's \\"revelations\\" about the use and control of women, and those of Mohammed and the Chinese visionary, Hong Xiuquan, also emerge. Lyman Wight's description of unbelievers as \\"devils, infernal hob-goblins, and ghosts\\" is also closely paralleled by the dehumanizing language of the Cultural Revolution and the Tai Ping movement.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"First, let me say that I am a 'recovering Mormon.' This book helped me open my eyes and step into the light, and out of the darkness in which I was raised. The light of truth is invigorating and refreshing.... I think it must have been similar for people in the former Soviet Union when their blinders were finally pulled off, and they saw that they had been living... and believing in...the fiction that was the USSR and its banckrupt ideology/false history since they were children.And I'm sorry if it will offend believers, but Mormonism really is 'out there' on the fringe, if you will, with Wicca and Scientology. A close reading of this book and other non-apologetic works on the development of the church, as well on the character and personality of Joseph Smith, shows that the Mormon religion is essentially rooted in magic and the occult. There are many 'cult-like' activities and practices established within the church and among its adherents as well.No Man Knows My History by Fawn Brodie shows that the emperor (Joe Smith, the great American heretic and apostate) has no clothes. It's the one book Mormons don't want the rest of the world to read, because it conflicts with the official, sanitized, fictionalized version of Joseph Smith's life promulgated by the LDS church.It saddens me that so many unknowing Christians are drawn to the Mormon religion through its hyper-intensive missionary (marketing) tactics.... and it saddens me even more that the future of Christendom will be tainted and vitiated by the heresy of Joseph Smith.Hopefully Mormons will read it too. Even more hopefully, it may help them return to/reunite with Christendom.Please read this historically accurate book if you want to learn the truth.

It shows what someone with a great but warped imagination, charisma can accomplish with some theatrics. On the already established credibility of Christianity, this guy invented his own religion out of thin air."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Let's play three blind men feeling different parts of an elephant. Said elephant is Fawn M. Brodie's biography of Mormon prophet-founder Joseph Smith, Jr., NO MAN KNOWS MY HISTORY. Some readers gravitate to Smith's optimistic vision of a human nature capable of infinite perfectibility; others gnash their teeth over Fawn Brodie's reading Smith's mind, somewhat as Smith allegedly read Egyptian texts at the bottom of his hat. For my part, I am fascinated by the biography's following passage:\\"... [T]he book is one of the earliest examples of frontier fiction, the first long Yankee narrative that owes nothing to English literary fashions. Except for the borrowings from the King James Bible, its sources are absolutely American ... nothing can detract from the fact that many people have found it convincing history.\\" (Chapter V).American frontier fiction? I thought that that flowed from New England narratives of Indian wars and Cotton Mather's sermons on the wilderness as the seat of all evil. I thought world-class American frontier fiction came of age with Indian-sympathizer James Fenimore Cooper and characters in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, WYANDOTTE and THE WEPT OF WISH-TON-WISH.Fiction? Prophecy? Truth? Whatever the BOOK OF MORMON, THE BOOK OF ABRAHAM and other Smith writings are, they are products of a powerful, assimilative imagination. Smith was only 38 when he died violently in 1844. His formal education had largely ended when he left New England for New York as a boy with his family. But he had a hugely retentive memory and read widely. He had sensitive antennae for what bothered the frontier people around him. One contemporary observer said that Old Joe Smith exemplified every major truth and error agitating New York in a particular decade.One such national and frontier preoccupation was with American Indians. Their high mysterious mounds were being ransacked. And buried Spanish treasure was thought to be everywhere. Writers, one actually got it right, were theorizing that Indians had come to North America from somewhere else, from Israel -- or from across the Bering Straits. Joseph Smith picked these ideas up, along with notions in the air about healthy eating and drinking, living in communities, plural wives, Masonic rituals, etc. and wove them into his various writings and translations.Smith sent early missionaries westward into Indian Territory with the \\"good news\\" revealed to him by God about their pre-history, which they should find religiously, culturally and politically liberating. What strikes me is that Joseph Smith liked and admired Indians at a time when all too few other Americans did. His were the years of Georgians grabbing Cherokee land after gold was discovered on it. This was the era of Andrew Jackson and the Indians' \\"Trail of Tears.\\" These were also the years of war, uprooting or trouble for Creeks, Choctaws, Seminoles and other \\"redskins\\" -- years in which another writer of the frontier, James Fenimore Cooper, wrote religion-flavored frontier fiction and clearly loved and admired American Indians. Not many Americans had anything good to say about those \\"merciless savages.\\"So I say three cheers for that fun-loving wrestler Old Joe Smith and dour, serious, at times ponderous James Fenimore Cooper! If there had been a million more articulate Americans who were pro-Indian, then America today might be a more just nation. -OOO-"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"One theme that emerges from reading the reviews of this book on Amazon.com is that almost all of the non-Mormons appreciated the book and thought it was worth a read. Most, if not all, of the reviews by Mormons were scathing reviews of both the book and Ms. Brodie's personal character. This is no doubt because the author writes of Joseph Smith's life, the gold-mongering, the rampant polygamy (justified by a revelation-of course), and the other very human desires and actions of Joseph Smith factually and without bias. If an unbiased look into the life of Joseph Smith is what you're looking for, then this book is for you. If you wish to believe that the character of Joseph Smith is unmarred by greed, power-mongering, murder and adultery, then you should stick to LDS-sanctioned biographies; since this bio will leave the honest reader seeing Joseph Smith as, very much, just a man; who, although full of charisma, charm and vision, certainly lacked in honor."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"To say this book is a riviting account of an outlandish American character is an understatement. Brodie's work is still the standard by which all other biographies of Smith must be measured. Having unparalled access to LDS archives gave Brodie a leg up on all other biographers (other than official LDS &quot;historians&quot; assigned the task of whitewashing the life of their church's founder). Since this work no one has been allowed the access to official LDS records which Brodie enjoyed because of her pedigree as the descendant of an LDS President. Brodie's writing style is professional and interesting. I will fault her with speculating on the feelings and thoughts of Joseph Smith's mother at the time of his birth (1st edition). Other than that Brodie does an excellent job of sticking to the facts and setting forth the character of Joseph Smith more thouroughly than any historian before or since. History has proven Brodie right and her critics wrong concerning controversies on some of her writings. This book is the type of tour de force one expects from a University of Chicago scholar, which Brodie is. If only all biographies were this well researched and written. LDS apologists will not like this book because it presents the shaddy side of Smith (conviction for disorderly conduct, what we would today describe as fraud, his illegal banking scam in Ohio, having affairs with married women and then latter coming up with the doctrine of poligamy)and the politically maniacal side of Smith (organizing a 6,000 member malitia and terrorizing his non-Morman neighbors by marching around the county, attacking and destroying private property because a newspaper pointed out the facts of his doings in the church and city). Brodie is fair and points out the positive aspects of Smith as well. Smith's great intelligence and familiarity with the King James Translation of the Holy Bible is very evident from this biography. The problems with the official LDS account of the discovery and translation of the book of Mormon become evident because of Brodie's thourough handling of this area of Smith's life. If you only read one book on Mormanism or Joseph Smith in our life, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is a classic, and is generally recognized as such. The topic, which is the life of Joseph Smith, found its ideal author in Fawn Brodie, a Mormon who was on the verge of excommunication and who as about as sympathetic to Smith as an honest historian could be. One is tempted to say that Smith is presented, warts and all. But it would be more helpful to say that Smith is presented, virtues and all, because a man who concocts what purports to be holy scripture, who fakes divine revelation, who organizes three Waco-type compounds, who institutes militias and secret societies to kill his enemies, who decrees polygamy to satify the lusts of himself and his male colleagues, who orders the destruction of his enemies and who lies about most of these things probably has more warts than virtues.Brodie wrestles constantly with the issue of how a man of such limited education and rather obvious fraudulent intent could attract thousands of dedicated followers. It is no wonder that Brodie in her later works became so attracted to psycho-history. She advances a rather attractive hypothesis which suggests how Smith could have deluded himself into believing his own nonsense: Since all our thoughts are the product of previous states of mind, and since these states include all the factors which go into our perceptions, concepts and mental \\"programs\\", there is no essential difference between our control over our waking thoughts and our control over our dreams, reveries, and other semi-conscious states. We just think there is, because the illusion of control is part of the nature of the mental state we call \\"consciousness.\\" If that is so, then it can be argued that a \\"revelation\\" which derives from our past state of mind is no more originated by our own will than the conscious perception that we are being visited by the angel Moroni.Of course, this line of thought comes dangerously close to solipsism, and solipsism comes dangerously close to autotheism (if there is nothing else in the universe but oneself, then everything there is must be an extension of oneself, and hence one must be God). Toward the end of his life, Smith's megalomania was indeed headed in this direction.Brodie does a wonderful job describing how Charismatic Smith must have been. To have persuaded people of real intelligence and ability like Brigham Young and his own wife Emma into believing and supporting him throughout his career, and to have, as she puts it, \\"Caused men to see visions\\" is no mean feat. And to have created a religion which, for all its faults, is far more admirable than its own founder bespeaks one of the most fascinating characters in American history. Everyone interested in religion, psychology, and American History should read this book."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I read and enjoyed this book. This book is worth reading although it must certainly read with a grain of salt and a critical mind. It contains historical fact frequently mixed with the author's own opinions and interpretations. The author promotes the sponge theory of the Book of Mormon- simply that Joseph Smith absorbed what was in the air and squeezed it and out came The Book of Mormon. To me this seems a bit far- fetched. If this is true, then The Book of Mormon has been one of the most successful hoaxes in the history of the world. The author does provide some interesting and detailed information about Joseph Smith and his polygamous activities in Nauvoo- information that the average Mormon probably does not know about and would probably find quite disturbing if they did. The current policy of the LDS church is to basically ignore parts of church history which are not faith inspiring. LDS church members are fed a very edited version of the history of Joseph Smith which is specifically intended to be faith inspiring. The average Mormon also probably does not know about Joseph's campaign for President of the United States. This book can help you to know who Joseph Smith really was although it must be read with a critical mind like I said before."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Brodie's, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" is a brilliantly researched history of the life of Mormonism's Prophet, the charismatic and gifted Joseph Smith. As a nonbeliever, myself, I approach almost everything from a secular level, as does Brodie, therefore I'm bound to agree with her approach, recognizing, at the same time, that some of her sources are questionable, in that they are derived from people who hated Josph and/or his strange religion.Brodie seeks to understand the young Joseph growing up in hard-scrabble Vermont and Western New York. We see a talented, ambitious and highly imaginative young dreamer trapped amongst largely uneducated people who were both superstitious and, oftentimes, painfully gullible. Young Joseph, who isn't enamored with farming, is fascinated by Indian mounds and treasure finding. He finds a stone thru which he claims can divine the location of hidden treasure. He is persuasive enough [alternatively, people are so gullible] that he makes a modest living from selling his talents although there is no evidence that he, or anyone else, was ever enriched by them. As a matter of fact, he is successfully sued by one angry man who regards himself as cheated.Over a period of time, and unlike Mormon preachments, Joseph morphs into something like a religious mystic. He claims he has found a 'Golden Bible' although the circumstances of finding it are initially vague. The Golden Bible has some interesting characteristics. Smith generally keeps it--whatever it is--hidden in a box or under cloth. It seems that few people can visualize it, except himself, although--according to witnesses--it has weight and heft. Also, despite the fact that others can't see it, Joseph reports hiding it from place to place so that it won't be stolen for its golden value.Using magical implements, including stones, Joseph 'translates' his golden plates into the document later known as the Book of Mormon. Joseph's tale of visions of angels, God and Jesus seem to have, for the most part, post-dated the translation of the gold. The nature of these visions, the number of angels, personages etc. seems to have morphed over time.Joseph is now well on his way to becoming a prophet and world-shaker. He gains increasing number of adherents. The question is, 'how much of this does Joseph believe, himself?' We'll probably never know but, I suspect that over time and with increasing adulation, that he comes to believe that he is the true instrument of God's Power on earth. Like most powerful men, women flock to him as bees do to honey. He has additional 'revelations' including the desireability of faithful men taking multiple wives. This revelation has the force of a commandment and Joseph, without the apparent consent or even knowledge of his wife, Emma, takes on multiple women as religious wives.The newly-founded sect finds it persecuted for its communistic and polygamist practices. They are forced to move, almost en masse, from one place to another, until founding the city of Nauvoo, Illinois on the banks of the Mississippi. The city is successful, perhaps too much so. Joseph sets himself up as General of the militia and orders the destruction of a printing press that has criticized him. He is arrested by secular authorities and, while imprisoned in the upper floor of a jailhouse, he and his brother, Hyram, are shot to death by an anti-Mormon mob. Joseph is dead but a martyr is born.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Yes, buy and read this book. You can see from the reviews that it is controversial. Reading controversial literature generally makes people more well rounded.The controversy doesn't revolve around the merits of the book. Any book that touches a religious theme has the same source of antagonism. A large number of people reading the history of Joseph Smith are doing so to ask the question: Was Smith truly the divine relevator of God or was he a charlatan?Such controversies are always mysteries.Accurate historical and scientific research has a wreckless history of messing with beliefs based on revelation. Look at the job that Copernicus did on the Catholic Church with his little diagrams suggesting the earth was round.Ms. Brodie was a faithful member of the LDS Church who changed her mind on this issue while doing her historical research. Yes, she is an apostate. She brings to the surface many of the facts that led to her conclusions.Of course, it should be noted that she is researching in a field where others have done twisting of facts to cast Smith as a living saint.Over all, it appears to be an extremely well researched work in a field where all of the research is questionable in nature. If you are interested in LDS or Utah history, I would strongly recommend the book.If your are wanting to read the accepted version of Joseph Smith's life, I would recommend reading The Work and The Glory by Gerald Lund.If you enjoy learning, I would pick up Brodie's book, it is far more interesting."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Sorry folks but you can't use the Ensign as a quotable source. It's called argument from authority. (My God is right also, so were does that leave us?). It's not accepted in accepted discussions. Also standing behind Nibley as an unofficial spokesman for your church instead of the policy makers in the western Vatican isn't kosher. Maybe you can get Nibley to show the genetic connection between the American Indians and the Israelites which is the main theme of the Joe's book anyway. (Mormon supercession ). The Mormons themselves can't even with the new genetics department at BYU. Even with the largest and most costly archeological expedition launched anywhere to Central America the efforts have been unable to substantiate his contention. Brodie, an often-overlooked fact, was a professor at one of the better universities that study folklore and cults. Her book is not only well written, but historically accurate, by way of research and not just genealogical connections. But why stop here. Read \\"Joseph Smith and the Orgins of The Book of Mormon\\", by David Persuitte. \\"By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus\\", by Charles M. Larson is a must. Both of these validate Brodies claims.

Although she did discredited some of the stories sensational stories about Joseph Smith, her book suffers from two major flaws.1. She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas.2. The book reads more like a novel than a true history. She knows more about what Joseph is thinking than any biographer can know. This criticism was dismissed by her supporters, but when she used the same technique on a biography of Thomas Jefferson, then those who knew better were strong in their denunciation of her work"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Joseph Smith is probably the best-documented &quot;prophet&quot; of all time, and this book traces his career in highly illuminating detail.But first, let me try to get one question out of the way. That question is: &quot;Did Joseph Smith REALLY receive a divine revelation which he set down in the Book of Mormon?&quot; If your answer to that question is &quot;Yes,&quot; then you get to explain how the Native Americans were the Lost Tribes of Israel! This is, of course, impossible to do, since the Native Americans are now known to be of Asian origin -- through studies of linguistics and DNA. And that's one of the big problems with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; -- its claims are so specific that they are actually falsifiable (unlike e.g. the generalities and moralizing found in the Koran).That question set aside (hopefully), this biography documents with meticulous detail Smith's exact sources for his holy forgery, including Ethan Smith's &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; and the contemporary political uproars over Freemasonry.This view of the Native Americans may have seemed plausible in the 1820's, but why would anyone follow Joseph Smith, whose previous line of work was divining and gold-digging? The only answer seems to be: this is embedded in human nature. There are a lot of people out there who have a need to believe, and they flit from one cult to another, never for a moment imagining that they could have an independent life outside of a cult.The story of Joseph Smith is also the story of Muhammad. In just the same way, an uneducated man &quot;received&quot; a divine book and created a whole new religion. And the adherents of that religion argue that it must be true because &quot;so many&quot; people believe in it. Well, there are 3 million Mormons. :-)This is also the story of what I have seen in my own lifetime: the Hare Krishnas (still going in Australia, by the way), the Moonies, the Rajneeshies, the Branch Davidians, and -- most recently -- the Islamic suicide cults led by the likes of Osama Bin Laden. (Not to mention Jonestown, or those weirdos in Rancho Santa Fe who committed mass suicide over the arrival of a comet.) In every case, we find a leader who fits the &quot;imposter&quot; psychological pattern, and who has the charisma to attract followers, associated with a group of &quot;believers&quot; who apparently have no standard of truth whatever, but rush around looking for imposters to follow.

This is a problem when a person is trying to understand a cult since a cult is defined by it's leader as well as it's followers.

Great book that has stood the test of time. I can understand why Mormons don't really care for Ms. Brodie. Ouch! She exposes Joseph Smith for what he was....a delusional con artist. Mr. Smith had quite an imagination and was an exceptionaly creative man. Unfortunately, he got a little carried away and started thinking he was a prophet, king and general.I know, I know.....

It lucidly and coherently explains the rise of the cult of mormonism and spares no expense in trying to hide its occult beginnings, Joseph Smith's megalomania, polygamy, bizarre temple rituals, racism, and all of the other nonsense found in the beginnings of this non-Christian religion. Surprisingly, the author refused to kowtow to the whims of the cult when she wrote this masterpiece; one that clearly exposed the brazen hypocrisy behind its basic tenets.One can't but wonder why any thinking human being wouldn't be swayed from joining (or remaining in) the cult after reading this dazzling biography that so eloquently details Smith's flagrant charlatanism and barefaced deceit as he gazed through seer stones, created stars (such as Kolob) where gods have celestial whoopee, \\"revelations\\" designed to pray upon the feeble minds of his followers, secret holy underwear (still worn by cult members), and a whole plethora of other nonsense.Of course, the cult also can't stand the fact that this book is remarkably well-documented and researched. This masterpiece has already withstood the test of time (originally written during the 1940's) and for good reason: it provides a solid foundation upon which all other studies on the cult must not ignore."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"There are few biographies of merit regarding Joseph Smith. It seems difficult for biographers to be neutral on him. Although the author genuinely attempts to be unbiased, she often takes facts from his life and comes up with a negative interpretation of his actions: much the way a church member would take the same events and come up with a positive interpretation.The book is very readable and there is factual information in the book that is difficult to find in other places. These are the highlights of this biography.The downside is the author's unintentional slant against Joseph which leads to many assumptions that may or may not be accurate.In sum, to better understand the life of Joseph Smith this would be a good book to read, but the reader should certainly get more than this one view point before making any firm judgements."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I found this book to be greatly informative and interesting. Great book!No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Brodie once confided with a close friend and fellow author prior to completing this work: \\"More and more I am coming to believe that the great biography of Joseph Smith will be a fictionalized one. There is plenty of evidence to write a book without fictionalizing, but to bring to life the man's inner character, to display all the facets of his infinitely complex character, requires I think the novelist's perception rather than the historians digging\\".This biography does indeed read like a novel which presents Smith's life as a marvellous adventure of a man living life to the fullest, and yet deceiving thousands (and possibly himself). It is obvious that Brodie has performed many years of extensive research in producing this material. Unfortunately her content, while based on genuine historical documents, is completely biased in the way it attempts to portray Joseph Smith's life.The book presents Smith as a man intent on deceiving the world, and Brodie attempts to focus each event as being a calculated decision to further that intent. She uses both well known and also not so well known sources, but does so selectively in a way to support her viewpoint. As a result, she often omits equally valid sources and material that would counter her personal belief. She highlights each \\"mistake\\" Smith makes and attempts to identify the motive that drove him to do the things he did. This bias is her major downfall as a historian - a role I believe which should be focused on documenting historical facts, not personal supposition.Fortunately, about halfway through the book, when Smith's \\"revelations\\" settle down to only a few in his final ten years of life, the author's agenda also settles down somewhat and the second half makes for a captivating, not so agenda driven, account.On a positive note, this book contains a fair amount of material not found in other accounts, and for me personally, that makes it worth the time to read it. It covers from his birth right through to his murder with significant details of his life in between.Whether Joseph Smith was or was not what he claimed to be, can never be \\"proven\\", as there are logical arguments on his life's history that support or discredit whatever it is you want to believe. If you are looking for arguments to support he was not what he claimed to be, you will absolutely love this book.In summary, I found this book to be an easy read and a classic work on the life of Joseph Smith, with portions that cannot be easily dismissed or ignored. Brodie has produced a pioneering and thorough biography on a man you'll either love or come to despise. Just don't let the author's personal beliefs influence your own opinion on who Joseph Smith was (or was not). The answer won't be found from reading one un-objective account.N.B. For the record, I believe this statement is just as true for \\"pro\\" Smith authors like Bushman and many others.Edit: Three days after writing this review I completed readingReconsidering No Man Knows My History(see my review). It contains an essay by Newell G. Bringhurst that included comments, better voiced than my own. One of Brodie's contemporaries reviewed her work upon publication (in 1945) by stating that she quotes \\"copiously . . . from books by embittered apostates\\" asserting that \\"now and then she appears to state as undisputable facts what can only be regarded as conjectures supported by doubtful evidence.\\" That her book was \\"almost more a novel than a biography because she rarely hesitates to give the content of a mind or to explain motives which at best can only be surmised.\\" That same reviewer ended their review with \\"It is nevertheless a probing and very satisfying volume.\\"(p.49)"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"A completely suspect read, this book's unqualified criticism becomes all the more clear when viewed in tandem with Miss Brodie's manufactured bio on Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;).For a critical rereading of this book, see &quot;Tinkling Cymbal and Sounding Brass,&quot; an excellent deconstruction by Hugh Nibley of Miss Brodie's methodology."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"The autor clearly is a poor writer of history, she actually claims to know what the charactors are thinking.

Brodie, an acknowleged agnostic, and many like her who are critical of the Church, write and love books like this which justify their apostate sympathies or actions.

Faithful Church members have no reason to want to read this book, which they know is filled with half truths and inuendo, so they don't come here to review it.Fawn Brodie pretends to know what was in the mind of Joseph Smith when he supposedly did what he did.

All one has to do is look at her much discredited work on Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;) and compare it with this work to see the parallels.For a critical rereading of this book, see &quot;Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass,&quot; an excellent deconstruction by Hugh Nibley of Fawn Brodie's methodology."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is an example of an anti-mormon trying to write an historical account and remain sitting on the fence. This cannot be accomplished and Fawn Brodie failes. This is not the history of Joseph Smith the man or the prophet. The background resrearch is horrible and the commentary leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the reader. The only message I got from this book is that Fawn Brodie is bitter and cannot write without this bitterness coming out in here book. One of the worst biographies on Joseph Smith that I have read."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"My entire life has included constant exposure to this attempt to capture,beat and bury poor old Joe Smith.She is a many decade favorite with those who like to throw rocks at all things LDS.Living in VA,in the shadow of Monticello,her horrible,discredited \\"biography\\"of our beloved Mr.Jefferson,should show the casual reader that her scholarship is extremely suspect.Reading her book is like going to a Harry Reid/Nancy Pelosi press party for ALL your info on the Bush administration.Her view of Smith is so twisted,so fabricated,so devoid of actual truth, as to make one wonder why anyone would care.But itching ears go for what fits their desires.Many desire to dismiss Smith as a charlatan,fake,fraud-Keep trying.Ain't gonna happen.In this bicentennial year of his birth,there has been a huge amount of scholarly research released,symposiums conducted,including one at the library of congress.The picture of Smith that emerges is one that paints a better portrait, that shows more of the depth of this giant on the American scene.His status as one of the most important figures in US history is undeniable.His influence in the US and,indeed,the entire world just grows.By their fruits,ye shall know them.The fruits of the life of Joseph Smith are sweet and welcome by those who know truth from gossip,something Ms.Brodie did NOT.The fact that most historians agree that he is the most important American religious figure ever produced, shows the futility of those who killed him,as well as those who continue to slander him."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Seeking to be primarily an exposition on Mormonism's founder, Joseph Smith, and his life, this biased and typically unscholarly work depicts the life of Joseph Smith as anything but prophet-like. Her twisted and oft times distorted view makes this book completely unreliable and, therefore, not quite the &quot;brilliant&quot; work some may suppose.At the time of its original publishing, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was considered the best anti-Mormon literature around. Ms. Brodie attempted to disclose supposed &quot;secrets&quot; about Joseph Smith's life and whisked away any notion of a his prophetic calling. With deceit in her heart, she believed it was necessary to perhaps logically explaining every condition, circumstance and story with more believable worldly circumstances. She even used psychoanalysis as a justification of her distorted views. Just as science sometimes attempts to explain there is no God, Ms. Brodie wants to show there is no such thing as a modern-day prophet!I was significantly disheartened to hear from some that this book of blatant untruths is probably the best reading material on Joseph Smith around. Obviously, not too inept to study, ponder and pray, these multitudes of ignoramuses are too quick to judge and probably not willing to seriously study in-depth (and from different perspectives) the life of a man too great in personal stature and unique spirituality to be told all in one book. No one book completely encases nor sufficiently explains the sheer virtuosity and dynamic life of Joseph Smith.I hope that others may know Ms. Brodie's book is not the end-all-discussion authority on Joseph Smith, nor will it ever be. I would recommend other reading material, but this book by no means gives a proper perspective!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"The author proves the title statement made by Smith and further extends it: No woman knows his history, either. The conclusive leaps are laughable to anyone who thinks them through, and too much information in the book is already outdated and disproved. Even some of the most vociferous scholarly critics of Joseph Smith and Mormonism have abadoned Brodie as a source of reliable research.As a former member who has looked for help to explain my choice to leave the Mormon Church, this book only left me rolling my eyes."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Many other independent and non lds sources have dispupted and disproven much of this book.

She was by no means some whacked out disgruntled female liberal rebel without a cause, as the Mormon Church would like to paint her. She was a credible scholar, Ph.D from UCLA. A master of history and a person who had the mega courage to expose the Mormon Church as a Fraud! As an EX Mormon of over 46 years, a former High Priest and former Mormon Temple worker, I thank God that I finally had the courage/curiosity to read this landmark book on Mormonism. Written over 60 years ago in the 1940's, Fawn Brodie NAILS Mormonism founder Joe Smith to the cross of truth. The Mormon apologists can only make desperate agonal jabs of ignorance in an attempt to counter punch the world class fighter arguments of Fawn Brodie as she systematically dismantles Joe Smith and his fraudulent Cult."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie wrote the definitive biography of Smith in \\"No Man Knows My History\\".. extensively researched, with a complete set of annotations and bibliographies. Many other books on the subject refer back to Brodie for much of their source material. A must read for those interested in the subject."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I just finished reading this poignant, rich and riveting look into the life of a man who was driven by his ego. A very talented story teller and a masterful charmer, he converted thousands in his day to following his church. The self proclaimed \\"one and only church\\". Brodie does her research thoroughly and completely, giving us a look at Joseph Smith the Man. Not a diluted form of history - or a sculpted version, but the facts. It's a must read. From a boy's curiosity about the Indian mounds and treasure seeking, to a man who marries over 50 women and runs for President of the United States. Whether you are a historian buff or just have an inquisitive mind regarding the mormon roots, this book is by far the best book I've read yet. Brodie was consequently ex-communicated from the church for NOT leaving out key components that the church wanted her to - thus giving us a true account of this historical man. A bright, eager, greedy and fallible man."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Outstanding book, and one that's caused a fair bit of consternation among the Mormon faithful. I'd take their criticisms with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I found this to be an excellent review of the life of Joseph Smith and a great read. It was written with candor and let the chips fall where they may. I do not believe that the Mormon church would agree with the many unflattering comments made about their prophet but it seems to be very well researched with supporting documents for each chapter. It also discounts many of the detractors of Joseph Smith as their comments were viewed as possibly coached by his enemies or unreliable due to the passage of time. This only adds credibility to the facts that were included. While this generally paints a very damaging picture of the prophet it does not seem to be a deliberate attempt to smear him or the Mormon church. It appears to be a straight forward well documented historical account. The author was also very sympathetic to the followers for the hostile treatment they suffered in Missouri and Illinois. The author also alludes to the numerous other prophets of the early 1800's. This is a fascinating treatment of an often overlooked aspect of American History. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Sixty and more years have passed since its publication, and \\"Know Man Knows My History\\" remains the best of the biographies of Joseph Smith, founder of THE quintessential American sect, predating Scientology in its (wildly) successful exploitation of human credulity. It should be required reading for all students of American history."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I have returned to read this book as a long-time favorite.

Timely reading."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie gained international renown for her landmark work on the life and teachings of Joseph Smith. She is even-handed and fair in recounting the positive, as well as negative, qualities of Joseph Smith. Some of the negatives include his \\"revelations\\" compelling women to marry him lest they incur the wrath of God as well as numerous \\"prophesies\\" that didn't come to pass. Her sources are firmly documented and she provides excellent footnotes, which allow the reader the opportunity to conduct further research. As is so often the case, when one lifts the veil on the early history of the Church of Latter Day Saints, one cannot avoid a convoluted, confused, and sordid picture. Like many other impartial scholars before and after her, her sincerity earned her excommunication from the church, which does not feel historic truth should be pronounced unless it is \\"faith-promoting.\\""},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This was an extremely well researched and interesting to read book. It is the best biography of Joseph Smith that I've come across."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I am an active LDS member and proud to be called a Mormon. I read this book quite a few times, and I am glad I did. After reading this book, I still believe Josepth Smith was called of God to be a prophet, and my opinion of him has not changed. I encourage other faithful Mormons to read it because it tells the story of Joseph from the historical point of view and from a non-believers perspective. Although I question some of the historical facts that Mrs. Brodie used to state Joseph Smith's psychoanalysis, I think she does a good job with most of the historical data and resources she used.I am not embarrased by the origins of our church. I am not embarrassed by the life of Joseph Smith. I think we should embrace our past, the history of our religion, and it will help us understand the times and epoch under which Joseph lived his life in Missouri, Ohio, New York, and Illinois. Yes it is a little odd that Joseph Smith was crowned \\"King\\" in the Kingdom of God by the Council of Fifty, but they are opinions of people who said it many years later. The reader needs to know and understand what is real historical data and what is not. There are a lot of statements and affidavits signed by people. The question remains, did they hate Joseph? Of course, all is understandable, and the reader needs to read this book with an open mind intellectually, and be a scholar in its thorough analysis.I personally liked Brodie's book. I have read other books critical of Mormonism and I think its very healthy to know the church's true origins, past, and the conditions from which it arose.Everything in this life is carried out by FAITH. Where you believe in God or not, whether you are Christian or Muslim, Catholic or Mormon, or Protestant, FAITH is not necessarily based on facts. How can we prove God exists? How can we prove Christ existed or that He was the Messiah? How do we prove the Holy Ghost exists? How do we believe what's in the bible? How do we believe God? ......It's all FAITH. We walk by FAITH. You are either secular or spiritual. You either believe in God or you don't. We all have the freedom to choose, to believe. I for one believe Josepth Smith to be a prophet. I believe Jesus was the Messiah. I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. Could I be wrong? Of course! But yet, I have FAITH and I choose to believe, and that settles it.But the book is a great read. I recommend you read it together with (and compare) to Bushman's \\"Rough Stone Rolling.\\" Both are very intellectually stimulating. It makes me appreciate Mormonism more."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"It's not the salacious tale some reviewers would have you think, and it can drag in spots.Still, it's fascinating to read about this man, and the author does her best to find every scrap of information on him, and his family, and his followers. I didn't find this to be a \\"bash Mormons\\" book at all. In general, it was interesting to see how a very charismatic, creative, and charming poor kid built an empire.From this book, you get not only specific and detailed information (as much as there is available) but also a pretty balanced look at how the LDS Church began, but more specifically, what was it about this man, and this time, that created the powerful entity that is the LDS church today? Why did HIS church succeed when so many failed?It made me wonder about the founding of other churches. Would we call them \\"cult leaders\\" today, if they hadn't been a product of such recent history, and so much easier to document?So, for me this was a thought-provoking book, and I learned much more than I thought I would when I purchased it."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Having been born and reared in the Church, it was not merely a \\"church,\\" but it was \\"The Only True Church on the Face of the Earth.\\" It was my identity, I served a misson, Branch President, H.P., Stake Mission President, sending my son on his mission next week, so imagine my sense of betrayal, and the helplessness and confusion I felt after reading this book. My three (3) pillars were: (1) a young man may spawn a lie, for personal motivations, but he can still be a Prophet, and nobody would carry a lie so far as to be killed for it; (2) No man could have written the Book of Mormon; and (3) the Temple Ceremony is so sacred and unusual that it could not have been imagined or contrived. Well, this most carefully documented, carefully written, carefully researched book, has all but destroyed my pillars. Fawn Brodie, Niece of the Prophet, David O. McKay, has done meticulous research and I have searched for but never found or read an official LDS Church response or debunking of it; I've searched the BYU F.A.R.M.S. site hoping for an academic, honest review of her evidence and hoping to find that Ms. Brodie's research was flawed or dishonest. But despite my motivations and wide-spread search, I have never read a criticism of her sources, or documented proof that her research is false, or that her conclusions are false, only that she had an agenda and some of her conclusions are specious and not well supported. Well, that is simply disengenuous criticism. To say that Ms. Brodie can only prove \\"A, B, C, and D,\\" but \\"jumps\\" to a conclusion that \\"E\\" exists, is simply blind faith ignorance and dishonest academia. This book constitutes the \\"mysteries,\\" that the Church teaches its members to stay away from. But it is hardly a mystery. This book explains with a clarity and insight never-before heard by an LDS member, how Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, how he practiced polygamy before receiving the alleged revelation; why he was tarred and feathered; exactly where the Temple signs and symbols came from; the extent Joseph would go to protect his power and authority, and many more \\"mysteries.\\" No active member of the Church should read this book lest their eyes be opened. It hurts! Truth is not pleasant sometimes, why should it be. I just wanted it \\"straight,\\" I didn't want to be lied to any longer. If the Church simply said, \\"we're a good church, doing good deeds, helping the poor, please give your tithes to help us, I would most certainly go. But the Church says, \\"we are the only true and living church on the face of the earth.\\" To me, that's a challenge to find out for myself, which I did. Now, I am a \\"mormon in recovery.\\" My entire belief system, every single word I've ever been taught, is a lie. I am undone.

McKay, who reprimanded her for using primary source LDS documents to write a less than favorable review of the founding prophet's life. Brodie later became a history professor at UCLA.Published in 1945, yet still a classic, her psychobiography was the first work to hint that Smith was a narcissist who used his vivid imagination to create the Mormon religion. Her book remains the best analysis of the facts giving birth to Mormonism and of the key events that took place in its founding prophet's life.Kay Burningham, Author of \\"An American Fraud: One Lawyer's Case against Mormonism.\\""},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I don't have a problem with Mormons. Unlike other proselytizers, they're polite, not condescending, and they don't ask you if you think you're saved. One also can't help but be impressed by Salt Lake City, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, their willingness to spend a year as missionaries and their elaborate social structure.However, I do have a small problem with Joseph Smith's claim that an angel told him where to find the golden plates on which the Book of Mormon was inscribed. I wanted to know what there was that tempted Smith's followers to embrace this sort of fantasy. Brodie, who was raised as a Mormon and was eventually excommunicated because of this work, does an excellent job answering that question. I thought she bent over backwards trying to be fair. Smith was born of a very poor family in Vermont and spent much of his youth in Palmyra, New York, where he became a treasure hunter, something like a \\"diviner.\\" People were willing to pay him to hunt for treasure because of the rumors about gold and sliver being buried in the Indian mounds native to the area. Smith used a stone to help him \\"see\\" where the treasure was buried. Eventually this idea morphed into the discovery of the golden plates which became the Book of Mormon. Naturally, no one else could see the plates under threat of death if they tried (Eventually he did find three men to testify they'd seen them, but it took some \\"persuading.\\" Even Smith's parents believed the plates were real, and he knew he was on to something. Here's where the fairness comes in. Brodie credits Smith with amazing talent in respect to improvisation and persuasiveness. Brodie credits Ethan Smith's VIEW OF THE HEBREWS; OR THE TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL IN AMERICA as an \\"inspiration,\\" for the Book of Mormon, but she also shows him dictating it to his secretaries, so, either he had an amazing memory or he wasn't faking. She also dispels some of exposes regarding Mormonism, namely The Spaulding-Rigdon Theory.Once Smith accumulated a wide following he moved his flock to Kirkland, Ohio, where he built his first temple. This was also where he received his first \\"revelation\\" regarding polygamy. Apparently the more wives you had, the more credit you received in heaven. His wife, Emma, however, was not convinced. She caught him with the poetess Eliza Roxey Snow, one of his first plural wives, and \\"flung her down the stairs and drove her out into the street.\\"In some respects Smith was his own worst enemy. He antagonized the Missouri settlers, where some of his followers set up Zion, by forming a militia, and he took to calling himself Lieutenant General Joseph Smith. Smith was also unable to control a number of apostates who turned against him, publicizing the polygamy as well as some suspicious land deals.Brodie never does use the term megalomania, but there was no doubt Smith had a high opinion of himself. When the otherwise trustworthy William Law left the church and formed his own newspaper which was critical of Smith's dillydallying (This was in Nauvoo, Illinois, where Smith and his followers went after being driven out of Missouri), Smith had the press destroyed. Once again the settlers were outraged. They also weren't that fond of Smith's militia which he claimed was 100,000 strong and which he bragged would help him form a theocracy.Brodie has been accused of being one of the first psycho-biographers, but she doesn't do a whole lot of that until the Supplement, where she refers to something called \\"pseudologia fantastica.\\" From this she infers that Smith was not necessarily a fraud, but a very conflicted man. In other words, Smith had sort of a split personality. On the surface he was a supremely confidant man, \\"focused and strongly assertive,\\" underneath he was still the crude diviner who preyed on people's naivet&eacute;."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book may be considered &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; by some. I can't say that I agree with everything that was written in the book, but most of it, yes. Contrary to the belief of many LDS church members, Joseph Smith was not a 100% perfect man. He was human, this is something that sould be realized. This is what the book talks about, it is the very, very human, imperfect side of Joseph Smith. And I appreciate Ms. Brodie for having enough courage to write the book. She doesn't seem bitter at anything. I think she did excellent research, she has many quotes from Mormons and Non-Mormons in the book, journal entries etc... from the people who were alive and knew Joseph or knew about him during his time. I recommend this book to people who want to see the church from both sides of the fence."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Although published in 1946, this book remains the definitive biography of the Mormon &#34;prophet&#34; Joseph Smith, Jr. Fawn Brodie's research and detailed footnotes make this an excellent reference book. Ms. Brodie was the grand-daughter of the president of Brigham Young University and niece of the &#34;prophet&#34; David McKay. This gave her unprecidented access to Mormon documents unavailable to nonMormon writers and historians. This is a book for those interested in history. It is absolutely facinating and makes history fun to read. Sadly, Ms. Brodie,s honest exploration of the life of Joseph Smith, Jr. led to her being excommunicated from the Mormon church. However, she has preserved historical truth for future generations. This a a must book for every student of American history or religion."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"With Romney's political ascendancy, I decided to revisit my former and late professor's career-making biography of Smith, who founded Mormonism. Brodie, a disaffected Mormon herself, was criticized for grinding an axe, especially as she concentrates heavily on what she easily exposes as Smith's long history of fraud and irrational thinking. But first and foremost, Brodie was a meticulous historian who built a national academic reputation of unqualified integrity. In this early work she is no less thorough, letting the facts speak for themselves."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Written originally in 1945, this book survives the test of time in it's relevance to Joseph Smith's history. Mormon authors still cite it as a counterpoint to their conclusions, \\"Brodie concluded Smith had 49 wives, but it is better to err on the side of caution,\\" and antagonists like to quote it to challenge the missionaries who just knocked on their door, \\"Have you heard of that book by Fawn Brodie?\\" Though some have attempted to cast this under the \\"anti\\" bus by stating that Brodie was on her way out of Mormonism when she wrote it, Brodie offers a significant challenge to the view of Smith's character and motives that can't be flippantly brushed aside. Brodie is well-known for five other biographies, most notably for Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History. While she does provide the more antagonistic view of Joseph, she provides good balance to Bushman's positive-leaning Rough Stone Rolling."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This account of Joseph Smith provides an interesting historical account with a multitude of footnotes and references which show the painstaking effort of a real detail-oriented historian.

It is written in such a manner that it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book has been around a long time. It is one of the most quoted books on Mormon history. Some of the assumptions and some of the conjectures made have since been found to be a little off, the history that was written was a wonderfully accurate look at the man Joseph Smith Jr. Fawn Brodie is a noted historian and author. In the beginning of the book it seemed that Ms. Brodie was sympathetic to Joseph Smith and the Mormons. As her research and the book progressed, the tone became more negative, just as mine did through the research I did."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"At the time of its release, Brodies work was either either a masterpiece or muckraking depending upon the vested interest one brought to the review. Time has not been kind to all of the books details or to the methods of psychological inquiry used by Brodie. Indeed Smith has proven to be far too complex a character for the biographer. Still if one is to engage in a serious study of early Mormonism or the life of America's prophet, Brodie is a foundation work if for no other reason than to set the parameters for what follows. The life of Joseph may never fully be realized in print and Donna Hill's work is actually much closer to reviving the man than is Brodies'. Still this work will hold its place in Mormon history for no other reason than that it motivated many others of all religous persuasions and scholastic ability to look seriously at the latter-day movement and attempt to explain its significance."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"To be certain I had a balanced picture of Joseph Smith, undoubtedly an American original, I bought and read a short biography sold by Deseret Press. In the 160 pages, there was so little substance for so historical figure, I caught myself thinking \\"get on with it\\".That didn't happen. So, back to Fawn Brodie. Her volume gave me at least, starting places to research. This did not happen in the Deseret volume. Although Brodie could be accused of being biased, I believe she let the historical evidence take her where it would."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I am more than happy to have read this book in the middle of my LDS-philic book hysteria and during the bicentennial celebration of Joseph's year of birth. As you can see from my other reviews, I have read Signature books a lot and would like to recommend theirs \\"The prophet puzzle\\" and \\"Making of a prophet\\". In these books several new aspects of Joseph Smith Jr are described and his rather multifaceted profile is acknowledged.Fawn can easily be misunderstood depending on the ideological stand of the reader. I for example found Hugh Nibley review/criticism of her book disgusting. Hugh Nibely, whose scholarship I admire and find amazing, has written an awful attacking review, \\"No ma'm, that's not history\\". In some way, critics (mostly conservative LDS but also scholars in autobiography) has seen her book as an effort to prove her own understanding of Joseph. If she wanted to prove that he was false, than she was subjective enough to chose the sources she wanred. Of course, every biographer has to do some filling in of details. When Fawn writes about how Joseph thought or felt in some situations, she guesses of course, but there is always a novellist in the historian and especially in Fawn, with her beautiful literary style. The book should be read as a historical novel, rather than a footnote-stuffed diary encyclopedia - by the way, it has footnotes.!I believe, from what I have read about Joseph and from Joseph, that Fawn hasn't at all exagerated her sources or manipulated them. What she has done, is not believing that Joseph wanted to be a prophet. She clearly shows a knowledge of how to handle different sources. The way she has gathered all the newspaper articles or read all the affadivits, good or bad, shows that she has wanted to give an optimally correct picture of Joseph. Many scholars have agreed about her evolutionary view of Joseph and that Joseph was a child of his time.I believe - being a scholar myself - that Joseph full heartedly wanted to be a prophet and he also became one, for himself and for others! He wanted a united Christianity, a more powerful Christianity. I don't agree with Fawn about him wanting to magnifying himself thru religion, no, he could have managed well, by becoming a politician - which he also tried. I see in Joseph a boy with a spiritual mind.At the same time, she is right about Joseph being the one behind the revelation. He was sure about the fact that his feelings were the same as god's. Brodie managed to refute the Spauldig theory about the origins of Book of Mormon and also the epilepsy diagnosis of Joseph. She introduced the View of the Hebrew as a plausbile source to Book of Mormon, something which BH Robert, the great LDS historian, also had noticed some 10 years before (1930s). She has managed to create a whole person - but too paradoxal, I had a difficulty to understand Joseph thru her.Joseph becomes the one that smoked and drank, but also the one who healed, who cried and suffered with his people. The one who went from woman to woman, but kept in the centre of his heart, Emma, his first wife. The one who was afraid of dying, but who knew that the end was near. Capturing this personality is not easy and Fawn has done an excellent job. But there are answers still to come about this remarkable man.Fawn shows thru her book, that Joseph was a human, not a prophet, but a strategic master in folklore, religion and charistamic leadership. For her, he was a strategic deciever - still in 1971 she couldn't udnerstand why Joseph chose religion for achieving his leadership dreams.Even though Fawn wanted to see an irreligious Joseph behind the \\"Thus saith the Lord\\", she has for me confirmed my picture of a highly spriritual Joseph."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"An outstanding and at times exhaustive history of Joseph Smith, founder of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints, the Mormons...Very detailed and excellently researched, but it is obvious--too obvious at times--that the author, Fawn Brodie, has a very low opinion, perhaps even detests, the man she is writing about and the the church he established.One wonders if she, like Scott McClellan's book on the Bush administration, is not getting her \\"pound of (vindictive) flesh,\\" though there may be some truth is what is said.There is a feeling, a strong feeling, that balance and objectivity may be missing from this work, but even so, it is a good, worthwhile read.This much is certain: The church Joseph Smith established could never have grown and become it the church it is today until he passed from the scene. It then no longer had to defend him and his wilding gyrating ideas and visions.It makes one wonder if the Mormon Church has become the church it is today--has found its way--in spite of Joesph Smith rather than because of him."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book helps the reader to know the truth about Joseph Smith, and how his story has changed over the years, revised as the LDS church sees fit.

It would be difficult for anybody who is LDS to believe anything in this book that puts Joseph Smith in a bad light. After all, he is revered as the prophet of the LDS church, and a negative reaction to this book would be expected from any believing member of the faith.Catholics do not want to read bad things about their popes, and LDS do not want to read bad things about their prophet.One does wonder what type of man Joseph Smith was. Whether Fawn Brodie was completely wrong in everything she wrote about him or not, this is a fascinating read.Another interesting read is Losing a Lost Tribe and By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus.By the way, don't waste your time on idiotic drivel from Hugh Nibley. He is merely an apologist for the Mormon cult, and his book, No Ma'am, That's Not History is as dull and unresearched a book as you will ever find."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"In studying Mormons as part of a look at some of my ancestors, I hoped to find that this book would be a purely historical account of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. While I found the information on his plural marriages accurate with other sources, some of the arguments on how the Book of Mormon was a reflection of Joseph Smith's life were bent to match the author's stance. Brodie refers to Nephi's family as a carbon copy of Smith's, but she changed the birth order of Nephi to mimic that of Smith. Brodie also claims that Smith was so concerned with the ideal world of the Book of Mormon, that he didn't include harlots or prostitutes. Funny- one of only a handful of women mentioned by name in the Book of Mormon, was a harlot named Isabel in the Alma chapter!Brodie also makes some weird conclusions and doesn't seem to focus on things contrary to her view. For example, Prof. Charles Anthon was visited by Smith's financial patron Martin Harris, and supposedly told him that the hieroglyphics of the record Smith was tranlating the Book of Mormon from were bunk. Yet Harris claimed that before he mentioned where the writings came from Anthon wrote a letter verifing their ancient origins. The letter was then ripped up when Smith was mentioned. Either way, Harris went on to mortgage his farm to help Smith finish translating the book. I think Anthon must have told him something positive, because would Harris financially ruin himself he was told by an expert that Smith was a sham? Brodie doesn't even dwell on this point, she quickly changes the subject.Another point Brodie doesn't look at is why the other men who saw the Book of Mormon (the witnesses) never recanted their statements. Most of them left the Mormon church at one time or another, but none of them ever took back what they said. Many of them called Smith a 'fallen prophet'- meaning that he was a prophet to them, just he did wrong in their eyes later. Brodie's only explanation for any of this is that Smith hypontized these men. If Smith had hypnotized these men, why did they leave his church and ridicule him eventually? Had the hypnotism been broken, don't you think they would realize that the golden plates were part of the trickery too? Again Brodie doesn't go in this direction.With these and other discrepancies, it was very hard to take anything Brodie wrote about seriously. When I later learned that she herself was once Mormon (related to Mormon President David McKay), I was not surprised at her obvious negative bias. There has got to be better books out there on Joseph Smith- more factual and less conjecture."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" was first published in 1945. On various points of detail, it has been superseded by more recent research. Also, one can debate whether or not Brodie's psychological and hypercritical take on Joseph Smith is correct or methodologically meaningful. Still, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" remains the classical biography of the Mormon prophet. Everyone who is interested in Mormonism from a non-Mormon (\\"non-faith promoting\\") perspective must read and come to terms with this book. Brodie herself was expelled from the Mormon (LDS) Church after the book's publication. Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley responded with a piece bearing the sexist title \\"No, Ma'm, that's not history\\". I'm not sure whether it's still available, or whether anyone really cares. As for Brodie, she eventually became a successful history professor and wrote biographies of Thaddeus Stevens, Richard Burton, Thomas Jefferson and Richard Nixon. I haven't read them, but apparently they are heavily dependent on Freud and psychoanalysis, which strikes me as somewhat problematic. (Many American scholars seem to have a very reverential attitude to Freud. Perhaps patricide is in order?)What makes Brodie's biography controversial is her forthright description of Joseph Smith as a fanatic and deliberate con man. In a later edition, she dubs him a megalomaniac. To Brodie, it seems obvious that if somebody makes claims that are patently absurd from an atheist viewpoint, that person must be a conscious liar. In the same manner, she writes off Joseph Smith's earliest followers as easily fooled, manipulated or hypnotized. Today, it's considered bad politic among anthropologists or comparative religion scholars to take matters quite this far. (Richard Dawkins is another case again. But then, he's a biologist.) However, I must admit that I feel a certain sympathy for Fawn Brodie's position. Smith, after all, made some pretty extreme claims!Regular prophets claim to have visions, hear voices or meet supernatural personages. The visionary might be honestly reporting a subjective, psychological experience. He may even be (honestly) delusional. But Joseph Smith claimed to have found, seen and handled an actual material artefact, the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon were \\"translated\\" through the aid of an equally material artefact, the Urim and the Thummim (apparently, some kind of spectacles). Moreover, the Three Witnesses claimed to have had a collective vision of an angel showing them the golden plates, while the Eight Witnesses claimed to have both seen and handled the plates in a strictly down-to-earth fashion. The problem, of course, is that the entire story is absurd: there never were any golden plates, no Urim and Thummim, etc. It's therefore difficult not to charge Joseph Smith with conscious fraud, and his followers with extreme gullibility.The same basic story applies to the Book of Abraham, where Smith did have access to an actual document, but where the \\"translation\\" is fraudulent. Add to this Smith's personal character, which included secret polygamy (while the Book of Mormon condemns polygamy), joining the Freemasons and copying their rituals (while the Book of Mormon condemns Masonry), revisions after the fact of published church material, etc. And what about prohibiting alcohol in Nauvoo while still running a saloon in the main building? Smith's disciples don't inspire much confidence either. The Three Witnesses all left the Mormon Church, yet insisted that their testimony about the golden plates was true. Smith's estranged wife Emma Hale Smith joined a monogamous breakaway group after her husband's death, taking revenge on Smith's polygamous successor Brigham Young by claiming that Smith had never been a polygamist.If this is how religions are usually conceived, I rather stay agnostic!Readers of \\"No Man Knows My History\\" should also consult \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History\\", a critical reappraisal of Brodie's book edited by Newell Bringhurst.

No doubt that they were written by true believing Mormons. I find it hilarious when they refer to their holier-than-thou Hugh Nibley? Who was Hugh Nibley outside of Utah? He was NOBODY! No real scholars outside the Mormon Church ever took him seriously. As for the people who really want to find out a little more about the Mormon corporation, I recommend the book \\"Leaving the Saints\\" by Hugh Nibley's daughter. In that book she explains in details what kind of man he was (he was one of those men who rape their daughters!). Furthermore, it is a very well written book - a real page turner!Fawn M. Brodie's book is very well researched and has been acclaimed by scholars throughout the world. She was a real Professor, who worked for a real university. She was not one of those puppets who teach at BYU. Joseph Smith was a sick man and there are tons of documents that prove it.The Mormon Church was founded to make easy money and it still does today. Why do you think that the Mormon missionaries are instructed to wait until the last minute to talk to their prospective converts about the law of tithing (giving 10% of your income to the Mormon corporation)?

Smith was just a charlatan that told his lies long enough he came to believe them, unlike some other prophets that were half a bubble off from the word go.

Brodie did her research. She is an accomplished historian. However, I do not think she shows Smith as more of a fraud than Jimmy Swaggart or Billy Sunday. She points out that Smith was only human with human failings. I find that knowing the TRUTH about a personage frees me from seeing that person as a god-man as Christians have done to the poor Rabbi from Nazereth. Smith is considered by me, a Jewish Rabbi, as a Prophet of the same caliber as the Prophet Mohammed or the Apostle Paul."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Theodor Mommsen said that \\"History is neither made nor written without love or hate.\\"I first read Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" in 1975, when I was eighteen years old. At the time I found the subject intensely fascinating, but the writing struck me as highly fictionalized, with lengthy asides describing Joseph Smith's inner motives and thinking processes -- not biography but psycho-biography. The bottom line was that Brodie pegged Joseph Smith as a deliberate and evil-minded fraud.I recently reread Brodie at the age of 43, now much older and slightly wiser, and also having read a thing or two in my day. On my second reading I wonder if this book might really have more to do with Brodie herself -- a disenchanted and deeply bitter Mormon -- than with Joseph Smith.There is no doubt that \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has a wide influence in the world. I would caution the reader, however, to read at least one other biography of Joseph Smith along with Brodie's -- I recommend Donna Hill's unstintingly honest but affectionate \\"Joseph Smith: The First Mormon\\" (Doubleday 1977).

But . . .1) Brodie's style is readable, which is more of a criticism of everyone else. It flows and is quite readable, which is a rare thing.2) The tone of the book is quite unusual. It is almost a fictional narrative or a speech where the heartstrings are played like a violin. She builds up suspense (which is not quite scholarly), ask questions that she never answers, and peers into the mind and motives of Joseph Smith. She, therefore, is getting beyond the manuscripts and primary sources, and becomes a &quot;scholarly outlaw.&quot; How does she know what Joseph Smith felt and thought unless Joseph Smith tells her? And if there is no journal entry, where is the data? Ascholarship!3) Many of the conclusions about the book are really conclusions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and not about what Ms. Brodie says, inasmuch as people who dislike the Church will agree with her. This is called &quot;multiplying the mirrors, but not increasing the light.&quot;4) Ms. Brodie asserts a &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; interpretation of Joseph Smith: &quot;You don't know how you got there/You just know you want out/believing in yourself/as much as you doubt.&quot; But confidence is the one thing we see with Joseph Smith. Two Temples, several cities planned and founded, three-star general in the Militia, mayor, presidential candidate, prophet, seer, revelator, and father to boot! All this in forty-four years! I for one feel lazy!5) Logic 1: &quot;Ad Hominem&quot; and &quot;Genetic Fallacy&quot;: I am an active endowed member, and a BYU graduate to boot, but are my conclusions tainted because of may bias?

Yes, this cuts both ways, but still are you going to rely on one source for your understanding of Joseph Smith.

The criticism usually centers on her use of Freudian psychobiographical techniques to ascertain a historical figure's experiences and motivations through a psychological interpretation of their writings.Although this seminal work is still the most analytical and provocative biography written on Smith, the following four problems are conspicuous with Brodie's research:1) Before beginning her examination of sources, she was already convinced that Joseph Smith's religious experiences were unauthentic. Thus, the volume's naturalistic perspectives (along with its limiting choices of explanatory categories) were preconceived before the research began.2) She also chose not to access the documents in the LDS Historical Archives at Salt Lake City. Consequently, her volume lacks both the balance and information available from the single largest collection on Mormonism.3) By ignoring the aforementioned collection she was ignorant of the fact that most of Joseph Smith's papers and diaries were written by scribes in first-person for him, thus, her psychobiographical theories were actually based on other people's writings; and4) Her libraries of research were located mainly in New York, Connecticut, Chicago and Missouri, which in the 1940's were chiefly anti-Mormon collections. Ergo, her book reflects an anti-Mormon attitude.A more balanced but less piercing treatment may be found in Bushman's, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling.If you really want to know the background of both Brodie and her first work, an excellent book that details both is Newell G. Bringhurst's, Reconsidering No Man Knows My History.Two scholarly LDS reviews on Brodie's volume are: Marvin S. Hill, \\"Secular or Sectarian History?

Ms. Brodie talks about a lot of things that will be upsetting to you and your faith. If you're happy in your religion you might just prefer to stay away from this book.For non-Mormons:If you're interested in religion, charasmatic leaders and movements, or just like biographies I think you'll find this book very interesting and readable. Joseph Smith is an interesting historical character who was able to raise up a religion with thousands of followers around him which has grown into millions of adherents today. Much of that religion still gathers strength from Smith's charisma and personality. Understanding him better can help you learn so much more about personality, religion, and psychology. It's worth your time if you have any interest.For ex-Mormons and Mormons who aren't happy in their religion:This is the group that I fit into. This book helped me to finally break away from the Mormon church. There were so many things that never made sense, but once you can better understand Joseph Smith and how he founded his religion you can better understand Mormonism today. Knowing the truth about Mormonism makes it so much easier to to leave because when it comes down to it Joseph's stories were lies and he constantly did things to better his own position in life. Joseph Smith was the first major cult leader in America and understanding that can help you get away.

For the first time many missing parts of the Mormon puzzle began to fit together and my life, as I understood it came crashing down. I literally threw up as I discovered what a bastard Joseph Smith was. No, this book isn't perfect, but having been written in 1945, it has proven itself to be the definitive expose of Mormonism's founder.

Fawn Brodie grew up as a Mormon, and I'm sure it pained her to uncover the facts that she did in her extensive research. (She was later excommunicated from the LDS Church, which I think is the wrong thing to do. She merely wrote a historical book; did the LDS leaders truly want her to repress the facts?) In No Man Knows my History, she uncovered the real Smith, the one who wanted to be prophet/military commander/president, etc. He is not the same person many Mormons have perceived him to be.The research is sound and, while very historical (obviously, since that was Brodie's specialty), extremely readable. It kept my interest throughout the book. I think it behooves a person to be very critical when it comes to following any leader. If the leader is from God, I think this will prove itself. If he is not, then common sense says to leave and search after what is real truth. This truth is only found in the God of the Bible, not the God that Joseph Smith said was &quot;once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned on yonder heavens.&quot; I think Brodie has gotten many followers of Joseph Smith to rethink their faith, and I am glad it is so very popular today."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Fawn McKay Brodie, trained historian and wordsmith, was raised in the LDS (Mormon) church. During her scholarly study of Joseph Smith's early writings and those of his contemporaries, she was given special access to historical archives of the LDS church - probably due to her relation to LDS general authority David O. McKay. The resulting history, with its rich and enjoyable literary style, easily qualifies as the first truly full biography of Joseph Smith, Jr. Mrs. Brodie gives credit where credit is due: &quot;The Prophet&quot; is credited with an aversion to violence, a genuine love for people (especially tender affection for children), manful behavior during his lengthy Liberty Jail incarceration, the power to win over even many of his enemies once personally introduced, and a powerful, driving imagination and energy. Proper criticisms are levelled against his lack of financial acumen, his inclination to see apparently fictional &quot;historical evidences&quot; in the things around him, his likely inability to constructively examine himself, and his extra-marital dalliances which more likely served as the cause of &quot;plural marriage&quot; rather than the effect of it. Her pointed examination of the Book of Abraham appears to have been vindicated in later years. (I have the 1954 edition.) And so on. While not a perfect work (is any writing of man or woman?), its strengths are sufficient to make it a must-have, must-read for anyone interested in Mormon studies."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Mormonism is said to be one of the fastest growing religions in the world, and No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith provides a fascinating and detail look into the life of Mormonism's founder. Detailed alongside, is the formation and growth of the early church and its key players.Mormonism is the only major religion to have its early, formative days chronicled by local newspapers, government and court records. Virtually every movement of the church and its principals--both controversial--were not only chronichled widely but histrionically editorialized about.The author, Fawn Brodie, maintains the hard-to-balance line of even reporting for such a controversial subject. The early church leaders could have been labeled either opportunistic whackos or divinely-inspired men of God. She does neither.Mormonism is quite popular and very widespread in the American West, and the United States has its very first Mormon presidential candidate. As a westerner, myself, I have a number of friends and acquaintances who are Mormon. After reading this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"Do these people really know this history of their church?\\"This reading experience left me somewhat doubting the validity and veracity of all orgnized religions. Read it."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"For me, a non-Mormon living in Utah for many years, this was a fascinating look into Joseph Smith's life and origins of the Mormon Church.It will never be popular with the Mormon faithful (see the many 1 star reviews here) because it is simply an honest account of Smith and his new church. And that honesty exposes Smith as a charlatan. The book is scholarly and well-documented, though Mormons have put a great deal of effort into making it seem otherwise."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I've consummed a library of books on Mormon studies, and had held off on reading &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; because I had already read a considerable quantity of biographical material on Joseph Smith. I capitulated at last only because it is among the most well known books on early Mormon history. I am so glad I did. No book could have pulled it all together and made sense of it all as well as Fawn Brodie's book. It is as valuable today as it was when it was first written over half a century ago. None of the objective scholarship of recent years contradicts her conclusions, but rather validates her, page after page after page. Her insight is piercing, her style is almost poetic, and her message is powerful.It is not any easy book for a Mormon to read, as is evidenced by some of the reactionary attacks Brodie receives in some of the reviews already written. The faithful do not want to hear that Joseph Smith was an &quot;evolutionary revolutionary,&quot; his doctrine growing with his ego and sense of personal magnificence. But this is no mean swipe at the character of Joseph Smith...if anything, you come away with a sense of awe at the creative genius, the charismatic giant that he must have been. If he brought scorn and violence upon himself and his people, it was a measure of the power he produced and the fear that he struck in lesser men with whom he shared his time and space. Nevertheless, Brodie's exploration of the world of Joseph Smith and the context within which his doctrine evolved is brilliant. She is adept at recognizing the role that projection has played throughout his career, beginning with the Book of Mormon, and continuing on through all of his other writings, including the History of the Church. Ms. Brodie says it best herself in the opening lines of Chapter 19: &quot;A man's memory is bound to be a distortion of his past in accordance with his present interests, and the most faithful autobiography is likely to mirror less what a man was than what he has become.&quot; Or as is so often the case, &quot;less what a man was than what he wished he had become.&quot; To one who has studied the role of paradigms in shaping the way we interpret our world, Brodie's book makes the most beautiful sense. To one who's faith is at stake, however, her book may serve to threaten the idylic, heroic legend of Joseph Smith that has been carefully nurtured since his murder in 1844.This is among the finest pieces of historical literature I have had the priveledge of reading. Her scholarship and writing and fearless approach to tackle controversial issues with objectivity and sensitivity is matched only by Juanita Brooks in the realm of Mormon studies. This is a book not just to read, but to consume."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"After hearing about the \\"controversial\\" nature of this book amongst my peers and how \\"horribly\\" written it was I decided I would read it for myself.Needless to say I was enthralled from the very beginning of the book. I found the book and the subject matter fascinating. I had expected the book to have a clear bias, but I felt Brodie presented the information very fairly and in a suprisingly unbiased way... oftentimes giving both perspectives and the information where both sides claims come from (i.e. she'll present people's claims that Joseph Smith was a moneydigger and occultist, and than show the court documents where he was on trial for doing so, and than she would show the other side's argument.).In fact the only part of the book that I felt had a truly negative biased tone was the \\"afterword\\" that was added several years after the author's excommunication.In the end though, I would have to say that the part I enjoyed most about the book was that it not only gave a detailed account of Joseph Smith, but of other church history figures such as Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young, John D. Lee, etc. I felt like a picture of what life was like back then was painted.Granted true blue Mormons will be offended when reading this book because they haven't heard anything but the filtered down version, AND they will gnash their teeth and bash on Fawn Brodie... BUT give her a break! It was the first biography of its kind and it was written in the 40's for heaven sakes. All the teeth gnashing looks ridiculous as if you're trying too hard to prove your obedience and faith.A good product will sell itself, and this book has sold suprisingly well despite being restricted to a small fraction of the world who actually knows what a \\"mormon\\" or who \\"Joseph Smith\\" was.

At any rate, I found the book well-written, the material neatly couched &amp; contextualized into the era it occurred, and a conscientous effort given to both 'official' mormon history and 'unofficial' mormon history. In spite of one's religious beliefs, this book ought to be required reading for both the scholar of mormon history and the devout mormon churchgoer. Ultimately, this book should serve as a springboard for further investigation and research by BOTH earnest mormon scholars and pious mormons alike."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"As a Mormon, I expected to find myself offended by this book, but it simply wasn't the case. Granted, Brodie approaches Smith with the assumption that he was not a real prophet...but once you understand that, her true facination and, yes, admiration for the man comes through.On the downside, she does try to psychoanalyze Smith using 20th century standards, and loses much of her credibility in the process. On the other hand, though, I've never read a more riveting account of the Missouri period. This book gives a flavor for what a truly remarkable man Smith was...whether one believed his claims or not.My advice to Mormons is: Read this book if you truly have an open mind and can appreciate a non-believer's point of view. To non-Mormomns I'd say: Remember, this book doesn't tell the whole story.All authors on Mormon history approach the subject matter from preconceived notions of belief or unelief, and that orientation clouds whatever comes after. Contrary to other reviewers, my feeling is that a book of this kind will never help someone to understand whether a religion is genuine or not. Those decisions come from other places in one's mind...and heart."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Like Ben Franklin, Kit Carson, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, Joseph Smith was incandescent in a uniquely American way. The church he founded is America's most successful home grown religion. A century and a half after Smith's murder by an Illinois mob, the Mormon Church flourishes, with over 12 million members worldwide. You don't have to believe he was divinely inspired - and Fawn Brodie clearly doesn't - to be impressed by his vision, energy, resilience, entrepreneurial skill and improvisational brilliance. Smith was undoubtedly a religious \\"genius\\" - William James' term for charismatic founders of new religious movements. This superb biography gives us the life in all its tumult and glory while skillfully refuting the larger than life myths it spawned.As Brodie shows, even as a semi-literate farm boy in upstate New York, Smith was a magnet for the social and theological currents whirling through 1820s America. His Book of Mormon, a mythic tale of warring tribes in the primordial American wilderness, drew upon magic, folklore, superstition, Masonic ritual, the old and new testaments of the Christian bible, racial prejudice against blacks and Indians, and the crude anthropology of his day. He grounded its authenticity in the Angel Moroni, who allegedly led him to the golden plates on which the book was inscribed in ancient hieroglyphics. He, Joseph, claimed only to be the messenger.Brodie has less interest in the mysteries of divine revelation than she does in the mysteries of human charisma. Smith's powerful voice, penetrating gaze and bluff, good-natured personality drew men and women from all walks of life into his orbit. His followers loved the man, according to Brodie, and saw in him the physical embodiment of their church. He was also shrewd enough to custom fit his religion to the character of his time, making Mormonism an ingenious meld of the secular and the spiritual. To a people eager for miracles, he proclaimed several. He gave Mormonism a patina of democracy, creating governing councils and making each member accountable for the overall health of the church. He also played on the willingness of Americans to see evidence of God's favor in the size of their bank balances. In Smith's religion, there was little friction between the good life on earth and the one that comes after.As the Mormons migrated west through Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, Smith updated his theology through periodic revelations from the Almighty. His most controversial revelation had to do with the taking of multiple wives. Interestingly, it wasn't the practice of polygamy that led to Mormon persecution during Smith's lifetime. Polygamy was too explosive for even Smith to sell to his followers, so he kept this revelation a secret outside his inner circle. The persecution the sect endured in Missouri and Illinois had to do with local fears that Smith's religious army would tip the balance of political power. That the prophet and his followers were cruelly persecuted, particularly in Missouri, is beyond dispute. By being tone deaf to their neighbors' concerns and by proclaiming themselves above secular authority, they created a decent portion of the resistance they encountered.At the time of his death in 1844, Smith was in the middle of a run for President of the United States. He was presiding over his church, the town of Nauvoo, a private military army, a vast financial and real estate empire, and a secret squadron of \\"fifty of so\\" wives. As he said in a sermon to his followers, \\"I don't blame anyone for not believing in my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself.\\"His was one of the most thrilling high wire acts ever seen in America. Brodie tells the life clearly, does an outstanding job of documenting her assertions, and gives credit where it's due. While not overlooking his tendency to claim divine justification for all too human urges, she has sympathy for the struggle he waged between \\"what he really was and what he most desperately wanted to be.\\" If you believe Smith had an actual pipeline to God, you'll probably see this book as a hatchet job. If you see him as a brilliant but flawed human being, you'll appreciate this balanced, clear-eyed biography."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Whether you believe Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God, a complete charlatan, or some mixture of the two does not change the fact that he is one of the most fascinating and underrated figures in American history. His life and the religion he founded say a lot about this country.This is the most famous (or infamous) biography of Joseph Smith. At the time of its publication it was a watershed event. No one with an 'outside' perspective had been given quite the access that Historian Fawn Brodie had.So after hearing all of the praise and condemnation heaped upon this book, what do I think? Pretty good, for the most part. Mrs. Brodie is a compelling storyteller. As a narrative, it has great flow and keeps your interest. From my perspective, the book's greatest strength is placing Joseph Smith's life within the context of the world views and cosmological theories prevalent in the United States in the early 19th Century. Some of Mrs. Brodie's sources ('Mormonism Unveiled' for example) have been largely discredited, so a careful reading is required, especially when considering the quotes of the some of the more vociferous opponents of Smith.Is Joseph Smith a true religious prophet or not? You definitely get the feeling that Mrs. Brodie does not think so, but even she is amazed at Joseph Smith's life and transformations.Historical books about religious figures are bound to be controversial. My advice would be read this book, as well as other about the life of Joseph Smith. But this book, although imperfect, is still an valuable and compelling part of the history of the history of Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This is the second edition of Fawn M. Brodie's classic 1945 biography of the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. Brodie is well-known for her other highly respected biographies on Thomas Jefferson, Richard Nixon, Sir Richard F. Burton, and Thaddeus Stevens. The book is a detailed dispassionate factual narration of Joseph Smith's life and the early days of the Mormon Church until his murder by a lynch mob at age 39 in 1844.While Brodie is careful not to disparage Joseph Smith, she presents him as a human with normal inclinations and faults, and Mormons might not like to think of him in this way. In fact, the Mormon Church excommunicated her because of this book. She writes that the \\"major original premises of this biography was that Joseph Smith's assumption of the role of a religious prophet was an evolutionary process, that he began as a bucolic scryer, using the primitive techniques of the folklore of magic common to his area, most of which he discarded as he evolved into a preacher-prophet.\\"Brodie offers evidence showing that Joseph Smith began his career offering to help gullible farmers find buried fortunes on their land. He originally intended to compose a fictional novel about buried treasures but then altered it into a true account of a revelation delivered to him on golden plates in a foreign language with tools to translate them. Brodie discusses the belief that much of this Book of Mormon was plagiarized from another person's novel. Joseph Smith claimed that he had his first vision of God and Jesus, who had human forms because God was once human, in 1820 when he was fourteen. Brodie shows that this dating is \\"sheer invention... he dictated at least three different descriptions of the \`first vision' between 1831 or 1832 and 1839, and these descriptions differ strikingly in detail.\\" The revelation states that American Indians descended from Israel's \\"Ten Lost Tribes\\" who sailed to America around 600 BCE. (Actually, the ten tribes were driven out of Israel in 722 BCE.)The Book of Mormon disparages all people of color, although Indians are better than blacks. Women are also belittled. Their role both in life and in the after-life is to care for their husbands. A wife cannot enter the after-life unless her husband allows her entry.Joseph Smith called his new religion Mormon saying that the word is Egyptian and means \\"good.\\" But he didn't know Egyptian. Brodie describes a trick pulled on him where he was told that a document apparently contained Egyptian writing, and he was asked to translate it. Smith didn't know that the person was an Egyptian scholar and gave a totally wrong imaginative translation. He later called his church the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Shortly before his murder, Smith and some of his saints began to practice polygamy, while publically insisting that the practice was wrong. Brodie names and describes over forty women that he married. Over a dozen were married to other men and their husbands apparently knew nothing of the liaisons. These included five pairs of sisters and one mother and daughter. Some women whom he approached turned him down. His wife was opposed to polygamy and claimed that he never engaged in it. She married a non-Mormon after his death.Smith was charismatic and able to draw thousands of people to his new religion. Because of repeated vicious persecutions, he had to lead his saints to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. He was imprisoned for treason when the lynch mob stormed his jail cell and murdered him."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"A nice fluffy series of reviews, but it's time to honor Ms. Brodie's excellent work and call a spade a spade. Joseph Smith was certainly a remarkable human being, but as anyone with a clear objective mind can see, he was a charlatan of the highest order. He made up a religion from whole cloth, or rather, from a patchwork quilt of what he had at hand. His \\"scriptures\\" had a resonance in his day, but his writings and his church derive from brazen and bold lies and fantasies, plain and simple.The Mormon church now consists of some millions who deeply believe that Joe Smith was a \\"prophet of God\\". They are convinced that the hilarious mish-mash of biblical, masonic, and early 19th century historical and world views that make up the sacred doctrines and rituals of their Church are a sufficient explanation for the wonder of life and human existence on this planet and in this universe.Don't misunderstand me, Smith's Church is no worse than any organized religion. But in this case (not unlike Scientology), too much has been documented for a rational mind not to expose it. Moreover, the well documented beginning, expansion, and solidification of Smith's church into the Fortune 400 economic powerhouse that it is today (faithful member must pay 10% of their pre-tax income)is extremely illuminating as to how all \\"great\\" religions get established."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I have an original copy of this book because my grandfather purchased one in 1945 in Salt Lake City, Utah. My grandfather told the family that in 1945 when the book was first published it appeared with great fanfare at the LDS book store, Deseret Book, in Salt Lake, which is still in existence.It was heavily advertised as a great work and a must read due to the fact that it was written by an LDS scholar, was well researched and of course was written by one of their own. Those in charge of the book store at the time apparently trusted that the book would be a great and positive write and did not review the contents of the book. It only took a very short time for the reports to flood into the book store concerning its contents, and just as quickly the book was removed from that particular book store.My grandfather, having left the LDS faith as did the rest of his once converted family, had to have a copy and bought it immediately from one of the many other non-LDS book sellers that quickly picked it up to sell. Another book purchased by my grandfather, Lights and Shadows of Mormonism, which is an interesting read, but is more of a one person perspective of life in early LDS Utah. Both books are fascinating reads for anyone wanting to research further information involved in the early LDS Church and early Utah in general."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"The best things about Brodie's work:1)She is accurate. Even though it's been decades since this book has been out, it is still a widely-read text. She is a competent historian, which is a must if you want to learn about things as they reflect reality.2)She is readable. You can actually -enjoy- reading this one! It makes things much easier when a historian can write well, and Brodie does.3)She has a fascinating subject. Joseph Smith is one interesting fellow, as evidenced by the successful church that has sprung up in Utah. For some orthodox Mormons, reading this may even be quite adventuresome, as they learn about Smith from another perspective! I think everyone can read this and be intrigued by a complex person.If I have any complaint, it's that Brodie tries to psychoanalyze Smith too much. Obviously every biography is going to involve some speculation - unless you can actually interview the person yourself - but I thought she went too far at times in assuming she knew &quot;why&quot; Smith did certain things.Overall I highly recommend the book and I think it is still after all these years the best biography on Smith you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This is the most comprehensive, factual book about Joseph Smith's life to date.

I am sure that the resulting list would consist of wonderful, challenging, interesting books. This is such a book. Joseph Smith was one of the most interesting and, in the end, important Americans of the Nineteenth century. Sadly, his followers today are offended by much of what Joseph Smith, the man, was. Fawn Brodie tells this story faithfully and well. Attacks on the author's methodology notwithstanding, this is a great and truthful biography, which gives insight into the man, his age and the American soul. It should be read open-mindedly by anyone who wishes insight into the forces that shape the American mind."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Teaming with documentation! Library of Congress, Court documents, letters, diaries, even the the Mormon's own church history books (with certain phrases selectively removed, of course). How can any Mormon deny that they don't know ALL the truth about their own religion after reading this book! If you truly believe in the Mormon church you should be willing to read this book. After all, the &quot;Glory of God is Intelligence,&quot; right?"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This work will spark either extreme -- because Mormons are taught to view Brodie as the antichrist (I know -- i grew up as a mormon and left the church in adulthood). But Brodie also began the book as a devout mormon, and had access to the intimate holdings of the church before its wave of antihistorical paranoia set in about the time of her book! As an historian, I also see some flaws in her attribution and other methodological issues that historians can disagree with. But the picture she paints of the life of Joseph smith is fascinating, thought provoking and the book is a must-have for anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"In this exhaustive biography of America's most controversial religious leader, Fawn Brodie goes all out to tell the tale of the embattled Mormon Church founder. Her status within the LDS church gave her unmatched access to historical documentation, which she also follows up tirelessly matching various newspapers and court records of the time to paint an unflinching portrait of the finer and weaker points of Joseph Smith. I dont believe I have ever read a more thoroughly footnoted biography. Whether you are a true believer and think Joseph Smith was a martyr, on the opposite end of the spectrum and think he was a gifted bilker, or anywhere in between, if you want to know the story of Joseph without Church bias, this is your guide."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Very insightful and eye opening into the origins of the Mormon church.

One could simply focus on validating her sources (many have been locked away in the archives by the LDS Church, some are becoming increasingly harder to find due to time and nothing else) to develop a deep understanding of Mormonism and it's remarkable founder - as well as late 19th Century America.In fact one could simply follow Brodies bibliographical and end note trail to become a leading Mormon Studies Scholar or expert on Joseph Smith, Jr.Read it first, or read it last, but this work can't be avoided if you are even remotely interested in Early Mormon History."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"A well documented book about a very controversial subject.

I feel that she was fair to her subject and appreciative of his strengths and abilities as a religious leader, even if not, perhaps, an actual prophet of God."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"The first line of Brodie's 1945 biography of Joseph Smith (1805-1844) alludes to the New England in which the prophet was born in 1805. Raised in Vermont to dirt poor farmers he and the family moved to Palmyra New York. His poor schoolteacher father and mother were odd. They enjoyed hunting for buried treasure! From an early age Joseph enjoyed dreaming and fantasizing schemes regarding the finding of treasure and empire.It was in Palmyra that Joseph Smith claimed the angel Moroni appeared to him bearing huge golden plates covered in Egyptian script. The revelation he received was published as the Book of Mormon in 1830.Brodie who was raised in an LSD home but later renounced the religion claims that Smith actually wrote the Book of Mormon. He used Masonic and mystery religion cultic language mixed in with huge portions of the Bible. The book claims that Jesus Christ came to America; the North American Indians are descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel and the Nephites lost to the Laminites in an apocalyptic battle on the North American continent. The Book of Mormon became a bestseller with thousands of converts to Mormonism in the United States and abroad.Smith was always involved in numerous law suits dealing with everything from bank fraud, polygamous charges, disorderly conduct and treason to the state.Smith married many wives (Brodie says we don't know the exact number but he probably had over 50 spouses). He was interested in land speculation, banking and military affairs. In 1844 he ran for President of the United States. Smith died as a mob shot him down in Carthage, Illinois along with his brother Hyrum in June 1844. The Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy in 1890 in an effort to qualify for U.S. statehood and keep peace with the faith's many vocal and hostile critics.Charlatan or great religion leader? He was probably a mixture of both elements. Smith had a massive ego, brooked no opposition and was an authority figure to thousands of early Mormons. He fought with factions within his church as well as state and local officials. He was anti-black but held the American Indians in high regard. Smith could be friendly, jovial and forgiving but he could also be harsh, judgmental, jealous and bellicose. He was poorly educated but made schooling an important belief in the Mormon faith lexicon. Smith and his followers enjoyed secret and elaborate rituals in their various temples.Whatever your beliefs might be this will nevertheless be a book of interest to anyone seeking to know more about the Mormons, Smith, nineteenth century American history and religious persecution.Smith's dream of an empire in Kirtland Ohio and Nauvoo Illinois failed but his successor Brigham Young led the Mormons on a trek to a glorious future in Salt Lake City Utah. Joseph Smith was an American original who is deserving of study and reflection."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"No Man Knows My History was a direct attack on critical Mormon beliefs about Joseph Smith. In 1946, The Improvement Era, the official periodical of the Church, said that many of the book's citations arose from doubtful sources and that the biography was \\"of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith.\\" The \\"Church News\\" section of the Deseret News provided a lengthy critique that acknowledged the biography's \\"fine literary style\\" and then denounced it as \\"a composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before.\\"BYU professor and LDS historian and apologist Hugh Nibley challenged Brodie in another booklet, No, Ma'am, That's Not History, asserting that Brodie had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others. Brodie herself thought the Deseret News pamphlet \\"a well-written, clever piece of Mormon propaganda\\", but she dismissed the ultimately more popular No, Ma'am, That's Not History as \\"a flippant and shallow piece.\\"Brodie's controversial depiction of Joseph Smith is in the same vein as her other Psychoanalysis works of fiction. I say fiction because the psychoanalytical babbling of the insane is just that - psychoanalytical babbling without substance or fact. Brodie incorporates in her work Freudian psychology. Psychoanalysis is a work of the devil for sure, based on dreams and unprovable and unsupported assumptions. Her psycho biography of Thomas Jefferson became a best-seller base on the same psychoanalytical babbling And most important, Brodie's study of the early Richard Nixon, completed while she was dying of cancer, demonstrated the hazards of psycho biography in the hands of an author who loathed her subject. Brodie grew up disliking the LDS religion with full support from her mother. Brodie had access to church historical records because of her family connections to the church. She deviously betrayed the trust of church historians by misusing and misrepresenting the material.Psychoanalysis is a body of knowledge developed by Sigmund Freud and his followers, devoted to the study of human psychological functioning and behavior. Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the patient verbalizes thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the unconscious conflicts causing the patient's symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems.Both Fawn Brodie and her husband subjected themselves to psychoanalysis, he for insomnia and she for chronic mild depression and sexual problems. (Bernard's employer, the RAND Corporation, paid most of the bills.) If the problems of everyday life had been insufficient to maintain Brodie's interest in psychology, there was the case of her mother, who during this period attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.One should be careful what they read and adopt as gospel truth. The infamous Mark Hofmann read Brodie's No Man Knows My History before he bombed and kill two prominent Salt Lake City residents in 1985. Hofmann set out to destroy the LDS church. Hofmann's favorite text to discredit the Mormon church was Fawn's Brodie's No Man Knows My History. In my opinion Brodie's book is a work of the devil for sure, based on the psychoanalytical babbling of the insane."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is a disgrace to being scholarly and should not even be included a website that sells such great scholarly works as Steinbeck.

Wixom says Brodie is an eloquent novelist, a bankrupt historian. Wixom gives many examples. Even Brodie admitted in her 1945 \\"expose\\" that if she speculated in her work that it had condescended to fiction. Yet, she has these statements in her supposed work of historicity: \\"He [Joseph Smith] knew that she thought him a coward.\\" No footnote. So, Brodie knew that Emma knew that Joseph knew what Emma was thinking.Or we have this: \\"Joseph stood proudly before his men betraying nothing of the tumult and anxiety raging within him.\\" And \\"Nancy [Rigdon] threatened to scream.\\" Threatened? Even if Brodie was there, which she wasn't, how does Brodie know Nancy threatened?Brodie might have gotten away with saying, \\"it might have been,\\" or \\"considering the results\\"...but Brodie knows much more than she could know 150 years after the fact. She may have done considerable resource on Mormondom's prophet Joseph Smith but has few sources for her conclusions. In fact, Wixom found that one of Brodie's \\"documented\\" sources attributed to a St. Louis newspaper didn't even in existence in the year given by Brodie.Prof. Hugh Nibley very ably dissected Brodie's \\"No Man\\" with \\"No, Ma'm That's Not History.\\" But His pamphlet was lamented by some historian in that it was too brief; it did not go into detail. Lou MIdgely of BYU's FARMS did go into great detail investigating Brodie's troubled life and marriage, as well as her highly controversial biography of Thomas Jefferson. Midgely noted that the same criticisms leveled at the Jefferson work (speculation and unfounded conclusions) could be aimed at the biography of Joseph Smith. These were, indeed, darts in Brodie's balloon.But Wixom's major contributions as a former investigative reporter for several daily newspapers and post-graduate work in history at two universities , was this: he cited the many eastern newspapers and magazines (including TIME) which acclaimed Brodie's \\"objectivity.\\" Wixom's master's thesis was on the topic of objectivity as it was expounded by such creditable entities as the Associated Press. \\"Tell both sides; keep your own opinions out of it; use reliable sources; avoid unfounded speculation.\\" Under these guidelines, Wixom labels Brodie's \\"objectivity\\" as selective, a disservice to credible historicity.As Wixom points out, Fawn Brodie took the position from the beginning that she was going to expose Joseph Smith. As the niece of LDS Church president David O. McKay, she showed bravado in going against her family; but what did it avail her if she could not prove her point?Even anti-Mormon author Vardis Fisher lamented that Brodie relied mostly on blatant enemies of the LDS Church. Her work was one-sided. Bernard De Voto praised Brodie for \\"avoiding the supernatural.\\" That would also toss the Bible in the trash can. But how does DeVoto explain the accomplishments of Joseph Smith if he did it all by himself? (The Book of Mormon brought forth by Joseph Smith at age 23-24 is now embraced by 14 millions Mormons). De Voto, like Brodie, does not try to explain it. Neither one make any valid attempt.With all of the above, it would seem that neither Marvin Hill nor anyone can continue to say that No Man Knows My History has \\"gone so long without effective criticism.\\" It is the opening of a new era. Let Brodie be recognized as a creative genius with a slant toward Charles Dickens or Mark Twain. But historian? Hardly.Note: Hartt Wixom has written three other books dealing with LDS history in addition to Critiquing the Critics of Joseph Smith: Profiles in Mormon Courage, Edward Partridge, Jacob Hamblin.

I have been a fool. I thought I could prove whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was true by reading a history book and I am not even a professional historian. I have learned that real historians know that anything more than the facts is bias. The vast majority of facts are unknown by everyone on Earth. Without the facts we cannot draw solid conclusions. We must be careful because what we desire can cause us to make unfair judgments. Do you desire that Joseph Smith was a fraud? Or do you really hope that He told the truth?Apparently, the author of No Man Knows My History also wrote a biography about Thomas Jefferson. This work was largely criticized for being unprofessional. The author, seemingly ignorantly, projects her speculation into the subject of the biography, and presents as fact, intimate psychological analyses, that as a historian, she could not reasonably know. It is interesting that initially, No Man Knows My History mostly received praise from critics. I wonder if these contrary responses have anything to do with the fact that, in general, Thomas Jefferson is well respected while Joseph Smith is not?More importantly, I wish to express the pain I brought upon myself through my casual rejection of goodness, by reading this book, just so I could think of myself as more clever then everyone else. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Before I joined the church I had no self-esteem, I blamed everyone but myself for my problems particularly my mum and dad. I had given up hope of ever being in a relationship. I only cared about myself. I was addicted to dwelling on unchaste thoughts, self abuse and looking at pornography. But when I begun to receive the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ my life began to change. Through faith, I gained the power to exercise self-control. The sense of purity this virtue gave me felt much sweeter then the momentary pleasure of masturbation etc. I also began to understand how to love other people better. I started to love my mum and dad and desire to be theirs' for ever. I gained confidence and felt happier then I ever had before. I even started entertaining the idea that one day I would get married. But, unfortunately I insidiously abandoned my faith in God so that I could gratify my desire for intellectual superiority and other lusts. I read No Man Knows My History and spent many hours pontificating about ultimately insignificant facts. Meanwhile I was careless about more important things in life like being loyal, treating people with respect, developing faith in God etc. Because of my bad attitude I got hurt badly. (This is to do with non-member and anti-Mormon friends but is another story). I found myself alone and on my knees with no one to turn to except God. Miraculously, He was still willing to show me love even though I had offensively ignored Him and created problems for others.I love the church founded by Joseph Smith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There I am taught how to do good and love others. The gospel of Jesus Christ as received by Joseph Smith is very precious to me. No Man Knows My History led me to doubt Joseph Smith and my decision to join the church he started. Ultimately, these doubts were injurious to me. I pray that you will appraise your values before you choose to read this book. Instead, read a biography of Joseph Smith that is kinder to the subject e.g. Rough Stone Rolling by Richard Bushman. Avoid making the same mistakes I have.Let me quote from The Book of Proverbs 3:5 \\"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\\" My Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, knows I am ignorant like a little child. I do not believe He would lead me to progress in righteousness by trusting Joseph Smith, as He has, if Joseph Smith really was not a prophet of God."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Is this tired old book still around? Serious scholars of the LDS faith are wasting their time on this. If you are sincere about understanding the Mormons' beliefs you would be better served to read their Book of Mormon. For those who waste their money on this book: Brodie and her ilk are laughing all the way to the bank."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book was written, using anti-Mormon documents as sources for the propoganda. Ms. Brodie was not writing this book as a true informative study of the LDS church. She was writing this as a way to spread intolerance. This book may be a convenient way for people to disprove Joseph Smith and the LDS church, but it is completely ignorant of the facts.Honestly, would you want to trust someone who started writing a book convinced that she was going to find out that the church isn't true and that Joseph Smith was a liar? Why would she even want to &quot;research&quot;? She already knew what she wanted to find, so she was basically wasting her time.This book is definitely one to AVOID!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book clearly shows who Mr. Smith was. Mr. Smith was merely a con artist and like a good con artist he was able to convince others to follow him. Unlike, as other have point out in the reviews; he is nothing close to a profit or a preacher. Yes, he was human, but he chose to manipulate others in his \\"quest\\" to be perfect. The fact that he was human clearly says that he was never perfect and now that he has died shows that he will never be perfect in any stretch of the imagination. I have read book upon books about the Mormon cult (both for and against) and this is not a book that I would recommend to someone. I would especially not recommend this book to someone who would like to be apart of the cult as it is more one sided. A great book to read would be The Kingdom of the Cults By Walter Martin. Not only does this book tell the complete store of Smith but it also tells the changing history of the Mormons."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I find it amazing that so many praise atheist Fawn M. Brodie's anti-Mormon screed and assume that it is well-researched and well-documented. A reader (not even an historian) cannot know how well-researched and documented a book is without, first, doing his/her own research and carefully checking the documentation. Brodie picked and chose her sources, which means that her book was highly slanted. In 1946, BYU professor, Hugh Nibley, briefly critiqued Brodie in a booklet, \\"No, Ma'am, That's Not History.\\" He wrote, \\"Brodie begins her study with the observation that though there is no lack of documents for the history of Joseph Smith, these documents are 'fiercely contradictory.' In that case, it is necessary for a writer to pick and choose his evidence. Now, by the simple process of picking and choosing one's evidence, one may prove absolutely anything. For which reason it is important to ask what principle Mrs. Brodie follows in making her choice. This is not hard to discover. [She] first makes up her mind about Joseph Smith and then proceeds to accept any and all evidence, from whatever source, that supports her theory. The uncritical acceptance of evidence from all sources gives her work at first glance an air of great impartiality. At the same time, she rejects any and all evidence, from whatever source, that refutes her settled ideas.\\"In other words, the lady was 'out to get' Joseph Smith. Nibley's critique is very brief, not the book-long review that Brodie's book deserved. Years later, Nibley provided this update referring to his original pamphlet:\\"When the writer [referring to himself] first read Mrs. Brodie's book 13 years ago he was struck by the brazen inconsistencies that swarm in its pages, and so wrote this hasty review. At that time he had no means of knowing that inconsistency was the least of the author's vices, and assumed with other reviewers that when she cited a work in her footnotes, she had actually read it, that when she quoted she was quoting correctly, and that she was familiar with the works in her bibliography. Only when other investigations led the reviewer to the same sources in ensuing years did the extent of Mrs. Brodie's irresponsibility become apparent. While a large book could (and probably should) be devoted to this remarkable monument of biographical mendacity . . . more than a decade of research abetted by correspondence with Mrs. Brodie's defenders has failed to discredit a single observation made in our 1946 review. . . .\\"Most readers probably won't realize that Fawn M. Brodie's book, published in 1945, is very much outdated. The more recent book, \\"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling,\\" written by historian Richard L. Bushman and published in 2005, is vastly superior to hers, both in research and comprehensiveness, and uses the scholarship accrued since her publication. Bushman's book is available on Amazon.com.Actually, Brodie's book didn't need but one page. All she needed to write was that she was an avowed atheist and therefore Joseph Smith could not possibly have been a prophet of God, because there is no God. Therefore he was a fraud - an impostor. Her atheist glasses colored every page of her book.It is unfortunate that she didn't take the time to write a book about Moses who also claimed to have talked with God, and Jesus who claimed to be the Son of God. She could have exposed them, both, proving them to be charlatans and frauds by reading their minds.On the positive side, Brodie was an interesting writer with truly excellent writing skills."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"When reviewing a critical biography, it helps to know who the author is. Ms. Brodie is a disgruntled niece of former Mormon Church president David O. McKay. What better way to attempt to tarnish the family name than to smear the name of the prophet that founded the Church your uncle led?Well, Ms. Brodie's book has been discredited by far more knowledgable scholars like Hugh Nibley, among others. If you like Mormon fiction, this is your book. If you want facts, look elswehere."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Allright, I usually don't write reviews but when I read this book I have never been so upset in my life. I hope when people want to find out something about Joseph Smith that they don't look at this blasphemous book. It is put across as an objective book but page after page and chapter after chapter Joseph Smith is made to look like a charlatan in every sense of the word. He's blasted for everything and it sounds like a very embittered person such as this woman who wrote this sorry excuse for a biography on the Mormon Prophet. Don't waste your time because there are other sources out there that one can find something about Joseph Smith that is more fair. If this was meant as an agenda to discredit the Prophet and the Church then the word objective shouldn't even be used. I tell you what if you want to get a bad view of Joseph Smith and the LDS Church then go ahead and read this piece of trash. I have been a member of the Church all my life and I have never heard of such a heartless, unforgiving portrayal of the Prophet than I have heard in this book. Watch the excellent documentary &quot;American Prophet&quot; or read Truman G. Madsen's book on the life of Joseph Smith. Sure Joseph Smith had faults but I know for a fact that he did not make up the Book of Mormon and that it was divinely inspired of God. He was a simple farm boy who had a fantastic experience. He was not a mythmaker and no fake but probably one of the most fascinating individuals ever to grace History. He was faithful to one woman and that was Emma Hale. Please if you are searching for an objective viewpoint of Joseph Smith don't read this fallacious, lying, deceitful book because 90 % of it is not true."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"It's fun and easy to scorn the Mormons - they never seem to want to put up a good fight back. I hope that anyone who proclaims oneself a true saint isn't in these ranks. This is a lot of beefed up bigotry disguised as objective reasoning - chucked full of conundrums that go unnoticed by those who love a lazy argument. It seems there is more history written on Joseph Smith's \\"scandals\\" than there is on all the scandals of all the presidents of the U.S. combined. I sincerely hope that those who are making the choice to criticize Joseph are enjoying themselves, and having a lot of fun while they can. Or, maybe it's just a perverted attempt to alleviate whatever cognitive dissonance they harbor inside of them. I don't know why they do it.Truthfully, I could destory every other religion I've come across with a five-second question, but I choose not to. To bash other's reasons to believe is neither productive, nor is it what the Savior taught. Shame Shame (especially if you are an author esteemed as a \\"former member\\".

The names, places and events in the pre-civil war era were fascinating"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Well I finally finished this book. This is not a book a reader will finish in a short time. Overall the book is extraordinary and certainly was revolutionary in its time.Joseph Smith was a very deceitful con artist but at the same time a very fascinating historical figure to study. It takes quite a charismatic man to have such power over other men, that men willingly let Joseph Smith \\"marry\\" their wives, and then they themseleves take the wives back again after they've had sex with their \\"prophet.\\"And poor little teen-age girls became plural wives to Joseph Smith because Smith convinced them it was their only guarantee to eternal salvation for them and their families. And of course the list of other facts about Joseph Smith that the Mormon church wishes no one knew about is extensive!Surely the Mormon church only made themselves look rediculous when they ex-communicated Brodie, as well as other authors whose only crime was telling the truth about history. Joseph Smith was an American who ran for president of the United States and who started an American born religion - he is a man who will be researched and history books will be written about him, regardless of how much the Mormon church dislikes this.And as American and patriotic and politically correct the Mormon church tries to be, they are very un-American to practice excommunication on its members who are only exercising their freedom of speech. But I'm sure Brodie and all the others didn't care about getting ex-communicated from an organization that is so weird and false. It's just a shame that the Mormon religion is so entrapping and makes it so difficult for its brain-washed members to discover the truth.Fascinating book!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Brodie's book is fantastic, and I can't believe it's taken me so many years to get around to reading it. I've read so much heavily edited history--produced by the church. Even when reading it, you can tell there are major omissions. No Man Knows My History fills in the gaps and stands as an excellent, well researched biography of Joseph Smith. The Mormon church is shown to be founded by an uneducated, charismatic loafer.The book starts by demonstrating that Joseph Smith and his father never wanted to really work hard for a living. Joseph ran around telling other people where to dig for buried treasure, even after his supposed first vision. Even though this was ridiculous and deceitful, Joe learned that people were drawn to his magnetic personality--he realized he could make things up and not have to work for a living. He invented a largely boring adventure story so he could have a nidus for his new religion; and hopefully, the proceeds might help his father get out of debt.Joseph would get adulation, money, land, unearned respect, and sexual gratification from many people over his short career before being gunned down by an angry mob. Fawn Brodie does a wonderful job of scrupulously citing her many sources! Those who wring their hands at the truth her biography brings to light should also note that many, if not most, of her quotes are from History of the Church.Leaders of the LDS church exhort its members not to read anything that speaks against doctrines or major members of the church. Though much of what disenfranchised or anti-Mormons say must be taken with a grain of salt, not all of it should be discarded.There are so, so many anti-Mormon writers--and even in Smith's day, books were being written against him, the Book of Mormon, and his church. There is a simple reason for this--he was a fraud. While subtracting some of the venom from these documents, it is clear that Joseph Smith didn't pay his debts (and probably never intended to), seduced teens, lied about fantastical visions and translating abilities, and belittled his wife. No one can read this accurate biography of Smith and believe in the church he founded. He took from others to make his life rich and fun--it caught up with him in tarrings and featherings, jailings and arrests, but these were small pains indeed when a bevy of women were anxiously hoping he'd choose their house to spend the night.Brodie should have won a Pulitzer for No Man Knows My History. Over time, and as more information has become available from historical research, none of Brodie's major conclusions can be tarnished. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is highly readable, compelling, and fascinating. It takes a subject--Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church--that has been written about by countless different people with countless different viewpoints, and makes it into a gripping narrative that will make you turn its pages as fast as you can read them.But this is hardly a history book. While it may profess to untangle the mess of contradictory literature produced by Mormons, Non-Mormons, and \\"Anti-Mormons,\\" all it really does is tangle that mess up a little more.The book is well researched and contains extensive footnotes and easy-to-read appendices, but the conclusions drawn by that research use a very, very questionable methodology. Where Fawn Brodie has a historical Point A and a Point B, she feels no qualms creatively filling in the spaces between them.For instance, she writes that as Joseph Smith concluded writing the Mormon scripture \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" he became troubled that the book dealt only with the ancient \\"Nephite\\" people from 600 B.C. to A.D. 400, and wanted to pay some attention to the then-contemporary speculation that people had immigrated to the Americas after the fall of the biblical Tower of Babel and then dispersed there into different tribes. \\"At any rate,\\" she says, \\"he was impressed with the probability of the 'dispersionist' thesis, for in the last weeks of writing he dictated a terse little history of a people called the Jaredites, which he appended to the Nephite record.\\"Here she has Point A--that there was speculation about the origin of America's early people--and Point B--that the last chapter of the Book of Mormon professes to be about a group of America's earlier inhabitants--but everything in the middle is total conjecture. A complete guess. A theory. It would be fine if she presented it all as such, but here it's presented matter-of-factly, as history. As undeniable truth. Stephen Ambrose, a real historian, would have probably laughed in her face about this sort of thing.The book has a lot of problems like this. It makes a ton of suppositions, and often considers a source valid when it supports her ideas of the way things were, but then renounces those exact same sources when they say something she disagrees with. It's not a perfect read, but still, things do make themselves evident that will probably make most Mormons uncomfortable, but that are hard to deny due to how many different sources back them up. I think every Mormon should read it, just to counter the neutered faith-promoting histories that are generally accepted without question within their faith, but it should still be read with a shaker full of salt. And I think anyone else that reads it should read something else to counterbalance this--either Hugh Nibley's imperfect but insightful \\"No Ma'am That's Not History,\\" or the more recent \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History.\\"...Because this is certainly NOT the last word on the subject."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Having been raised to see Joseph Smith as something just short of a God, many members of the LDS church are quite surprised to read the realities of the Joseph Smith story; the natural reaction is, as has been demonstrated in previous reviews, to lump Brodie in the &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; author category and defend the foundations of their faith. Interestingly enough, Brodie was still in full fellowship with the Church at the time of the book's publication, seriously dampening the &quot;anti-mo&quot; theory.Proven time and again in the decades since the publication of &quot;No Man Knows...&quot; is the veracity of Brodie's sources and research. One simply has to thumb through the pages of sources at the end of the book to appreciate how exhaustive Ms. Brodie's research was. Not only does she utilize and cite &quot;objective,&quot; non-mormon sources, but there are a number of quotes taken from church sponsored writings, i.e. _History of the Church_.As a former missionary for the church, I appreciated Ms. Brodie's own objectivity in her writing of _No Man..._. So often the material members of the LDS Church are presented with is so slanted and negative. Ms. Brodie frequently points out Joseph's intelligence, passion, and creativity. Ultimately, Ms. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith feels sympathetic towards the prophet's weaknesses and his sincere desire and urge to be a prophetic holy man.Ms. Brodie makes sense of questions that have long troubled members of the Mormon church, such as polygamy, the causes of Joseph's final incarceration at Carthage, and the continual rotation of early church leaders. In fact, I found Ms. Brodie's hypothesis on the foundations of polygamy far more satisfactory and sensible than any I have ever heard in my 23 years in the church.Though certainly not recommended for the conservative, nonquestioning member of the LDS church, this book will provide an invaluable look at the most prominent character in all Mormonism for those with an interest in the Prophet and his vision."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Wanting to know more about the history of Mormonism, I thought the obvious place to start was at the source - Joseph Smith. There are several bios, but I wanted to avoid hagiography, and so shied away from ones by church members.This bio dates from the 1940s, with a later revision in the '60's, I think. The author was a U Cal historian of good reputation. I appreciate most that she is scrupulous in not taking sides despite the problematic nature of her subject. That's especially important, I think, since Joseph Smith appears to have relished being difficult to describe.I have not finished reading but am pleased with the first few chapters, and will add to this when I've done."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I picked up No Man Knows My History because I like Fawn Brodie's work. It's not an attack on Mormonism. It's not an attack on Joseph Smith. If anything I was struck by the sympathetic portrayal of Smith and his followers. Fawn Brodie doesn't appear to enjoy writing unsavory things about her subject. I'd say the book is a fair and accurate one. The writing is so enjoyable. Brodie wrote nonfiction with a fiction author's flair. I picked it up at nine in the morning and kept coming back to it until I'd finnished it at around midnight."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I was somewhat reluctant to pick this book up, as biographies tend to put me to sleep. However, Ms. Brodie's work is without doubt the best biograpy I have read. Her subject, the Mormon founder Joseph Smith, is presented from his infancy up to the time of his death, with the social and political background also covered, and it makes fascinating reading.Ms. Brodie leaves the reader with the impresison that Smith was a con-artist of the highest order, who dreamt up supposed \\"revelatons\\" (\\"thus saith the Lord\\") at will, and I found myself saying \\"this guy can't have had the nerve to do what he did\\". In spite of his deception, the reader can't dislike the character. But it is also made quite clear that Joseph Smith, with all his personal charisma, was certainly no \\"prophet of God\\". He was a first-rate deceiver. The story Fawn Brodie writes reads as an adventure tale of a colorful conman who, sadly, met his end before he mended his ways.Verdict: don't be put off by the fact it's a biography. It's an enthraling read. Especially recommended to LDS readers, who will find out a bit about Smith they won't have known before."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This is the definative Joseph Smith autobiography, Brodie is famous for the portraits of men of power and Joseph Smith is far more interesting then Richard Nixon. Brodie really is viewed as an absolute evil in the Mormon church, there is no doubt about that, I remember hearing her name sworn at long before I ever heard of the book. Arguing about religion is a long and no-way street, one can only enjoy the book as a great introduction to the most interesting part of American history. The book reads like a charm and is really entertaining, and regardless of that entertainment value- Brodie has you wondering what is to be believed from her sources, and she certainly succeeded in luring me in to Mormon History, after four years of continual reading, still not able to reach conclusions about Polygamy and the nature of the early Mormon church. These questions Brodie raises throughout her book. I didn't give the book a five star rating simply because I am really annoyed when the author tells us what Joseph Smith was thinking, on the basis of her Freudian analysis. I really don't buy it, and honestly don't know what place that technique has in legitimate history.I recommend this book to those who are willing to keep reading."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Wow! I was really impressed with this book. I only THOUGHT I understood Mormonism!This book traces the beginnings of Joseph Smiths creation, from his beginnings in upstate New York, to his lynching in Carthage, Illinois. The author has researched her subject meticulously, as evident by the bibliography. Many early Mormon writings are quoted, including letters from Joseph Smith himself.After reading this book, I can better understand how people could be deceived into believing the Book of Mormon and other Mormon writings. It is clearer now how Mormonism got a foothold in America--it was birthed into a sub-culture filled with people who, while professing Christianity, really had little understanding of the Word of God, thus could be duped quite easliy. (This by the way, is how Mormonism maintains its grasp today.)I don't care how many other books you've read on Mormonism, or how much you think you know about the subject; you need to read this book.By the way, the author does not &quot;slam&quot; Joseph Smith (or his followers). On the contrary, she seems to have quite a bit of respect for him and what he became."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is appropriately titled because it give a side of the story that is seldom heard within the Mormon religion. Unfortunately, that is also it's only drawback. Brody gives much of the \\"negative\\" information while minimizing the many characteristics that made Joseph Smith such a charismatic and popular figure. It is good that people have a place to learn about Joseph's deceitful living as a youth, the real history behind the Book of Mormon, and his philandering with married women while prophet; but the biography would be much more powerful if it included a more balanced presentation of his strengths, also.Despite the slant against Joseph Smith, this book is excellent. Brody has done thorough and well-documented research and has written in a style that makes this book a pleasureable read. It is a must for anyone interested in American, Western, or Mormon history. However, this is probably not the book that a practicing Mormon who is happy with their faith should read."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Without question, Fawn Brodie has produced a masterwork of religious history with this volume. I have been passionately interested in Latter-day Saint history and theology for several years, and feel it would be improper to formulate an opinion of Joseph Smith without consulting this work. Her conclusions will, of course, be attacked by members of the Latter-day Saint faith, but I would hope you would read it and form your own opinion.It's well-written, using a style that is both authoritative and approachable, well-paced and well-thought out. Please don't number me as an opponent of the Saints; I simply investigated their theology as part of a personal quest and found difficulties with it. Certainly, you should read more than one work dealing with subject, and make up your mind accordingly.Make sure, however, that this is a cornerstone of your search-I believe you will find it well worth your efforts."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Brodie's work is the starting point for scholars who want to understand the evolution of thinking about Jos Smith. Even the latest work by Bushman owes her a debt of gratitude. Two excellent and carefully crafted refutations of parts of her work were written by Hugh Nibley and Marvin Hill both BYU professors at one time or another. Although a polemic, she does exonerate the Mormon prophet from an age old controversy. Smith had been accused of plagiarizing the Book of Mormon from a manuscript of Samuel Spaulding. Brodie is the first to demolish such an assertion. For that alone it is worth a read.Nevertheless, Brodie, who took a psychoanalytical approach to her biographical subjects often stretched her sources beyond the breaking point. Yet, although psychoanalytic (psycho-history) approaches to biography are out of favor among mainstream historians, she cannot simply be discounted because of her controversial methods. Brodie demonstrates the best and worst of the approach. You can dislike her methodology, but her works cannot be ignored. Some absolutely hated her work on Jefferson and Nixon for taking such an approach.There is a lesson for true believerss who feel threatened by Smith's biography--History is not a discipline one bases his or faith upon."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I read this book while living in Idaho in the 60s.

The book is far from perfect, but don't take a Mormon's word for it when they claim that, &quot;She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas&quot;. Although this statement may be partially true, the reality is that the conclusions of those who objectively study Joseph Smith are very different from those of true believing Mormons who &quot;tend to ignore information and resources that don't support their preconceived ideas&quot;.

I have read many reviews of this great book calling it tripe and that it is a rag written by a someone with an axe to grind. Sorry, but if you read, REALLY read this book, then you will see that it was not put together on a whim and that it was footnoted and researched to the nth degree. The only reason that this book gets negative reviews is that the people reading it giving those reviews do not WANT to accept the truth and want to keep their minds closed. I have not seen one valid argument from an opponent of this book other than to say it is trash and is full of lies and half-truths. Well, back those statements up with facts as Ms. Brodie has done in her wonderful book. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to people wishing to know the truth about the birth of Mormonism. Don't take my word for it though, read it through and make your own judgement, but I think you will see that at a a time when America was gullible and open to new religions, Joseph Smith took advantage of that and preyed on the minds of those people and many an individual, myself included, have been lured into it since that time."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This is a good book for anyone looking for a historical understanding of Joseph Smith.

I got exactly that. It wasn't a real page turner though. In fact, I had to force myself to continue reading it about half way through.Mrs Brodie seems to have done a lot of research and presents it pretty well. There were a couple of instances where I thought she was reaching a bit, but she indicated herself that these instances were only theories, or possibilites, so in that regard I have to give her a lot of credit. These instances were also very trivial matters, in my opinion. The more substantial claims, such as the \\"translation\\" of the plates, and the polygamy can be verified through LDS sources, and are much more damaging to the church's credibility than this book could ever be.In fairness, I attempted to read \\"No Ma'am, that's not history\\" by Hugh Nibley. I say \\"attempted\\", because like most apologists, Mr Nibley seems to dance around issues rather than addressing them directly. I got tired of waiting for him to make a point and quit reading.In conclusion, if you want to learn about Joseph Smith, and read a very credible explaination for the circumstances regarding the foundation of the LDS church, read this book."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"This book is considered anti-mormon by many but reading it I didn't feel that way. I felt it was very comprehensive. Many say that her sources are distorted to produce a negative image.

In this book, Ms. Brodie includes not just quotes from Joseph Smith and his followers, but also three appendixes full of reproductions of nineteenth century documents dealing with the life and court record of Smith. Ms. Brodie also manages to make it a very interesting book, in spite of the fact that there are more names and dates contained in it than any average history book. (Proof, I suppose, of the author's exhaustive research.) The book is not completely objective; it takes the viewpoint of the skeptic investigating the Mormon Church (she even includes quotes by Mark Twain regarding the Mormons!) This biography is essential reading for the person interested in the LDS Church, as well as LDS members.

If she were writing today, however, Brodie's book would be twice as long because so much new information has come to light--especially about Joseph Smith's involvement in magic. See D. Michael Quinn's massively documented, yet very readable, \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View.\\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World ViewLike Brodie, Quinn was excommunicated for telling the truth about Joseph Smith.You know that Fawn Brodie has come a long way when even Mormons can praise it. In \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism,\\" the distinguished Mormon historian Richard Bushman wrote:\\"As notable for its journalistic brilliance as for its scholarship, \`No Man Knows My History' presented Riley's arguments and findings in a form more palatable to twentieth-century tastes\\" (p. 191).The critics of Brodie have also failed. In \\"Critiquing the Critics,\\" Haart Wixom (p. 120-121) writes the following about an article Brodie quoted from the \\"St. Louis Bulletin\\" about Martha Brotherton who left polygamy. It \\"appears Brodie made up at least part, if not all, of the Brotherton story. Whether she knowingly gave a wrong reference or not, it is nevertheless bogus.\\"Just previously, Wixom condescendingly refers to Brodie as \\"the woman,\\" and he denies that the newspaper even existed. It does exist.Actually the name of the newspaper is the \\"American Bulletin,\\" published in St. Louis--a minor error on Brodie's part, and one that I discovered in two minutes of research on the Internet.The article describes the methods used at Nauvoo by early Mormons, including Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, to get young women to marry them (Smith married a daughter and then her mother--Patty and Silvia Sessions; Young two sisters).In another case, Wixom erroneously writes: \\"She (Brodie) says Joseph probably got his idea for a higher priesthood from a book written by James Gray, giving no title or footnotes\\" (p. 177). On the contrary, Gray's book is footnoted on page 111 of Brodie's book. Nevertheless, this is an odd criticism for Wixom to make because he doesn't mention the title of Gray's book. The title is easy to find. Just google \\"James Gray, Melchesedec.\\"Brodie wrote: \\"It seems likely that Joseph that Joseph concept of duel priesthood came directly from James Gray's \`Dissertation on the Coincidence between the Priesthoods of Jesus Christ and Melchisedec' (Philadelphia, 1810). Her comment is reasonable: it does seem \\"likely.\\" The title of Gray's book will catch the eye of anyone familiar with Mormonism.My criticism would be that Brodie could have made a stronger case by putting the name of Gray's book in the text rather than in a footnote. She also could have quoted from Gray's 121 page pamphlet-book. In just an hour of reading, an intelligent person would have a complete scriptural justification for the Melchisedec priesthood in a church--not just an idea for the Melchisedec priesthood, but detailed justification.I would say this in criticism of Brodie. She completely dismisses the Spalding theory. While I believe that Brodie is correct in saying that Joseph Smith composed the Book of Mormon himself, the similarities of the plot elements in \\"Manuscript Found\\" are troubling. They insure that Solomon Spalding's ghost will never rest.It seems possible that Joseph Smith could have heard about Spalding's story without actually having seen it. Thus, it could have had an influence on Joseph Smith.Nevertheless, here are the plot elements of \\"Manuscript Found\\" compared to those of the Book of Mormon (plot elements never listed by Mormon writers for fear of opening a can of worms--Brodie did not list them either).In about 1812, the Reverend Solomon Spalding wrote a novel about two races in ancient America. Spalding lived in Connecut, Ohio, less than 200 miles from Palmyra (on the Great Lake's trade route, so traveler could have told Joseph Smith about Spalding's story).Spalding described an ancient American civilization in as much detail as is found in the Book of Mormon (1830). Spalding even read passages of his novel to his congregation (thus insuring that it was spread far and wide).So we have two stories, each purporting to be a history, and each featuring a \\"translator,\\" who finds an ancient account of a lost white American civilization.In each story, the civilization is described in detail, including its laws, religion, priests, money system, tools, animals, agricultural products, as well as a magical seer stone possessed by its prophets. Letters are exchanged between leaders (the Book of Mormon has \\"epistles\\"), \\"Censors\\" are the rulers (\\"Judges\\" in the Book of Mormon), and lists of generals are given for armies of tens of thousands.The dead from great battles are heaped up in mounds (false explanations for the orderly Indian burial mounds of real history). In both works, the white race has continuous wars with a darker-skinned race, but hundreds of years of peace are established by a great teacher (\\"Bosaka\\" in \\"Manuscript Found\\" and Christ in the Book of Mormon).This extraordinarily long period of peace ends in a battle near a hill. In this last battle in which the white race is exterminated, there is an incident in which a man is beheaded in a sword fight.Each account also claims that the ancient Americans possessed the modern knowledge that the earth rotates around the sun, rather than vise verse. Both stories feature an item of technology consistent with the 1800s, rather than thousands of years ago. The Book of Mormon has submarines; the American Robert Fulton built his famous Nautilus in 1800; Spalding's story has a hot-air balloon (note the famous French balloon flights of the 1780s). These hot technologies of the day were story elements of the newly-born American literature. Spalding and Smith were perhaps the first American writers to include them in a novel.There are other coincidences. The world's first reconstructed mammoth skeleton, \\"the ninth wonder of the world,\\" went on display in Philadelphia in 1802, and coincidentally \\"elephants\\" are found in the Book of Mormon (1830) and \\"mamoons\\" in \\"Manuscript Found\\" (1812).One would think that the plot elements of the two stories would at least be discussed by Mormon writers out to disprove the Spalding Theory. But no, they shift the focus to how did Joseph Smith come to read Spalding's manuscript? Some critics said that the link between the stories was Syndey Rigdon, the first major convert to Mormonism. Rigdon had lived in Pittsburg and was known at the printshop where Spalding sent his manuscript.Although I believe that Joseph Smith was the author of the Book of Mormon, the \\"Pittsburgh coincidence\\" has never set well with me. Like a detective investigating an unsolved murder, the possibility that Smith in some way borrowed from Spalding story will never be laid to rest.Curiously, one Mormon writer in criticising the Spalding Theory said there are \\"no complex Chiasms appear in MS (Manuscript Found).\\" See \\"Refuting the Critics: Evidences of the Book of Mormon's Authenticity,\\" by Michael Griffith, p. 81. Griffith's statement is an admission that \\"chiamus\\" (parallelisms in Hebrew poetry) were around in 1812. They have been pointed out by proponents of the Spalding Theory. See my review of \\"By the Hand of Mormon,\\" by Terryl L. Givens. Click here:By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World ReligionRobert Silverberg in the \\"Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth\\" is dispassionate about these similarities of plot elements to those of the Book of Mormon. \\"Neutral observers,\\" he writes, \\"generally suggest the possibility that both works drew their inspiration from the fund of Mound Builder legends then in circulation, leaving aside the question of possible borrowing by Smith from Spaulding\\" (p. 96).Silverberg's book is a must-read for anyone interested in the world of Joseph Smith and the great Mound Builder myth.

An excellent book from someone who experienced the religion first hand."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"If there had been no Fawn Brodie, Mormons would probably have had to invent her. Ever since she published \\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet\\" in 1945, calling into serious question most of the faith claims based on Mormonism's early history, an enormous amount of energy has been expended by Mormon historians, apologists, and critics of all backgrounds and persuasions either to defend or to deny her conclusions. The themes explored by Mormon historians since that time have often responded to Brodie's analysis.When Brodie published \\"No Man Knows My History\\" in 1945, she analyzed Mormonism's founder using the standards of secular scholarship. She interpreted him as a charlatan at first motivated by self-serving desires but gradually coming to believe in his own prophetic mission. She also acknowledged his very real accomplishments in forming an important religious movement in the United States. In many ways it was a seminal study that served as a transition point between what has been inaccurately called the old and the new Mormon history, the \\"old\\" generally viewed as polemical while the \\"new\\" was considered less concerned with questions of religious truth and more interested in understanding why events unfolded as they did. It is a measure of the success of her biography of Smith that it is still considered more than fifty years later the standard work on the subject and the starting point for all analyses of Mormonism. A second edition of this book, published in 1971, revised some of her earlier conclusions, especially her contention that Smith had been a charlatan, and incorporated recent trends from psychohistory to explain him more as a self-deluded imposter.Brodie, perhaps intentionally, dealt a damaging blow to many of the Mormon foundational beliefs when she questioned most of the basic assumptions about Mormon origins in her biography of Joseph Smith. In \\"No Man Knows My History\\" she systematically dealt with five basic issues that have challenged Mormon historians ever since. One of the most important was Joseph Smith's \\"First Vision,\\" for which she emphatically denied that there was any valid evidence until Smith fabricated it in 1838 when he began dictating his history to provide a starting point for his prophetic career that would counter charges that he was involved in treasure seeking. A second was the whole issue of treasure seeking itself and its relationship both to Smith and Mormon origins. Third, Brodie questioned the origins and content of the Book of Mormon, asserting that it was a product of Joseph Smith's vivid imagination and not an actual history of any group of people who came to America. Fourth, she explored in depth the origins of plural marriage and the duplicity Smith registered in originating it to justify what she thought was his licentious nature. Finally, Brodie interpreted Smith as a would-be tyrant seeking to take over some or all of the territory of the United States to create his own theocratic state with himself in charge.She provides an in depth analysis of each of these themes in her biography of Smith, and those perspectives still hold a powerful sway over Mormon historiography. One cannot begin to understand the development of the Mormon religion without grappling with the issues raised by Fawn Brodie."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"I don't know how any knowledgeable, educated person can read this book and not conclude that Joseph Smith was a fraud who pulled off a whopper of a scam.

I'm a former Mormon who found this book to be an eye-opener."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"As a non-Morman living in Utah, I am often confronted with Mormon rhetoric. One hears propoganda about the religion and, without the knowledge base, one can't help but believe what many Mormons are so earnest about...their religion. However, after reading Brodie's book, I am now armed with questions, facts and details that refute what Mormon's are raised to believe. What I can't understand is how so many Mormon's refuse to read this factual, well-documented history of the man they basically worship? If they don't buy into Brodie's actual words, why don't they dig through the references she readily supplies? I am so intrigued that a man of such proposterous ethics can create such a following? And, how can so many truly intelligent Mormons not question the integrity of this man and this religion? This book is very, very insightful."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"Like all good history, this book's chief aim is simply to provide the evidence as best as it can while leaving readers to their own conclusions.To the over twenty million Mormon faithful, Brodie readily concedes that Joseph Smith gave birth to a religion that now spans the globe, spreading word of its good news.And to the \\"gentile\\" non Mormons, this book asks by its history the very pointed question of how such a religion could have come to be and survived its not inconsiderable obstacles were it not ordained of God.For my part, all the history relating to Joseph Smith's all too human frailities...his 1826 conviction for disorderly conduct (essentially a fraud charge), his sometimes contradictory revelations from above and of course his documented plural marriages...do not cast him and his movement in a light less than other religions but rather reminiscent of them.In rallying against those who would do violence to Mormons I was reminded of Old Testament vitriol against nonbelievers. In practicing (if not necessarily espousing) plural marriage I was reminded of course of that other prophet Mohammed. And of course, with with reference to its historical tendency to bring all too Earthly suffering to those for whom it sought to give eternal deliverance, I was reminded of all religion.While Brodie's book for its part enigmatically refuses to answer that ultimate question of the verite of Joseph Smith's prophetic status, a careful reading of it does suggest perhaps his limitations are one with all religion.And as long as our celestial witnesses are human, we will be left seeing that great eternity through only the limitations of their refracted mortal gaze."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My History: the Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet","review":"The last US Presidential elections came and went. President Obama won a re-election, the Republican contender, Mitt Romney, lost. Mitt is a Mormon and this would be one of the books he could have banned if he were the President. This book reveals the true story behind the man who created American's biggest corporate cult that poses as a \\"religion\\", successfully usurped an entire US state, and whose members have no qualms investing in vice to enrich themselves.This classic biography of the insane founder of Mormonism takes you behind the scenes of a disturbed man, who spent his time dabbling in the dark with peep stones, communication with ghosts and spirits who led him to treasures. The founding of a new American religion grew out of Mr. Smith's wild imaginations and charismatic personality, so prevalent in Protestantism.Mormonism is just another off-shoot of Protestantism, holding the same principles, and changing them as the times see fit. Their self-declared prophets talk like elementary school children, with absolutely no depth in theological knowledge. Then again, what can you expect from a Prot by-product that creates a god out of their fantasies. Oh, do remember to contribute at least 10% of your monthly income to your local \\"church\\", no wait, Mormons don't have a church, they've a stake house that doesn't even display a decent cross in sight!Now, how many wives can I now legally have if I were a reformed or fundamentalist Mormon? Once upon a time, Mormon men could marry multiple women, they changed that view not because they received a coded message from God, but because their cult wanted to survive for another generation and had to play by decent moral codes of conduct. Once upon a time, Mormons were totally racists, accepting only blue eyed blondes (and some brunettes), now they just had to change that Nazi \\"theology\\" so that they can swindle more money from non-Americans to enlarge their Utah corporation. So very Protestant in nature!When Mormons can't give a logical explanation to their \\"theology\\", worldview and history, they resort to FEELINGS as a vindication of their \\"truth\\". What a form of Prot escapism, often seen in Prot cults and sects. They can't think or reason in a coherent fashion and when they can't answer questions, always resort to violence or feelings as proof of their \\"truths\\".How can 14+ MILLION adherents of Mormonism be do DUMB as to believe in a cult whose founder founded his new religion on personal lusts for women, ghostly spectres and a mishmash of Protestantism?

A long time ago, that was. It's so wordy and descriptive and sparkling with life and vitality, too. So I'm going to try to do this book more justice, now that I've had more practise writing reviews.I believe this book is the fullest of tragedy and melodrama of the five in the series, and at the time I wrote that other review it was my favourite book of all. When I think of this book, I think primarily of Morgan, Finola, and the rest of the clan in Dublin, because most of the action really takes place there. Occasionally you cut back to New York City for a dose of Nora's, &quot;When am I ever going to have a baby, sweetheart?&quot; or &quot;Sara, darling, you will take down your hair just for me!&quot; It must be that I didn't read the New York episodes as often and they aren't implanted in my mind as the Dublin ones are.In New York, Nora is married, Michael is engaged, and Tierney is working for a crime boss. In Dublin, Morgan is still trapped in the wheelchair. There is no miracle cure here, unfortunately. A Nun (capital N) named Sis. Louisa and a wolfhound named Fergus join the staff at Nelson Hall. Finola becomes the victim of unfortunate circumstances in the red light district and is brought to live at Morgan's house while she recovers, and her &quot;wicked woman&quot; friend Lucy comes along. I think somebody dies too, but I won't say who. Oh, and I think Nora finally was going to have a baby, too. Sandemon's deep, dark past is uncovered, Aine waits patiently to be adopted by Morgan, and so forth and so on. I love the part when there IS a miracle cure - not for Morgan, but for Finola - when she can suddenly talk again. It is a very incredible scene, perhaps a bit unrealistic, but perfect for fifteen or sixteen year old girls who dote on that kind of romantic dramatisation and swoon over it with their friends.I shall say no more of the wonders between the front and back covers of this book.

Whatever....This is clearly a newbie, offering insight to other newbies. Anybody even remotely acquainted with Korean Cinema won't need this collection of average review from somebody who clearly has only started watching Korean Cinema in the last few years.There's no real information, just a patchwork of IMDB info and other snippets from sites. Ask anything about pre-99 Korean Cinema to the guy, and he wouldn't know squat.A few advices to mr. Leong, for his next project:1) Learn Korean. Are you basing your review on English Subtitles? Most of them are really bad.2) Learn about Korean Culture. You can't possibly comment on any social or cultural practice in Korea if you don't know squat about it. This shows pretty heavily in most of your reviews.3) Study the history of Korean Cinema. Most of your reviews are average forum material. No real insight into the filmmakers' styles and their position in the industry. Good magazines to start are Cine 21, Film 2.0 and NKino. Of course, they're in Korean...4) Stop trying to compare everything to Hollywood and other Asian movies. Korean Cinema has a clear identity of its own, one you clearly can't grasp yet.5) Study a bit the Korean entertainment scene. Watch TV Dramas, listen to some music. Inform yourself.For an introduction to K-cinema, it's barely OK.

As a result, it is very accessible to the average reader and provides a good basis for understanding the underpinnings of the growing success of South Korea's film industry.The book is comprised of two distinct parts. The opening chapters provide some background on South Korea and the current state of its film industry, and though this may be something that some readers may wish to skip, it provides context for readers in understanding what makes Korean films special. Also, the author's style keeps the read light and interesting, so it is actually fun to read.The second part consists of a number of reviews (I counted at least 80) of recent Korean films grouped by genre. One thing I liked about the author is his digressions into related topics in his reviews, such as how he discusses the alternate history genre in science fiction in his review of 2009 Lost Memories, or how he dabbles in guerrilla journalism in taking apart less-than-worthy films.Whether you have developed an interest in Korean film or have been watching them for a few years, this book is an excellent companion and will help you build your DVD collection. For the author, I would suggest that he think about expanding the book in the future to include interviews with some Korean filmmakers and add more reviews (with the number of Korean films being released on DVD growing day by day)."},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"It's about time that someone wrote a book about Korean cinema from recent years. Up until now, the only books available were about films before the early 90s and read more like textbooks. Korean Cinema is an easy read and has a good balance between insight and irreverence, such as how the author makes a parallel between Korea right now and Hong Kong ten years ago, his thoughts on all those time travel romances, and how he shreds absolutely horrible movies like Dream of a Warrior to pieces. This one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"I received this for Christmas from my boyfriend and read it from cover to cover by New Years: its that good.

My first Korean DVD purchases were Shiri and JSA, which I brought more for novelty and and as a momento of Korea than anything else, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised at the production values of both these movies. As a result, I have become a firm fan of Korean movies, and have added a number of titles to my DVD collection. This book will help me select some more good titles to add to the collection.\\"Korean Cinema\\" fulfills a useful niche as it is basically a primer for Korean movies from 1998 to 2002 for newcomers to Korean cinema. The author reviews and rates a number of the movies made in this time span, from \\"Attack the Gas Station\\" through to \\"2009: Lost Memories\\", plus a couple of titles a couple of years older. The author also rates and discusses 10 Korean movies from that time period which he rates as must sees. It would be a good start for building a DVD collection. There is also a section devoted to the major personalities of the Korean movie industry, actors and directors. It is illustrated but only in black and white, and many of the pictures are of poor quality.Ignore the low rating reviews of this book - the reviewers obviously brought this book expecting a serious textbook of Korean cinema, which if you actually read the advertising blurb for the book, it is most certainly not. There are books out there discussing the full history of Korean cinema, but make no mistake, this book is not one of them. It is strictly for the newcomers to the genre, and who has little knowledge of the Korean movie industry. It does have a chapter on the history of the industry in Korea, but it is only superficial, and it isn't the reason I brought the book anyway.Especially ignore the twit who is critical of the author basing his movie reviews on english subtitles. Korean is a particularly difficult language to learn and to become sufficiently competent in the language to be able to follow a Korean movie without english subtitles is beyond the abilities of all but the most dedicated of people. The author of \\"Korean Cinema\\" does make it quite clear he is only a recent convert, and thus a beginner, in Korean movies.This book would lend itself to an update every 3 or 4 years or so. There has been some considerably significant Korean movie releases since this book was first published, not least of which is \\"Tae-Guk-Gi\\". I also recommend checking out the website www.koreanfilm.org which has movie reviews, talent profiles and other useful informative articles. The author of the site, Darcy Paquet, is listed in the bibliography of \\"Korean Cinema\\" a number of times."},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"I wish I had this book a year ago.

Whether Anthony C.Y. Leong has remained so is anyone's guess as of late, but it indeed comes as a small surprise that this book was written by a regular contributor to Thomas Weisser's execrable ASIAN CULT CINEMA magazine, a publication that has done more to pigeonhole Asian cinema into one gigantic bowl of sex and sadism than any Pink-film-loving pervert could do in a lifetime.From evidence provided here, though, Leong's passion for movies (which is also evidenced via various online review portals, the style here being little better than that) is better served by self-published efforts such as this than it is sandwiched between the salacious and error-ridden pages of Weisser's rag. Weisser's ASIAN CULT CINEMA book, a late-90's reference guide to Hong Kong cinema that has disseminated more MISinformation to the world than any fifty amateur fanzines could circa 1990, is still being peddled to an unsuspecting base of newcomers (I've yet to ascertain whether Leong was a contributor, but it's likely), so it's refreshing to know that viewers curious about Korean cinema at least have a reference guide that, while not blessed with particularly great prose, is at least honest and forthight in its appreciation of its subject matter, without resorting to the cheap putdowns and mysogynist leanings of the Weisser material with which its author, perhaps unwittingly, has previously been associated.Leong is, however, WAY WAY OFF BASE in labelling Korean cinema \\"The New Hong Kong.\\" The assumption that one country's cinematic fare is so lacking in cultural identity that it stands only to supplant the fare of another country - following that all Asian cinema somehow \\"blends\\" together in the eyes of outsiders - is simplistic and ill-informed to say the least. Leong, who is Chinese, makes repeated commentary about the downfall of Hong Kong cinema while holding Korean cinema up as the natural successor to the throne. Hong Kong cinema, however, is still very much alive and kicking, and while Korean cinema has certainly enjoyed a renaissance of sorts (both domestically and internationally) since the release of the high-tech action thriller SHIRI in 1999, nearly seven years on, many Korean films are still plagued by tired concepts, poorly-plotted screenplays, crass histrionics, and various culturally-specific idosyncracies that may yet be their undoing in the international market once the demand for genre pictures has dried up (as I write this, the Korean DVD market is in a serious state of financial decline). (2007 EDIT: much of this has come to pass: Korean films are garnering fewer distribs at film festivals, and they're lucky if they get one or two breakout smashes a year; DVD sales are nearlly dead in the country. They're still making films worth watching, but the industry is in serious pain right now.However, Leong's book generally covers films from 1998 to 2002, which any Korean film fan will tell you is the period they first \\"discovered\\" Korean cinema, too. And as such, the book clearly is/was a labour of love. More scholarly books have been written on Korean cinema both before and since Leong's self-published tome, but none have ventured to simply provide straight-up reviews of the many varied films that came from this period, so depite his web-forum-worthy writing style, Leong still managed a small victory for the fanboys.. Mind you, scholarly works on Korean cinema (and Korea itself!) are virtually required reading--I strongly prefer them to a book like this--if one is to truly understand the cultural subtext running through much of modern Korean cinema. Thus, Leong's book stands as the best place to START your journey, but once you've seen the films, and if you truly want to know more, then it might be good to augment this book with a more serious cultural, cinematic or even socio-political study.The format of Leong's reviews is a bit too structurally consistent (intro-synopsis-opinion-rinse-repeat), which means they're best digested a few at a time, preferably just before of just after watching the film in question, which will at least grant the book an extended shelf life as the reader builds a Korean DVD collection. Also, the reviews are grouped into \\"categories,\\" which is restrictive, particularly as many of the films aren't so easily pigeonholed. It's a small gripe, admittedly, but straightforward alphebetical listings would be much more user-friendly.Since the book's publication at the very beginning of 2003, however, Korean cinema has produced an incredible number of feature films -ranging from derivative-but-pretty junk like MY BOYFRIEND IS TYPE B and RED EYE to international arthouse darlings like OLDBOY and TAE GUK GI - that would be well served by an update to Leong's manuscript, something which has yet to take place but would firmly cement his position as one of the few non-internet-based reviewers to tackle the subject matter in this way. One hopes that the visible reduction in his output might mean he's working on a revised version of his book, but as he's not one to return emails from interested supporters (especially those who are, at the same time, like myself, openly hostile towards his previous \\"employer,\\" Miami-based bootlegger and \\"author\\" Thomas Weisser), we may simply have to wait and see what comes next, if anything..."},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"What a great book! Everything you need to know about Korean movies all in one package. With lots of background on why Korean movies kick ass right now, what movies are worth watching, and which ones should be avoided, you definetely get your money's worth here. I hope he writes another one soon!"},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"A certain quality which could have been redeeming about this book is that it approaches the films discussed from a point of view of a cinema reviewer or critic, and thus uses layman's terms without the hassle of all the academic jargon to explain what the critic's views are. However, there are more than just one point which mark for me the serious Achilles' heels(note, I use 'heels', and not 'heel')of the author's approach.Firstly, the attempt to compare Korean film qualitatively with the cinema of Hong Kong, which defeats the whole point about Korean cinema's cultural idiosyncracies, which have often been pointed out by critics and scholars as both its strength and self-alienating weakness, yet very much an undeniable aspect Anthony Leong does not draw attention to. When one tries to call Korean cinema the \\"New Hong Kong cinema\\", one is just supplanting one's notions of what constitutes dominant filmic forms of expression in Asia for the rest which could be equally distinct and different apart from it. I managed to obtain access to the book via its online pages, where certain review sections were cut and pasted onto the Internet site for Anthony Leong's book, but disappointed at his whole paradigm of analysis, which assumes a certain shared culture or filmic set of paradigms for filmmaking between Korea and Hong Kong, I would dissuade anyone who wants to know more about Korean films to try doing so via Anthony Leong's book.Secondly, the book shows little reference to the earlier periods of Korean cinema which are in fact the formative years, starting from the years of early Japanese colonialism and occupation, and the heavy censorship and propaganda exposure which seriously limited the film industry in Korea, to the deposing of the various military regimes from Sgnyman Rhee right through to the current legacy of the \\"Sunshine Policy\\" bequeathed by Kim Dae-Jung and how all these political-historical movements have affected the mediatised expressions of culture and nationalism on Korean cinema. Anthony Leong's book carries virtually little or no allusion to all these, which even the amateur interested in Korean cinema will make the effort to find out about.If one desires a better and more comprehensive guide to Korean cinema and its auteurs, that is, for good publications in English, one would be better placed if he or she turns to Professor Lee Hyangjin's \\"Contemporary Korean Cinema\\" or journal articles written by either native Koreans or Tony Rayns and Chris Berry(academics established in the non-Korean world for their expertise in East Asian films)."},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"The odd grammatical and printing error aside, this is a well-produced and easy to use guide to some of the best film-making of the last ten years or so.It's worth noting quickly that despite the glossy cover, the book is entirely black-and-white inside with pictures that are of an acceptable rather than brilliant quality. Personally, I find this to be a very minor quibble.I was already very enthused by recent Korean cinema before reading this book and have enjoyed it very much, but it would also make an ideal introduction for someone only just thinking of dipping their toes into the invigorating waters of the Korean New Wave.I can't fully appreciate the frequent comparisons made with Hong Kong film-making of the 1980s having seen very little of it, but it hardly matters; this book puts across in no uncertain terms just how exciting the film scene in Korea has been for the last decade, and it would be a hard-hearted person who isn't stimulated to seek out a DVD or a viewing of some of the films reviewed here.This is not to say, however, that the book is unbalanced. The author's enthusiasm for Korean cinema is obvious, but does not stop him criticising those films - some, even, that have done very well at the box office - that he considers do not come up to scratch.The book is sensibly laid out to make it easy to either read straight through or dip into for specific information. It begins with a brief - and NOT heavy-going - history of the Korean film industry coming right up to the beginning of the 21st century. There then follows a chapter of in-depth reviews of 10 of the best Korean films that 'Everyone Should See'. After that the chapters are divided up by film genre (Action, Horror, etc.), and there are 87 (yes, I counted!) high-quality reviews in all. The last few chapters introduce some of the rising stars of the industry, give some assistance to those wishing to find and see these films, and look to the future of Korean film-making.The only major disappointment for me was that due to the book's having been published in 2002, wonderful films such as A Bittersweet Life, Memories of Murder and Save the Green Planet! are not included, having been released from 2003 onwards. It would be silly to complain about this type of issue since it is inevitable, but here's hoping for a new edition of Korean Cinema: The New Hong Kong sometime soon because the cinematic gems just keep on coming!"},{"Title":"Korean Cinema.","review":"A good book on an ignored area of film.

I'm always sad when I finish a great book. I loved Lucius. He was the ideal male romantic figure, in my opinion. He loved her enough to give her the space she needed to work things out for herself. He wasn't arrogant, domineering and rough as some of the romantic characters. I liked him a lot.I think we have all known a Frances in our lives.

I was able to understand the thinking of the characters, their motives but for the life of me I was totally baffled about her secret.

Your books are all tastefully packaged."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"What can I say? A fabulous and fun read. Any book that Mary Balogh produces is better than most of the books out there and Simply Unforgettable delivers.This is the first book in the teacher quartet series and begins with music teacher's Frances Allard story. The heroine meets her match in the veritable corinthian Viscount Lucius Marshall, whose persistance displaces the complacement contentment that she has cultivated these past years. At the same time, he also brings out her inner fries and passion. She in return teaches Lucius to see beyond his self-indulgent existence and he will flaunt social conventions for the women he loves. Sparks fly and the dialogue between the two are delightful. Lucius, in particular, has a very wry sarcastic wit which provided much comic relief.This novel falls under the category of Mary's ligher fare. I've enjoyed her novels from the the Unlikely Duchess, the Counterfeit Betrothal, the Famous Heroine to her more serious novels i.e. The Secret Pearl, Silent Melody, etc. And I appreciate that she has a wide range of writing styles, in the end, the common thread are wonderful storylines full of depth, characterization, and accepting love that will bring a smile to your face.I'm looking forward to the other novels, most especially Susanna Osbourne's story who will be matched with Viscount Whitleaf ( Lauren Edgeworth's cousin in A Summer to Remember)!"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I love all of Mary Balogh's books.

It's not that this book is poorly written or plotted, it's just that Ms. Balogh has written books that were far superior. This will entertain you for the time it takes to read it, but \\"simply unforgettable\\" it ain't. In fact, it's been a week since I read it and I can barely remember the plot!It's my sense Ms. Balogh, for about 4 years now, has been writing by formula. Worse, several of the books she's produced in that time seem to be trying hard to cover all the politically correct bases. The heroine in this novel has not one career but (count 'em) two! She's a school marm AND a world-class opera singer (who, interestingly, doesn't need to practice the 2 - 3 hours a day other great singers seem to require.) Of course her Regency era hubby is ecstatic about her performing in public and can't wait to promote her artistic career (that's what nannies are for, right?) I'm sure all male, British aristos in the early 19th century would have done the same.Despite my disappointment with this latest work, I'll never give up hope Mary Balogh will one day write another unforgettable Regency-era romance (sans those plot elements that smack of 21st century sensibilities. I like my Regencies straight up with no ice, thank you very much.) The author who gave us The Notorious Rake, Heartless, Lord Carew's Bride, Dancing With Clara, and The Temporary Wife has already enriched the genre immeasureably and earned her place on the short list of the best living romance authors. In the meantime, I'll keep my well worn copy of those and others of her works close by and hope her next book will be their patiently awaited equal."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Ah, Mary Balogh begins her new, much anticipated series - a quartet of books about four teachers at Miss Martin's School for Girls in Bath. Ok, so what did I think of the first entry? Although, SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE is pleasant, it is too tranquil, too restrained, it is like warm milk before bed. Sadly, Balogh's romantic spark and familiar poignancy are missing. After all, this is an author who can bring tears simply by describing a faded gown or a frayed hem. Regrettably, SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE may be enjoyable but it is lifeless.Mary Balogh brings Miss Frances Allard and Lucius Marshall together on a snow-clogged road. Was it fate or coincidence? Who knows? Nevertheless, that random accident changed their lives forever.Frances Allard loves her life in Bath. She is content. She enjoys teaching and feels she is doing something useful. She enjoys her independence and enjoys her solitude. Yes, Frances Allard is content, but is she happy?Lucius Marshall is wealthy, fashionable, and handsome. He is also the Viscount Sinclair of Cleve Abbey, but he is restless. He has promised his aging grandfather he will take a bride. So what is it the viscount now offers to Frances Allard? He offers to pay for her lodgings, her clothes, her jewels, is she to become his mistress? Alas, it does not matter, for Miss Allard walks away. Yes, Lucius Marshall is restless, but he is persistent.That persistence is the governing focus of Balogh's story. Lucius Marshall will not give up Frances Allard. Is it fate that continues to bring them together, or is it the viscount's determination? Is it coincidence that continues to bring them together, or is it the viscount's tyranny?Mary Balogh writes this story with her usual polish. Her words flow over the pages, and her story is easy to read. This devoted fan recommends SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE for true Balogh readers, but don't expect the usual Balogh flair. Although I was disappointed, the blandness did not discourage me, I certainly will be buying the next book in this series.Mary Balogh has been around a long time, and has quite a large following of faithful fans. Of course, loyal readers know exactly who the secret patron to Miss Martin's School for Girls is, but don't miss the delightful reference to Baron Heath, the musical connoisseur - he is the hero, from the novella THE BOND STREET CAROLERS, from the 1997 anthology 'A Regency Christmas Carol.'

Determined to rescue her from her boring dreary life as a teacher, Lucius encourages her singing.What follows is a series of chapters with Lucius pursuing and Frances retreating because there is some big secret in her past.The only thing that saves this book from being a dreary bore is the fact that Mary Balogh is a talented writer. For the most part though, this is a by-the-numbers-plot with a by-the-numbers romance. It was pleasant enough but when the big secret from the past is finally revealed it is rather a let-down.Oh yeah, it is rather glaring that this is a contemporary novel disguised as a regency. It has a very \\"modern\\" feel that seems out of place."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Save your money and don't buy this book at the hardcover price. It's not worth it. There's nothing wrong with it but it's clear that Balogh is losing her voice and inspiration: the result is a bland book that's totally forgettable. The hero is just another washed down version of Wulfric (complete with internal monologues about unsuitable behaviour and the now famous love/in love thing) and the heroine is very very annoying. Add to that the fact that it reads like an overpadded traditional Regency and the author's lost me by page 150. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would improve, and, well, it didn't. The hero and heroine are thrust together in the worst contrived manner possible and I'm still wondering what the hero saw in the heroine."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This is the first Mary Balogh book I have read and probably my last.Although well written, it doesn't read like a romance at all. I don't think Ms. Balogh's style is for me.The hero and heroine are thrown together due to adverse weather at an remote inn.Frances is a prime and proper school teacher and a virgin.Lucius is rather undefined and never really develops.After a day or two together they end up making love on their last night together. My problem with this is that there is no chemistry between them and nothing that leads up to the bedroom scene. Also for a virgin, Frances acts very much like an experienced woman. This rather confused me... Love scenes are my favorite part and the reason I read romances. However a virgin who ends up in bed with a man she doesn't know after just a few days...makes no sense.After a few months they come back in contact and the rest of the book is nothing but a constant chase. Lucious trying to convince Frances to marry him. Frances refusing due to some \\"deep dark secret\\" that ends up being rather silly.The few love scenes in the book are rather flat and dull. Lacking passion and intensity.If you are looking for a book about human nature where the main characters are soul searching for what is really important in life and what they want out of it...then this is for you.If like me you are seeking a well written plot with romance, passion and sensuality...then you should read Sabrina Jeffries or Lisa Kleypas."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I borrowed the book from my sister after she had read it. I asked her how she liked it and she just shrugged, like she didn't know what to say. We are both Balogh fans. I went ahead and read it but I have to admit I skipped a lot. The 'big misunderstanding' turned out to be so stupid, my reaction was \\"Is that all??\\" The hero kept asking the heroine the same thing and she kept telling him the same answer. It was boring. If you cut about 100 pages out of this book, it might have been good. I got the feeling that to justify the price of a hard cover book, either the publisher, Ms. Balogh or both thought it had to be so many pages long, even if the story didn't need that many. I expected more from Ms. Balogh. I'm also really glad I didn't pay for this book!"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"First off, I adore Mary Balogh and her Bedwyns. That series has set the bar very high so maybe if this book was not measured against those I would have liked it better. Or not. Frankly I simply did not like either one of the main characters. Occasionally they would say something witty and warm and I would think Ah, now it will start up. But it never did. And the big secret was such a rip off, something that could have been resolved in ten minutes if the right questions had been asked and answered. And they would have been in the normal course of things, if her big secret wasn't simply a plot device so had to be held to the end.And worst of all, all the secondary characters conversations were all so stupid and trivial. I found myself constantly saying \\"ridiculous people\\" under my breath.But Mary is allowed a lousy book and she's still a first clas writer in my book. I have hope for the rest of the series. Maybe. The whole teacher thing is so uninspiring for me. The idea that any woman would prefer it to a home and family is just too ridiculous. In the present sure, but not back in that time. Being a spinster teacher was Simply Dreary."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Allow me to preface my review by saying that Mary Balogh is one of my favorite authors. I have been reading her romance novels for ages, and I usually enjoy them very much. Therefore, I was quite disappointed to read this, the first book in her new series. In a word, it was tedious. I can't quite put my finger on exactly what's wrong, but I'll try. For starters, it was about 150 pages too long. I felt that it dragged on...and on...and on. I also felt that the character development was non-existent. Lucius and Frances, the main characters in the book, were so one-dimensional. And boring. (I was surprised, as Mary Balogh usually does a great job in creating characters who have distinct and engaging personalities.) I hope Lucius and Frances don't reappear in future novels. In essence, Simply Unforgettable was a disappointing and tedious read. I guess even our favorite authors can fail us once in a while."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This is the first of Mary Balogh's \\"Simply\\" series currently being written which focuses on four women who teach at a school in Bath. Although this book works well as a standalone, long-time Mary Balogh fans will spot links to some of her other series (the Bedwyns are mentioned, as are a few other characters who have shown up in other books).Frances Allard is travelling back from her two great-aunts' house after spending Christmas with them. She's on the road to Bath when a significant snowstorm causes her problems. Eventually her coach slides into a ditch and she's rescued by a rude and insulting gentleman. She has to go with him in his carriage to the nearest Inn - which turns out to be closed. However, she and the gentleman, Lucius Marshall, have to make the Inn habitable and stay there whilst the snow makes travelling impossible.Of course, being thrown together with a dishy man in the privacy of an Inn for a couple of days makes her change her initial view of him as rude and unfriendly - they discover a shared enjoyment of simple fun like peeling potatoes, building snowmen, waltzing... and their relationship moves to rather more intimate. When the snow melts Lucius delivers her to Bath, trying to persuade her to become his mistress - but Frances refuses. She is content with her life as a teacher and not willing to throw this all away on a rake's whim.At this point I wondered where the story was going - how would they meet again? Lucius happens to be Viscount Sinclair, heir to his grandfather's Earldom (his father has already died) and he has promised to get married by the summer. His intended, Portia Hunt, is perfect but cold and he has no real interest in her, but family pressure is strong. However, he finds himself back in Bath with his grandfather, bumps into Frances again after a gap of three months, and this meeting has significant consequences for both of them and for their futures.The book is, in some ways, a coming-of-age book although the hero is 28 and the heroine 23. Lucius discovers, over the course of the book, that his youthful desire for raking and having fun is changing - he now appreciates far more the traditional grown-up and dull things such as his family and the concept of a wife and home - as long as it is the correct wife. Frances had a rather unusual upbringing but a bad experience aged 20 has caused her to be afraid of danger and exposure to London people and to hide herself away as a teacher. She has an amazing gift for singing but is afraid of the repercussions if people hear her who remembered her before and her hint of scandal. Many of Mary Balogh's books seem to have a heroine with a secret in her past which turns out not to be such an issue when faced - in some ways this theme is getting a little tired to me.Viscount Sinclair is an unusual hero in that, although physically gorgeous (of course!) he seems to work his way through the book doing whatever he wants and not really respecting Frances' wishes. He seems to go back on his word (\\"I won't bother you anymore, this will be goodbye\\") a surprising amount of times for an honourable nobleman! Still, who wouldn't find a handsome man pursuing you with marriage proposals rather pleasant - I know I would!One of my traditional gripes - Mary Balogh, despite being born in England, has fallen into some of the traps that American authors of Regencies write. Or perhaps it was her editor. The spelling in my edition is American (which is to be expected) but some sentence forms and structures are also not entirely English. The Christmas time is called \\"holiday\\" in phrases where it wouldn't be in British English; people \\"visit\\" when we would use a different sentence structure; and, a common Mary Balogh failing, the Baron of somewhere is \\"Baron Cliffe\\" rather than \\"Sir John Cliffe\\" or \\"Sir John.\\" No-one is referred to as \\"Baron X\\" in the English peerage. Such a simple error but remarkably annoying when I read it regularly in her books.Overall this book is a perfectly acceptable way to spend an afternoon - there are some good scenes, the dialogue is good, the attraction between the two (although apparently based mostly on physical appearance) does make sense, but having read this book I don't think I'll remember much about it in six months. It wasn't fresh and gripping enough to be simply unforgettable."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This is a disappointment, a bit of froth; and I wonder what has happened to the Mary Balogh who gave us Longing and Secret Pearl and Silent Melody and others already listed in these reviews. Simply Unforgettable is a quick and probably unrealistic view of the times in which it was written. But I long for the Mary Balogh of depth and darkness and desperation and redemption and abiding love. And I would beg Mary to fight the editors, if that is what it takes, and return to those beautiful, haunting LOVE stories that captured the imaginations of all her many fans who want HER to remain unforgettable."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I love the premise of this series - four female teachers teaching at a girl school in Bath. These are women with a past and also women with brains. They aren\`t spoiled rich girls og women flirting at ton balls. They are women trying to create their own lives.The first one out is Frances who doesn\`t have much family apart from two distant aunts she is visiting for Christmas. On her way back she is caught up in a snow storm and seeks shelter in a closed inn together with Lucius who fails to mention that he is the heir to a title. They quarrel a lot at first but make love the second night they spend at the inn. Frances thinks Lucius will be out of her life the next day - and she tries to put him out of her mind as well as there is no future between the school teacher and the member of the nobility. But Lucius can\`t get her out his mind, though he is angry with her for not wanting to be his mistress. And so the campaign to win her - as mistress or wife - begins. Unfortunately for Lucius Frances has very good reasons for not wanting to go to London in any capacity.This was a very good story. I liked Frances a lot. As a very young girl she\`d managed to land on her own two feet even though she had no one to help her. Lucius was spoiled and used to getting what he wanted and it was nice to see Frances stand up for her principles and making Lucius work for it. I liked how Lucius got angry with Frances because his feelings were hurt but also that he swallowed his anger.I also loved the secondary characters and this book made me very curious about the other three school teachers. It was a well written story and the ending was very gratifying."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"The title for me should have been \\"simply forgettable\\". I am a huge Balogh fan but in this particular series of books, she's batting .500. I will confess that I've bough books in her series simply to find out what has happened to characters introduced in other books (here for example, we have characters connected to the Butler family and the Bedwyns) and in this group, the books about Claudia Martin (Freyja Bedwyn's governess) and Anne Jewell/Sydnam Butler were either better written or they had nore appeal. There are plenty of reviews about the plot and characters in this book so no need to repeat that. Skip it unless you are a die hard fan or want to read the entire \\"Simply\\" series."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I picked up Mary Balogh's Simply Unforgettable at the library after reading the inside jacket and deciding I might like this story. I Loved it. I was so taken by the characters and the setting and the simplicity of it all. The \\"adventure\\" as Frances Allard calls it is one I'm sure we would all like to have. The 23 yr old girls school teacher is hiding something we are not sure exactly what it is but are sure we will find out. Lucius is so handsome, witty and manly you just love him. I like the fact the heroine in the book was different. She was Italian, not the blonde, blue eyed, petite beauty Lucius usually favored. I like the way she becomes more attractive to him as he gets to know her and her character, which is very true in life. She is also very intelligent, witty and brave herself. She denies herself happiness for Lucius' sake. She doesn't think his family will accept her once they know the truth.I've been a Sandra Brown fan for a while but have not liked her crime type novels as much. I wanted to venture out to other authors and have found some new ones I like: Garwood and Robards being the favorite until this novel. I tend to use the summer as a time of escaping into romantic novels since during the rest of the year my mind is engaged in more studious topics. I will definitely read the rest of the Simply series but I think Unforgettable will stay my favorite. I've already re-read it twice and plan on purchasing it for my own library. I just love the play between these characters. With some books you get kind of tired of the constant back and forth between the characters. Waiting for something to happen. Not so with this book. Things happen quickly with in the first 5 chapters and that keeps you wanting to see what the outcome will be - although you know what it will be. It is still great to read."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Frances Allard is on her way back to Miss Martin's School for girls where she teaches. Frances spent her Christmas break with her two elderly great aunts. The weather is making a turn for the worse when her carriage is over taken by a speeding hellion. Just a short way down the road disaster strikes. The hellion has had to stop and Frances' driver is unable to stop in time. The carriage ends up in a snow drift but Frances is rescued by Lucius Marshall, Viscount Sinclair.The turn in weather makes travel impossible so Frances, Lucius and their drivers seek shelter in an inn. The innkeepers are away but they have left behind Wally, a pretty much useless servant. Frances and Lucius spend the next few days bickering, laughing, frolicking, learning each other and loving. Both Frances and Lucius understand that once the weather improves they'll be saying good-bye. It's this knowledge that allows Frances to take the risk and live in the moment.When the time comes; however, Lucius doesn't see why saying good-bye is necessary. Frances is an independent woman and won't live as someone's mistress or even as a kept woman. She can only accept marriage and that isn't an option. Lucius must marry by summer's end and is all but betrothed to another. Frances doesn't want to leave Bath or her teaching position. Fate has other ideas and keeps throwing them together.Lucius is a strong male role and at times was almost overbearing. Really he was just a determined man who knew his woman was holding back and needed to help fix it. In the end he was a caring man who would do anything to see Frances happy. Frances spends so much time worrying how every thing is going to turn out that she forgets to live. She is content where she is and won't allow herself to reach for happiness, so Lucius reaches for it for both of them. The secondary characters added greatly to the book as well. I found myself wanting to know Lucius' family more. Frances' colleagues were just there enough to make me wonder what secrets their stories hold. I'm looking forward to finding out!Simply Unforgettable is the type of book that will ruin all others for awhile after you finish it. It is that good. Balogh takes a standard stranded together themed book and twists and shapes it into something new and stunning. Lucius seems doomed to a marriage with someone else and Frances has a mysterious past that stands between them. I was worried about her past and if it was really as big a deal as we were being led to believe. I wasn't disappointed. It isn't an insurmountable problem but it wasn't a small problem either.Simply Unforgettable is great for someone looking to slip to London for a tea or soiree. If you've read the Wallflower series by Lisa Kleypas, I don't doubt for a minute you'll love Simply Unforgettable by Mary Balogh!"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This book was wonderful. It was nice to see the man of the story doing the chasing. It was hilarious the lenghts he went to to get her. But he got her.. Some of the reviews was very misleading this was a great book, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Both these books were great reading as are all books by this author. She spins a good story and makes you want to keep reading just to see what will happen next. They are not like so many books by one author, in that you can't always see what is coming next."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I am a late-comer to Mary Balogh's books. I especially love the Slightly and Simply series. I borrowed these books from the library but knew that these are ones that I could read over and over, so I bought them. If you like regency romances Mary Balogh's books have nicely complex characters and stories."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I think this book started off cute enough, with the hero and heroine stuck in an unlikely place together and developing a mutual affection for each other simply because of what they went through together. It felt very real to me because it might happen even in today's world. But after they parted, things kind of went tepid, and still the book dragged on for another good more than half of it. In the end, I agree with one of the reviewers below that the big secret was kind of disappointing. Yet more disappointing was the character development of Lucius Marshall, which was none. He struck me as an impulsive, love-struck man with nothing better to do but run around shopping with his sisters and taking care of his grandpa -- not very masculine indeed. I much prefer the first part of the book when he was at least making use of his muscles for chopping woods etc. She's this gorgeous Italian, olive-skinned goddess with a good head on her shoulders, and a good singing voice. I couldn't help thinking that she could do better. I finished it in less than a day, and unlike withSlightly Dangerous, had no wish to go back to it again."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Okay, I had not read a romance novel in quite awhile, and I picked up this book at my local library's used book section (a wonderful place where you can buy used paperbacks for 50 cents.) And maybe I was just in the mood for a good romance novel. But, I was totally charmed by this book--loved the characters, the setting, and the writing. I couldn't put it down and at its conclusion, I immediately read Ms. Balogh's Simply Magic (which I had also purchased). I am now going to read her other two books in the series, Simply Love and Simply Perfect. I've read romance novels for many years (although I will admit I go through periods where I can't read them and need to read more \\"serious\\" stuff.) But I've read enough romance authors to know who's really good and Mary Balogh is truly gifted. Her character development is really wonderful--she creates people that you really care about and are multi-faceted (not just a pretty face)and her writing is so much better than many other novelists in her genre. I just picked up a different author's book (whom I had read in the past and thought was OK) and I couldn't read it--the book was written so poorly and so childishly--really terrible. Or maybe the comparison to Ms. Balogh's writing was too much to bear. Anyway, this book was wonderful and I recommend it to anyone who wants to escape for an afternoon to another time and place with some really satisfying and well written characters and really lovely love story. If you haven't read her novels before, it will probably start you on a love affair with Mary Balogh."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Simply said...one of the best series and authors I have ever read. To the woman who reviewed this in 2005...if you knew anything about natural talent you would know it's just there. You don't need to practice everyday of your life. Since this is a piece of fiction as well, I'm sure Frances did practice once she started to perform in public, but we don't need to know that. We do need to know that Frances and Lucius end up happy. Again, Brava to Ms. Balogh for a great series of historical romances."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I am so glad that Mary Balogh is adapting her style of writing to include more humor and witty dialogs. I found her earlier works much too tedious and depressing. But starting with Simply series, her style started to change. Gone are long paragraphs describign longing and feeling desperate. After all, how many times could you feel longing and desperate? And instead, the plot is much faster and dynamic.There is still a nice, romantic ending with things that go exactly right for the hero and heroine. And you will not be disappointed if you wished for a happy ending. But, there are several chapters that should end the book and did not. Again, it is a plot strategy, and after it happens second time, you expect for the story to continue and have another \\"final farewell\\" again."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"It is not a horrible book, but it just isn't original and it's repetitive. This is the first book I have ever read by Mary Balogh, so I didn't know what to expect. In the first few chapters, I was like WOW! What a refreshing change of pace from all other romance books! The author is actually going to allow these characters to have a smoldering, passionate romance with no misunderstandings, etc. Then what happened? Same ole, same ole. As soon as the first passionate encounter ends, this book turns into the same ole storyline as all other romance books. I was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages, so I did give it 4 stars, but I was so disappointed in the fact that I thought I had found a refreshing change when in fact it is just like any number of thousands out there.Here is the storyline as well as 99% of all other romance books -Boy meets girl. Hate. Love. Hate. Love. The end.WHEN?? are we gonna get something different?"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"A man and a woman meet in a snowstorm, have a brief romantic interlude and both have trouble forgetting each other after they go their seperate ways.The struggles to straighten out their feelings and finally get married are a bit too long drawn out - the man is really obsessive about the woman - but it all works out in the end.Linda Sheean"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Frances Allard travels from Miss Martin's School for Girls in Bath to spend the Christmas holidays with her beloved great-aunts in Mickledean. However a rare holiday snowstorm strikes; while her coach crawls, Viscount Lucius Marshall goes full speed cuasing a near accident. Her coach is stuck in the drifts and though she the tortoise and he the hare argue he takes her to a nearby inn. Shockingly they share an incredible night of passion.In the morning light, Frances knows he is way above her station and besides even if she was not her past makes her unsuitable for him; she must move on, but she will never forget the greatest night of her life. Lucius refuses to take no for an answer as he realizes that he has found his soulmate although she is far from the perfect wife, love makes her even better suited for him, but he must persuade her one kiss at a time.The opening of the \\"Simply\\" delightful Regency series is a reason to rejoice as the great Mary Balogh starts off with a terrific tale of two individuals who by Ton standards could never be together except as his mistress. The story line is character driven as the determined male protagonist knows what his perfect spouse should be, but his ideal wife will share one trait with him: love. Anything less is unacceptable. Frances is his wonderful counterpart who rejects him out of her love for him. The secondary cast adds depth and humor while also deftly introducing us fans to future lead characters. This is no slightly diverging novel as sub-genre readers will simply treasure this unforgettable romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"They get stranded at an inn in a snow storm and the relationship becomes a stormy one even though they are falling in love with one another.

President of Just My Best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Immensely.Mary Balogh has written a lot of books. I have not, as yet, read them all, but so far, this is one of my favorites, and I'll explain why - not because it is the best book she has ever written, but because, to me, it is such a \\"feel good\\" read.I was expecting a slow start, (as I have found some of Mary Balogh's previous books tended to do), but this book actually gets into the action pretty quickly, and I loved the first few chapters. The way that Mary Balogh describes the inn, for example, you can feel as if you are right there, you can almost taste the food! And the dialogue between the two of them, the way the scene is built up - it was really enjoyable reading. But then, when the h/h parted ways, I found it a bit of a let down, as not much happens for the next few chapters, however, a few chapters later it once again gains momentum as everyone is orchestrated into place for a beautifully executed finish.SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE is the first book of what is to be a new series. In this story, we are introduced to Frances Allard, who is going back to the boarding school where she teaches, after having been with family for the holidays. A snowstorm soon overtakes her, and she finds herself stuck on the road, unable to get through the snowdrift ahead of her. Someone else is stuck on the same road as well - Mr. Lucius Marshall, Viscount Sinclair. Being stuck together, they are forced to share a nearby, but empty, inn. He is of the aristocracy; she is a teacher, and must work for her living; - two people from opposite ends of the social spectrum, two people who would never in the course of things ever meet - yes, it is hate at first sight - but then, as they slowly get to know each other - is there something else as well? And even if there were to be something else there - nothing can ever come out of it, could it? They come from opposite ends of the society spectrum, something which in Regency times was quite a big line to cross.This may have been a bit of a bland read, but on the other hand, sometimes that is what I am looking for - a nice, sweet story with a beautiful and accomplished heroine, a titled hero who is wealthy, handsome, and a little bit arrogant - a \\"fairy tale\\" kind of story - to balance out the more \\"dark\\" stuff that we are exposed to constantly. I know, this is not real life, but sometimes I do want \\"fiction\\" as opposed to \\"realism\\", and I sometimes even like my fictional h/h to be perfect, why not? And I don't think that it was so impossible that Frances Allaird was an accomplished singer. This is actually explained very plausibly, and this fact adds an added dimension to the plot. And I don't think that she would have to practice for hours a day if she were not performing at the time of the story (it's obvious that she did practice in the past).I do love these love/hate at first sight kind of storylines, it usually makes for some entertaining reading, and in this book, Mary Balogh does the situation to it's very hilt. I found this book has some really, really good dialogue (and I love dialogue), something that not all of MB's books have - so that was a bonus for me. I thought the characters of Frances and Lucius were very well done, and well fleshed out. They are both very definitely \\"real\\" people, in that they react in a very realistic way, and they both change, in their outlook, as the story goes on - one of Mary Balogh's trademarks, actually. Mary Balogh always writes well, beautifully well, and some parts of this book were so absolutely beautifully done, that I think those parts were as close to perfection as is possible for a book to be. I really, really enjoyed this story very much.A previous reviewer mentioned that it seemed out of character for the hero to allow the Frances to sing even after they were married. True, a husband of that time would probably not allow his wife to sing, and it would not have occured to either of them to even think of such an arrangement, but this is fiction, after all, and a modern author does have to do some tampering with the facts to satisfy her modern readership. I don't think was such a bad one either - it's not like she would be a shopgirl or something.Was this book perfect? IMHO, it was not. While some parts of the story were very well written, exquisitely written; some parts seemed to have been a bit rushed, and there were even some pages that seemed to have been there only to introduce the peripheral characters in this book as central characters for her next book - which was done very badly, BTW. I also did not like that this book focused exclusively on the relationship between Francis and Lucius. I usually like a secondary romance as well, which Ms. Balogh very kindly provides for me in her previous books, but *not* in this book.No, it's not perfect... yet I rated this book \\"five stars\\" because this book, for me was a keeper, despite it's flaws. A book that I would like to have on hand, a book to counteract those days where everything is sort of blue... I do NOT think that it should have come out in hardcover, however, and I found that very annoying. I actually took this book out of the library, as I almost never buy hardcover (not in my budget), but I am waiting for the softcover version so that I can have this one for my keeper shelf.Will you like this story? Mary Balogh has written some very emotional, and angst-driven books. Some of them, such as ONE NIGHT FOR LOVE and A SUMMER TO REMEMBER, were very highly rated by many Amazon reviewers, however, I, personally, found those two books to be four star reads, while this book was a five star read to me. So, if you, like me, enjoy a book written on a \\"lighter\\" note, and you are looking for a story with \\"real\\" and complex characters told by a master storyteller, then you will definitely enjoy SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"The first in Mary Balogh's Simply Quartet, SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE was unfortunately not so for me. I am a huge Mary Balogh fan, but this is my least favorite book of hers and I actually had to stop myself from skimming parts at the end (which is just unheard of for me). Meanwhile, I have continued on to the second book of the Quartet,Simply Love, and found that book highly enjoyable - I recommend just skipping to that one.The middle section of this book was actually quite enjoyable; it was in the beginning (read my comments below) and in the end (which is supposed to be the best part!) that things fell apart for me. The section that takes place in Bath is fun to read and the interactions between Frances and Lucius are enjoyable, but once things move forward after that ... the book lost me and by the end, I was so sick of the back and forth that like I said above, I had to stop myself from just skipping to the end and finishing it already.PROBLEM WITH THE PREMISE:This is a matter of personal preference, but I don't usually like the \\"one night of passion with a stranger\\" premises in historical romances. I don't read many contemporary romances, but I don't mind them in that genre. However, when you're dealing with a historical romance, it just doesn't really fit with the times unless the woman is \\"loose,\\" which of course the heroine never is. When the author writes a heroine who is supposedly prim and proper (Frances is such a heroine), it's very hard to have that type of character engage in one night of passion with some mystery man and maintain a sense of continuity or cohesiveness with how she's supposed to be the rest of the time.SIMILAR BOOKS:If you like books where the hero and heroine have one night of passion as strangers and later fall in love, check out the following:~Slightly Wicked(Bedwyn Family, Book 2) by Mary Balogh~The Secret Pearlby Mary Balogh - a spin on the \\"one night of passion\\"~When We Meet Again(Effington Family, Book 10) by Victoria Alexander~Her Highness, My Wife(Effington Family, Book 5) by Victoria Alexander - premise isn't exactly the same, but similar enough~Let It Be Love(Effington Family, Book 11) by Victoria Alexander~It Happened One Night, anthology - I haven't read it, but I think it is similarBOTTOM LINE:Balogh is a wonderful author, but from this book you wouldn't perhaps know it. Skip it and read one of her other books: you can skip to SIMPLY LOVE, which is second in the Simply Quartet; readThe Secret Pearl, a great stand-alone; or settle in to enjoy the wonderful Bedwyn series, starting withA Summer to Remember(Bedwyn prequel) andSlightly Married(Bedwyn Book 1)."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I have greatly enjoyed most of Mary Balogh's earlier books, and, as usual, her main characters are very engaging. The Viscount Sinclair is charming, romantic, and impulsive. Frances Allard is proud, talented, and beautiful. Great start, right? Everything is lovely for about the first 70 pages.Then, the plot becomes a ping pong back and forth of a marriage proposal and a refusal. Enough already. I hate books that drag on for another 100 or so pages when clearly all that needs to happen has already happened. Sure, Ms. Allard has her secrets to keep, but they just aren't monstrous enough secrets to prolong the cycle of \\"Marry me.\\" - \\"I can't.\\" for the next 2/3 of the book. I advise skipping this book and checking back with the esteemed Mary Balogh on her next try."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"What can I say..but Hurrah !!!

I will read some of her more highly rated books next time or at least check the reviews first.There is really not too much to say about the story. I was bothered by the fact that Frances had such a modern attitude - independent career girl, dedicated to job, excels at opera singing and cooking on the side. Her character/personality didn't fit in with the period or the setting."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I enjoyed the book. I agree with other reviewers that the 'secret' at the end was not all the author had presented it to be, but all the same it was still a surprise to me. Also, I enjoyed the characters a great deal. There is not as much drama and suspense in this book as I am used to in other Mary Balogh novels, but as the first in the new series, I think it is certainly worth the cost. If i wasn't such a huge fan I would have waited for the soft back to come out and pay a bit less for it."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I just get all snippy when a book starts off terrific and then for a hundred or so pages makes me want to snooze and then comes around in the end. It's as if the publisher said to this accomplished author \\"make it longer,stretch out the middle\\". I can't believe that the idea for all the repetitive middle was Mary Balogh's idea. She is far to good to pad her plot. So, a really good story is about a hundred sleep inducing pages too long. I'm going to read the rest of this series because I have faith that the next will be great."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I love this author! This 4-book series is great! I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it was the beginning of the series and you got to see some old characters from her other series. I love it when books all tie together. Highly recommend! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This book was so disappointing. It's full of cliches and ridiculous behavior. You have the virgin schoolmarm who is beautiful but doesn't know it and the high society rake who must marry a high born lady to pacify his grandaddy. These two conveniently get stranded together (without chaperone) during a snowstorm and within what seems like hours decide to have sex because, well, you can only make so many snowmen in a day, eh? Did I mention that she was a virgin? But the worst sin of this book is the fact that the writing is so freaking boring. This author usually excels at characterization and character motivation but this time it feels like she wrote it while on auto-pilot and it makes me so very sad."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I was looking forward to reading this after devouring her last series of \\"Slightly\\" books which I loved. Her next series focuses on the four teachers at a ladies finishing school, the same attended by one of the rowdy Bedwyn girls (opportunity to bring the Bedwyn's back in) and tells the story of the mysterious Frances Allard.Thrown together (alone of course) in the midst of a snow storm, passion and romance blooms between the school teachers Frances and the Viscount Sinclair. I was a bit disappointed that the story was the typical \\"I can't tell you the truth and share my feelings so we are doomed to a tragic misunderstanding\\" story line. But written by Balogh, the characters, settings and story are interesting and entertaining to read. Balogh also connects the characters to her Bedwyn stories leading the way for another series of wonderful books."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I felt it important to write a review to offer some balance to other perspectives from other reviewers. This was the first novel I've read by Mary Balogh, and I am relatively unfamiliar (since high school days) with either Romance or Regency genres of literature. Approaching this book with no expectations from previous Balogh books or other writings in the genre, I was pleasantly surprised by the warm feelings inspired for the well-drawn characters through the acute and intelligent writing style. The subtlety and complexity of what drew each character to the other reflect the essence of the paradox of falling in love, where the silliest and least consequential characteristics can endear others deeply to us. There was a nobility in each character which had little to do with \\"birth,\\" and much with developed values--both refreshing and admirable to see portrayed. There were also several passages so true and lyrical--as describing the purity and depth expressed by the heroine's profound musicianship that deepened the love between the characters--which brought tears to my eyes (and I am not excessively romantic). This was a moving book about unusually vibrant characters, people who seemed truly to have been brought to life from the page. The author's restraint and subtlety likely set her apart from most writers in her genre, one of the reasons I do not generally read or enjoy books in this area. But a good story, about quality people I wish to have known, is always captivating, and can live on in the imagination for many years. It is also rare and refreshing these days to read about characters admirable for their virtue and character. This book touched me as few have in recent memory. Many thanks to the author for her vivid characterizations and ability to touch on true-life dilemmas--of independence, duty vs. individual happiness, and prudent vs. intuitive living--relevant even today."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"Shame on you Mary Balogh for using an old plot from one of your older signet regencies \\"Snow Angel\\". In this regency, hero and heroine are similarly caught in a snowstorm and forced to spend time together alone where they ultimately engage in a \\"night of passion\\". Another coincidence is that the hero is also engaged to another person and both hero and heroine have to suppress their love for one another because of circumstances which keep them apart. The only thing different was that Balogh made the heroine an opera singer. I was greatly disappointed! Shame on you! When I e-mailed my thoughts to Ms. Balogh, she kindly replied that after writing over 100 novels similarities can happen. Well, if that is the case perhaps a hiatus is in order. Hopefully, her next novel, Simply Love will be more original. If this is your first Balogh book, do not judge her by this novel! Read her \\"Slightly\\" series and you will enjoy many hours of pure regency enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read all of the Bedwyn family books by Mary Balough (and liked them all very much) and bought this one on name alone. I won't do that again. The characters were very boring and the interaction between Lucius and Frances didn't leave me feeling the romance. unless you feel the need to read all her books, don't bother with this one. It is usually very hard for me to put a book down once it is started but this took me 4 days to read."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"I finished it yesterday, and already I have forgotten almost everything about it except the title. I thought it started out well, but the story lost me after it moved from the setting in Bath to London. I lost interest in Frances as a character. I found it dragging. I knew they would end up together (that's the point of the genre, I guess), but it seemed to take too long and be filled with boring passages."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"What can I say..but Hurrah !!!

All of them that I have read are unforgettable and I will buy more and more of her books as they become available."},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This book was just O.K.I can't give it more than two stars. It was simply the same as Mary Balogh's other books. It is the same woman-just a different scandal, same man-just a different meeting, same sex scene-just new names faces and location in this instance, same first-time scene...you get the picture.Is it just me or am I the only one noticing that all Ms. Balogh's women all have a natural perfume of clean soup and water (something to that effect), then the wedding is the same-she notes the basics and the character(s) is so enamored or numb that they don't notice the ceremony-just different colors. I found myself going yea, yea, get original. It is the same woman being an idiot over the same man and his proposal.It is not that this is badly written and it was a quick read, but there is nothing new in this story. Should you waste your time reading it? Well, it depends; I thought the stranded-at-the-Inn-in-a-snow storm was kind of romantic and Ms. Balogh did a good job of setting the stage on how/why a spinster teacher would suddenly throw morals to the winds and have an affair, but the story goes downhill swiftly from there. There is just too much arguing in this story, it gets old fast!I just was hoping for something new and original in this book and didn't get it. Ms. Balogh has simply written the same story with different characters and a different scandal...again..... blah blah blah"},{"Title":"Simply Unforgettable","review":"This is Mary Balogh best work so far.

If you are repressed or inhibited and in search of something to make you set yourself loose, this book is an express train to libido-ville. If you are a prude and happily wed to your vanilla fondlings on crisp linens, this book is for you too-it will repulse you and ignite you at the same time or at a minimum give you something to be substantially angry about. If you are already uninhibited and proud of the way your desire rules you, this book will reaffirm that you are on the right track. Within these pages, classic lesbian stereotypes get celebrated, blown apart and put back together again in a brand new way. Butches flaunt their penis envy, bask in their ability to woo the girly girls or subdue the bois and, take ownership of their desire to submit when they choose to. Femmes rise with formidable power above the superficiality of their lipstick and stilettos to leave us breathless and aching. 26 stories. 26 unique, unfaltering voices. 26 opportunities to discover a new kink. 26 ways to recover what you may have lost. 26 chances to validate that part of yourself you keep denying.

I think that in order to be deemed \\"cutting edge\\" this series has gotten so far away from the way *most* lesbians experience their lesbianism that it bears no real reflection of anything but bizarre and isolated sexual kink. If one - or both! - of the people in the scene do not identify as lesbian, how is the sex \\"lesbian\\"? I have to assume that the inclusion of such stories under the label \\"best lesbian\\" means the editors think these are lesbian sex acts.I beg to differ. For example, ask any sex worker who identifies lesbian - sex with a male customer isn't lesbian sex. I also know many butches who don't recoil in shock and horror if a femme reaches down their pants wanting to touch female flesh.And this is the \\"best\\" such talented writers have to offer as insight into lesbian sex in the year 2005? What's with the men, and the straight women, the lack of clear consent, and the endless, endless, endless genderbending and calling it \\"best lesbian\\" sex acts? There are stories with \\"lesbians\\" yearning to be and acting so much like men that the sex is het! That's simply not what I want in an anthology of \\"best lesbian\\" sex.I thought last year's anthology was as far as they could go labeling the contents \\"lesbian\\" but this year went way over the line that works for me. I'll be looking elsewhere from now on for reflections of what I (and I know I'm not alone) call \\"best lesbian sex.\\""},{"Title":"130 Evident Miracles in the Quran","review":"This book illustrates some of the miracles of the quran.

At the end are the bedtime themed poems. FYI: There are 2 halloween poems (but those aren't the only Autumn poems) and they talk about witches and ghosts although they are light-hearted and not creepy. There are also some Thanksgiving poems and the classic 'Twas the Night Before Christmas' among others.My child enjoyed these fun poems so much she often quotes or acts them out.This was just what I was hoping for.

I'm under the impression that Matthews in British sport must hold a place similar to the way we see some of our baseball legends, something like that. The breadth of detail is in fact a bit cumbersome and at times, maybe dry, I really think the book should be read alongside Matthews' contemporaryTom Finney Autobiographywhich has a nice easygoing flow to it and is highly readable compared to this one. Still, it easily merits a top rating.Matthews accounts are of the utmost intimate matters, as an example: playing a Match against Nazi Germany in May, 1938 before a crowd of over 100,000 people in Berlin. The English players actually gave a Nazi salute before the game and there is a famous photograph of this. In this book, you will find out what was going on behind the scenes and I will say here, it was for diplomatic reasons, maybe a bit in the \\"peace in our time\\" vein.You will find out in those early days of International soccer, these fixtures were regarded comparable to the World Cup or Olympic games, whereas some tournaments were boycotted back then or not even attended at all with the ominous signs of war growing in Europe and around the world (One source, Wangerin's \\"Soccer in a football world\\" states that the latter is precisely why the USA did not go to the 1938 World Cup). Qualifying for these tournaments must not have been fully developed at this time.The summer of 1939 saw a similar incident, as the English team went into Milan to play the Italian team, the streets were filled with thousands of well-wishers. In the hotel lobby was a contingent of Maltese fans expressing their support for the 3 Lions buoyed it seems by an uneasy feeling of vulnerability to the Axis powers, Germany and Italy. In this famous game at the San Siro stadium, just like in the 1934 World Cup where referees were suspended for aiding Italy in its wins, this game again, saw farcical refereeing by a German to aid the host team (expounded on brilliantly in articles by the BBC). In reference, the movieVictorywith Pele and Stallone is not really far from the truth in that game it portrays. The game ended 2-2 and the Crown Prince of Italy even sent the English FA a letter offering to reverse the result, there was some sort of controversial goal but the FA accepted the original result without further actions.Matthews playing in the service during World War II, Matthews receiving a bit more than a pick me up from a doctor during his career when the flu bug bit (sounded like he was describing an amphetamine like product which he claims was done only one time or so) and in fact, even Matthews playing until he was seventy years old and yes, retiring due to injury are all covered in this book along with apparently Matthews being a bit of a health nut way back in the day, maintaining a healthy diet and not drinking. One will also read of other major sports figures of the day, Dixie Dean the scoring-machine and of course, one reads of Matthews professional career mainly with Stoke City and BlackpoolThe editorial reviews above reads: \\"'A gracefully crafted autobiography filled with entertaining anecdotes reflecting an age when the game was uncorrupted by greed and hooliganism' -- Birmingham PostOkay, basically right but it was not uncorrupted as before a players' union was set up in England, the owners were the benefactors of much of the revenue and players were largely chattelAn extraordinary memoir found in these pages is the account of the Burnden (fire) stadium tragedy which demonstrates that events like Hillborough were not the first time events like this that had marred the sports scene though it seems to largely be the last time an event of that magnitude happened. A need for change was seen necessary for the general safety of the public.I upped this to 5 stars because though, it is long and detailed, it really serves also as a very valuable reference in addition to being the autobiography of a man who Pele says \\"showed us how to do it.\\""},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Portuguese Grammar","review":"I am Brazilian. In my opinion several things are not quite right in this grammar but as a native speaker I may be too critical. However there is one point I want to make. In the introductory section this grammar makes some strong statements about the differences between European and Brazilian Portuguese, but throughout the units there are several mistakes about these differences. Just a few examples. On page 168 you read that the conditional may be and often is substituted by the imperfect tense, especially in the spoken language (though not in Brazil). This is wrong. We use the imperfect for the conditional a lot in Brazil. On page 204 you read that the command form used exclusively in most of Brazil is in the third person and the verb goes into what is known as the present subjunctive. This is wrong. Colloquially we often say &quot;fala&quot;, &quot;vai&quot;, etc. (speak, go, etc) which is the imperative for &quot;tu&quot; although we do not really say &quot;tu&quot;(it also looks like the third person singular of the present indicative). On page 242 you read that the subjunctive is used after words like &quot;talvez&quot; and &quot;oxala&quot;(there should be an accent on the last &quot;a&quot;) but this is supposed to be in Portugal not in Brazil. Well, we say it too. I find that anyone using this grammar will end up rather confused and I regret to say that shall not be able to recommend it."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Portuguese Grammar","review":"This book does not explain Portuguese grammar to you, throws it at you. The verbs are diabolic. You are told that the present indicative mood has a number of different meanings in English. You are told that &quot;eu falo&quot; can mean I speak, I am speaking, I do speak, I shall speak. If this is the case, surely the reader should be given some guidance on these meanings. No, there is no guidance, which is really missed in a teach yourself grammar. It is also surprising in a book that keeps telling the reader that you are getting lots of helpful advice. Are you? Not really. You may find out that the supposedly helpful advice is wrong. For example the book tells you rather patronizingly not to see the preterit as a frightening array of new forms to learn but to make the patterns shown in the book work for you. Do they? No. Why? Because they are wrong. They tell you that the verb maintains the original letter it had in the infinitive (a/e/i).On the previous page there is evidence to the contrary. For example &quot;falei&quot; and &quot;falou&quot; do not maintain the &quot;a&quot; or &quot;comi&quot; the &quot;e&quot;. You don't say &quot;falaei, falaou, comei&quot; (wrong!) for I spoke, you spoke, I ate.

Three examples of the intellectually provocative essay titles are: &quot;What the Student owes his Teacher&quot;, &quot;On the Seriousness of Sports&quot; and &quot;On teaching the Most Important Things&quot;. The most charming and unique feature of Schall's book is the &quot;various and sundry&quot; book lists that follow at the end of each chapter. The book lists are not merely bibliographies, rather they are meant to provide a syllabi for the reader who wishes to further his education in the realm of the things that matter most in life: i.e. suffering, love, death, immortality, education, morality, politics etc.. Many of the names and books on the lists are venerable entries, such as Plato, Aristotle, the Bible, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, Shakespeare etc., however the lists are full of authors and titles of which I had never yet heard mention in my life.

That means gathering about oneself wonderful books on diverse topics and marvelling as the years roll by that, as he says at one point, &quot;Everything reminds me of something in Plato.&quot;Fr. Schall shuns the approach of a Master List of Books To Read Or Else. Instead, he writes elegant, meaty essays on education, philosophy, science, politics, history, and revelation, and concludes each essay with a short list of the books that nourish his own thoughts on the subject at hand. Examples of such lists include, &quot;Unlikely List of Books to Keep Sane By&quot;, &quot;Books You Will Never Be Assigned&quot;, &quot;Seven Books on Sports and Serious Reflection&quot;, &quot;Seven Books on the Limits of Politics&quot;, and &quot;Five Books Addressed to the Heart of Things&quot;.Why haven't I begun to do this?

He enlists the thought and works of Plato and Aristotle, of Augustine and Aquinas, of G.K. Chesterton, [contemporary Thomist] Josef Pieper, and C.S. Lewis. Allow me to quote from the book's Conclusion:&quot;I wanted to suggest that anyone with some diligence and some good fortune can find his way to the highest things even if such higher level concerns are not formally or systematically treated in the schools, even if they are in fact denied there or by our own friends or culture. Indeed, I would suspect that there is a certain basic loneliness in our relationships to the highest things. I am not a skeptic here, but we should not expect too much from our formal educational institutions in this regard.&quot;Can I get an &quot;Amen&quot;?If nothing else, considering Fr. Schall's lists of books that matter may prompt each reader to ask, while scanning the surrounding array of books, &quot;Which books most shape my thought? How would I introduce them to others?&quot; Fr. Schall provides a wonderfeul model of how to do that."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"To begin with, any book which, in its preface, seamlessly links Eric Voegelin, E. F. Schumacher, and Mad Magazine deserves attention. James V. Schall has written a delightfully odd, but profound book (in fact, \\"Oddness and Sanity\\" is the title of one of his essays) for folks like me who got all the way through college without managing to get \\"educated\\" (and digging into the difference between the two is only one of the book's many virtues).The whimsical subtitle captures the essence of the book perfectly: 'Selected Contrary Essays on How to Finally Acquire an Education While Still in College or Anywhere Else: Containing Some Belated Advice about How to Employ Your Leisure Time When Ultimate Questions Remain Perplexing in Spite of Your Highest Earned Academic Degree, Together with Sundry Book Lists Nowhere Else in Captivity to Be Found'.The book contains 21 thoughtful (and thought-provoking) essays on an eclectic range of topics. From my own experience, though, the best feature of this book is the book lists at the end of each essay - 37 lists in all, composed of 290 books (not accounting for titles appearing in multiple lists). I consciously took Schall's advice on maybe a dozen books or so, but in reviewing it recently, I was surprised at how many more I've read since then. One could do a lot worse than following Schall's advice."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"Not just a catalogue of books, but a guide to help students (whether in school or in the real world) **recall** that education (and, indeed, human existence itself) has a higher purpose.One could spend a life-time chasing down Fr. Schall's lists and reading them; you regain that life-time when you apprehend what the book is trying to tell you (and why Schall put it on his list in the first place).Superb work, and unequalled as an originating impetus for pursuing the life of enquiry and the love of wisdom."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"Are you conservative? Are you religious in the Christian Catholic way? Then this book is for you. I mean this in a wonderful way. Even if you didn't answer yes to both questions you will find this book valuable. The title says it all so no more description is necessary.One great thing it did for me was to clarify my thinking and point me in the right direction of what I should be learning about, what is really important to spend my time learning about. Ever walk into Barnes & Nobel and feel confused and overwhelmed by this question, \\"Good heavens, what book and I gonna buy now because their are so darn many ones to pick from?\\" This book will answer that question for you.I savored every word on every page as I read through this book. Then I went to my Amazon.com account and added virtually every bood he suggested to my 'wish list', yes all 200+ of them. Then I ranked them according to my interest and started builing myself a serious conservative, classic library in our home. It will take me years to buy all of them and even longer to read them all - but I'm detrminded!"},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"Not too long ago a friend asked me, \\"Do you really think it is worth teaching your students all the history and philosophy stuff? Shouldn't they just learn science and math to get a job and make money?\\" He has a point. If we are to be strictly robotic producers and insatiable consumers in a capitalistic society, that may be true. But to be truly utilitarian about it, not to mention human, he is flatly mistaken. We are not soldier ants or drone bees. We are not defined by what we make and consume. We call the humanities \\"humanities\\" because, at their best, they help humanize us by allowing us to enter into dialogue with the past to inform us about who we are as humans. This book seeks to do the same.One of the reasons that I like to write so many reviews on amazon is because it serves as something of a mental map of my inner life. Until the birth of my children I marked the passing of time by thinking, \\"Oh, yeah, that was when I was reading such and such\\" rather than dates. Some people remember eras by music, who they dated or what job they had. For me, it is what books I was reading. I have also often toyed with the idea of writing a book about the best and worst books that I have read as a short eulogy for each on its way out of the home, on the premise that my wife was forcing me to get rid of them to make room for our children. Maybe I still will. Anyway, the reason I write this is because I image that James Schall may be the same way. This wonderful book of his is akin to a road map of the mind through the lens of various authors that have moved him in a particularly strong direction, like strong winds in the sails of a ship on the ocean.Believing that education is not to be left to schools, he suggests that we all need to sit down sometime with people in the past who have asked the right questions and thought through various answers, something which, if you are educated in the humanities like myself, you may have missed somehow in college! I may be wrong, but I think Samuel Clemens remarked something to the effect of \\"I never let school get in the way of my education.\\" How true. College is usually a money racket that almost by its corrupt nature doesn't want you to question the fundamental premises of a society that has drifted so far away from any center that truly holds. By wrestling with the Ultimate Questions, Schall invites us into the inner journey of a lifetime, a quest to be frankly honest about what it means to exist at all.Use the \\"look inside\\" function to get an idea of how he arranges his roadmap. A very odd book in that it is so unique. I may just use this as a textbook for my future students."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"A book that I wish was better known. Unlike the most modern books that are meant primarily as entertainment this book harkens back to the day when books were rare and cherished and thought about word for word. You could spend a long time thinking about the ideas in the book. I especially like the chapter \\"On the Difficulty of Believing and Not Believing\\" since I have so much trouble believing. Along the same vein I like that Schall isn't preaching here - his goal is not a conclusion but a process - he wants you to think. Really a nice handbook to philosophy and thinking."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"Over the past three years, including (and in spite of!) the latter half of my studies at Brandeis University, this book lit a flame hot enough to incinerate my rotting agnosticism and send me whirling towards Roman Catholicism in a flurry of ashes. How?Well, rather than address any specifics inside the book, I merely want to say that during this period at Brandeis I quickly became a bibliophile while working as a book-shelver at the university library. Not only did I resolve to begin collecting my own library, but I also resolved never to purchase softcover books when hardcover--or even fine leather--versions existed for a reasonable price. My records show that I acquired a hardcover copy of Another Sort of Learning on May 29, 2008 for the sum of $10, at the close of my academic year as a Junior.When the book arrived, it had traits that I could only compare with one other book on my shelves at the time: That Eager Zest: First Discoveries in the Magic World of Books, edited by Frances Walsh. These traits were: cotton case bindings in an unusually playful color, nearly identical type and font settings on fine, odor-free cream paper, and quite wise essays written with childlike wonder and glee. They are among the most readable books I own, and the elegance of their physical structure has everything to do with it--they are so pleasing to hold that they cast nearby softcover books into oblivion.Though I had hardly read much in either of them, the publishers evidently wanted these particular editions to be lavished with their reader's attention. With regard to Another Sort of Learning, I am especially glad they did, because without these physical adornments I might not have returned with such \\"eager zest\\" to this book which I had at first found impenetrable.I am not exaggerating when I say that none of the authors recommended or written about in the book were familiar to me. It took me many false starts before I began to comprehend why the likes of E. F. Schumacher, G. K. Chesterton, Josef Pieper, Allan Bloom, Plato, C. S. Lewis, and many others, warranted my utmost attention, and it will take many more just to survey all the gold in this enormous goldmine.Another Sort of Learning is itself a brilliant guide for the perplexed, and I can only hope this volume finds its way to fellow individuals willing to concede perplexity, because it is a massive dose of truth for those who may not know that they are wrong about the most important things, or, as was in my case, did not yet even know what they were. This is a fountainhead of real philosophy, for the love of wisdom, following the truth where the truth leads, in order to secure the proper convictions for the most pressing questions of mortal and immortal life."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"James V. Schall's Another Sort of Learning is a books of essays, \\"contrary essays\\" it claims in a subtitle too long to type and too fun to read aloud, about reading, studying, teaching, longing, thinking, evil, sanity, values, lectures, devotion, prayer, sports, and a few other things. Easily, Schall could have entitled his book \\"On Everything\\" if only Hilaire Belloc had not used that one for a book of essays in 1909.The book begins with a quotation from Mad Magazine, and ends with a reference to Aristotle. In between the end-pages you will repeatedly encounter names such as Samuel Johnson, G.K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Russell Kirk, Augustine, Plato, Machiavelli, Josef Pieper, Eric Voegelin, Thomas Aquinas, Flannery O'Connor, Stanley Jaki, John Henry Newman, Dorothy Sayers, and Maurice Baring. It is a book largely about reading and thinking.What keeps one going back to the book, if not only to reread the essays, is to consult the book lists. Part of the beautiful subtitle states \\"Sundry Book Lists Nowhere Else in Captivity to Be Found\\". Each chapter contains at least one delightful book list; and then there is the bibliography. You will find \\"Eight Books on Evil and Suffering\\", \\"Five Books Addressed to the Heart of Things\\", \\"Sixteen Books on Belief and Disbelief\\", \\"Eight Collections of Essays and Letters Not To Be Missed\\", and so on.It is easily read, in any chapter order, and at any speed. It is a perfect start to a journey in worthwhile books. Schall's Another Sort of Learning is \\"Not To Be Missed\\"."},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","review":"Schall is a great essayist: his goal is to lead modern men and women away from the shallowness and relatavism of the modern education system, where the prescribed mantra is \\"your truth is not my truth and my truth is not your truth\\". This book is about being a cultured human being, about being a proud inheritor of the greatest civilisation the world has known -the civilisation wrought through the power of the gospel, namely western civilisation. This book is about everything which contributes to this great culture. That being said, it lacks any serious discussion of music and arts, foundation stones of western civilisation. Leaving that aside, I highly recommend this hook; each chapter ends with some fine book recommendations, books no longer fashionable but key to understanding our culture."},{"Title":"Owen Foote, Frontiersman","review":"I came across this book on the library shelves and thought my son would like the book...and I was right.
