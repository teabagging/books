And that I'd feel classy after reading it. I do feel classy after reading it. It's a really excellent bunch of set pieces on a young summer romance. Roth does a great caricature: Brenda's worldly father, less-successful uncle, and Neil's crazy aunt are all very memorable and concisely drawn. And he does really precise scenes: it's kind of swimming pool, dinner, doctor, wedding, and we're done.But since Roth's writing really economically and less evaluatively, the main characters were less clear. Brenda, the romantic object, gets some witty lines, but is otherwise treated semi-unfairly. It's really unclear, in the light of this century, how a fight over a contraceptive would be so important for a couple having plenty of sex - a fight where Brenda's implausibly portrayed as both self-hating and pretty sneaky. And Neil as unbearably arrogant. And why'd she like the paranoid, chip-on-his-shoulder, but also smugly superior kid-from-the-other-side-of-the-tracks? Also unclear - since Neil works in a library, it wasn't like he was rough trade or anything.So it's very good in the particulars, but there's a hole in the center of this thing.

In the first 100 pages, the life of Chopin is discussed by Huneker in a very colorful and poetic style, although unfortunately very few biographical facts are revealed. When I finished this section I felt I had hardly learned anything new about Chopin.The next 150 pages deal with Chopin's music, in which Huneker comments briefly on every one of Chopin's compositions (with the exception of several pieces unknown to Huneker), categorized by type (Ballades, Preludes, etc.). This section, like the first, is amusing but not very helpful. The author never really goes into great depth about any single piece. Instead he simply says a word or two on mood or style, often quoting authorities such as Kullak and Niecks, and compares several major editions of the work. I would recommend this to someone very interested in editorial details... anyone else could probably do without most of this section.People familiar with Chopin should find Huneker's writing somewhat enlightening, though far from substantial. Those looking for an introduction to Chopin may find the first section very helpful, if they can tolerate the author's verbosity."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Huneker was an aspiring concert pianist (as well as a brilliant writer), and his analysis of Chopin's music and poetry are simply amazing. Like Chopin, Huneker expresses from the heart and hears the music at a whole new level. His interpretation is raw and as full in energy as the music itself (especially for etude op.25 no.11 and the ballade no.1)."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Who can count themselves learned in Chopin who has not read Huneker's wonderful, purple-prosy, unabashedly romantic examination of the Polish Master's music? If the musicology is a tad dated, the enthusiasm, the sheer love of music present on every page, are more evident than ever. This is absolutely essential reading for the Chopin lover."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"The biography is very disappointing, the musical descriptions are poetic but don't get into much detail. If you want a general feel for Chopin's music but don't want intricate musical detail, the descriptions of the pieces may suit your need. That's the only reason I didn't give this book the lowest possible rating.For biographical info, \\"Chopin in Paris\\" by Tad Szulc is much more informative and accurate. Huneker's biography, besides being relatively short, takes off on gossipy tangents that often jump around in time making it hard to get a good feeling for Chopin's progression thru life.My problem with the musical descriptions (the book is divided into 76 pages of biography and 141 pages of music \\"analysis\\", divided into sections on preludes, mazurkas, etc.) is again the gossipy nature. For example, the chapter on the preludes is 13 pages long. The first four pages are strictly about who claimed when and where they were written.I recently played Prelude No. 4 in E Minor at Peabody in Baltimore. Prior to the recital, I was deluged with coaching at college master-class play-ins, etc. The discussions centered on things like why the downbeat beginning each measure is played weaker than usual, contributing to the feeling of hopelessness in the piece.Huneker's descriptions are: \\"The melody seems literally to wail..\\", \\"This tiny prelude contains wonderful music\\", \\"The whole is like some canvas by Rembrant..\\"In the relatively few times Huneker does go into musical detail there may be some insight, but just as frequently a few bars of music are shown accompanied by an explanation like, \\"Volcanic mutterings these!\\" -when the music shown is a pianissimo (played very softly) passage!For anyone looking for insights on actually playing the pieces, Walker's \\"The Chopin Companion..\\" which can be found \\"used\\" at Amazon, is a much better choice."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Loved the documentary about Mozart. I learned things I never knew about him. Too bad he died so young, can you imagine the amount of music he could have written?"},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"This book is listed with Weinstock as the author, but Huneker is the author. Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called \\"Chopin: The Man And His Music\\". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Strangely, no one seems to have writen a definitive biography of Frederic Chopin (1810-1849), despite the fact that he was one of the most important composers of the 19th century Romantic era. (Tad Szulc's book,Chopin In Paris: The Life And Times Of The Romantic Composer, is perhaps the best existing biography, in addition to Jim Samson'sChopin (Master Musicians Series)and Jeremy Siepmann'sChopin: The Reluctant Romantic; Chopin's friend Franz Liszt also wrote a \\"SORT OF\\" biography of himLife of Chopin (Forgotten Books).) Consequently, I would suggest that this book by American music newspaper writer and critic James Gibbon Huneker should not be expected to be more than it is.Huneker offers many interesting observations on Chopin's life and personality: \\"For the dissipations of the 'average sensual man,' he had an abiding contempt.\\" \\"Chopin loved the night and its soft mysteries...\\" Chopin \\"did not care much for German music except Bach and Mozart. Beethoven ... was not sympathetic. Schubert he found rough, Weber, in his piano music, too operatic and Schumann he dismissed without a word.\\" With regard to Chopin's famous development of the rubato style of playing, Huneker writes, \\"The Chopin rubato is rhythm liberated from its scholastic bonds, but it does not mean anarchy, disorder.\\"Concerning Chopin's fateful meeting of author George Sand, \\"Sand was antipathetic to Chopin but her technique for overcoming masculine coyness was as remarkable in its particular fashion as Chopin's proficiency at the keyboard.\\" Her ardor for Chopin cooled as he became ill: \\"for an active mind and body like hers, it must have been irksome to submit to the caprices of a moody, ailing man.\\" In his final days, Chopin \\"begged his sister to burn all his inferior compositions. 'I owe it to the public and to myself to publish only good things.'\\" Huneker notes that \\"This wish has not been respected. The posthumous publications are for the most part feeble stuff.\\"Huneker concludes that \\"Chopin is the open door in music. Besides having been a poet and giving vibratory expression to the concrete, he was something else---he was a pioneer.\\"This isn't THE biography or study of Chopin to purchase; but for lovers of Chopin and his music, it should be read."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Au contraire to the negative reviewers. This book is the tour de force on the music of Chopin, expressed in the most descriptive and vibrant language imaginable. It was written in the late 19th Century by a man who enthusiastically explored every nook and cranny of Chopin's genius.The book is meant primarily as an overview and examination of Chopin's music for pianists and lovers of Chopin, written by a man who was a respected music critic and pianist himself. It's full of information on how the great pianists of the time performed Chopin and invaluable as a fascinating read and historical document. The book was never intended as a dry encyclopedic biography of the composer, and much has been discovered about Chopin's life in the last 100 years that can be found in other biographical sources. Those who expect Huneker to be literally correct in every respect on Chopin's life are badly missing the point of this fascinating examination of Chopin's life and music. Huneker adored Chopin, and his writing brims with passion, enthusiasm and incredible insight into each piece Chopin produced, though his words were never intended for the piano pedagogues only.Anyone who deeply loves Chopin will find this a unique and wonderful read. I have marked many passages, referred to it countless times, and there is nothing like reading Huneker's descriptions of a Chopin work while you are actually listening to it performed at the same time. Huneker's language simply reflects the florid language of his age and is truly fantastic in its descriptive detail.Zero stars on the misguided negative reviews on the book; and 5 stars on behalf of Huneker's little Chopin classic that has been in print for over 100 years. This is a book to be savored, and there are no other writings on Chopin that can match the boundless enthusiasm that Huneker felt for his musical god. Each page brims with Huneker's exuberant spirit and his fervent love of music itself. A treasure from another age."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"James Huneker made an praised essay around the different stages of Chopin's life as well an extensive, meticulous and detailed analysis about every one of his compositions. The way he analyzes and even collates this Polish composer reveals not only a deep engagement but besides a remarkable description supported by a poetic trait that stimulates still more the necessary reading.If you are engaged with Chopin's micro cosmos, go for this notable essay."},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","review":"This a beautiful, useful book well worth the purchase price. But I bought it to tell me how to build a home wine cellar (which it does) and I was disappointed to discover that it doesn't include any actual floor plan examples, with dimensions, showing a sample layout of a real wine cellar for, say, a small collection, a medium collection or a large collection of bottles. I'm new to this and need suggestions from someone who has done a lot of this. That's what I bought the book for. Also, I would have appreciated some recommendations on brands of cooling equipment and maybe a few names, websites, etc. of different equipment and furnishings the author has found superior to the competition. An appendix listing equipment and furnishing suppliers would have been great, like a recommendation of a good set of prefab racks to buy. In other words, I've read the whole book and still have to design my own floorplan from scratch and still have to spend a lot of time researching websites to decide on the brand/model of cooling equipment I want to use. I suspect the author already knows which is best, and I wish he had told me!"},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","review":"Parts of the book were helpful and the photos were interesting. However, aside from asthetics, the critical issues in building a cellar are the vapor barrier, insulation and cooling system. It would have been helpful to have more technical advice or at least technical advice that was easier to follow. For example, an explanation of why the vapor barrier must be on the outside everywhere (to keep condensation away from the insulation) would be more helpful than just a bald statement that it should be. The diagrams are clear as far as they go, but the explanation on how to put a vapor barrier up and insulate a ceiling is confusing in the absence of an explanation of the purpose of the vapor barrier. For example, if you have wires, pipes and ventilation ducts in your basement ceiling as most people do, what is the best approach? Should you drop the ceiling and then install a vapor barrier followed by insulation or is there something else you can do? Likewise, a discussion of the pros and cons of using a glass vs. solid door, whether to have electrical outlets inside and if so how many and why, whether to place the light switch inside the room or out, and a discussion of how to properly ventilate the cooling unit to optimize operational efficiency all would have been helpful. Finally, since the author is in the business, I would assume that he uses particular brands of cooling units and has specific recommenations regarding size, makes and models--all of that would have been useful information.To be fair, I did a lot of research and nobody seems to be able to write clearly on this subject and there is a lot of conflicting information on various aspects of design and construction. Still, now that I've been through the construction process, it seems that someone with expertise should be able to write a sufficiently detailed publication to give a novice or a novice working with a general contractor who isn't a wine cellar pro an understanding of the critical elements of design and construction to help them anticipate the issues involved in building a cellar. The book falls short in that regard.I agree with the reviewer above that this book could have been half as long. As someone who was already inclined to build a cellar, I was already familiar enough with wine to know how to serve it. I wasn't looking for a contractor's advice on that subject. What I was looking for was detailed information on planning/design issues and construction methods. The information in this book that I found helpful on those topics was less than complete and was limited to about a dozen pages."},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","review":"I am planning to build a 2,000 bottle cellar myself and have found the published literature on the subject inadequate. After purchasing this book, I am no better off than I was prior to reading it. The book is so general that unless you do not know what wine is, it will tell you almost nothing you do not already know. It spends an inordinate amount of time discussing things like how to install and use a wine cooler. I own two wine coolers already and I assume almost everyone planning a wine cellar knows what a wine cooler is and how to turn one on. It spends a bunch of time on wine drinking, selection and pouring which is not what anyone buying this book is looking for. It also spends time discussing how to put shelves in a closet or under stairs, all of which is common sense. I need help on what type of vapor barrier to buy, how thick the studs should be, what is the best lighting to use, what coolers are best, what insulation will handle moisture the best, how to level a basement floor prior to installing tile, what types of wall finishes are best, what wood is best for racks, what stain is best, what themometers and humidity sensors are best, most efficient and best looking floor plans, etc. This book offers no solutions to the real issues with building a cellar. I found more real information doing a few hours of web blog searches than I found in the same amount of time reading this book. I found the Richard Gold book on the subject much more informative even though it focuses on passive cellars and has no pretty color pictures."},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","review":"This is a pretty book. It has nice pictures of some very pretty cellars. From a practical standpoint though, only about 25% of it is actually worthwhile. They should offer a scaled down version at at quarter of the price."},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","review":"According to his bio, Mr. Sims is a master carpenter who runs a wine cellar construction business based near Sacramento. I was initially concerned that this book was going to serve solely as an advertorial for Mr. Sims' business, and it turned out that this fear was well-founded. However, it was only in so much as that the work Mr. Sims does displays a fine and impressive level of craftsmanship, and that the construction of large-scale wine cellars is not for the average lay crafts-person. Anyone interested in constructing a home cellar should take a look at this guide, but should be forewarned. Afterward it will be hard not to want Mr. Sims to oversee your personal project.The guide starts by taking the reader through the various \\"hows and whys of wine storage.\\" Much of this information is useful, but fairly basic. The book then leads into various storage options, the pros-and-cons of each option, and how that particular option is constructed. The majority of the explanations are helpful and detailed, while not being overly-complex. The two greatest assets of the guide are the step-by-step DIY instructions (photos included) and the authors awareness that not everyone wants, or is capable of owning, a massive wine cellar. Mr. Sims takes this to heart by providing chapters on installing self-contained (ie. under kitchen counter) storage units, and on tackling space conversions. The information on these conversions is particularly interesting, including how to convert a bookcase, a wardrobe closet, and under-utilized spaces (ie. under a stairwell) to meet specific storage needs.Although the later parts of the book focus on larger-scale construction projects (the kind it might be best to have a professional contractor tackle), the same step-by-step instructions are there for those projects as well. These instructions cover everything from interior-wall vapor barriers to fine finishing options.The only qualms I had with this book were with the content and organization of the final chapter. It strays a bit into auxiliary topics such as wine and food pairings, and has section titles like \\"The Tasting Ritual,\\" which are not completely relevant to the main thesis.Overall, I give the guide high marks. It is easy to understand and it flows well from chapter to chapter. It is well-organized, all of the photos are high-res, topically relevant and in color, and many of the examples are delightful and inspiring in nature.This is certainly a book I will keep around and refer back to. Although I have yet to personally tackle any of the construction projects in it, eventually I plan to integrate pieces of this publication into some of my other favorite construction ideas in the building of a future home."},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","review":"Covers everything I needed - mainly ideas for room and rack construction plus some decorative design concepts.

The language and diction are just perfect (though I recommend a good Spanish dictionary because some words can be tricky), making you travel to this very remote place and experience ice, magnets, telegraphs, trains and bananas for the very first time.This is without a doubt, one of the best books you'll ever read. Get a piece of paper, write down the family tree (because it will get confusing) and enjoy the ride.\\"...porque las estirpes condenadas a cien a&ntilde;os de soledad no tienen una segunda oportunidad sobre la tierra.\\""},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"Really great book.

However, this edition provided me with information that I completely missed from my first reading. There are way too many details in the story and the footnotes pointed out all of them. Some, I agree, are less important, but most of them help the reader understand the complex and fascinating matrix of lives of this fantastic book."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"I first read this book in the 'sixties, when it came out. I lived in Colombia then. It would still be a few years before anyone in the world outside would read it in translation.Since then, living in other places far from Colombia, I have re-read it several times, both in translation and in the original. In English, it comes across as a very, very odd story, much in same the way Colombia can strike visitors as an elusive, enigmatic place. But in Spanish, the book evokes the sounds and smells of Colombia so powerfully, that you have the sensation of actually being there, alongside the Magdalena River.No translation can ever capture that quality. The power of a great storyteller's art is there in other languages, but not Colombia's innermost soul. Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, a friend of Garcia Marquez's, who wrote a biographical sketch of him, had that in mind when he entitled it &quot;El olor de la guayaba,&quot; i.e. the smell of fallen fruit beginning to rot. Mendoza, also a Colombian, although from a completely different part of the country, may have been too closely touched to be able to talk about it. In any event he does not, the title notwithstanding.In the 'eighties I lived in Spain, and every Wednesday a major newspaper there had a column by the by-then-world-famous Nobel laureate, who lived in Barcelona. Half his columns were about politics, and forgettable. But the other half, which were about everything else, fairly shimmered with inspiration.Gabo has written a lot in his life, but hands down the best of it, and the distilled essence of all of it, is in that one novel. Once you read it, you'll never again be able to look at yellow butterflies, mariposas amarillas, without seeing ghosts."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"No soy muy afecto a leer novelas, prefiero temas de historia natural, biolog&iacute;a o f&iacute;sica, pero esto fue increible.

But beware of this particular edition. It has footnotes. Not illuminating notes. Not guiding notes. Not explanatory notes. Just dumb, distracting, unneeded, unasked for notes. If you can avoid reading them, great. I, for one, can't avoid looking at the footnotes, and in this case, the pleasure of reading an insanely great novel sours into the anger of being interrupted with subnormal comments (do you need to be reminded of a phrase that appears a few lines before?), long-winded diversions (do you really need the definition of the Real Academia Espa&ntilde;ola to understand what is a Yuca?) or truly gratuitous opinions of the editor, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme. I am lucky the book I bought also had some imperfections in the cover, so I had a formal reason to return it. Now I am buying another edition, free of footnotes. It will be a bit more expensive, but I know, because I've read the book many times, that an unobstructed reading of Cien Anos de Soledad is worth it."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"One of the best books written originally in Spanish by Nobel Prize Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Un libro con el que se puede identificar cualquier latinoamericano por todo lo que tiene de cotidiano y de supersticioso. La historia tiene ciertas similitudes con la Biblia (G&eacute;nesis, Exodo, Evangelios) , con las Mil y Una Noches y otras literaturas; lo que hacen que leerla le parezca a uno muy familiar aparte de que el lenguaje que utiliza Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez es muy sencillo y cotidiano. Nadie que la lea olvidar&aacute; jam&aacute;s a Ursula, o a Fernanda del Carpio, a Remedios la Bella o a cualquiera de los Aurelianos o Jos&eacute; Arcadios. Es un libro adictivo para aquellos que dan sus primeros pasos en la buena literatura.Despu&eacute;s del Quijote, la mejor novela escrita en espa&ntilde;ol, pero tambi&eacute;n la mejor novela contemporanea de nuestros tiempos. Es por eso, impresindible leer esta genial novela.Un atractivo extra de esta edici&oacute;n son las notas al pie de p&aacute;gina que da Jacques Joset, que permiten al lector aclarar muchas dudas acerca de donde tom&aacute; el autor nombres de personajes o de lugares.

Macondo and the Buendia Family are the perfect metaphores if you really want to tell an undercover story about the world, the humankind and its abouts. It's totally magic. It's charming and funny. It's deep and joyfully shallow and full of life, life in a town that has survived more than one hundred years of solitude.

Let's write a book in a \\"circular\\" time and place pattern and confuse the hell out of all the readers. Yes, we get it, the style of writing is symbolic of the cycle of life described in the book: it is a never-ending cyclic nightmare! What most annoys me about this book, however, is the literary snobbery of pseudo-literary fans who drop the name Gabriel Garcia Marquez as if he were the biggest literary genius of all time just because he wrote a book with almost no punctuation and a jumbled up storyline! Yes, life in the Caribbean is just as frustrating as this book, and no, don't live there or read this book if you don't want to drive yourself nuts."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"It's well-written and the characters are well developed, but I must say that the story is just horrible.

I had already read this author's \\"Putas tristes\\", and his autobiography, \\"Vivir para contarla\\". In the latter book Garc&iacute;a mentioned that he had read Romulo Gallegos when he was young. The latter's book, \\"D&oacute;&ntilde;a B&aacute;rbara\\", which truly IS a classic of Latin American writing. I found Garc&iacute;a's book to have the same theme (\\"the struggle between landowners and peasants in L.A.), and even the style, to be essentially the same. Many other Latin authors, such as Isabel Allende, seem to also use the same plagiaristic ploy. Another thing annoying about Garc&iacute;a is his self-admitted tendency to employ outrageous exagerations with a straight face. In one episode of \\"Cien a&ntilde;os\\" he describes a man so strong he carries a store counter from a store out into the street, and it too eleven men to get it back in.

La le&iacute; hace un par de a&ntilde;os, casi al mismo tiempo que La Ciudad y los Perros y Conversaci&oacute;n en la Catedral, ambas salidas de la inigualable pluma de Vargas Llosa. Pero, es ah&iacute; donde empiezan, justamente, las discrepancias con las revisiones. S&oacute;lo porque haya ganado el Premio Nobel no se va a convertir de la noche a la ma&ntilde;ana en el mejor escritor sudamericano. Recordemos, pues, que el propio Vargas Llosa no lo ha ganado s&oacute;lo por dos motivos: es de derecha, mientras que los suecos son todos de izquierda (hablo de pol&iacute;tica, se&ntilde;ores). Y segundo, no ha escrito a&uacute;n una obra que destaque y profundice la naturaleza humana, como lo hizo Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez con su &uacute;nica obra rescatable: Cien A&ntilde;os de Soledad; las dem&aacute;s son, francamente, unas bazofias. Cualquier persona, en tanto, que haya le&iacute;do Cien A&ntilde;os de Soledad y Conversaci&oacute;n en la Catedral, no puede negar que la diferencia de calidad no es mucha (yo prefiero, por ejemplo, la conversaci&oacute;n). Mi punto es que hay m&aacute;s de veinticinco revisiones de las obras del colombiano, mientras que las del peruano s&oacute;lo ostentan una que otra. Y mi indignaci&oacute;n no surge s&oacute;lo porque yo prefiera a este &uacute;ltimo, sino que porque en latinoamerica ambos son conocidos, y Vargas Llosa se respeta, adem&aacute;s, como intelectual; no anda diciendo, por ejemplo, que se deber&iacute;a eliminar la ortograf&iacute;a. Por otro lado, yo mismo no creo que pueda decirle a nadie qu&eacute; tipo de libro debe leer, o cu&aacute;l deba gustarle, pero creo que no se debe decir tampoco que es lo mejor de lo mejor cuando algunas personas no lo piensan as&iacute;. Y, para terminar esta cr&iacute;tica poco constructiva, tal vez, quiero aclarar que un escritor siempre se ve influenciado por lo que lee: a todos les ha pasado. Entonces, no se puede decir que La Casa de los Esp&iacute;ritus sea una vil copia, pues todas las obras de Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez son, a su vez, malas copias, usando el mismo lenguaje de las revisiones, de las obras de Faulkner, Kafka, y muchos otros escritores de la &eacute;poca. Los estilos, como es debido con las cosas buenas, se copian, pero no como plagio, sino que porque el escritor reci&eacute;n est&aacute; cre&aacute;ndose uno propio. Es algo obvio que no puede dejarse pasar por la cr&iacute;tica: La Casa de los Esp&iacute;ritus es la primera obra de Isabel Allende; no se la puede juzgar por eso."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"From the very start, this novel was a page turner.

The terrible humidity of Macondo overwhelms us and in the meantime leads to new coordinates of the historic perspective, where time and space are badly drawn and the sensation of vertigo and insecurity involves the reader.With this work, Garcia Marquez not only achieved that coveted pearl so many times described in Mythology that represents the summon of the creative pinnacle; besides he opened the gate for the rest of the world to discover that famous phrase, wedged by Vasconcelos: \\"Latin America: the cosmic race\\"We can find similar parallelisms if we take a look around: Picasso and Guernica, Schubert and his String Quintet Op.163This pyramidal feat so many times desired and so few times achieved, not only consolidated the prestige of his creator, but simultaneously allowed the rest of the world to acquire a vertiginous interest for other notable writers of the fantastic literature, such Onetti, Horacio Quiroga, Borges, Bioy Casares, Cortazar or Miguel Angel Asturias."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon.com because I wanted to re-read this Spanish language masterpiece.

I have this memory of reading Chronicle of a Death Foretold and not making too much sense of it, not really understanding what was the point.More than 20 years later, I received One Hundred Years of Solitude as a gift and gave it chance. What a reversal! This book might not be necessarily a page-turner, but it surely opens your mind and twists it a little bit. Two features stand out:a) The powerful and rich prose of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. He was a distinct ability to combine words in new and forceful ways. You're quietly reading and then, pow!, you get this unexpected mix of words. This mix you never imagine could be done, but now that it's there, it feels as if there was no other way to put it (I refer here to the Spanish version of the book)b) The clear sense that there are several layers to the story. And for this I accept my limitations and lack of formal literary training. I barely could feel there was more to the story. I am sure scholars have a field day with this work.In case anyone wonders, this book tells the story of the Buendia family. They settle in a small town (Macondo) in the countryside of an unnamed country (which we could assume is Colombia) and, through generations, live the ups and downs of Macondo."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"Increible historia, con un final tragicopero un contenido que te mantiene con el hasta el final,personalmente pienso que los personajes si se merecian una segunda oportunidad despues de decifrar los manuscritos de Melquiades.Todos necesitamos segundas oportunidades."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"Entre la soledad y el AmorEntre la soledad y el amor puede ocurrir :Sentimiento de Soledad y en el Amor su redencion."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"The book was in great condition and at a good price!

Yo he caminado de la mano con este libro a travez de sus curenta y cuatro anos. Andaba en el tercer ano de bachillerato y habia cumplido trece anos. La profesora de literatura nos dijo que lo leeriamos aunque era un libro demasiado complicado para nuestra edad, pero creia que merecia la pena intentarlo. Yo lo disfrute mucho, y en ese momento no tenia idea de que no habia entendido ni el 1% del libro, pero desde entonces ha formado parte de mi vida. Lo fui entendiendo a medida que trataba de entender este mundo que me toco vivir. Lo he comprado y perdido muchas veces, pero como se convirtio en mi biblia, siempre lo reemplazo por uno nuevo. Los que dicen que es ficcion estan muy equivocados, es la mas cruda realidad del mundo desde sus comienzos, retrata la creacion del mundo en un pueblito imaginario, y se atreve incluso a retratar el final. Se puede encontrar a Balzac a Conrad, la politica, la ciencia, la religiones, todo lo que quieran esta en este libro. Solo que fue escrito con ironia y humor, para que nos riamos en vez de llorar. Para no tener que sucidarnos, como les sucedia a los que leian a Werther. No es gratuito que los mas grandes escritores de nuestro tiempo le dediquen tantos elogios, como los que escribieron sus ensayos para esta edicion en homenaje a los cuarenta anos de publicacion. O que el escritor estadounidense William Kennedy se atreva a decir que es el libro que todos tenemos la misma obligacion de leer que tenemos de hacerlo con El genesis.Siempre regreso a el porque siempre tiene algo nuevo que decirme. Y esta edicion esta muy bien empastada, y tiene como bono adicioanal el aporte que grandes escritores le hacen a esta maravilla para que la gente ahorre algunos anos de los que a mi me han costado para entender auque sea alguna parte de su mensaje."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"I loved this book, I am buying all the books by the same author.

What's great about this version is that it comes with literary notes that help you appreciate the depth of this book by pointing out details that one could never detect in a first reading--unless you are brighter than your average person.

Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez hat ein monumentales und im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes epochales Meisterwerk geschaffen, das, vom Wandel der Zeiten unber&uuml;hrt, Bestand f&uuml;r die Ewigkeit haben wird. Durch das virtuose Arangement des verwirrenden Figurenensembles und eine unnachahmlich lebensvolle Schilderung des Lebens seiner Protagonisten gelingt Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez mittels ausgefeilter Erz&auml;hltechnik des reifen Romanciers im Zenit seines K&ouml;nnens die &uuml;berzeugende Darstellung einer sich &uuml;ber sechs Generationen erstreckenden Familiensaga vor dem Hintergrund der j&uuml;ngeren Geschichte Lateinamerikas. Im Zentrum der Handlung steht die Sippe der Buend&iacute;as, deren Schicksal eng mit dem ihres Heimatortes Macondo verbunden ist. Trotz verzweifelter Anstrengungen gelingt es ihr nicht, ihrem von Anfang an vorherbestimmten unabwendbaren Schicksal, der Ausl&ouml;schung der Sippe, zu entkommen. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez ist der Chronist dieser Vorg&auml;nge und schildert das Schicksal der Buend&iacute;as von der Gr&uuml;ndung Macondos bis zu dessen letztendlichem gleichsam apokalyptischen Untergang in einem verheerenden Wirbelsturm. Der Leser indes bleibt nach der Lekt&uuml;re mit der Erkenntnis zur&uuml;ck, da&szlig; Zeit mehr ist als eine Koordinate in unserem raumzeitlichen Koordinatensystem, n&auml;mlich da&szlig; sie verschiedene Geschwindigkeiten annehmen, da&szlig; sie sich umkehren, da&szlig; sie wieder an ihren Ausgangspunkt zu&uuml;ckkehren, ja da&szlig; sie sogar eine Qualit&auml;t annehmen kann. Ursula, die Stammutter aller Buend&iacute;as, hat dies als erste erkannt, als sie in hellsichtiger Vorausahnung von der &quot;schlechten Qualit&auml;t&quot; der Zeit sprach und somit auf nicht weniger als die Tatsache hinwies, da&szlig; mit dem Ende der Zeit auch Mocondo und der Stamm der Buend&iacute;as ihre Existenz beschlie&szlig;en w&uuml;rden. &quot;Hundert Jahre Einsamkeit&quot; ist ein gro&szlig;er Roman, der sich jedoch nicht unbedingt beim ersten Lesen erschlie&szlig;t. Andererseits er&ouml;ffnet die abermalige Lekt&uuml;re unter Umst&auml;nden v&ouml;llig neue Fecetten des Verst&auml;ndnisses. Ein so komplexes und vielschichtiges Werk wie dieses ist denn auch wert, immer wieder gelesen werden. Aus diesem Grunde wird &quot;Hundert Jahre Einsamkeit&quot; ganz gewi&szlig; niemals eine abschlie&szlig;ende Interpretation erfahren k&ouml;nnen. Als Lesende ist es letztlich an uns, einen Sinn zu entdecken und mit ihm Einsichten zu gewinnen, die unser Leben positiv beeinflussen. &quot;Hundert Jahre Einsamkeit&quot; geh&ouml;rt ohne Zweifel zu jener Kategorie von B&uuml;chern, die Standpunkte ver&auml;ndern."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"A long saga of a family; this is a Nobel Prize author, you know.

El libro pasa las cuatro generaciones de la familia Buend&iacute;a despu&eacute;s que Jos&eacute; Arcadio se estableci&oacute; sobre la tierra firme al fondo de la ci&eacute;naga - en poco tiempo la aldea tuvo 300 personas. El grupo de habitantes se estableci&oacute; en una regi&oacute;n alrededor de los indignes y los campamentos de gitanos. Al principio del libro, un gitano, Melqu&iacute;ades, un gran sabio de los conocimientos antiguos, present&iacute;a a las nuevas llegadas. De hecho, Melqu&iacute;ades, sus frascos, sus escritos y sus pergaminos queda presente en la historia de la familia Buend&iacute;a hasta el fin del libro.La evoluci&oacute;n de la historia de Macondo sigue una curva haciendo alarde a la familia. Despu&eacute;s la primera generaci&oacute;n que hab&iacute;a establecido el pueblo, los Buend&iacute;a ten&iacute;an un papel importante. La segunda generaci&oacute;n estuve muy preocupado por la guerra. Durante veinte a&ntilde;os Aureliano Buend&iacute;a, el hijo de Jos&eacute; Arcadio, lucha en la guerra civil que opon&iacute;a los partidos lib&eacute;rales y conservadores. El coronel Aureliano y la mayor&iacute;a de la poblaci&oacute;n de Macondo sosten&iacute;an los liberales que quer&iacute;an la revisi&oacute;n de t&iacute;tulos de propiedad para una repartici&oacute;n mas justa de las tierras. Pero al fin de la guerra, los dos partidos acordaron por abandonar esta exigencia. Para Aureliano esta traici&oacute;n fue el punto final - dijo \\"desde este momento solo luchamos por el poder.\\"Para la tercera generaci&oacute;n, el desarrollo del pueblo fue una preocupaci&oacute;n muy grande. Aureliano Triste, nieto de Jos&eacute; Arcadio, con la colaboraci&oacute;n de otros empresarios, llevaba un ferrocarril para unir Macondo a los centros urbanos. Entonces, Macondo se convert&iacute;a en un centro de producci&oacute;n de banano. Una empresa americana se estableci&oacute;, import&oacute; los trabajadores, construy&oacute; nuevas casas y los barrios del pueblo. Pero, en la &uacute;ltima generaci&oacute;n, toda esta prosperidad cay&oacute; durante un per&iacute;odo catastr&oacute;fico de cuatro a&ntilde;os once meses y dos d&iacute;as de lluvia. La empresa de banano quebr&oacute;, los trabajadores dejaran Macondo y quedaron los barrios y las casas desertas y en ruina.Esa novela no es f&aacute;cil a leer, Garcia Marquez tiene un vocabulario muy rico, describe en detalla las personalidades del libro y utilaza muchas palabras y expresiones colombianas que no son todav&iacute;a f&aacute;cil a comprender. Pero, la lectura de esta historia vale la pe&ntilde;a, ella presenta muy bien los deferentes niveles de la sociedad, los conflictos y las costumbres. De m&aacute;s, todos los temas de la novela, de la familia y del pueblo ven conjuntas en un fin muy espectacular y horrible. Para mi, Cien A&ntilde;os es un de los mejores historias que ha le&iacute;do despu&eacute;s algunas a&ntilde;os."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"I'm not one to praise or hype above deserved merit. Cien A&ntilde;os De Soledad, which I read in its original language - Spanish, is the best book I've read. While some may find it confusing, it actually gets easier as you read on.I tend to breeze through books but this book prevented me for doing so. Albeit for a bit of its complexity but more so because you want to enjoy every minute of it. There are many things, which you know are impossible in the real world, but you want to believe and you do believe in the end.Some may say that it's a slow read and that some parts are even boring, well, yes, some parts are boring but not so much a flaw of the writing but a way for the reader to really get to know each character thoroughly without distraction.Another point to note, and the best part to me, is the ending. Most books end with the love-couple finally getting together or the killer finally revealed or the main character somehow overcoming their worst fears, not this one, no sir, this is the mother of all endings. The Sixth Sense's ending is crap compared to the ending of Cien A&ntilde;os De Soledad."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"Hay que tener en cuenta que GGM fue finalmente reconocido y premiado justamente por este libro.

This is the story of the Buendia family, a town call Macondo and it's inhabitants, throughout the decades and generations Buendias . As background to this Marquez offers the Colombia of a period of civil war and political isntability at all levels. Although this novel is far from being a political banner of any kind it does offer a satisfying taste satire and magic. Garcia Marquez at his best narrative style, fills this story with chaotic and obsessive characters that take the reader through a land of alchimy, Gypsies and bounless unending love that breakes the reason of mind. This book is highly recomended to any one who has a taste for stories of the strugles of the mind and the some times the blury line between the magic of this world and irrelevancy of our lives.

If the averages found in both these ways is the same, then the system is called ergotic.Buendia familly in this sence was ergotic.

Even though a lot of the names repeat, very common in our culture (I'm a Venezuelan so similarities with Colombia are many), he manages to let you know how different and at the same time similar those persons are.The book covers everything, romance, adventure, politics, war and all of it without leaving Macondo (the small caribbean town when everything happens).

The books also can be classified. For example, into good and bad ones. In this case \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" is a good book. Or they can be classifies into great and good. Therefore \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" is considered a great book. Or into those, which got a Nobel Prize and those, which did not. Marques got Nobel Prize for his book \\"100 Years of Solitude\\". But to classify the contents of this book and to tell what is this book about...? it's next to impossible. It is about small town Macondo on the bank of the river, which runs its clear water in the white-stone polished bed. It's about the world of Latin America, quite a new world, that some things even do not have a name, and have to be pointed with the finger... About six generations of Buandia family... About love, loneliness and death. About endless cyclic recurrence and reiteration of love, loneliness and death. Reiteration, but already in other people, other characters, words and other life. In the life, which is impossible without love, loneliness and death. What amazes most in the book - is the great number of people, destinies and plots. Just imagine - the talented Shakespeare specialist made up his mind to summarize each Shakespeare play in one page. He has to carefully preserve grandeur, language, tragedy and humor. He selects two-three best quotations, unites the characters of all plays together as relatives or citizens of one town. He replaces castles and palaces by streets, where simple white houses sink in the heat under almond-trees for half a year, and for the rest of the year they sail in the rain like ships in an autumn sea. Replaces swords and man's sleeveless jackets by simple homemade clothes. Replaces crowded Europe by boundless selva, by poppy fields, where one can find the island of Spanish galleon and the Cordilleras, with peaks, buried in snow and clouds. The book might tuned out to be praise-worthy. But to make it similar to \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" it had to be saturated with unique rhythm and atmosphere of Latin America, as Marques did. One of his interview cited that the most difficult for him was to present the language of the novel. He had to tell this in such a manner, like his forefathers did: impassively, with absolute firm calmness, which can not be destroyed even if the world turns upside down. This fascination of impassivity in the face of joy and sorrow, impassivity, but not heartlessness, could not have appeared in Marques characters without any reason. It needed about 400 years of mixing blood of Spanish adventurer-conquistadors, which contained both European and Moorish blood, with Indian blood, which originated the art of patient waiting. Waiting, which is similar to many-hour immobility of condor soaring above the mountain canyons. It needed to happen mixing of risk of bullfights with ferocity of cockfights, mixing of Arabic and catholic styles of architecture in Spain, brought through calm and storm of the Atlantic, with the nature of Latin America, with jungles and salt sea winds. It needed to happen to give birth to an old man, which paid attention neither to ardent rose bushes, nor to spilled shine of sunset, and could answer the question of a stranger, which dared to break his loneliness: - What are you doing, colonel? - I am just sitting and waiting when coffin with my body will be carried by.The novel \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" to some extend is written like a mirror. Marques looked into it and saw the town of his childhood, his granny, bustling about, and his grandpa, the veteran of the Civil war. Any reader of this book can look at himself in the mirror. In one of the pages he will see the reflection of his love, loneliness or death. But there is nothing sad in it. The life comes back again and again, but only Macondo will have been destroyed by hurricane and have been escaped from human memory. Those human generations, which are condemned to hundred years of loneliness, are not fated to appear on the Earth twice."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"Esta nueva edicion conmemorativa a cargo de la Real Academia Espanola en conjuncion con la Asociacion de academias de la lengua espanola pone en manos del lector la novela de Garcia Marquez consagrada ya como un clasico de la literatura universal. Aunque esta edicion tiene el merito de compilar una serie de ensayos de escritores de la talla de Carlos Fuentes, Vargas Llosa, Alvaro Mutis, Claudio Guillen, entre otros; una extensa bibliografia y un utilisimo glosario, el lector que se inicia en esta obra deberia complementar su lectura con la insuperable edicion critica de Catedra que trae, ademas, notas a pie de paginas, ausente desgraciadamente en la presente edicion.

Si se mantiene la mente alerta y se tiene una intensa suspicacia, Cien a&ntilde;os de Soledad ofrece mas de lo que aparenta ofrecer.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a genius when writing novels and this is a example of why.This novel takes hold of you from the first sentence, and does not let you go until the very end. Its a story of a mans life flashing before his eyes, and the generation of his family throughout the book. A chronological tale that takes you back and forth through time, describing the impact that a family has in the formation of a town that later becomes a city.A very emotional novel, telling stories of life a death, grief and happiness, love and hate, that by the time you finish reading it you would feel that you are a part of the book.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves great Latino literature, because this is truly a south American jewel."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"I am a follower of Marquez and have read most of his works.

Great transaction. Would purchase from seller again."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"In this, his magnum opus detailing the historical arc of the Buendia family in the fictional near-Caribbean town of Macondo, Marquez is stupefyingly inventive and constantly violates the basic storytelling principle of \\"show, don't tell.\\" That's a good thing, because if he didn't a book where so much happens would be three thousand pages long, in which case I wouldn't have the stamina to read it in the original. Reading alternately in Spanish and English, I found that, in addition to increasing my vocabulary of fancypants literary Spanish by scads of rarely useful words that I've mostly forgotten since, I kept thinking, \\"Well I thought I was following what was going on pretty well, but what I think just happened is too weird to make sense, so I must be wrong.\\" But then I'd read the English version to find out that yes, everyone in town *had* fallen ill with a variety of insomnia causing progressive amnesia, or that an orphan girl *had* shown up at the house with a bag bearing the incessant jumping and clicking bones of her parents, or whatever. That's magical realism for you.I wasn't very good with literary Spanish when I started, but Marquez consistently rewarded my slow, dogged efforts to understand what was going on by putting something funny or amazing in almost every paragraph. At first I found it infuriating that he decided to only use two first names for all the generations of male members of the Buendia family, but I gradually got used to it. The only thing that bothered me a bit in the end was that he spent so much time on the clan's long, circling decline into the dust, and I didn't enjoy inhabiting their lingering, interminable decrepitude quite so much as some others apparently have."},{"Title":"Cien Anos De Soledad","review":"This is a (seriously) great novel... one of the strongest reasons to learn Spanish....

With a few interesting twists along the way it makes for an intriguing read ,however the names can get a little confusing .If you are not very good with names ,the family tradition of naming all of the males with very similar names, in very simmilar combinations mixed with the pace of the book (100 years in just over 400 pages) it may leave a little lost.

How's that for the Dumbing Up of America?).Also of note: The eerie realization that the tone of TYM is very similar to his father's 1942 biography of John Barrymore, \\"Goodnight Sweet Prince\\"; and the last poem ever written by Robert Hillyar, which had then been sent to Gene in honor of their friendship - mailed only hours before the poet's sudden death on December 24, 1961."},{"Title":"The young man from Denver","review":"the book delivered is in terrible condition. the dust jacket was badly frayed and stained and pages torn out. i will not trust 'flabears book market' to deliver what they offer. it is a shame that this memoir of a great author was sold in this condition"},{"Title":"Art forms in nature","review":"Anyone who 'knows' Dover books, will probably agree that they offer good quality for very reasonable prices. There is nothing 'wrong' with this book, except that all the plates are in black and white, and there is no information on Haeckel and his times. Prestel has also published this book of plates, with a highly informative article on Haeckel, his influences, and those influenced by him included, AND with many of the plates 'in color' (that is, often one color in different -subtle - hues, or a color scheme based on two colors). Unless you are a strictly 'black and white' person, I would advise you to look for the Prestel book."},{"Title":"Art forms in nature","review":"Many patterns in nature are often overlooked. Haeckel captures the natural beauty of living creatures, presenting them in such a way as to spotlight their delicate forms. This black and white rendition of Haeckel's artwork is very impressive, adding a quality perhaps more pleasing to the modern eye than the color originals. Although no written text accompanies the plates, one still understands what the artist is conveying. Haeckel's grouping of the organisms in a very detailed, scientific manner is at the same time aesthetically pleasing to both scientists and nonscientists."},{"Title":"Art forms in nature","review":"I purchased this book as a reference book for my personal library and found that my children also love it.

My 10 year old lovers to try to draw the images and identify them.This book is not for someone looking for photographic images."},{"Title":"Art forms in nature","review":"Buyer Beware! Even though the cover is in color (deceptively so in my opinion), all of the images in this book are in black & white! I wish I had read the description more carefully before buying. The colors in Haeckel's images are a HUGE part of what makes them so amazing. Check out the Haeckel images at Wikimedia Commons (commons.wikimedia.org) to see what I mean. Rendering them in black & white is a grotesque defacement of his work in my opinion."},{"Title":"Art forms in nature","review":"I recommend a different version of this book, also sold on Amazon - link below.

However, he's most surely better known for his incessant visual chronicling of our planet's oddest lifeforms and their myriad variations of form and color. In his article on the Public Domain Review, Dr Mario A. Di Gregorio, professor of the History of Science at the University of L'Aquila and author ofFrom Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith (Religion Theologie und Naturwissenschaft / Religion Theology and Natural Science (RThN)), offers insight into the origins of Haeckel's theories and the mind-bending art that came from his obsessive depictions of the Kunstformen der Natur, or \\"the Art Forms of Nature,\\" which Haeckel published in 1904. You'll stumble upon copies of this book in just about every format (Dover paperback with CD-ROM, for example, since its contents are in the public domain) in almost any new or used bookstore and should be a staple of your visual junk collection if there ever was one.

Nick, Cristine, and their son Joey, find peace and harmony in a beach community on the north shore where it seems everyone owns a boat, except them. Alas, their peace and harmony is shattered when they return from a party at their neighbor's and find their dog, Sleazy, decapitated. Then Nick seems to be spending a lot of time at their neighbor's pool listening to the beautiful and enchanting Karla, the neighbor's daughter, sing songs with her ultra clear, and messmerizing voice. But something has changed in Nick. He has become moody, and sullen, not at all his usual happy go lucky self. In fact, he has become abusive towards Christine, and distant to his son. Then Christine's alcoholic aunt, Henrietta, arrives on the scene to add a little much needed humor to the mix. And things go steadily downhill from there for the Marinos. There's a terrible beast lurking aoutside in the woods. A beast that can not only decapatate dogs (one being a full grown Great Dane!). But also a horse! Literally tearing them apart, limb from limb, and leaving them bloodless. no it's not another vampire story. Oh no. Not at all. It's something else.

That would spoil all the fun and make me a Troll.I found this book to be rather fun, and though the characters are a bit two dimesional, I must say that the story moved right along and held my interest until the very end. There were some nice twists along the way, and after I finished it, I said right out loud to my dogs, 'See, that's what happens to bad dogs.', they knew just what I was saying, too, but I also said right out loud, 'that was a fun book'. And it was, in fact, it made me want to read more by Rrobert C. Sloane. And after all is said and done, I suppose that is what every author wishes for, when they put pen to paper, or keyboard to screen.jvp333"},{"Title":"Origines celticae (a fragment) and other contributions to the history of Britain,","review":"This book is a masterpiece of a little known English scholar who dedicated over 40 years of his life to finding, cataloging and confirming the data concerning the origines and history of the Celtic Race.

It is the story of a stagecoach stationmaster's last moments of life. Unforgettable.

This army was involved in the fighting at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, the carnage at Shiloh, and finally entered Northern Mississippi at Corinth - which began the initial phase of the march on Vicksburg.Force later went on to serve under Sherman at Atlanta, and during Hood's desperate counterattacks was gravely wounded. However he survived and later became a prominent judge and politician in his native Ohio.Along with a number of other former Union Civil War officers, Force helped write the multi-volume \\"Campaigns of the Civil War\\" series in the early and mid-1880s. The series became extremely popular with that generation which was beginning to forget about the Civil War.Even after over 20 years, General Force was able to provide his reads with a sense of the scope of Grant's plans in the spring of 1862. He also sheds light on the operations and generalship of John Pope, who was then a rising star in the Union Army by his successes at New Madrid, Island Number 10, and Corinth - only to fail fast when he went east to confront Bobby Lee later that year. Here Force shows that Pope was NOT the braggart or ne'er do well later Civil War histories made him out to be, as his campaigns along the Mississippi were just as successful as Grant's were, though he faced considerably less resistance.Force honorably sheds light too, on Grant's opposite - the well-respected and reluctant Confederate Major General Albert Sidney Johnston, quoting much from the late General's son's biography. Forced south after the fall of Fort Donelson, Johnston turned around and surprised Grant at Shiloh Church (Pittsburg Landing) only to be mortally wounded in a description by Force that is pretty terse rather than the dramatic tales of how he could have lived had a tourniquet been applied. With Johnston's death, and the arrival of Union reinforcements, the Confederate surge collapsed - and the Union armies was able to clear western Tennessee and North Mississippi of their foe. With his military experience, General Force was able to illuminate much of the action and tactics involved during this major battle as well as the other campaigns mentioned in this work.This reprint has the original tiny lettering and ink maps of the period, so it may be a bit difficult to read, as all of the books in this series are. Still, it is a major account of the Shiloh Campaign, and a wonderful addition by a former serving officer in the Civil War enthusiast's bookshelf."},{"Title":"From Fort Henry to Corinth (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"My Great-grand-father Samuel Carson Smith was with the 12th Iowa Volunteer Infantry from 1861 until 1866.

I've only completed 25% of From Fort Henry to Corinth, and I'm very excited about the up-dated information I've read. The 12th Iowa held the center of the line at the Hornet's Nest at the battle of Shiloh and I'm looking forward to From Fort Henry to Corinth's accounting of a very controversial history of this battle.

Meanwhile let us read this present dismal history of one of our early colonialist enterprises as if well and truly limed by this Oxfordian scholar Raymond Carr, chosen by the editorial team as one who bears no ideological ax to grind, and thus published by the academic Vintage Classics in its Twentieth Century Fund Study series.This thick 500 page study serves the interests of every researcher from neophyte to the field to those seeking a valuable, reliable and comprehensive resource under one cover for any academic and historical purpose.As the Director of the Twentieth Century Fund, MJ Rossant, explains their difficulty a quarter century ago in selecting a researcher for this project who had not already made up their mind regarding the relationship of the USA with Puerto Rico: \\"The major problem in mounting a Puerto Rican study had been the difficulty of finding a scholar whether Puerto Rican or American (sic - Puerto Ricans are US citizens and America encompasses an entire hemisphere of separate nations, Rossant himself displays prejudicial thought patterns and set political paradigms in this one word) who had not already made up his (sic) mind about what the relationship ought to be. The Puerto Rican scholars, I must add, are even more committed to specific points of view than Americans (sic) perhaps because nothing is more important to them than the US relationship with Puerto Rico. Our solution, arrived at after careful deliberation, was to interest an English scholar, one who could handle the peculiar history of the Puerto Rican - US relationship with dispassion and sensitivity, in the project. In Raymond Carr, a (sic) historian noted for his work on Spain, now Warden of St. Anthony's College, and formerly professor of Latin American studies at Oxford, we found the ideal choice for the assignment (p. viii).\\"Overlooking for now the underlying and fallacious misconceptions evident in that statement, let us see the back matter which states: \\"In its depth and insight (this work) is certain to prove a major contribution to the resolution, not only of the growing controversy over the political status of Puerto Rico, but of the larger problems of colonialism and imperialism in the modern world.\\"Although such a \\"resolution\\" is even further off now than ever, unless through a deeply undesirable violent revolution or further unsustainable military occupation, we find in this scholarly analysis of a quarter century ago important reflection for our current position not only in our expensive and fruitless Iraqi efforts, but also in our so-called \\"free trade\\" agreements which destroy local independent farmers and industries, and in fact evidence the effects of multinational for profit corporations and globalization as a whole. Despite the rather fallacious selection of the author by the editorial team, whose continued anglophiliac and colonialist subservient mindset should be obvious to all in the contorted quotation cited above, one may discover here an important and highly recommended study which we do well now to read again. Let us free ourselves from our own continued colonialist oppressive mindset which entraps us unto emperor worship of the British throne most embarrassingly revealed in the Torry Bush regime, and let us liberate as well those whom we ourselves oppress. The greater and more difficult liberation of mind which we require is in believing ourselves superior to other nations in any way."},{"Title":"Rebel Without Applause : Tales from the Castro Renaissance","review":"A fable, a diatribe, a biography - there's a little bit of everything in this slim little book, and all of it so richly written that it evokes incredible imagery.'Stories of Politics' and 'Stories of Whimsy' is the dividing line between the different collections of tales, historical tid-bits, and concrete poetry that make up this book. In the Politics side are stories that bring back the origins of the queer movement, and tell the tale of the first 'Freedom Flag' (what we now call the 'Pride Flag,' and its grandparents, and prior ideas). These were stories I found interesting, and certainly educational in a way that - as always - gives me nothing but admiration for those who came before me and didn't even have the slight rights and concessions I sneered at as merely 'a inadequate poor start.'The Whimsy writings were just plain fun. Werewolf fables, and stories of grandmothers and granddaughters passing along holy swords, and other such delightful stuff as to make one smile.

He also gives vibrant descriptions of difficult concepts, leading the reader in the most natural way toward a solid understanding of Relativity theory and the foundations upon which it is built. In my opinion, this book ranks with the best of popular expositions both on the history of scientific thought in physics, and on modern physics itself. I recommend it for the non-initiated as well as for the seasoned scientist."},{"Title":"Relativity and Its Roots","review":"Relativity and its Roots is more than an assembly of Einstein's work, it's a rich volume of scientific history leading up to his discoveries.

Complete with dozens of explanitory diagrams, it's one read that will change your perception of our universe."},{"Title":"Relativity and Its Roots","review":"Relativity and Its Roots straddles the line between physics and history of science. It explores the development of an idea. You'd expect a book with \\"Relativity\\" in its title to concentrate on Einstein, especially as it is written by one of his colleagues. In fact Einstein does not enter the picture till the penultimate chapter. The story of Relativity starts with the Greeks and takes time to tell.What I found most useful was Hoffmann's exploration of the thought processes of the scientists who advanced the theory. They often do not follow the standard stories of scientific discovery. Maxwell developed his theory of Electromagnetism not by thinking of mathematical symmetry but by following a mechanistic explanation of phenomena. He then removed this mechanistic scaffolding leaving us with the elegant mathematical theory. You come away from the book with new insights into both the way the universe works and the way great minds think.Both the scientifically trained and the layman can learn from the book. It is written without equations in the main body.

If, on the other hand, you are interested in ancient Egypt as it actually was, you will find this book extremely elusive and difficult to grasp.Iversen, an Egyptologist of some note, first wrote this book in 1961, but it has been added to the Bollingen Mythos collection from Princeton, which also publishes people like Jean Seznec, Erwin Panofsky, etc. I have not compared editions, but so far as I can tell the only difference between this and the original edition is the addition of a brief preface discussing the work of such scholars as Frances Yates.Okay, on to the book itself. In short, Iversen wants to discuss how European thinkers (before Champollion deciphered hieroglyphics at the start of the 19th C) thought about hieroglyphs, how they misinterpreted them conceptually, and how as a result they constructed a vast and erroneous mythology of what Egypt really was and what wisdom it could impart to the wise seeker.The story is now relatively well-known, largely as a result of this book. Since Europeans did not realize that hieroglyphs are primarily phonetic, they assumed that their meaning was based entirely upon a connection between the pictures and the objects they represented graphically. Since it was hard to make sense of any actual inscriptions based upon this theory, European thinkers developed elaborate theories about the allegorical significance of hieroglyphs, such that a picture of a snake eating its tail might allegorically represent the infinity of time and space, and hence the universe.If the story I have just sketched sounds boring to you, don't buy this book. If, on the other hand, you think this is nifty --- or you already knew this but want the details --- this book is for you.Iversen begins with an introduction to hieroglyphics as they really were, then goes on to a chronological story of reception and attempts at decryption. Along the way, we pick up a great number of really interesting people and ideas, because Egyptomania was a constant theme in (especially) Renaissance iconography and intellectual history. We get bits of some famous books and some obscure ones, raving madness and serious scholarly analysis, and everything in between.One can hardly summarize the varieties of mis-decipherments in Renaissance European Egyptomania, but Iversen manages to cover a huge amount of ground in a relatively few pages. My only criticism is an unfair one: he doesn't know (or care) about cultural linguistic perceptions, and as such he tends to group all of these would-be decipherments into a kind of history of folly. Nevertheless, he is willing to take it all relatively seriously, considering that he thinks it's silly.The result is a book which is charming and scholarly at once. Unfortunately, it is somewhat densely written, probably because English is not Iversen's native tongue. On the up side, there are a lot of pictures of hieroglyphs and, more interestingly, things described as hieroglyphs which bear little obvious relationship to the ones inscribed in Egypt. It's a fascinating tour of an important and still somewhat neglected field, and suitable for the general educated reader as well as for the specialist; indeed, the specialist may find it a bit sparse on detailed information, although the notes and apparatus are certainly satisfactory.This book is somewhat dated, of course, but remains the seminal work in this odd corner of intellectual or cultural history. If you find the description here interesting, you will probably enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Myth of Egypt and Its Hieroglyphs in European Tradition","review":"This very profound and interesting book recounts the fate that the cultural expressions, and especially the hieroglyphs, of ancient Egypt has found in the Western World, as well as the effects of her influence on European Medieval and Renascentist Ages and afterwards. It is masterly written, full of useful and valuable data and nicely printed. Nothing else but to highly recommend it for all those interested in ancient Egyptian writing and the development of writing-history."},{"Title":"Dolce Vita Style","review":"Jean-Pierre Dufreigne's Dolce Vita Style starts out describing my favorite scene from the unforgettable film Fellini's Roma. The scene takes place at one of the city's innumerable cafes, where an anonymous woman asks writer Gore Vidal why he chooses to live in Rome. Mr. Vidal answers as if he had been expecting the question: \\"Rome is the only place to be,\\" he says, \\"to wait for the end.\\"That's pretty much true, at least if you were living in the go-go Dolce Vita years, which were already drawing to a close by the time the film was made in 1972. The over-the-top style of those days were like a candle burning not only on both ends but also at several points in the middle.But, boy, did they ever look good doing it.That's the best thing about this book: the photography really captures the feel of Rome during the Dolce Vita years. For anyone who knows the Via Veneto as is is today -- home to the U.S. Embassy and the Hard Rock Cafe -- the photos of the parties in the street there in the 1960s will cause a double take. Ditto for scenes from the Spanish Steps, the Campidoglio, and Piazza Navona. The photo selection is excellent: Mr. Dufreigne, a journalist with France's L'Express, avoids cliche shots like Antia Ekberg in the Trevi Fountain (though there is a less-well-known shot from that series near the end of the book, and a modern remake with model Claudia Schiffer in Ms. Ekberg's place) in favor of unfamiliar images that capture the mood perfectly.Sadly, beyond that there is little to recommend the book besides that. The text -- for the most part spoken in Italian, transcribed in the book in Mr. Dufreigne's native French, and then translated into English for this edition -- sounds melodramatic and forced. And although it is handsomely bound, the layout can be frustrating: captions for photos are rarely on the same page as the photo, a lack of paragraph indents can make some pages appear to be a single run-on sentence, and the lack of an index and only the vaguest table of contents makes picking and choosing what to read an exercise in frustration."},{"Title":"Dolce Vita Style","review":"Very informational and inspirational. Haven't flipped/read all of it but I can say it's a fabulous book for those who love Italian culture and fashion. The outfits are amazing. You really get to see/feel/taste a piece of that era's Italian culture."},{"Title":"Catherine the Great","review":"This long-lost study of Catherine the Great is a rather dry but certainly solid historical biography, of a woman who has often been misunderstood by history. The book does not contain very much coverage of Catherine's actual time as Empress of Russia (about half of her life), but that is material better suited to history books, and the personal aspects of her life had apparently gotten monotonous by that point. Instead, most of the book focuses on Catherine's life before her rule, as she worked her way up the ladder of European nobility and usurped the Russian throne. We learn that Catherine was actually a German girl named Sophia, from a family of minor nobles in a backwater German principality. She was used uncaringly by her family to gain influence in noble circles until she ended up in an arranged marriage to the heir to the Russian throne, and then found herself ruling this backward nation. Oldenbourg has a real flair for palace intrigue and the petty political shenanigans among the nobility that first swept Catherine along reluctantly, but which she eventually learned to exploit to her own advantage. We also see the backwardness of Russia during that era, as a disconnected nobility pathetically emulated the cultured houses of Europe with little knowledge of the awful, medieval lives of the common Russians. Catherine gets due credit for bringing culture and modernity to her adopted country, though not without earning a bad reputation as an corrupt seductress and self-obsessed dictator. (Oldenbourg debates such incorrect opinions but fails to tackle the inherent sexism of such historical condemnations.) Ultimately, this book can be a bit of a slog but paints a worthy picture of one of history's most powerful women.

In the context of Russian history, these are incredible omissions).Also note that in the chronological table, the entry of the \\"storming of the Bastille\\" is incorrectly listed as having happened in 1788.3) The insane & incessant instances of boiler-plate writing - the most prominent being the dozens of \\"in facts,\\" escorted down the aisle by \\"the like of which had never been seen,\\" the latter phrase having already been seen in countless previous histories - ruined many a paragraph.The book starts out strongly (especially admired was the chapter providing a synopsis of the reign of Peter The Great); sags & nearly collapses in the middle (with interminable & redundant meanderings about the psychological & sexual derangements of the pathetic Peter III, how CTG could have been secretly in love with Potemkin - without she herself actually knowing of it! etc.); & then finishes quite admirably.Having come away from this biography with a personal aversion to Catherine The Great, for now, this will suffice.*****Weirdly: Just as I was finishing this forgotten book, Robert's Massie's biography of CTG made its debut, on or about 01/01/12.Maureen Callahan in the NY Post - usually an original, compelling & candid writer - apparently took the publisher's Cliff Notes & rewove them into a book review-lovefest of the regime of an Empress, during which the sadistic system of exploitation of Russia's millions of serfs intensified at the same time that she was hypocritically championing the principles of the Enlightenment."},{"Title":"Catherine the Great","review":"Her contemporaries -- men of the caliber of Volaire and Diderot among them -- called her the Star of the North, Minerva, &quot;admirable autocrat, conqueror, peacemaker, and legislator&quot;; she was the &quot;Mother Tsarina&quot; of all the Russias, mother of her country, mother of her people, Catherine the Wise; she was the friend of the Enlightenment or, more modestly, an &quot;enlightened despot&quot;. She was also the Messalina of the North, the gross et vieille Cateau of the revolutionary pamphleteers. To history she will always be Catherine The Great, one of the three of four women who have ruled in their own right, for any length of time, over a great nation and who have left behind them a glorious memory of their reign.She was more than simply a great ruler, and more than a remarkable woman: already she belongs among the half-legendary figures whose lives have been popularized and vulgarized in films, plays, and novels with little regard for that they were really like.Catherine has had no lack of chroniclers, and all of them, objective and impartial scholars, dedicated admirers and passionate detractors alike, have found abundant material in the records left by her contemporaries and by Catherine herself. Few historical characters have, in the course of their lives, been so thoroughly observed, judged, and described by their contemporaries, and there are fewer still who have left so much written testimony about themselves."},{"Title":"Catherine the Great","review":"A biography of Catherine the Great that looks suspiciously optimistic. We glanced at it, and found juicier stuff in other works, notably Troyat's Catherine the Great. [HistoryHouse.com]"},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"'Candid Confessions' is among the most interesting novels I have ever read, and I recommend it especially to those who appreciate the difference between popular fiction and serious literature. I will take a small liberty here in advising any reader that s/he may find it challenging--as I did--to identify or sympathize with the main character. 'Jack' presents his tale to us in diary form, the style of which makes his story easy to read fairly quickly. Jack is an antihero whose diary comprises a parable on the misunderstanding of the nature of love. He claims to be searching for a deep and lasting love. Okay, fine. But sadly, Jack's understanding of love is grounded in a childhood trauma of the Oedipal kind. Readers learn this early on, and that knowledge helps us appreciate the meaning of the two Chinese characters appearing on the cover, standing out from their bleak, black background. The characters mean 'menstruation' and 'human ashes,' and they identify themes which recur throughout Jack's highly sexualized quest for 'love.' One bonus in this novel is its local color. It gives the reader a feel for daily life in the Orient, mostly in Japan, though Jack spends significant time also in Korea, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar (formerly Burma). This feature alone makes the book well worth reading. I suspect that serious readers will be glad to have read this intriguing 'diary,' even if they experience frustration with Jack's strategy for achieving his goal."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"Patrick,I got your book in the mail yesterday, and read it last night. There seems to be a lot about anuses (ani?), blood, and alcohol. It was a fairly easy read, meaning your writing style is comfortable. Being written in the first person, it sort of felt like one of the old classics.However, I must have glossed over whatever symbolism you intended. I'm not sure about the guy getting sick (was it three times?) and what that meant, nor am I sure if you intended anything by the names of the characters you used, or the progression of countries visited. Sorry, I must not be that deep of a thinker. Is your book like &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;--one of those stories you need to take a class to understand? If so, I offer my apologies, as I'm not into anything so complicated.Honestly, I came away with the impression that I'd read a rather long chapter of a story, and looked forward to reading the rest of the story to get to the point. The ending was short of premature in my view.I could write a review for you, but I'm really not sure what to say. On a scale of 1-10, I'd have to give you something like a 5 or a 6. I like your writing style, but the story left me unfulfilled. Take all of that with a grain of salt. Had your man been chasing international terrorists (in a pointless fashion) I probably would have rated you a 10."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"When the author of this book, Patrick Mahr contacted me about reading his newly published book, Candid Confessions, I was hesitant but decided to read it, from the moment I received the book, I was unable to put it down, reading it in two sitting. The book is a diary of a man who has many internal conflicts and often leads a questionable lifestyle. The book is fast paced, ever changing, and shocking at points, which makes it a truly enjoyable read. I would highly recommend this book, it is one of the best I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"This little novel takes us on a fairly authentic tour of what the Asian EFL teaching experience is like for many young expatriates. With a bare minimum of attention paid to teaching, a majority of energy is expended into the daily satisfactions of a selfish existence in an alien world. How to pass the time, the next minute even, sometimes, in this playground where there's so much to see and do. The protagonist has some notion of honor, and of appropriate actions, but he's mostly just blindly searching for sexual diversion. He's got a few hang-ups but he doesn't deal with them; he lives with them. And he carries on, like the rest of us. The writing is mostly quite smooth, albeit relying on content to pull the story along. A few too many liberties are taken with recognizeable real-life characters, negative distortions of good people. A good read, however."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"Overall I thought this was a very entertaining book. Maher's writing isn't going to win any awards, but, the plot was interesting &amp; kept me reading, which is why i read books. I read the last 100 pages in 1 day. Only negative was that the ending seemed like it came together too fast &amp; easy- Almost like it was an afterthought. Sometimes Maher manages to move beyond the dark apsect to higher ground I just coasted through the book, not especially caring how it all would work out, because none of t created any feeling of sympathy or connection that resonated with me. Yes, I read it all the way to the end, but more to see if my prediction of Jack would come true. Overall I rate this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"In 'Candid Confessions' an American man, Jack goes to Japan. This book takes the reader through the life of Jack. He is separated from her mother, his sick mother, and himself, who was sold to a life is confusion. He works as n English teacher and attempts to escape from his past. Jack strives to become a good person so he will not repeat his past life. He has no idea what it actually takes to be a good person until he finally succeeds in his goal. He becomes one of Japan's many gaijons, who do not follow their hearts and feelings, whose looks dominate everything, whose sexual drive dominatesis, who is expected at any cost to be able to seduce any woman, and who don't even get to keep their own name.The author's tone throughout the book helps to portray its theme that who a person is cannot be judged by a given facade; it is what is inside that truly shows who one is. At the beginning of the novel, Patrick Maher presents Jack in almost a tragic tone, using blood and very awful magery, while also letting a peek of the real person underneath show through. The image created by the detail used further expresses the quality of writing throughout the book. The contrast from the awful description and the narrow glimpse of the real person behind the make-up is extremely vivid. Further supporting the theme, the author writes in an almost airy, sincere, arrogant tone. The author's tone throughout the novel very strongly caught me."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"A rather uninteresting tale of an amoral alcoholic who is aimlessly searching for a right way to live. A very easy read, but lacked substance."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"written in the spirit of expat american writers - Miller and Hemingway - just to name a few. I enjoyed this book. I was surprised there is no other work by the author. To sum up the book, the confessions show a man who writes as he progesses and progesses as he writes. Meat and potatoes candidness - beware ladies."},{"Title":"Candid Confessions","review":"The story of Jack, a confused and tormented ex-patriot working and playing in various Asian countries grabbed me from the first sentence and never let me go. His sexual behaviour and experiences were usually reckless, sometimes frightening or sordid and often just plain sad, but I never lost my faith in him. I hope there's a sequel, because I really want to know what happens to him next."},{"Title":"World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and the Broadcasts That Riveted a Nation","review":"This is a unique and intriguing book which creatively captures the history of Edward R. Murrow and \\"Murrow's Boys.\\" The book includes a CD containing 51 broadcasts just as they were heard live during World War II, with narration by Dan Rather. The text has symbols throughout, keying the reader to the CD track which compliments the written words with the voices of these brave men as they broadcasted from all over the world. The text includes concise profiles of the various members of Murrow's team: William Shirer (author of RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH), Eric Sevareid, Howard K. Smith, Larry LaSueur, Charles Collingwood, Winston Burdett and Richard Hottelet, among others. To those who remember WWII these names will be very familiar, and for those who do not, they tell the war's story with passion, intensity and professionalism. The authors have painstakingly researched the intricate details of how William Paley took the embryonic Columbia Broadcast System from a largely soft entertainment network to the premier news gathering and reporting organization which eclipsed all others during the war. The role Murrow plays in this evolution reveals a man of tremendous commitment to his craft, despite almost no previous experience in radio, with a great capacity for judging and selecting the others who became the critical reporters on his team. The travails of Murrow and the others as they faced death in flights over enemy territory, beach assaults and other combat assignments and suffered the tyranny of technological challenges with equipment strained to the breaking point make for great reading. The authors weave the complexities of personalities, politics, warfare and technology into a comprehensive and coherent book. The CD is haunting and chilling as these now dead voices bring back to the present momentous events which told America about the fighting of the war and the slow and painful process of winning peace just as they were happening. This book will be a superb addition to the library of any student of WWII and is also recommended for any reader who enjoys fast paced history in the making."},{"Title":"World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and the Broadcasts That Riveted a Nation","review":"I read the Rise and Fall on the 3rd Reich in high school, and I had always thought of Wm Shirer as a historian - I had no idea that he was a reporter during the war, and had a unique seat and understanding watching the Nazi drama unfold.Great book. You can really appreciate the difficulty of getting a live broadcast from Europe done in 1938, and how hard Murrow and company worked at it. There was no \\"press freedom\\" then, and the deference the press is shown today didn't exist then. They were a courageous bunch, Morrow's boys. And look at the roster! Murrow and Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Howard K. Smith, Charles Collingwood, and back in New York, William Paley was calling the shots and rooting Murrow on. What a collection of talent. Amazing.The only irritating thing about it concerns the CD - why did Rather narrate it and not Walt Cronkite? Cronkite had front line reporting experience in WWII (was on the beach at D-day and made a jump with the 101st) and ended up working for Morrow after the war. Every time I hear Rather narrate, I have the feeling he doesn't deserve to be talking.Otherwise the radio clips are superb."},{"Title":"World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and the Broadcasts That Riveted a Nation","review":"Collaboratively compiled and written by Mark Bernstein and Alex Lubertozzi, World War II On The Air: Edward R. Murrow And The Broadcasts That Riveted A Nation presents the stories behind the implacable and courageous radio correspondents who brought the reality of war itself into living rooms across the nation for the first time in history. More than 50 actual broadcasts, and an audio CD narrated by Dan Rather, enhance this unique and very highly recommended look at World War II events and personalities as the home front experienced it through the medium of radio broadcasting."},{"Title":"World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and the Broadcasts That Riveted a Nation","review":"There is only one reason to buy this book--for the CD. I found the book to be poorly written, bland and superficial. Of course, I had just finished reading \\"Citizens of London..\\" by Lynne Olsen, which is one of the best books I have ever read, period. I kept thinking to myself when I read \\"World War II On the Air:...\\" that it was written for middle schoolers. Honestly, I'm glad I didn't pay too much it. So, if you want to listen to the voices of radio from WWII, buy this book, but read \\"The Murrow Boys\\" by Olsen or \\"Citizens of London\\" for the history."},{"Title":"World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and the Broadcasts That Riveted a Nation","review":"Excellent, valuable introduction and sampler to this topic; complements well Bob Edwards' work on Murrow and The Murrow Boys (and Girl)....Appreciated especially:the brief bios of the various chartacters, not only the well-known (Murrow, Shirer, Collingwood, etc.) but also the now lesser known (Paley, Paul White, Tom Grandin, for example).The operative word here for both the book and CD is Intro....What may be needed to supplement this work are CD sets of the actual broadcasts from archival sources, complete with the original intros and back-announces if extant. Indeed a sampling of a few original CBS evening news broadcasts in toto, to show how these overseas reports fitted in to regular domestic broadcasts. Of value would be the complete transcription of the first CBS Evening News Roundup, at the time of the Munich Crisis.Years ago, CBS/Columbia issued a 2-LP set in the \\"I Can Hear It Now\\" series, of a sampling of Murrow's 1939-1946 broadcasts, from BBC and CBS archival material. This has been art of print for decades. A reissue of this on CD by Sony would be valuable, especially for the student of broadcast journalism.Again, a very fine beginning."},{"Title":"World War II on the Air: Edward R.

I almost couldn't believe it was her writing this suspense. It reminded me somewhat of Greg Iles &quot;The Quiet Game&quot;, also a story of a widower father who is an attorney and getting involved in a case in his home town that affects him personally.In this story, the attorney, John O'Rourke, is a widower with 2 kids, a teen son and a daughter. He is trying his best to raise them in his home town where everyone knows them, but is making enemies by taking on a horrible case. He is representing an admitted serial killer of young women and the town hates him for it. Along comes a lovely woman who believes this serial killer may be the cause for her sisters disappearance 6 months prior in this area. John is torn between wanting to help the woman, whom he is attracted to, and doing his best for his client. The story takes many twists and turns and is written very well. You feel connected to these characters and think about them even when you are not reading... that's the sign of a well written novel.Luanne writes in the same New England setting that she has used in her other books. Her characters, even the pets, have captivating personalities, and the discriptive locale always makes you want to go there. Another great book by Ms. Rice... do some more like this, Luanne."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"A new book by Luanne Rice is always an occasion for me to rush right out, buy the book and then wait a few weeks before I read it. Why do I wait to read it? Perhaps its because I'm waiting for just the right mood or knowing that once I finish this book I'll have to wait a bit till Ms. Rice writes another one. And while my wait wasn't that long this time since I recently read the Firefly trilogy which included Firefly Beach, Safe Harbor and True Blue almost back to back, The Secret Hour is Luanne Rice at her very best. As she has accomplished in so many of her novels I loved, Ms. Rice introduces us to characters who have suffered tragedies in their family structures and find healing within themselves and through others.John O'Rourke, a defense attorney and his children 14 year old Ted and 11 year old Maggie, are still reeling from the accidental death of their wife and mother Theresa. Now two years later, John is desperately trying to save his client from the death penalty. Isolated form his neighbors and community for representing this convicted killer, John and his family suffer greatly particularly the children who have barely begun to deal with their mother's passing. Then one day a new woman, Kate Harris, arrives in town. The family mistakes her for a new housekeeper/babysitter whom they have been advertising for in the local papers. But Kate has her own reason for being in Connecticut and wanting to get to know the O'Rourke family. Thus begins a reader's journey and adventure where once again Rice's plots are filled with the themes of love between siblings, love between a man and a woman and happiness after tragedies.Although not always a fan of the genre of romantic suspense, I loved this book. I found that Rice's writing was emotional and heart rending without being sappy as characterized in books by Nicholas Sparks and others. Her characters are well portrayed and I think about them now weeks after I finished this title.While I always wait patiently for a new Luanne Rice book,this time my wait is almost over. Her new book, Dance With Me, is due out in February and I for one can't wait. I will purchase it immediately, put it away and read it at just the right time, which for me is almost any time. I do hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"I think this was one of Luanne Rice's best books. It's definitely different from the others I've read, but in a good way.I liked that she wrote a book with some suspense. Kind of a change. She did a good job with the new aspect. She still kept in her trademarks of the East coast &amp; beauty surrounding it as well as the love story &amp; the family story.Great book! She's my new favorite author."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"I have read all of Luanne Rice's books to date and would say that she is one of my favorite authors. I grew up in southern Rhode Island so I am familiar with many of the landmarks that she mentions. As I read, I can envision the scenarios and hear the surf pounding the shore.That being said, I wasn't as crazy about this book as I have been about her others. I don't want to give away the ending, but I thought it was just a little too far-fetched to be believable.However, I did like her development of the characters and the interaction between John and his children. That was real.I guess you can't win them all."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"In Connecticut, defense attorney John O'Rourke struggles with his moral dilemma of defending some of society's worse monsters to insure they have a fair trail and the requirements of a single dad raising two youngsters by himself. The townsfolk treat John like a pariah especially with his current case, defending Greg Merrill, the Breakwater Killer. The latest incident is a brick tossed threw his kitchen window that two cops blithely write it off as if John was the criminal.Immediately following the brick incident, Kate Harris arrives at the O'Rourke residence. She wants John to ascertain whether his infamous client killed her sister, who vanished without the body recovered. As Kate helps the O'Rourkes heal from the loss of their mother, she falls in love with the trio. The kids welcome her into their lives, but John is reluctant as he feels guilt over his spouse's cheating while he overly worked on defending the dregs.THE SECRET HOUR is a powerful legal romantic thriller that is at its best when John, living up to the Dershowitz credo that a \\"good lawyer should want to take the hardest cases, the most unpopular defendants\\", must defend himself and his children from his neighbors. Readers will feel his strength from the start when John thinks back on an incident at an ice cream parlor with his young daughter involving the condemnation by a senior citizen. The story line is fast-paced yet obvious, but romantic suspense fans and legal thriller buffs will want to read this close look at the toll of defending death row convicts on the personal lives of an attorney and his family.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"\\"The Secret Hour\\" by Luanne Rice combines drama, romance and suspense in a riviting, can't-put-down, narrative.

There is no real action or suspense until then, so I am only going to give this 3 stars for not really being as action-packed as I was lead to believe.I still think she is a great writer, though, and I am a dedicated Luanne Rice reader, no matter what."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"I actually put this book down and read something else for a few days - I had to force myself to finish it.

I had all I could do to put it down long enough to drive home and get ready for bed!This is a great departure from her usual story lines, so I think that may be one reason I really dove into it. The other reason, and probably the biggest reason, is that I'm a paralegal and can easily put myself in John O'Rouke's position. However, I didn't expect the book to end the way it did. It was a cool, surprising twist at the end. I'm still trying to decide, though, whether the last chapter was a good ending. I think they might have left a couple chapters out!"},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesJohn O'Rourke is the defense attorney for serial killer Greg Merrill, AKA \\"The Breakwater Killer\\" and many people are not happy he's handling this case. When a brick is thrown through his front window, he knows he's in for a rough time, as are his Children. In the middle of all of this, John is dealing with his feelings about his wife's recent death, and her adultery.Kate Harris arrives on John's doorstep seeking his aid. Her sister is missing; a possible victim of Merrill, the body has never been recovered. John is reluctant to discuss his case with Kate but finds himself drawn in to the mystery surrounding her sister's disappearance nonetheless. Although the meeting of John and Kate was under unfortunate circumstances, she finds herself drawn to his young children... and to john. She may be just what he needs to heal his wounded spirit. But danger is all around as they try to solve the mystery of Kate's sister.This story is classic of Luanne Rice, though she reveals her darker side in the psychological undertones found in The Secret Hour. However, as this was the abridged version of the story, a lot of the details that should have really provided the darker feel were missing. Even so, the suspenseful air comes through loud and clear, keeping the reader guessing. The surprise twist at the end threw this reviewer for a loop as she was not expecting that turn of events.As always in a Luanne Rice novel, relationships of many kinds are showcased. One will find the bond between a father and his children, the sometimes upsetting relationship of a lawyer with a guilty client, the love between sisters which is the strongest relationship bond in this story, and the love that grows between people proving that family is what we make of it, and is not always formed by blood. The tender feelings that develop between John and Kate are well done, making readers understand what is going through their minds as they form this unlikely bond.? Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2005.

John O'Rourke's character seems like a sensitive caring person and hard to see him defending a serial killer. I know they have a right to counsel but seems like long years of that would destroy a sensitive person and you see it does take a toll on John. Okay this is the focus of the book. One reviewer stated they didn't like most of the characters. I thought they were all quite interesting. I hadn't read a novel with the scenario of this one. I would have liked a little more to the ending tying things up but wasn't bad. I appreciated LR's lack of profanity (there is some but wasn't every page) and also lack of detailed sexual scenes.

Some hateful person threw a brick at their house one autumn morning injuring John in the face, and terrifying Maggie and Teddy.This is when Kate Harris appears at the door. She wants answers from John as to whatever happened to her younger sister when she mysteriously disappeared. She received one postcard from Willa that came from the New England shore. This is the only clue she has to go on, and all the while Kate suspects Greg Merrill of possibly killing her sister.

I liked The Secret Hour, but it is NOT the typical type of story written by this author. I am not drawn to books about serial killers with lots of description and violence so when some of this was included in this book, it was a bit suprising, but based on the storyline it was not a big shock.

Because I really do love all of her other books."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"This was my first Luanne Rice novel and since she seems to have loyal readers and a successful career I felt there must be a good reason for her popularity. I found the descriptions of the east coast to be very enjoyable, since I have spent a good deal of time in the area. Her plot was quite unrealistic in my opinion. All this adultery and yet the love is still present? I knew after page one that Kate and John would end up together; no suspense there. John was such an unpleasant and rude person it was amazing anyone would put up with his behavior. I also found the ending quite a stretch, although I had suspected one of the parties would be involved. Kate's search seemed endless so I confess to doing a great deal of skimming through this book. I never skim when I am reading an author I respect and like; in fact, I hang on every single word. So for those of you who enjoy this type of light and predictable reading, stay loyal to Ms. Rice. She lives, at least part time, in the wonderful area of Old Lyme, CT so she must be doing something right . Just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"I have found a new author for my list of 'favorites'!

He has his own personal issues which have devestated his life, but he still is a good dad to his kids.The heroine is a wonderful character, full of love and though she's been hurt, she's willing from the beginning to open up and help those in need.There are some good side characters - his father and his father's housekeeper, for example. There is a wonderful description of small town life - the good and the bad. And there is evil lurking everywhere.Though this is probably listed as romantic suspense, it's not chock full of sex like that genre usually is. Instead, it's old-fashioned romance. And it's awful, new-age, gory suspense. The mix wasn't as satisfying for me as I would hope. The overall image left is very dark. I generally like things lighter.That being said, it was still a great read.(*)>"},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"The defense attorney for a serial killer.

The other side is the sister of a missing person who meets the description of other victims of this serial killer. Her bond with her sister was just too strong to let go of and good thing she didn't give up. I liked the story and it kept me reading up to the last bit of the book.

Yeah, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"I hope Luanne Rice writes a sequel to this book.

Most of her books I've enjoyed but this one was over the top. Hard to find someone in this to really like, maybe Teddy showing a maturity beyond his years. Although John has had time to get over his wife's betrayal and death, learning she was going to leave him anyway, he has his head so inside himself he can't see his kids. Teddy does the best he can for his sister just 3 years younger, but she shows no maturity at all, not enough to even take baths. I agree with others that the ending was just too much and to have it all crammed into the last 3 or 4 pages it was mind boggling. Too bad John didn't wake up and become aware of his surroundings sooner. The story was very slow moving and in all those pages no new territory was covered at all, just more of the same. The only thing that would have topped the ending would have been to have Merrill break out of his high security death row cell. You tell me how John and Katy can find any peace in their minds and hearts to have a life together, is beyond me. They are too damaged and traumatized."},{"Title":"The Secret Hour","review":"Wait till this one comes out in paperback.

You won't confuse any of these men with the character Richard Gere played in the movie &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, even though it was supposedly based on one of the men in this book. The author dedicates a chapter each to several men who used their wealth to add to the definition of &quot;hostile takeover.&quot; The reader gets a good look at how a corporate raider goes about his work, but we never learn too much about the men behind the money.Although it covers a time period between the late'60s to the early '80s, it's still a relevant work considering one of the subjects, Carl Ichan, is still very much in the business today. His recent attempts to acquire Nabisco is just another in a long history of raiding you can learn about in this book."},{"Title":"Picking Up the Pieces","review":"This book is about a girl named Megan, who's about 13 years old, having to bounce back from a motorcycle accident she has a lot of problems along the way.

Another is that she hasn't heard from the boy who was driving the motorcycle when they crashed."},{"Title":"Picking Up the Pieces","review":"This book brought a realization to me.

Until the terrible accident that left her in the wheelchair, and shaped the rest of her life with a spinal cord injury. Determined to help her get on with her life. Megans family plans a trip to the lake cottage where they have vacationed every summer. Megan is reluctant to go, believing that nothing will ever be the same again. The trip starts out just as Megan had planned, bringing back painful memories of what had been. That's is until she meets Harris. Him and his Aunt Julia, a bitter actress, and her husband have rented the cottege next door. Megan is determined not to like Harris, but unknowingly, she begins to fall for him. Together they get throughout their problems, and figure out that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. This, by far is the best book I've read as far as tragedy goes. The Book, &quot;Out of the blue.&quot; by Sarah Ellis, was similar yet different to this story. In this book, a young girl, also named Megan, finds out that her mother has another daughter. This is also about a life changing experience, and both characters are very stubborn to accept the change. I think that Megan is a powerful character, and strong role model for young girls everywhere. She is lost in deep depression but with the help of Harris, they pull each other out. I think the budding romance going on between the two is adorable. This book is for people who like to sit down by the fire and cozy up to a good book. There isn't much action, and it is definitely a female book. Even so I think that any audience of young readers would appreciate it."},{"Title":"Picking Up the Pieces","review":"Realistic, it gives you an insight to the thoughts and feelingsof a physically handicapped person.

It has distanced him from his Mexican-born parents and separated him almost entirely from his Mexican roots. The central idea running through many of these thoughtful, earnest essays is a heightened awareness of the differences between our public and private lives. They also focus on the impact of education on himself and his siblings as children of Spanish-speaking immigrants.After reading his books, nothing about becoming American seems as simple as it's often represented in popular fiction and movies. You see, for example, how learning English and the way Americans use it immediately create cultural conflicts. Rodriguez' parents had valued education as a way to get ahead in America. Ironically, the greater success he experienced in school, the further he became removed from the world of his parents.Still a boy, he lost the ability to converse in Spanish. Becoming a public figure in the English-speaking world, he seemed to betray his ethnic background, which valued privacy and separateness from the English-speaking (gringo) world. Ironically, for all his achievements as an &quot;American,&quot; Rodriguez learns that because of his background, he remains in many ways an outsider. Lacking a middle class upbringing, he has passed through the educational system as a &quot;scholarship boy.&quot; This term, borrowed from Richard Hoggart's book &quot;The Uses of Literacy,&quot; describes the son of working class parents who is granted the privilege of a middle class education, but while rising above his humble origins, never fully transcends them.The political positions Rodreguez takes as an adult flow as a logical extension from the experiences that shaped him -- especially the benefits of the education he received in a private school. Later there were the benefits that came to him as a &quot;minority student&quot; -- advantages he considered unwarranted. Concerned by poverty in America and the underfunding of schools that would help end poverty, he takes positions that have been unpopular among many educators. In these essays, he challenges the assumptions underlying both affirmative action and bilingual education.Rodriguez writes with great clarity, and his sentences seem crafted with considerable care. He wants very much to say precisely what he means. And this cannot have been always easy, as many of his ideas grapple with both irony and paradox. Often you read paragraphs that seem to have been thought through deeply, then carefully written and rewritten. The care that he takes in writing these essays reflects a wish to be read carefully. Those who have found reason to be offended, angered, or &quot;bored&quot; by his ideas are evidence that he touches on a great many sensitive issues."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"This book is more of a dialogue rather than an argument. A passionate mesmerizing dialogue with the past and present perceived realities of the author's cultural heritage. I saw Richard Rodriguez at a televised University presentation. His ability to respond to questions from the students and faculty with relaxed patience and stunning oratory was impressive. That is why I purchased this book. A man of knowledge and accomplishment, who has something to say, and knows how to say it. I wanted to learn more from him. That same quality of knowledge permeates this book which is filled with unsurpassed images of Mexico, Spain and California. Mr Rodriguez revisits this historical blend of cultures that produced him and invites us to also participate in this dialogue of perceptions. He bares his inner most thoughts, his agony and his pride. Well worth reading. Take your time, and savor the sights, sounds and existence of a beautiful people; then and now."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"Rodriguez sinks his teeth into the juicy apple of race and somehow pulls off enlightening concrete distinctions between the single extant species of Homo sapiens remaining on earth. Essentially (and we allow here for the purposes of discussion some generalities) Rodriguez asserts that Americans/Northern Europeans are divorced psychologically from their historically inseparable neighbors, the Mexicans/Indians, because the Americans/Northern Europeans represent masculine, aggressive, individualistic, Protestant, optimistic, or \\"comic\\" values. The passive, Catholic, communal, familial, feminine value systems of the Mexicans/Indians he terms \\"tragic.\\" (The tragic race, incidentally, is much happier and less medicated, etc., it's so substantially less destructive and selfish.) I grew up in Southern California, lived in Mexico for a few years, and three years ago married a Mexican woman, so I epitomize the fabulous collision of opposite worlds that this book describes (and really helped me to understand). Gorgeously composed, arrogantly honest, and a whole lot more. Intellectually one of the ten most important books of the last two decades. When I admire a book I immediately read it again. I read this one three times."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"Rodriguez' previous book, Hunger of Memory, was a valuable account of the cultural schizophrenia many Latinos go through--i.e., Spanish vs English, Catholic vs Protestant, Old World vs New World. What was so damn infuriating about that book was Rodriguez' closeted, timid tone. Every word was carefully weighed, the tone as dead, as academic as the world he kissed up to and was, hence, rewarded by. He was so careful not to be vulgar or hasty in his judgments that he came off stiff and ponderous. Anyone put off by his arguments could have rejected them on the basis of his style alone. If this is what kowtowing to the Protestant academic establishment does to you, I'll gladly remain a backward, brash Latino any day. In Days of Obligation, Rodriguez has loosened up considerably but not always with the best of results. His fondness for colorful adjectives and adverbs makes his writing here frequently dense and knotty. One thinks, &quot;Hmmm, what a beautiful description--what it means, I haven't the vaguest idea.&quot; He amplifies his cultural survey here with mixed results: his description of Mexican society is rich and meaty; however, I could have done without yet another breezy dismissal of superficial L.A. in a subsequent chapter. And his unwillingness in the chapter on San Francisco to address his own sexuality is rather tiresome; he seems rather an old-fashioned nelly in his reluctance to state the obvious. And the book's organization is a mess--nothing holds together; it all seems rather disconnected. And what exactly the argument with his father is is unclear since he ends up coming to the same conclusions. He's an odd mixture of a writer: raised with the progressive optimism of the U.S. but by temperament more attuned to the cynicism and resignation of Latin culture. Still, this book shows him to be far more human and interesting a writer than the dry, careful prose of Hunger of Memory suggests. In Days of Obligation, the hunger is at least partially sated."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"Richard Rodriguez, is, to say the least, a dense writer. His prose overflows with allusions to the demonic Romantic founder William Blake, work ethic orientated Victorian philosopher Thomas Carlyle, with small dash of natural theologian St. Thomas Aquinas, among others. And these are only the obvious references to me. Add that to classical literature, Roman Catholic philosophy, pre and post lapsearian filters on the role of Mexican Americans in the United States, and you have a philosophical self examination that rivals Dante Alighieri. \\"Days of Obligation\\" is a purposely dense, complex, at times conciliatory and confusing allegory of examination of self via international relations. Rodriguez attempts to unravel the relationship between Mexico and California as he unravels his own relationship with the native land of his parents.He opens his collection with his travels with a BBC crew to find his roots. He feels alienated in a place where everyone assumes he would feel most comfortable. This feeling of alienation continues throughout the collection, and extends to his observations of alienation of those around him. Father Huerta is alienated from others because of his yearning to reunite the body and head of Joaqu&iacute;n Murrieta. The disillusion between the t&uacute; and usted forms in Mexico. The alienation that he feels from his family. More optimistic about his life's potential than his fathers cynicism, more comfortable than his mother who dreams about better days in Mexico.What I found most interesting about this collection is that it seemed, whether intentional or not, to follow basic Blakean philosophy. He makes a reference to a \\"Blakean angel\\" in \\"Late Victorians\\", which to me implies that he had some conscience effort go into that. One of the tenets of William Blakes philosophy is often misunderstood as duality, but its actually the opposite. In a simplified sense, Blake believed that people are neither good or bad, but both good and bad at the same time. And I think that is how Rodriguez sees himself in this collection. He is neither American nor is Mexican, he is both, living in both worlds, unable to fully commit to one or the either.Another interesting thing that I noticed was an emphasis on work. Thomas Carlyle wrote that work was therapeutic, purification process, that made people more focused. Rodriguez seems to play on that idea in a satirical tone in \`Late Victorians' when he writes that \\"Body building is a parody of labor, a useless accumulation of the laborer's bulk and strength\\" Rodriguez seems to believe that there should a reason for work, but this is such an obscure allusion that I'm not sure what to do with it. The book seems to continue with this theme also, but there is nothing specifically that I can point out that seems to obviously fit with that model.I brought up Thomas Aquinas because Rodriguez is a Catholic apologist. As well as a gay man. I thought that tied up into the Blakean philosophy quiet well. Two forces that are generally seen as opposing forces coexisting in one being at the same time in the same place. He is constantly defending the Church, something that I'm sure many people would find perplexing giving the Church's position on homosexuality.I greatly enjoyed the book. It was unlike any other non fiction that I have read. It doesn't concern itself with the typical \\"I feel--\\" statements that generally profusely overflow in contemporary non fiction. His style is reminiscent of Alexander Pope in a way--dense and literal at the same time; pretentious and personal. There is no doubt that his postulations will cause some people to walk away puzzled. He has no yearning to return to Mexico, as some people may assume, but is more than willing to admit that he does not understand the country as much as he would like. He's more than willing to, and does, to write above the average readers head. This alone is what most likely turn readers off. Unless one has a background in ethnic studies, theology, or English literature, the metaphors, references and allusions will go over the everyday readers head. But research into whatever questions the reader has will ultimately make reading the collection a richer experience.Over all, I enjoyed the book, and when my next pay period comes in, I know that I will make a few purchases of his other works to get a greater understanding of his writing. And that is one of the greatest compliment I think that any writer can receive."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"Richard Rodriguez is a gifted writer. He words are almost lyrical at times and at points, Days of Obligation is simply a beautiful experience to read.In Days of Obligation, Rodriguez struggles with so many facets of himself -- notably, his ethnic heritage, his sexuality, his sense of guilt at the chasm between who he is and who he has been told to be by parents and his church. I believe there is a universal element to Rodriguez' struggles. They are the challenges that all human beings encounter in becoming their own unique selves.The added dimension of Rodriguez' Mexican heritage, makes this story all the more fascinating. A wonderful book to have us think about being ourselves in a world full of others expectations as well as an opportunity to get a closer view of Mexican ethnic influences and the related struggles in a United States where far too many people forget they themselves are immigrants or children of immigrants.A highly enjoyable book from many perspectives.James J.

One wonders if in fact all the controversy surrounding the author and the attacks waged against him did not effect a political retreat from his earlier views (which were taken at face value as attacking Mexican &quot;immigrant&quot; culture as &quot;static&quot; and introvertive, while promoting Americanization as progressive). It appears the book is a more bland, and for that less &quot;confrontational&quot; search for identity, and roots. Ultimately, though the author, perhaps unconsciously elucidates the alienation that some Mexicans who've &quot;made it&quot; or become significantly acculturated into the American mainstream feel as a new breed. Not to say the least but although the book is beautifully poetic at times, and quite expressive, capturing in words feelings that for many of Mexican (or other recently immigrant) background have been locked away deeply for fear of remembering, much of the book's subjects are not immediately memorable the way much of &quot;Hunger&quot; was. In this book the author seems to be indirectly apologizing for his earlier views, or at best ineffectively trying to clarify his earlier position on the value and importance of Mexican culture"},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"Richard Rodriguez is a Californian in the best sense of the word, and his book, Days of Obligation: An Argument with My Mexican Father rises to writing's challenge of explaining the inexplicable-- describing the indescribable.What does it mean to be of two worlds...or three, or four, or several? Rodriguez in a dialogue with his father-self struggles with the dualism/duelism of being someone who lives between/among several worlds/states of mind /socio-economic srata/cultures/etc. He does this with prose which incorporates enough historic detail and insight to make even the most miserly readers feel that their time with this book was well spent.If you haven't read Rodriguez before I'd describe his writing as that of an intellecutal Caen, a non-fiction Tan/Allende, or a less profane Capote/Sedaris.You can catch Rodriguez on the The News Hour where his essays and commentary are a cut above the ususal beltway banter.

It was an inspiring and emotional description of how children of immigrant parents are sometimes from old world beliefs and new world knowledge.

It was a breathtaking book that I connected to it in some level.

He was an invited guest of First Lady Laura Bush to speak at an author's fair that she started hosting in Texas while she was the First Lady of Texas. Rodriguez was promoting his book \\"Brown\\" at the the time and I thought his observations were wonderful.\\"Days of Obligations\\" is in a similar vein, but not nearly as focused. He does (primarily) focus on the differences between Mexico and the United States Two interesting observations from Mexicans about America include: 1) \\"America is 'Organized'. Passive voice. Rodriguez notes that there seems to be no connection that actual Americans do the organizing. Rather it's almost like it is fate that America is organized. 2) Americans have too much freedom.Rodriguez digresses from his Mexico/America discussion for an interesting (but off topic) discussion about the gay lifestyle in San Francisco. Perhaps it was meant to be a comparison between Mexicans moving into California and San Francisco's transformation into a beacon for homosexuals. If so, it was poorly correlated, although interesting nonetheless.His observations on multi-culturalism are very interesting. Rodriguez is a hard man to pin down politically. He is a walking dichotomy. Gay. Devoted Catholic. Mexican, but barely speaks Spanish. American but feels that he is different. Anyway, he looks at school to be the ultimate \\"de-individualizer\\" in American society, and that is not entirely bad. He believes that there needs to be a common understanding in society - we all have a common culture if we live in the United States, even if we prefer to ignore it. For example, he stresses the importance of the studying the Founding Fathers: \\"These were the men that shaped the country that shaped my life.\\" He stresses that point off and on throughout the book - the United States shaped his life, Mexico shaped his parents' lives, and even though they brought Mexico with them in their hearts, he did not buy into it - he was shaped much more by America.Rodriguez's obeservations on multiculturalism in the Catholic church and Protestant vs. Catholic (in attitude, worship style, individual vs. communal, even musical themes) take up nearly an hour of the audio edition - but it may be the most interesting hour of all.Rodriguez is a skilled and experienced public speaker (regular duty on PBS plus book tours) so I have to wonder why he did not read his own book. The reader they chose did a great job with accents(primarily Irish and Mexican) and the spoken Spanish was solid so I have no complaints, but still...I give this one an A-. Worth a read, or in my case, a listen while driving to work. Lots of thoughts about immigration, Mexico, religion - and true to Rodriguez's form, no real answers. But, the discussion is worth the time and Rodriguez can turn a phrase quite nicely."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"I am a high school student.

Only Shakespeare understood that Indians have eyes.\\" (p. 23) And how would Mr. Rodriquez know anything about the force of Indian contemplation? He doesn't allow Americans, among whom he numbers himself, to know much of anything. And what's this about Shakespeare? Didn't he just say something about European vocabularies?Informed by his immersion in Elizabethan English, Rodriguez fashions poetry out of absurdity, misanthropy and breathtaking contradiction. He fools high school kids (and it seems a lot have been assigned this book), but the educated, well read adult will be skeptical. How can he complain that he was taught that the Indians were gone, then drag multicultural education through the mud? I'm ANGRY that U.S. history was fed to me divorced from North America. I thought Montezuma was a legend! I defend all efforts at inclusion even when some ridiculous stuff comes along with it. Keep those ideas coming!And why is it that the people who have benefited most from affirmative action spit in its face? It's especially odd coming from a man whose parents moved to the U.S. for the express purpose of bettering their children.Rodriguez is entertaining on the topic of alienation, but he's the perfect example of why I've yearned for a minority gripe: It gives the human soul a hook on which to hang the cloak all mortals wear, the weight of an elegiac separation from God and other people. It's not about being Mexican/American, it's about the human condition: Read the poetry of the precortesian Mexican philosopher Nezahualcoyotl, who, as King of Texcoco, was hardly a stranger in a strange land.Warning to readers: Rodriguez saves all his personal attacks for women. If you find man-hating literature tiresome, which I do, beware misogyny from a man who waxes lyrical about bedpans.Rodriguez strives valiantly to be Octavio Paz, and is even trotted out as our answer to Mexico's Nobel laureate. (See, we Americans can search our souls in inscrutable, contradictory ways, too!) My advice? READ OCTAVIO PAZ INSTEAD. At least he loved life."},{"Title":"Days of obligation; an argument with my Mexican father.","review":"Boring, Boring, Boring.But hey, atleast the book is consistent."},{"Title":"Misalliance","review":"Misalliance, written by George Bernard Shaw, is a fascinating view of the relationship between parents and their children. The first half of the play is a tad dry or as Hypatia (the young daughter who seeks adventure) would put it; the play is filled with \\"talk, talk, talk\\". However with the help of an aeroplane things quickly change.The introduction of a Polish acrobat (Lina) who is nothing like the other two women in the play, results in a strange but intriguing plot twist. The actions that ensue upon the arrival of Lina add action and liveliness to the play. From there the play takes off with crazy tales of love and lust and there is truly no way of telling how this will all end.However great for readers, for what Shaw seems to lack in plot for the first half of the play, he makes up with interesting characters and with ideas that are important to address. He addresses not only the relationship between parent and child but he also shows how women are changing as they look to move to liberate themselves from the control of men. This play shows the evolution of woman in society. Lina is seen as the woman of the future, Mrs. Tarleton is of the past and Hypatia, a woman in between the two, wants to change herself from the times of her mother to follow the footsteps of Lina."},{"Title":"Misalliance","review":"Misalliance is a play focused on the values and interactions among family. The play is based on the story and drama of two upper class families the Summerhays and Tarleton's. Throughout the play they discuss issues that are relevant to the time and heated topics that are not often discussed by families. The women such as Hypatia bring about issues of control and how they should lead their own lives while not letting a husband control their lives. The issue of older men cheating and chasing around younger women is another underlying topic throughout the play. Elderly married men from the play chase women around, while the women of the play try to go out on their own and establish their own being.I enjoyed this play and found it to be interesting because a heated discussion is carried throughout the play. The drama and conflicts of the characters and issues in the play carry the discussion right up until the end. This discussion evolves and changes as each character is introduced with their own beliefs. One thing I did not like about the play though was that the discussion was very lengthy and at times was not filled with anything exciting. Overall I would recommend this play to anyone who is looking for a discussion of family values and beliefs in one easy sitting. The humorous and social discussion that evolves throughout the play carries the book along and makes it an interesting story."},{"Title":"Misalliance","review":"Title: MisallianceAuthor: George Bernard ShawBrief Summary:Misalliance is a Shaw drama set in 1909 in the house of John Tarleton, of Hindhead, Surrey. The play is centered around a middle to upper class family and their close friends: Johnny Tarleton, the son; Bentley Summerhays, the economically blessed, however socially undeveloped friend of the family; Mr. Tarleton, owner of underwear company; Ms Tarleton; Hypatia, rebellious daughter of Tarletons; and Lord Summerhays, father of Bentley. This so called \\"average\\" family goes through a turn of events to turn it upside down and inside out revealing the secrets to each person's true character. They have unexpected guests that literally \\"drop\\" in for a visit; Mr. Tarleton meets fate with the end of a loaded gun, and love triangles and infidelity are everywhere. Deceit and power, parents versus the younger generation, and the male female power struggle are the main themes that run throughout the book. The unexpected is the only thing that stays predictable through the play. Shaw does a very effective job of satirizing society's values, secrets, and powers with money. He uses the stereotypes of individuals to over dramatize the characteristics within this very dynamic group of people.The biggest obstacle in this book is getting past the introduction. Shaw uses more than the first half of his published work to set up and express his own feelings towards society's rituals and traditions. He digresses about his every thought; he holds nothing back. He touches on all the ideas that he will be satirizes in the play. After awhile, the repetitive criticism becomes monotonous, no matter how true his ideas may be.Overall I believe Shaw effectively gets his point across in an entertaining manner. I would rate the play as a highly effective satire of the privileged society's false superiority."},{"Title":"Misalliance","review":"This excellent comedic play is about an impending marriage between \\"a member of the great and good middle class with one of the vicious and corrupt aristocracy (which would be) a misalliance.\\" It is also about the differences (misalliance) between parents and children, and between the leadership of the English people, people with no leadership skills, and the people they are controlling. Two adventurers appear in Hypatia's mundane life, a young man and young woman. Hypatia's father tries to seduce the woman and she tries to seduce the man. Then a stranger appears with a gun saying he came to kill Hypatia's father."},{"Title":"Misalliance","review":"Misalliance is a fast moving play that centers around the effects of love. The elderly men chase the women while the women chase the younger men. It is a writen revolution for the way women should act and speak. The character Lina, who falls from the sky, takes full charge of everything around her. The women are impressed with her while the men become infatuated. Later, the soft spoken Hypatia begins to take charge of her own life. She ignores the Lord and follows her heart. The men throughout the play almost seem to be props for the women's next move.If you enjoy a quick paced play with humor, social change and romance then this is the play for you. Seeing the play acted out is ever better then reading it."},{"Title":"Misalliance","review":"The play of Misalliance is centralized by the main idea of &iexcl;How people live in the old world while waiting for the new world to come?&iexcl; Also, surrounding the main idea, issues such as the interpenetration of parents and children&iexcl;s world, change in ideologies, social expectations verses personal desires...etc are raised in the play. Associated with these profound issues, Misalliance is filled with humors which will surely bring pleasure to readers. This play is packed with pace, humor, romance and concepts all in one; which not only expressed the author Bernard Shaw&iexcl;s beliefs thoroughly, but also bring supreme entertainment to readers. Being a youth myself and brought up in a traditional Chinese family, I find this play highly relevant to my life as I am constantly rebelling against my parents&iexcl; will.

This book includes the staff of Cahiers du Cinema polemically discussing aesthetics, what creates an auteur, and debating the best directors of their time. (Each writer has their personal favorites of course, Bazin-Anthony Mann's westerns) All the essays are incredibly intellectual and strong knowledge of films of the 50s is necessary to even comprehend what they are speaking about. If you are familiar with the works of Renoir, Nicholas Ray, Robert Aldrich, Joseph Mankiwicz, Vittorio De Sica, Vincente Minnelli, Alan Resnais, Hawks, and Hitchcock, here is the place to find trenchant analysis into their works.Some of the most brilliant essays, of course, comes from Andre Bazin, whom in certain circles is contested as the father of film theory (my favorites from Bazin in this collection are 'On the politique des auteurs' and his defense of Kurosawa's Living, following Luc Molluet's thorough trashing of the now considered classic).Also this volume can contribute to your 'movies to see' lists for those real film buffs out there (if you can find them). The back of the book contains the Cahiers annual Best Films Listing from 1955-59.For all the French-film lovin', director wannabees, artsy fartsy, snobbish, 'they don't make 'em like they use to' people like me this is a great book to pick up anytime. Just to read sober, intelligent essays on the art of filmmaking, and what these directors where trying to achieve decades ago. I personally read these essays with a smile, getting simple pleasures out of the high-brow ideologies these young writers/directors once had, and how they went on to change the face of cinema, forever.This is truly a historical collection of essays. 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Cahiers du Cinma: The 1950s: Neo-Realism, Hollywood, New Wave (Harvard Film Studies) (v. 1)","review":"Cahiers Du Cinema most far and away the most important film magazine during the 50's and 60's.

And so there have been attempts to pretend it doesn't exist - you won't find it on the back cover of Tintin books with the other volumes - or to excuse it, by showing how Herge was merely reflecting the attitudes of his time, although, three decades after 'Heart Of Darkness' and the findsings of Roger Casement, it's difficult to justify as naive the (ahem) white-washing of genocidal Belgian colonialism, with the benevolent missionary project celebrated here, full of heroic action-priests. This is certainly the most difficult Tintin to read - watching our hero referring to natives as 'boy'; bullying them into working, and generally abusing them for his mistakes; treating Africa as a big playground where people exist to serve him and animals for the jolly slaughter.Tintin is on a safari holiday to the Congo. His presence, however, is minsinterpreted by the area's gangsters, who send one particularly unlovely goon to get rid of him, which he attempts to do by raising the natives against Tintin. Among the various trials inflicted on our hero, the most memorable include being hung over a river of hungry crocodiles, being charged by an army of M'hatavus; and precipitating on a branch over steep rapids.'Congo' is really Snowy's adventure - from his opening struggle with a parrot on board their cruise, Snowy is prominent, getting into scrapes, endlessly rescuing his recklessly adventurous master, at one point even made king by a tribe of pygmies. This focus is appropriate in an environment stuffed with animals; encounters with crocodiles, snakes, monkeys, buffalo, hippopotami, giraffes and rhinos make up the bulk of the action. This has a sinister side - the monkeys bear a striking resemblance to the Africans, whose flock-like instincts, dumb obedience and malleability marks them as barely above the level of animals, their minds as primitive as their way of life.There are two types of colonialism in this adventure - one, bad, that exploits the natives, treats them as slaves and robs them of their resources; the other, that of Tintin and the missionaries who teach the natives that their home country is Belgium, is benevolent, bringing railways, medicine, education technology, progress. I think it's possible, however, that Herge, contributing to a right-wing Catholic magazine, was straining at his story's ideological limits - the reduction of the train service to a rickety tin-can hardly heralds the success of colonialism; the repeated imagery of holes, trees, fluids (water, rubber seeping from trees), arrows etc., might take on a Freudian dimensnion, suggesting unconscious anxieties behind the optimistic facade - the incident with the buffalos might suggest as much. When Tintin prepares to shoot a rhino, the film camera he had been carrying is turned away - this is an activity best not documented. At one point, a gangster disguises himself as a priest, momentarily suggesting a connection between the two (exploiting) groups. Throughout the story, judgements and observations made by Tintin based on appearances - the wandering of a leopard into a schoolroom; the charge of whooping pygmies - are shown to be inaccurate. The importation of the less pleasant aspects of colonialism - especially militarism - is seen to blow up in the natives' faces.The well-meaning attempts to ignore 'Congo' is wrong, a denial of history, an attempt to pretend Western Europe was never fundamentally racist. The real shame is that the book is a big improvement on its predecessor - the drawing is much more controlled and imaginative - memorable images include the torchlight revelation of a hunting monkey; the rescue attempt by the priest on two wires over the rapids, with the knife-wielding gangster looking on; the pygmy charge through the forest; the silhouette of Tintin hanging from the rope ladder of a biplane as he escapes a herd of buffalo. Most brilliantly, the landscape often mirrors the action, e.g. the palm trees overlooking the homicidal witch-doctor at night."},{"Title":"Tintin Au Congo (Book is NOT Bilingual) (French Edition)","review":"Still one of the best comics around. A very fun adventure story set in the Belgian Congo. Some content may be deemed racist, but please bear in mind that at the time of creation, the Congo in Africa was still under Belgian colonial rule. Herge was a Belgian.

With a portrayal of natives from a deficit model and the killing of multiple exotic creatures, this book reads more like a chapter of history than a children's tale with morals. Still, the book is what the book is: an accurate snapshot of the perceptions of Belgians at this time period. I believe that Herge is a genius in creating story plots and drawing his beloved characters and that the story (like all the others) is extremely amusing. The only reason I give it less than 5 stars is because it demands parental guidance in working through the historical and political differences of the 1920s and now, so that children also understand the lens through which many Europeans viewed their African colonies. Therefore, it turns out to be more of a history lesson than a comic book. May I suggest something like &quot;On a Marche sur la Lune&quot; among many other titles for lighter fare that children can enjoy freely without political implications."},{"Title":"Tintin Au Congo (Book is NOT Bilingual) (French Edition)","review":"tin tin in the congo is a great book if you have someway to translate it.

The problem with this Herg&eacute; offering from the 1930s is that it contains racist ideas and images. &quot;Tintin Au Congo&quot; fully embraces Belgian colonialism, white supremacy, and heroic missionaries bringing the word of God to the unwashed savages. Tintin himself is almost unrecognizable to readers who have come to love him through the traditional 21 adventures in the easily available canon. Tintin calls natives &quot;boy,&quot; bullies them around, and has clearly come to Africa to have a grand timing shooting animals during his safari holiday. More recognizable are the local gangsters who assume Tintin is there to bring them to justice and take pre-emptive action, which results in the recognizable series of perilous escapes. The best part of this adventure is that Milou does more than his fair share in rescuing his master from trouble and ends up becoming the king of the pygmies.As you would expect Herg&eacute; works in as many exotic animals as he can into the story. So there are plenty of crocodiles, snakes, buffalo, giraffes, rhinos and the like. But the problem is that there are also a tribe of monkeys who bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the natives. Fortunately, the benevolent Belgians are there to make the Congo a better place. Now, as far as I am concerned there are clearly a lot of indefensible things in &quot;Tintin Au Congo.&quot; Herg&eacute;'s story and art clearly contain racist elements. I do find the story to be of historical value because it represents a clear manifestation of the racism of the times. Does this get Herg&eacute; off the hook? Absolutely not. But given the humanitarianism that is evident in the vast majority of the Adventures of Tintin it is clear that Herg&eacute;'s attitudes changed for the better. If George Wallace and Strom Thurmond could get away with similar conversions on substantially less evidence in their favor in the political arena, than Herg&eacute; can get the benefit of the doubt when we take into account his entire body of work.Young kids who love the Adventures of Tintin should not read &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; until they are older and can better understand why an author they admire could tell a story so racist and offensive. They certainly do not want to read this story at a point in their lives where they cannot realize what is wrong about this particular story.

Tintin au Congo must have been the first I book I \\"read\\". These pictures and story were drawn and written when you were still lynching blacks. White comedians appeared in black face..so keep trying to find fault in a book that was solely written for children. Belgium was never an imperialistic nation, it's a kingdom. It was a funny story, the world of make believe, Tintin did not put a stick of dynamite after drilling a rhino. It was adventure for children, to see other people with chilldren eyes,a marvelous adventure with animals we had never seen. How do these rightgeous critics rate TinTin in America with only gangsters and cowboys...the Blue Lotus, with British harrassing Chinese and the Japanese all look like jackasses. Captain Haddock inhales whisky, but he is also the president of the League des Marins Antialcooliques. ..."},{"Title":"Temple of the Rainbow","review":"Hidden beneath the adventures of Freemont are eternal spiritual truths that can uplift any reader. Wounded and angry, Freemont struggles with the same problems we all struggle with and slowly becomes more open and compassionate toward life and the others he meets in his travels. He's on his way to discovering the environmental dangers that face all frogs, their causes, and very possibly, sometime in the future, their solutions. Great for children, youth, and adults who are young at heart."},{"Title":"Temple of the Rainbow","review":"This is definitely a book that can be shared with all ages. I have a 7 and a 4 year old. Both of my kids have listened to and fell in love with Freemont. As you follow along on this journey, it is amazing at how many little life lessons are included in the story. The things that we may look at in life that are actually there to help us, not harm us. This book is inspiring and I can't wait for the next one to be released."},{"Title":"The Emergence of Life on Earth A Historical and Scientific Overview","review":"From the ancient Greek philosophers through Enlightenment science to today's high-tech world, how life originated has been a compelling question. Fry presents the thinkers and their ideas about this enigma with penetrating skill. Her recapitulation of the philosophical questions set in their historical perspective demonstrates the persistence of many concepts regarding life's history. \\"Spontaneous generation\\", now considered a quaint idea, dominated the view of theologians and natural scientists alike. Even when empirical experiments demonstrated the falsity of the notion, versions of it remained, deflecting other proposals.Fry shows how Darwin's idea of natural selection over vast periods of time allowed tracing a view of life back to simple, microscopic life forms. Darwin's famous \\"warm little pond\\" may have been an incomplete picture, but it demonstrated a break with established notions. Complex life evolved from simple life, not fully blown from a soiled shirt. Only in the 20th Century did technology and the discovery of unanticipated life forms in extreme conditions allow a look at the chemical basis of life before complexity could emerge.Fry carefully and skillfully examines all these steps, giving each thinker his due while placing him in historical context. There's more than one surprise here for those who don't know the lives of researchers such as Pasteur, Eigen or Oparin. As she reveals the progress of thinking on the subject, Fry examines the roots of various proposals, their advances and their shortcomings. Was life's beginning protein-based? Are amino acids the foundation or the product of life? Did RNA precede DNA or the reverse? Science proceeds on a step-by-step basis and Fry describes that halting, but useful process far better than most. While Fry's descriptive prose reflects a thesis style, the wealth of information here overrides that limited criticism.Among the modern thinkers on life's origins, Fry provides the best summation available on the ideas of two men, Graham Cairns Smith and Gunther Wachtershauser. Both men have offered theories of chemical beginnings of life, the one suggesting clay crystals as replication models, the other utilising the iron-sulfur energy capacity of pyrite. These two concepts are united by Fry in light of the processes found associated with deep sea-floor vents.Fry's conclusion deals with the likelihood of life on worlds other than Earth. The dispute over whether the Antarctic Martian meteorite exhibits organic residues serves to show how limited current information actually is on pre-life chemistry. More research, more examination and more questions need to be posed. Fry's book provides a solid foundation for the next steps. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The Emergence of Life on Earth A Historical and Scientific Overview","review":"Trained in philosophy, but more than conversant in chemistry and biochemistry, Iris Fry does the scientific community a splendid service in offering this comprehensive and up-to-date look at the scientific work being done on life's origins. She points out that it is ultimately a metaphysical matter, resting on faith--but on faith backed up by the splendid track record of scientific empiricism--that life evolved, most likely on Earth, from inanimate matter. But as you read this detailed and wonderfully referenced work the odds of life appearing otherwise appreciably diminish, and a picture, soberly stated and carefully argued, of a metabolic (pre-genetic) origin prior to genes subtly insinuates itself into your rational consciousness. My favorite part of the work is the reference to Jeffrey Wicken whose critique of Manfred Eigen's hypercyle theory leads me to suggest that a selfish RNA world would no more be likely to encumber its streamlined replicants with bodies than an Olympic sprinter would be to run a three-legged race. I am not sure about her Kantian interpretations and she misses some important work on the origins of life, such as Clifford Matthews hydrogen cyanide world; she also does not (in my opinion) sufficiently ground life's early cyclical processes in cyclical nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems. But you can't have everything--where would you put it?I love the fact that she is a philosopher and outside the various factions she surveys. This means she has no axe to grind and you can trust her as a fair guide among the competing views which, she points out, will increasingly come together as science moves forward. Best read along with Freeman Dyson's revised, 1999 edition entitled Origins of Life."},{"Title":"The Emergence of Life on Earth A Historical and Scientific Overview","review":"This is an excellent overview of the research on the origin of life. It starts with historical material, including the refutation of ancient \\"spontaneous generation\\" theories by Pasteur. We then get to the Darwinians. Haeckel in particular felt that inanimate matter made a transition to a living system in an evolutionary manner. In the 1920s, Oparin and Haldane speculated on the organic components and atmosphere that might have been present on the early Earth. And Fry tells us of the Urey-Miller experiment of 1953.Next we find out about the contributions of Sidney Fox, who suggested a model that started with abiotic material and then generated amino acids, condensed them to form \\"protenoids,\\" and then formed cell-like \\"microspheres.\\" This was a \\"protein-first approach.\\" That is contrasted with the \\"gene-first approach\\" and accompanying experiments by Spiegelman, Orgel, and Eigen.There is a discussion of the \\"RNA world\\" and whether or not there was a world of earlier self-replicators. And Fry gives arguments for and against the ideas of Freeman Dyson (with the emphasis on primitive cells), Stuart Kauffman (with the emphasis on \\"catalytic closure\\") and Gunter Wachtershauser (with the emphasis on Iron Sulfide chemistry).Fry is at her best discussing the need to ask if life originated by a series of likely steps, by design, or by one or more unlikely steps. She makes it clear that long required sequences simply can't form by pure chance. There must be some natural ordering (such as in snowflakes) as well as incremental improvement (in an evolutionary manner). And if we are left with some theories that require some incredible luck and some theories that do not require such luck, we'll obviously prefer the latter. She discusses de Duve's ideas here. It seems that a \\"scaffolding\\" approach is a good concept, while autocatalytic cycles may be needed almost by definition (of life).That gets us to the final chapter, where the definition of life is indeed discussed. In addition, Fry talks about the possibility of there having been life on Mars and elsewhere in our solar system. There's also some material about habitable zones, and on the possibility of life on extrasolar planets.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Emergence of Life on Earth A Historical and Scientific Overview","review":"I've read many books on this theme,but I rarely came across a treatise so complete,so vast in scope ans so profound and well written, whit many original and illuminating notations.

In a somewhat journalistic style she briefly revisits the early \\"thought leaders\\" and proceeds to show how orgin of life theory has progressed to the present in keeping with advances in scientific knowledge of molecular chemistry and cell biology. She covers the current schools of thought, supporting research, and major players of the naturalism community without taking sides. This is an excellent resource for someone who seeks a general understanding of the state of origin of life science and its future challenges."},{"Title":"Phonics for the New Reader","review":"&quot;Phonics for the New Reader&quot; will be great part of any phonics-based reading program.

There are 12 'scenarios' with the parent doing a task and the child using a positive behavior to get positive attention from the parent. I also like it because the book doesn't say that the parent will drop everything to play with the child.

He denounced his German citizenship and became a citizen of the United States, none of which I knew before reading this book.His advice was to always ask questions and never lose your curiosity about things. A lot of his teachers didn't like that he asked so many questions that they couldn't answer.

At least he isn't claiming it's from God like Neale Walsch! My review of Walsch's \\"Conversations with God\\" are appropos here as well. BUT...White's world view resonates far better. Furthermore, his books include one of the great classics of metaphysics, \\"The Unobstructed Universe.\\" \\"The Job of Living\\" is a nice book. It tends to be practical advice from a spiritual perspective. But, it's not \\"The Unobstructed Universe.\\" The world view presented in these works (wherever they actually came from) is profound, logical, and fills in many a void in other metaphysical systems. So, if you are turned off by the stated source, just ignore it and read on. Frankly, almost all the books I read are replete with the author's personality, predispositions, assumptions, etc.--it's hard to read between the lines and to separate the wheat from the chaff. In this book, however, that only applies to the source. The material (and, especially in the following volume) is first rate. White also wrote 5 or 6 additional spiritual works, somewhat lesser lights than \\"The Unobstructed Universe\\" or \\"The Betty Book\\" but worth reading.

It is obviously edited to be a course textbook. There are separate prefaces for student and instructor. It would serve equally well as an English Comp. or an Ethics text. Each of the pieces has some ethical question at its center. There are accompanying questions for interested students / instructors.There is a fairly wide variety of styles represented. There is the classic essay, excerpts from larger works, a fine piece of oral history by Studs Terkel, a bit of poetry, even a few cartoons. There are some classical pieces, notably King's \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" and Orwell's \\"Politics and the English Language\\". Balanced with that are relatively unknown works that catch one off-balance with their truth, beauty, pathos.Many of the pieces are startling in their relevance. Sallie Tisdale's \\"We Do Abortions Here\\" should be required reading for anyone who wants to participate in the abortion debate. The Andre Dubus piece entitled \\"Giving Up the Gun\\" talks eloquently about gun control from a personal level. Daniel Baum's \\"The Casualty\\" is a heart-breaking reminder of the singularly personal consequences of war. Finally, the beautiful opening piece by Benjamin Saenz, \\"Exile: El Paso, Texas\\" talks about the consequences of profiling that will be the necessary result of the new anti-immigration laws sprouting up, most notably the Arizona law that is currently (summer, 2010) drawing so much attentionFinally, there is an ironic little joke buried inside. When I first acquired the book (in 2005, before the controversy), prior to the beginning of the semester, I cracked it open to a random page and read the first piece I found. It was an excerpt from James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", the book that brought fame and eventually infamy to Frey for the manufactured bits of \\"autobiography\\". Interestingly, the table of contents reads as follows:5. Is Honesty the Best Policy 375WHAT WOULD YOU DO? A CASE OF PLAGIARISM 376JAMES FREY, How Do You Think It Makes Your Mother Feel? 378Frankly, I think this irony adds to the quality of the book. If I were among the the editors publishing a second edition, I would leave the essay in and add some context of the history of the piece. If you're going to have a book centered on ethics questions, it should face the problem straight on. One of the cartoons is a Calvin and Hobbes classic where Calvin debates the pros and cons of cheating on a test. I'll leave it to the interested reader to find the sweet relevance of the punchline.The fact that I purchased a copy for a friend could be taken as a testimony to its quality. How many times does one feel compelled to purchase a second copy of a textbook as a gift?Enjoy."},{"Title":"Open Questions: Readings for Critical Thinking and Writing","review":"This book discusses the most difficult questions.

(Potter's property was left to the National Trust.) The focus of the book is Hilltop Farm, the first farm Beatrix Potter acquired. Although she lived across the road in Castle Cottage, Potter often used Hilltop for its library, guestroom, and workplaces. She also used it to display her &quot;treasures.&quot; This book reveals her love of nature, the English Lake District, and of old things--carved dressers, chests, spinning wheels are a few of the &quot;gems&quot; portrayed. Two-page color spreads convey the beauty of the Lake Area, where Potter became a major landowner, sheepfarmer, and a happily married woman. It is wonderful to see the original places, buildings, and objects that she incorporated into her books (examples are shown side by side). The book's layout, photographs, and design are first-rate. Reading this book reminded me of THE PRIVATE WORLD OF TASHA TUDOR and its wonderful photographs by Richard Brown. Like Tudor, Potter drew what she knew and preferred country to city life. (Tudor also was a working farmer in New Hampshire.) Finally, this book presents information about Beatrix Potter and the things and people she loved in an informative and respectful way. This book is not a biography, and Denyer avoids the biographer's temptation to &quot;sum up&quot; or &quot;explain&quot; Beatrix Potter. Rather, we draw our own conclusions after being exposed to the things Potter loved. The select bibliography at the book's end provides a list of works on and by Potter (her journals and letters have been published) that is very helpful to those who want to know more about this author. This is a book to treasure."},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"Being the big fan of Beatrox Potter, the woman and not just the author I was overjoyed to get this as a gift recently and the book is a treat for the eyes. While it has pages and pages of stunning photographs as well as her own water colours, it is the text and complete history of her farms that is awesome.That and reading and seeing photographs of her as well as her farms and reading why she bought each property and the breeds of sheep she raised was of special interest to me. I loved seeing the inside of her farms, although I had seen the inside of a few, via the National Land Trust to whom she left her properties.I loved the photographs of Beatrix and how she was so eccentric, kind yet firm and a woman ahead of her time. And it was nice to read that she was a true homestead style woman who had the waste not want not mentality, as well as a deep appreciation for quality and hated to see old bridges torn down for modern ones, although she was quick to make sure the stones and plants, wood and other things being discarded by some, didn't end up in some dump area but were recycled into new walls and buildings and plantings on her property.This is a book a cottage gardener, keeper of sheep. painters, stone masons and anyone who loves working with their hands will love. As well as sincere environmentalists and organic gardeners and farmers."},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"This book is a balanced combination of biographical information, Beatrix Potter's sketches and paintings, and exceptional scenic photography of the Lake District she helped preserve. It also details the exterior and interior of a house she owned which provided the backgrounds for many of her book illustrations. The side-by-side comparisons were interesting, even though the house seemed to be more of a showpiece than her actual residence. (Thus, the book title is somewhat misleading.) I found this book to be of exceptional quality and, although the text was sometimes overwrought with property, town and house names, the book includes many captioned photos and a map that allow the reader to appreciate the area in which she lived."},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"What a beautiful book.

It is a room by room description of Beatrix Potter's Hill Top farm house and includes the gardens. Beatrix started journaling about what she loved in a home from the time she was nine years old and this house is the cummulation of a life long interest in interior and exterior design theory. She fit in with the whole Arts and Crafts movement of the time. The house was deliberatly her largest artistic creation, she didn't actually live there very much. Again, it is a beautiful book and has many fasinating details about Beatrix Potter, her family and her times."},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"I can't really put my finger on why I found this book to be disappointing ... Possibly because I am in the middle of Linda Lear's monumental and wonderful biography of Beatrix Potter; she has lots of photos in her book and she gives great place descriptions. I bought this book because I wanted more of Potter's very special watercolors and more period photography. Instead, I get modern day photos of her home presented as a showplace, restored for visitors. I think this book reminded me of a large \\"brochure of The Lake District, featuring a tour as well as the home of Beatrix Potter\\".Nevertheless, there are many gems in this book, such as Potter's photo of the \\"pace-eggers\\", and lovely landscapes of the area."},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"I am thrilled with this book .

However, Ms. Potter herself was at least as interesting as her children's book, and in my opinion quite a bit more interesting! This fascinating book is less a biography of Ms. Potter than it is an explanation of who she was and what made her \\"tick.\\"Overall, I found this to be a very interesting book. I have read several biographies of Beatrix Potter, but this book really is in a class by itself. I loved the look into the great lady that it gave me, and I really, really loved the numerous pictures of her and the places she knew. It really is an exciting book!"},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"What a wonderful book! I've always loved Beatrix Potter (so much so that I named one of my daughters Beatrix) and this book has so much history and has not only breathtaking photos but drawings and illustrations that are captivating. So interesting to see Beatrix's characters come to life in her actual surroundings. She was ahead of her time with her independence and decisions to showcase her talents when her own mother just wanted her to get married and be a socialite.I find it almost sad in a way that the greatest children's author of our time never had kids of her own. She had a great sense of humor, a tremendous work ethic and her dedication as a Philanthropist to the Lakes District is inspring. She managed to buy over 4000 acres herself that her husband, William Heelis, gave(as Beatrix wanted) to the National Trust when he passed away only 18 months later. I can't wait to take my own family to the land that inspired Beatrix and that she loved so much."},{"Title":"At Home With Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit","review":"I really love this book!

When I was a sophmore in college I burned down my dorm room and my copy of High Windows. It was truly tragic. This slim little volume contains some of Larkin's best work. It is wry, revealing, and sardonic in true Larkin fashion. I particularly like the title poem and None of the Books Have Time. Also, there's one in there about the stubborn stupidity of old folks that is absolutely delightful and hilarious though the title escapes me at the moment. Anyway, this small book that won't take up either much time to read or much space on the shelf is a delightful and highly recommended piece. One of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"High Windows (Penguin/Faber audiobooks)","review":"As a new comer to Philip Larkin I wasn't quite sure what to expect of his work. However, since receiving High Windows it has been a delightful addition to my collection. I've found myself at times tossing it in my bag to take with me only to read and reread it out of sheer enjoyment of this man's talent!"},{"Title":"High Windows (Penguin/Faber audiobooks)","review":"I ordered the book thinking that it was the collection, High Windows by Philip Larkin. But, this book was worth the purchase! It had great commentary on the poems and analysis. Also, the book arrived very quickly and in good condition."},{"Title":"High Windows (Penguin/Faber audiobooks)","review":"Philip Larkin, High Windows (Faber, 1974)Larkin, the celebrated librarian-poet, got somewhat cranky in his middle age. He also got more experimental, both qualities that make for fine poetry. Add to these scurrilousness, a wicked sense of humor, and an ear for rhythm matched only in the modern world's finest poets, and you have a recipe for greatness.So why doesn't Larkin always pull it off? Good question. When he's on, he's very, very on, but when he's off, it's a mess. Unlike most poets, Larkin seems to have been able to switch back and forth between formal and free verse at will a number of times, but he did make the grade-school gaffe of trying to combine the two more than once. And a good deal of his \\"politically incorrect\\" (for lack of a better term) poetry smacks more of the juvenile than the Shakespearean:\\"Jan von Hogspeuw staggers to the doorAnd pisses at the dark. Outside, the rainCourses in cart-ruts down the deep mud land.Inside, Dirk Dogstoerd pours himself some more...\\"(\\"The Card-Players\\")Despite these excursions into the ridiculous, however, Larkin does still exhibit his mastery more often than not in this slim volume, and it's worth picking up either for the established Larkin fan or the newcomer who wonders what happened to metrical poetry after World War II. ***"},{"Title":"Watermark","review":"Jacquleyn Pope's \\"Watermark\\" touches on despair, identity, history, and hope. Pope's is a poetry of dead-ends and new beginnings that catches a self and a voice in transition against the sights, habits, and smells of Amsterdam. Pope's language has energy and mystery with quiet passion attaining the directness of incantation or prayer.These poems are technically accomplished and interesting. Pope uses enjambment, rhythm, and sound as gestures to reinforce the speaker's character, conflict, and mood. Her controlled tone preserves emotional complexity and gives the voice integrity while speaking about identity, relationship, crisis and transition.Phrases and lines that bring to mind glittering mosaic tiles haunt these poems and stay with a reader. For example in \\"Raddled\\" is \\"bruise of a buttonhole,/ the gap where I gather\\"; from \\"In the Bonehouse,\\" emerges,\\" \\"a stitch of skin gave shape/to the hollowed form I fit;\\" or, in \\"Furiouser and Furiouser,\\" we find, \\"I'll swing out, tipsy and shifting,/beggared by my rounds/ and the curse of cowardice.\\" In this way, Pope shades feeling and event into being rather than using the stark outlines of narrative. \\"Watermark\\" is a worthwhile journey. Get the book."},{"Title":"The War Lover","review":"John Hersey has created a wonderfully thought-provoking book in The War Lover. Hersey combines a familiar setting, World War II, with unfamiliar human emotions -- emotions only experienced by those who fought in the war. Hersey also has a gift for using flashbacks to enlighten the reader about the underlying reasons for a character's thoughts, feelings, or actions.One doesn't have to enjoy war literature to enjoy this book. It reaches way beyond the war, right into the human spirit."},{"Title":"The War Lover","review":"I read a lot, I'm reviewing this book not as an expert but as a reader. The story is OK, it has some good thoughts, but in my opinion it's not Very good or Excellent, so I give my opinionated rating of 3 stars. Doesn't mean the book isn't great, just that, to me, it doesn't compare to very good or excellent, 5 star stories/novels. Sufficiently philosophic, and good detail of WW2 American airborne."},{"Title":"The War Lover","review":"Set in England during WW II, this suspenseful novel tells about the 24th (and last) mission flown by a group of airmen, with special emphasis on the pilot Buzz Marrow and co-pilot Charles Boman. Marrow is the daring, talented, overly macho leader whom everyone in the crew looks up to - except Boman, who has learned something about him from his lover Daphne. Two separate storylines wend their way through the novel, one concerned strictly with the mission at hand, the other going back in time and relating character background of the principal people.In what he considers a major act of betrayal Boman learns from Daphne after she has slept with Marrow that Marrow is basically in love with his plane (named \\"The Body\\"), with the destructive power he wields during his bombing raids, with war itself - all in the most erotic of ways. In sleeping with him she reveals to Marrow his true nature, the knowledge of which he takes with him on that 24th mission, which ends disastrously with the plane crashing into the sea and Marrow choosing to go down with the sinking plane rather than be rescued.Hersey develops his story with great assurance; the scenes with Bowman and Daphne as their feelings for each other blossom are very well done and believable. Not so believable is Daphne's motivation to sleep with Marrow (she's a strong character and seems as if she'd be above his caveman brutishness), but her justifying it to Boman as a reaction to her feeling that Boman didn't really love her and was coming to the end of his time in England anyway is honest enough to dilute much of the anger he's feeling toward her. It's a wise conclusion to the Daphne-Boman affair, even if it's just a bit too calculating as part of the plot structure. The novel presents an interesting and intense story of love in a number of ramifications within a wartime setting: love for others, self-love, and self-loathing in the name of love. Well done."},{"Title":"The War Lover","review":"I suppose it takes guts to write an anti-war novel which takes place in World War II, because by attempting to discredit the war effort against Hitler, as The War Lover (and Catch-22) does, the author implicitly states that any war against any tyrant is improper, illegal and immoral. In The War Lover, there is a lot of interesting and apparently accurate period detail of life at an airbase in World War II, but beyond that, don't look here for anything worth reading.This novel would be a good example for James Bowman's classic \\"Honor: A History\\" of how Western intellectuals abandoned the concept of honor in the Twentieth Century, which is the only thing that enabled us to stop Hitler. Buzz Morrow, the \\"war lover\\" of the title, is a good leader, but there is little else to distinguish him from anyone else. His end - where he collapses when the chips are down - comes without any sense of the character which would lead you to expect this development, an inexcusable lapse in a book so long and tedious.Unlike, say, Herman Wouk in The Caine Mutiny, Mr. Hersey lacks the grace to give his warrior the credit where credit is due. True to form with the standard issue, plodding anti-war novel, Hersey's pacifistic intellectual turns out to be a better soldier than the true warrior. This intellectual pipe dream has become a cliche in the past 90 years. One hopes that Americans will never have to discover how false this illusion is."},{"Title":"Stickmaking Handbook","review":"Based on the authors' \\"Stick Making: A Complete Course.\\" Andrew Jones and Clive George, devote the first chapter of this book going over finding, cutting, seasoning sticks, what types of wood is used, as well as the tools used.

It's not an unmixed happiness, though, because many people she knows and loves remain behind the borders of Hilter's Reich. Kristallnacht, the Night of Breaking Glass, brings her sorrow; but it brings stark terror at best, and death at worst, to Jews within the Reich. And to those who protect Jews, also, including Elisa's Gentile aunt and her family: Helen and Pastor Karl Ibsen and their children, Lori and Jamie.Once again we meet Otto Wattenbarger, the Nazi son of a Tyrolian farm family whose other members we've seen taking enormous risks in the earlier books of this series. Otto, we now know, isn't what he so carefully appears to be. He's who his parents raised him to be, after all. But will taking in Karin Wallich and her three children, the family of a Jew who has died in Nazi custody, and attempting to give them new and Aryan identities, be Otto's undoing at last? And what about Lucy Strasburg, the peasant girl from Munich who's now living with an S.S. officer in Vienna, as she begins to see her beloved for what he really is, and as his child grows in her womb? What about Alfie Halder, the \\"dummkopf\\" who escapes from a Nazi-run \\"hospital\\" just in time to avoid euthanasia?The cast of characters in this fifth installment of the Zion Covenant series has grown, but each of its members - established and newly introduced, alike - lives and breathes and seems fully real. The authors do a good job of keeping the plot threads sorted out for the reader, and their historical accuracy continues to be spot on. Preaching in this one is minimal, and that's fortunate because it is not needed.

Thanks."},{"Title":"Danzig Passage (The Zion Covenant #5)","review":"I give this movie 4 stars mainly because of the character of Alfie Halder and the genuine portrayal of one of the darkest times in history. The scenes involving Karl Ibsen's imprisonment are as heart-renching as the scenes describing the Kalner boys' escape and their refuge in New Church are tense and heart-stopping. The New Church scenes bring to mind the atmosphere of the Diary of Anne Frank. Lori Ibsen is rather like Anne, dealing with physical and emotional changes in herself (she seems to both love and hate Jacob Kalner) as well as the dangers brought about by war.Indeed, Lori, Lucy and Marlene, the three new females introduced in this book, are the reason for my less than perfect review. All the problems that the Wallich family and the \\"Danzig Gang\\" suffer seem to be solely because of their female members. Lori and Marlene are always whining or arguing or doing something that puts the others' lives in danger. Lucy is something of a silly weakling though she does get better as the book goes along. I wished for some more likeable, heroic females like Elisa, Leah and Victoria of the previous books in this series rather than the weak, disobedient \\"daughters of Eve\\" found here. BROCK Thoene must've helped his wife write this one; there is so much woman bashing! And as for Peter Wallich, I HATED HIM! His sister Marlene is just a child, after all, and he is BEASTLY to her. When reading about him, I tried to tell myself that he, like Jacob and Lori, is trying to deal with growing up fast and handling a difficult, adult situation, but still I wanted to shake him! After enduring so many arguements and frustrations at the hands of the Danzig gang and the Wallichs, the scenes involving Alfie and Werner kitty were like a breath of fresh air. Alfie is something of a foil for the other characters in this book. He seems simple, yet he understands the dangers that he's in. Of all the characters, he is probably the most untouched by the war, still maintaining his innocence and his happy outlook on life. When you can identify with and understand characters that you don't particularly like, it is a sign of a good writer. Yes, I rank this 5th on my enjoyable scale of the six Zion Covenant book, the tragic Munich Signature being 6th. Maybe it's not my favorite in the series, but still very good. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Interurban interlude;: A history of the North Jersey Rapid Transit Company, (A Carstens publication)","review":"This book is 'the' source for anyone curious about the North Jersey Rapid Transit line that ran from Suffern, New York to Paterson, New Jersey. Quinby, who worked for the NJRT, provides a thorough description of the line's physical features and operations, peppered with interesting asides of his personal experiences. By necessity, the level of detail pulls in much of the history of North Jersey during the early 20th century, and this book should be a staple in all local libraries in towns along the former NJRT corridor. The book also does a good job explaining how government/incompetence effectively destroyed the railway, a subject which Quinby was quite passionate about. Note that this is the same E.J. Quinby who was the first to expose the 'General Motors streetcar conspiracy', which undermined public transit to encourage automobile sales."},{"Title":"Curious Minds: How a Child Becomes a Scientist","review":"Despite the subtitle of this book, the stories are less a guide to making your child into a scientist and more a series of autobiographical essays.Sounds boring? Absolutely not.The writing is alive and vibrant, the stories are funny and poignant. While you might approach this book thinking \\"I can help my child love science\\", you'll probably leave thinking \\"this science stuff sounds interesting, how come I've not tried it?\\".As you read you'll find many examples of people who were turned on to a love of discovery because of some adult they met who treated them as a colleague or a collaborator.Read the book.

For all of the current passion for loading our children up with the \\"best\\" and \\"the latest\\", the best approach is perhaps to simply get out of the way. What struck me about this book was that so many of the scientists profiled made do with very little as children--it wasn't all chemistry sets and parents with advanced degrees. My favorite was the primatologist who was inspired by the Bronx Zoo down the block AND the theme-song from Gilligan's Island (\\"...the professor and Mary-Ann\\" convinced him that brains might attract women). There was the woman whose parents wanted her to be a nightclub singer, but the Nancy Drew books she read led her to love investigations. A brain surgeon grew up searching for bullets in the brains of cows that his cowboy-butcher father processed. Indeed some of the scientists don't even find their focus until adulthood (in other words, if your high-schooler doesn't win the Intel science prize, there's still hope). This book made me realize that inspiration is all around my children and the wisest thing I can do is just be supportive."},{"Title":"Curious Minds: How a Child Becomes a Scientist","review":"Although the subtitle uses the terms, Child and Scientist, I think the real topic is how a person develops into a successful, creative adult. I found the book fascinating as I looked for patterns to validate how I raised my own children, or how I was raised, or how anyone should mentor younger people. What I learned was that becoming a scientist or any thinking adult is a mixture of luck, genetics, family influence, peer influence, and social setting. There is no recipe, but there may be patterns for our children and ourselves.While this was not a well constructed statistical survey, it was a well conceived set of informative essays from interesting, successful folks.

Do scientists work in industry? Not in this book. Is your child a female? She would be a distinct minority if she becomes a scientist, to judge by this book. Will your child have a Ph.D. by age 21? No? How disappointing. The scientist profiled in the first chapter, Nicholas Humphrey, descendent of famous scientists who grew up an acquaintance of, among others, young Stephen Hawking, captures why this book misses the mark in its selection of role models for aspiring scientists. He \\"wonders if having been born to be a scientist has not undercut my right to call myself a scientist at all.\\" That is too harsh.

I think that fate has some place in what we become and do at a particular phase in our lives. It was in grad school when his interest in language became the focus for his career in vocabulary and grammar, my special interests, too.Just like a man, when he is confronted with a question or situation he isn't expecting, he just nods -- therefore, no real \\"thinking\\" takes place. For a psychology professor, he has a strange way of thinking about truth, changing his viewpoint as the whim hits him.

Usually we find our niche in life quite acccidentally.Most of us don't know what we will become (when suffering through childhood) nor any way to deflect what the future has in store for us. Happenstance has a way of steering us in a direction we might not want to go. We never know when life will throw us a curve ball.The old hometown is full of transplants and aliens interested only with making big money, not in promoting \\"curious minds\\" of children to become scientists. Thomas Wolfe was right, \\"You can't go home again.\\" Because home is where you are, not the place you were born. That's a myth -- an illusion. Nothing is ever the same.

The primary purpose of this text is to strengthen the vocabulary of the learner. It is designed with the adult learner in mind, tailoring the vocabulary and language exercises to be of use to those who are continuing their education toward GED, community college and general literacy skills.Each chapter of the book has three key elements - word mastery, learning strategies, and interesting features of words. In the mastering of words, each chapter presents the tried-and-true vocabulary list, to be used again and again in the course of the chapter (and repeated occasionally throughout later chapters). Several sentences are used to put the words in context. It is not simply a dull list of definitions - words are connected, and related words given.Learning strategies are introduced in each chapter as well. These include use of a dictionary (how can you look up a word when you don't know how to spell it?), using context clues to figure out the meaning of a word, analysing word elements by parts (prefixes, suffixes, etc.), and learning words in settings such as forms, newspapers, and other familiar settings.The special interest sections include articles that highlight the vocabulary (articles include the history of Ben &amp; Jerry's, stories of how cars get named, biographical stories of famous people like Jackie Robinson, and more), as well as brief histories of words and word categories.Each chapter has a variety of exercises - mix and match, word association, fill in the blank, analyzing paragraphs, discussion questions for the reading passages, and more.The one thing I would wish for this text would be a general glossary or dictionary at the end of the book, for students to use with greater ease in looking up the meanings of words. This could be organised in the manner of a dictionary, to be useful for the dictionary use exercises, too. Other than this, \`The World of Words' serves as a very useful guide in language arts, reading and writing classes, as well as for individual tutoring for those looking to enhance their basic literacy skills."},{"Title":"The World of Words: Vocabulary for College Students","review":"I was very pleased with the speedy shipping and condition of the used book.

So I ordered this book. What did I learn? NOTHING! It covers much of the commonplace information that I've seen dozens of times -- in newspapers, in widely circulated magazines, and in pamphlets given away at the local old folks' center. For instance a little forgetfulness does not imply Alzheimer's, and senior citizens should maintain contact with other people.

This was a well paced romance/thriller and I found it to be engaging."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"When I was about halfway through Nine Coaches Waiting, I found myself on the phone with my mom, who asked me what I was reading. Since it's a relatively obscure book, I didn't expect her to react the way she did: \\"I read that thirty years ago!\\" And \\"Your aunt loved Mary Stewart's books.\\" Apparently, it was so \\"trashy\\" that my grandfather forbid his daughters to read it.My copy of this 1958 book is a 2006 reprint, and I have to say that, considering what's published these days, Nine Coaches Waiting isn't all that scandalous. But it's a great novel of Gothic suspense and romance nonetheless, borrowing from the styles of the Bronte sisters and Daphne DuMaurier.The story begins when half-English, half-French Linda Martin goes to be a governess in France to nine-year-old Philippe, Count of Valmy. Although Linda forms a special bond with her ward, she senses something distinctly dangerous and sinister about Philippe's uncle Leon and his aunt. That doesn't stop Linda from rushing headlong into a romance with the Valmys son, Raoul. Soon, however, Linda begins to notice that something is not quite right about the \\"accidents\\" that Philippe keeps having...As I've said before, there's a heavy Bronte/ DuMaurier influence here (though one can hardly blame Stewart for borrowing from her predecessor; Daphne DuMaurier did the same forRebecca). The book could have been campy, but it's not. Instead, it's a wonderful, intricately-plotted novel of suspense. I finished reading this book days ago, but it took me a while to figure out what to say in this review. The novel is the kind that stays with you for a long time. And you'll never feel the same way about a wheelchair ever again."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"When Linda Martin first learned about the position of governess at Chateau Valmy in France for the young Philippe, she pounced upon it; though Madame de Valmy asked for an English girl.

Almost imediately, Linda \\"smells sulphur\\". Both Leon de Valmy and his wife seemingly ignore the child but after the fist accident that almost results in Philippe's death, Linda trusts no one.The only person other than Linda who appears suspicious is the dark, handsome, Raoul de Valmy, Leon's son.

I've worn out my original."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Keeps you on the edge of your seat. You keep trying to predict what is going to happen but end up not being right. An exceptional book."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I read - and loved - many of Mary Stewart's romantic suspense novels about 35 years ago when I was a teenager. I had forgotten about her until I came across \\"Nine Coaches Waiting\\" at a book sale, and snapped it up to read again. After that, I read \\"Thornyhold\\" for the first time.She's a wonderful writer, and has a great ability to describe beautiful houses and the surrounding countryside in such mouthwatering detail that I immediately want to be transported there - preferably as the owner, not the governess!Although NCW was very enjoyable this time around, I found it to be somewhat amateurish when I read it through the prism of my own life experience (and lifetime of reading other novels, which I didn't have when I first read it).Some spoilers may follow but they're minor.There was a plot twist in which the family doesn't know that Our Heroine (OH) speaks fluent French. Unfortunately, this never comes into play in any meaningful way. Early on, the husband says something to the wife in French, one sentence, which OH hears and understands. But this sentence is really a throwaway line and doesn't advance the plot. Then, for no apparent reason, we are told in the middle of the book that probably the husband has most likely figured out that she speaks French. We're not told WHY or HOW he could have figured it out - but the plot device is dropped after that, and this whole \\"she's really French but they think she's English\\" angle doesn't matter after all.One plot device which gets a bit tired and is not credible: in both \\"Nine Coaches Waiting\\" and \\"Thornyhold\\" OH falls madly in love with a man after spending less than a day in his company. Just - not believable. Especially considering that in both novels, OH has very little life experience and is most likely - dare I say it? - a virgin. Sure, such women have mad crushes but - they don't usually turn into deep love, as we're expected to believe they do here. And, the male characters seem a bit impenetrable - they are of course madly attractive but - not fully fleshed out.One problem with the first person narrative of Mary Stewart's books is that we only see things through OH's eyes. While that's fine, it means we never really see OH - the most important character in the book - through anyone else's eyes. this doesn't have to be the drawback that it seems to be in her novels ... if you really devote time to fleshing out the other characters' personalities, or put words in their mouths that show how they feel about OH -and why. Ms. Stewart skimps on this a bit.Ms. Stewart is also extremely Victorian, for lack of a better word, in her approach to romance. I mean, we don't even get to see the main romantic characters KISS! He grabs her, then we fade to black (virtually) and only fade back in after the romantic action, wiith a line such as \\"...when I could breathe a few minutes later...\\" I mean, surely she could have given us a bit more payoff without even coming close to being prurient!I've been nitpicking in this review, and you might be wondering why I gave the book four stars. Well as I said in the beginning, she's a really wonderful writer, and every scene holds your interest, despite the drawbacks mentioned above. There are many pages of truly thrilling suspense in this novel, all of it credibly written. Refreshingly, none of it involves the sort of stupid gunfight scenes that pass for suspense in the movies today..."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Wow! This is the sort of book that comes along all too rarely. It is a fast-paced, suspenseful story with intricate plot twists and characters who seem so real-to-life that you feel sure you'd recognize them on the street. Mary Stewart is a master of this hybrid genre (mystery/suspense/romance/psychological thriller)and, for my money, Nine Coaches Waiting is her best effort among an impressive and prolific array of novels. A caveat should be issued to the reader, however -- this book may well cause serious sleep deprivation. It's that compelling.

From the first pages where the lonely but determined young woman (with the wry sense of self-deprecating humor) grabs your heart to the final pages where the young man \\"who was raised in a house that was not for children\\" chases her down (literally), it is as fine a work of literature as you will ever read. Mary Stewart comes out of the old days of classical liberal arts education, where poetry was essential and Shakespeare mattered. Her writing reflects this -- with an artist's' eye for detail and a hiker's love of nature and topography. As \\"Linda\\" arrives in 1950's France, so do we. Ah, l'amour!"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I guess mysteries have always been a part of my life. Ever since my mom handed me that first Nancy Drew--The Hidden Staircase--that thirst for the clues, the search, the not knowing has stuck with me. That, combined with the fact that they are very nostalgic for me, and you get to read about a lot of them. Mary Stewart is my very favorite when it comes to romantic suspense and her many mysteries are serial re-reads for me. In the best of times and the worst of times, she comes through with an unrivaled spirit of adventure, panache, and wanderlust. I will forever have my mom to thank for finding her first Mary Stewart in a small town library when she was in high school, painstakingly collecting lovely used copies over the years, and reading them over and over again so that one day I would grow up and want to do the same. If you ask my mom which one is her favorite she'll probably tell youAirs Above the Ground. It takes place in her beloved Austrian Alps and features a dangerous fire, a missing husband, and a legendary horse. It's definitely the one I saw her re-reading most often. If you ask me, I get \\"that look\\" on my face and dither around about the virtues of this one and that one. Which is exactly what I did trying to decide which one to post on today. I ended up with NINE COACHES WAITING because it may be the most potent combination of every element I love about Ms. Stewart's novels. It's certainly one of the ones I re-read most often.Belinda Martin (Linda for short--or for pretty, as her mother used to say) lands in Paris on a cold, gray, and rainy day. She is on her way to her brand new post as a governess to the young Count Philippe de Valmy. Having lost both his parents in a tragic accident, the nine-year-old little boy lives with his aunt and uncle in the vast and ornate Chteau Valmy in the French countryside. L&eacute;on de Valmy, Philippe's uncle, runs the estate on behalf of his underage nephew until he comes of age and arranged for a proper English governess for his charge. When Linda arrives at the imposing manor, she is at once enchanted by its beauty and history, but is also immediately struck by the sense of menace and doom surrounding the land and its inhabitants. L&eacute;on is a charismatic force of nature and quite charming with it, and when Linda meets his reckless and rakishly handsome son Raoul, she understands a bit more about the Valmy heritage and what makes this family tick. As she becomes closer to Philippe and Raoul, Linda draws ever nearer to putting her finger on the source of the threat. But the layers of danger and darkness run deeper than any of them guessed and she may not be able to trust those she wants to, no matter how innocent or attractive they may seem. Soon it is up to the shy young governess to beat the clock in order to save Philippe's life as well as her own.This is the kind of heady, romantic, foreboding tale that wraps you up in its elegant wings and carries you off for parts unknown. Linda is immediately sympathetic, with her loneliness wrapped around her like a threadbare cloak, her fierce protectiveness of Philippe, and the way she verbally spars with L&eacute;on de Valmy and manages to emerge unscathed. She is what this darkly glorious place needs and there are wonderful little touches here and there of the Jane Eyre and Rebecca about this novel. And the entire story winds on in that delicious vein. The exquisite suspense lingers to the very last and the relationships between the characters are real, romantic, and wholly delightful. Every time I read it I fall in love all over again with lovely Linda, dangerous Raoul, adorable Philippe, and beautiful, haunting Valmy. And I get chills at the same parts every time single time. NINE COACHES WAITING showcases a master storyteller at her very best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"A friend recommended this audiobook to me after I told her how much I enjoyed Davina Porter's reading of the earlier Hamish Macbeth books by M.C. Beaton. The story itself is very engrossing, especially after the first few chapters (albeit a little excessive on the descriptions of surroundings, and notwithstanding my disagreement with the heroine's romantic choices). What makes it great as an audiobook is the reader, who is adept in both English and French and makes the characters come alive as a great actor would."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"There was something so amazing about this book even when I first started reading it. I couldn't put it down. The book takes place in France. Linda goes to become the governess for the young Comte de Valmy. Someone is trying to dispose of him.

I really wanted to trust the charming Raoul, but I didn't know what to think. I loved the relationship between Linda and Raoul, it was kind of humorous to me in a strange way. I really enjoyed this book. It was a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This is my first encounter with this author. I did not get this book from Amazon. I am always on the hunt for a good book, and found my copy in my local Salvation Army store. Style 1800's , although judging by the cadillac driven by one of the characters the time period is probably nearer to 1920-1940, setting France , nearing the end of grand estates and governesses, servants and Great Houses as we remember them in the last quarter of the 1800,s. Like Jane Austen who keeps her romances nicely low, low key in the essence of nothing more than a kiss here or there, Stewart does the same in this novel. I adore Jane Austen, the Brontes, etc... so at first I was worried this was going to be so closely patterened to the Austen style that it might end up being disappointing because it would be more of a copy of Austens' style which I would not like I don't want a book that is merely a copy of another authors style. I was not disappointed, suddendly the romance turned into a fabulous mystery and I read the book in a day, because I just could not put it down. I will absolutely be purchasing more of this authors works. It is a period I adore, and anytime I find a really good book from this period that does not compromise great morals, I can't wait to get into it. So if you love books by the writers I mentioned and other authors like this you owe it to yourself to check Stewarts writing out."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This is the first book I have read by author Mary Stewart and I plan on reading the rest of her published works. The book was extremely suspenseful, especially the second half where Linda the governess is making her getaway from the evil at Valmy. The author gives superb descriptions and plot twists and turns as Linda runs for her life throughout the countryside of France. However, the one area this book came up short is on the romantic end and thus my 4-star rating. Sorry, but the romance between Raoul and Linda was not believable in the least, it was really far-fetched and I would have written the book so that Linda married the Englishman...all in all, it was a fantastic read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a suspenseful mystery."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I first read Mary Stewart's novels when in my early teens. I think my expectations of romance were slightly colored by the men in her books. Now that I go back to read them almost 40 years later, I find they stand the test of time.This time it's not just the romance that engages me, but Mary Stewart's writing that captures the attention. Her way with words makes this gothic tale come to life. You can see what Linda sees and feels what she feels. Your heart goes out to Phillipe.Reading the description of the countryside around here made me go to an atlas to find the towns mentioned. I was surprised to find how involved I got in the story, that hasn't happened for quite some time. (Unless I'm reading a new Harry Potter.)I now realize that I am a total Mary Stewart fan."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I first read this book 40 years ago - required high school summer reading - and am so glad I did, I loved it. It opened up the world of gothic romance/suspense. And Ms. Stewart's technique of using literary quotes at the beginning of each chapter (once I understood what that was all about) was such fun. The characters are all so believeable that I feel as if I know them personally. The food, car & location settings are also wonderful. Even now, whenever I'm in a fabric store & see sparkly fabric, I wonder if that was Linda's dress material. Maybe because this was the first gothic romance/suspense I read or maybe beacuse it's so good, no other - with the possible exception of \\"This Rough Magic\\" - comes close. However, if you don't mind switching authors, I highly recommend Victoria Holt's \\"King of the Castle\\"."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I began reading Mary Stewart's books when I was a teenager over 35 years ago.

It is a well-crafted story of a young Englishwoman, who is hired as a governess to the adolescent Comte de Valmy. ... Mary Stewart's wonderful narrative enables the reader to \\"see\\" the plot as it unfolds. Her descriptions of food make your mouth water... literally. It is a tribute to Ms. Stewart's skill as a writer that her works have held up so well, 40+ years after their initial publication."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This is the first Mary Stewart novel I've read and I will surely be reading more.Stewart is slow and thoughtful in her pacing and by the time she pulls the line taught the reader is hooked like a fish, well this reader was anyway. I couldn't put the book down and had to stay up waaaayyy past my bedtime to finish it.I wasn't sure I was going to like this book at first. The beginning was a little bit on the slow side, I had been busy with other things and not able to devote as much time as I would have liked to reading. So, the first hundred and fifty pages took me longer to read than usual. But I thought the writing was good and the imagery of the landscape lush and vivid, the interactions and dialog believable and the characters were interesting and complex. I really didn't know who or what to believe until the very last page. And even then I wasn't completely sure.This is another one of those books that gave me the feeling that I 'almost' knew what was going to happen. There was something familiar about it that I can't quite articulate. I felt the same way about 'Rebecca' and 'My Cousin Rachel' by Daphne DuMaurier and 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte Bronte, they all have a similar flavor to them and I loved them all. Maybe you would say they are \\"Gothic\\" but I'm not exactly sure what people mean when they say that about a book.Mary Stewart starts each chapter with an absolutely perfect quote from various classic works of literature. Each one gives you insight into what is happening in the story. One of my favorites was;'I am two fools, I know,For loving, and for saying so.'JOHN DONNE: The Triple FoolI loved this, I really couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to sink my teeth into another juicy story by Mary Stewart!"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This book was my introduction to Mary Stewart. I found it in a box of books in the attic when I was about twelve or thirteen. I read it and most if not all of her other novels throughout my teenage and young adult years. I reread this recently (30 years later) and find it is still enjoyable. It seems all the romances on the market these days are nothing but bodice rippers and they get boring real fast. I much prefer books with a plot and character development. I highly recommend Mary Stewart's novels to every one.Has any one else noticed that her characters smoke so many cigarettes in her novels? Maybe I do because I'm an ex smoker."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"If you find the average mystery/thriller novel too grim with grisly murders and lots of gore, and prefer more \\"depth\\"-- you'll most likely enjoy Mary Stewart's style. She adds a romantic twist, and makes the girl Linda Martin very relateable. Most noteworthy is how \\"real\\" the characters seem--I felt as though I had actually met them, and I admit, developed a slight crush on one of the characters...As far as suspense goes, I usually pride myself in being able to guess what happens next, but I was often caught off guard. It really picks up speed in the second half--and is more exhilerating than watching a action movie (at least in my opinion). I finished at 3AM in the morning, feeling that Stewart is very talented and fluid with language; sometimes I stopped just to re-read how beautiful her phrasings were. All in all, you will be guessing until the very last paragraph!"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This was my first introduction to Mary Stewart (loaned to me by a friend) and I couldn't put it down. The novel is extremely intelligent, literate and very suspenseful, with a tremendously likeable and self-deprecating heroine. Highy recommended, especially for lovers of British mysteries."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"On the back cover of the book, the publisher categorizes it as \\"Romance/Suspense/Literature\\"; after reading it I have to agree it is indeed all three, and that Mary Stewart has melded all of these together in a way that few writers can.This is romance in the \\"old style\\", which is the way I like best; no graphic sex scenes, in fact no graphic details at all. And yet Stewart manages to conjure all the emotions that come with falling in love. Every time Raoul appeared my heart started racing! No modern writer can top that, no matter how titillating they try to be.And thanks to Mary Stewart's remarkable use of language, this book is \\"literature\\" as well. Her style of writing is so evocative and lyrical that it is almost poetic. Her characters' manner of speaking is slightly dated, but is still remarkably readable, especially considering that this book was written over 50 years ago.The \\"suspense\\" is the weakest element of this book, which is why I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5. The identity and motive of the culprits are obvious right from the start, the plot is unoriginal, and there are no surprises along the way. Stewart includes many small elements and issues that could have been developed further to make the plot more intriguing and engrossing, and indeed, in every case I was led to believe they were going to become significant parts of the story. But Stewart just leaves them and moves on without ever mentioning them again, which made me wonder why she even included these little tidbits at all? Although Stewart does try to throw out a red herring about 3/4 of the way through and get the reader off on a different track, it is weak and not very convincing. The plot and outcome are just as the reader predicted by the end of chapter 2 or 3.Nevertheless, Stewart does create some gripping passages that will keep you turning the pages and unable to put the book down. Linda's flight with Philippe was one of the best parts of the book, and Stewart managed to sustain the suspense and tension not just for a paragraph or a page, but for several chapters.All in all this is a very enjoyable read. A sympathetic heroine in an exotic and romantic locale, with a handsome heartthrob and a smidgeon of suspense thrown in -- what's not to like?! I look forward to reading more of Mary Stewart's work. Probably not her Merlin books, since I'm not into Arthurian stuff, but I will definitely give more of her romantic suspense works a try."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Mary Stewart is a genius; every time I read her books, I am filled with pleasure mixed with acute jealousy. Her descriptive and suspense-stringing talents have yet to be topped. This book is one of the best. If not as magical as This Rough Magic, it is much stronger on the romance and keeps suspense longer than any of her other books. I never knew, by the way, how many different settings there were in France until Mary Stewart came along--this one is quite Gothic in a 1960s-glamour way."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This is the first Mary Stewart novel I've read and while I enjoyed the book's atmosphere and lead characters, I was a bit let down by the plot on the whole.From reviews I had read, I was hoping for a dark and intricately plotted mystery. While there were several very suspenseful passages, the story was a bit too predictable and the ending seemed to drag on a little too long.I did enjoy the fact that 'Nine Coaches Waiting' is mainly a mystery with just a sprinkling of romance. However, I felt that even with the main focus not on the romance, that part of the story could have been handled a lot better. The romantic entanglements between the two main protagonists seem much too rushed and unrealistic.All that being said, I still enjoyed reading 'Nine Coaches Waiting' (even though it did not live up to expectations)and will give the author's other books a try."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This would be a wonderful three part-er for Masterpiece Theater, eh? The reason i think so is because the descriptions are so delightful. The reader does not skip ahead to \\"get on with the story\\". How lucky you are if you have not yet read this book."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I am an English teacher and avid reader. I love Mary Stewart's romantic novels and this is the best one. Moody French setting, charm of a big country house and money, the rakish dark handsome man that the heroine falls helplessly in love with and then he has to convince her that yes, it is her that he loves. The love story is paramount over the mystery, which is what I prefer. When I embark on a re-read of this book, I cannot. put. it. down. I love 'Nine Coaches Waiting.'"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"There's a reason why Stewart wears the unofficial crown of \\"Queen of Suspense\\", and that reason could very well be her novel, \\"Nine Coaches Waiting\\".I've been reading (or re-reading) Stewart's books throughout 2009. NCW has escaped my reading list all these years, so it was a delight to dive into Stewart's descriptive and nail-biting world with no pre-conceptions of how this one would play out.Certainly, NCW is typical Stewart: lovely young Englishwoman travels to [insert country here] and finds herself caught in a web of intrigue, danger and romance with a handsome, mysterious stranger. One knows exactly what to expect from reading Stewart. However, the journey from Chapter 1 to \\"The End\\" is always lyrical, dreamy, suspenseful, and downright entertaining.If I could praise one attribute of Stewart's writing, I would have to say I enjoy her sense of narrative \\"place\\". She can transport the reader to whatever destination she writes of, so that you feel you know the landscape--it's sights, it's smells--as well as the heroine does.NCW transports the reader to late '50s France, where orphan Linda Martin travels to care for a young boy soon to inherit a chateaux. After a series of \\"accidents\\", Linda realizes that there's more at stake then taking care of the boy -- she's actually needed to take care of his life, and she can't trust the one man she's fallen in love with to help her do it. To say more would be to spoil the surprise, so I'll leave it at that. Suffice it to say, you won't be disappointed in NCW if you're a fan of Stewart. If you're new to Stewart, this is certainly one of her better romantic suspense novels, and a good intro. to her world~"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Mary Stewart's most famous novel, Nine Coaches Waiting is sure to please lovers of classic romance and suspenseful adventure. It is classy in that it employs neither racy or super-scary elements. It's a great read to keep you up all night wanting more."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"What's not to love? Linda Martin arrives at the Chateaux Valmy high in the French Alps to care for young Comte Philippe, recently orphaned and in the care of his uncle Leon and step-aunt Heloise de Valmy. When Leon's son Raoul arrives, Linda finds herself falling in love, although things are not as they appear and Philippe begins to have several life threatening accidents. Or are they accidents? Is there something more sinister involved? Could the person behind these attempts want to set Linda up as the scapegoat? What about her beloved Raoul? Could he have a part in this deadly scheme?That's about all I'm going to tell, you know I'm not into book reports or spoilers. Linda was a charming Jane Eyre-ish type of heroine, and I loved the dark mysterious Raoul (ooh, that midnight \\"buffet\\"). Stewart has a lovely, subtle style of story telling and keeps the plot moving without too much in-your-face telling instead of showing and very reminiscent of Du Maurier. I also loved how she worked the mists and clouds of the high mountains (as well as that hair raising zig-zag drive to the Chateaux) to set a properly spooky atmosphere,\\"Out into a patch of clear darkness, and then another cloud was on us, but this time thin, so that our yellow-dimmed lights made rainbows in it that wisped away along our wings, and we were through.\\"All in all a perfect book to cuddle up with for a rainy day, my only complaint is she took a tad bit too long to wrap all the lose ends up, so I'm knocking off one star. 4/5."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I am not one to read \\"girly\\" books so was surprised when I really enjoyed reading this at my step mom's suggestion. It reminded me a little of Heidie and Rebecca rolled together - calling up fond memories of youthful reading. It is predictable yet suspenseful; corny yet engaging; implausible yet believeable. I loved Mary Stewart's Merlin books so gave it a shot and am glad I did. This is not a deep thinking book, but if you want to get away for a while into a pleasant place, this book will take you there."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This is the first book of Mary Stewart that I read and it was Chinese version. It's amazing in storyboard, characters and the illustration of France."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"The first romance I ever read and STILL my favorite! No one can match Mary Stewart's talent for mystery, intrigue and seduction or her naturally sophisticated yet genuine, earthy style... I have loved all of her books."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's the story of a young girl 23 who becomes a governess in a French mansion with a dark side to a little boy and she falls in love with a handsome but dark and mysterious man named Raoul. It was a good gothic mystery when strange things start happening to her."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I should begin by saying that this is my first Mary Stewart book. I picked it up after seeing repeated references to it on Lauren Willig's blog. Originally published in 1958, I would call this a \\"romantic suspense\\" novel.Linda Martin was born and raised in France, but has lived the past ten years in a London orphanage after a plane accident that resulted in the death of both her parents. At the beginning of the story, she has been offered the position of governess at the Chateau Valmy, caring for a little boy named Philippe. Philippe's parents were killed in a car accident, and he now lives with his aunt and uncle, who are acting as trustees for the Chateau until Philippe comes of age. Oh, how I love a good governess book. This is one is no exception.Although the Chateau Valmy is beautiful and she is pleased to be back in her native France, Linda is not totally at ease. Philippe's uncle Leon is wheelchair-bound after a car accident. His devastating good looks and terrifying temper cause Linda to think of him as Lucifer, and he has a habit of appearing suddenly and soundlessly in rooms at inopportune moments. Philippe's aunt Heloise does her best Ice Queen imitation for most of the book, playing cool and emotionally unattached with her nephew. Several of the house servants seem jealous or suspicious of Linda. The silver lining is Leon's son Raoul, who visits occasionally and takes an immediate interest in Linda. While Linda sees in Raoul a handsome, romantic \\"Prince Charming,\\" she senses something dark in his nature as well. Stewart deepens the suspense as Philippe has two near-fatal \\"accidents\\" and begins to have nightmares of people coming into his bedroom.Even though the end of this book was fairly easy to predict, I enjoyed reading it so much that I didn't mind. The last third of the book tears toward the conclusion, as Linda and Philippe are hunted through the French countryside with no idea who they can trust or where they should go. I enjoyed the relationship between Philippe and Linda - Philippe is a boy who has been forced to mature too quickly, and it frequently makes Linda unhappy to see how serious and hesitant he is in comparison to other boys his age. The romance is absorbing but not overplayed, and all loose ends are tied up nicely."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Mary Stewart's romantic mysteries. I'm so glad that they are being reissued as Rediscovered Classics."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I had never read any books by this author before and only ordered it because the author of Edenbrooke (julianne donaldson) listed it as one of her favorites. I was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. It is clean, it is suspenseful, the characters are amazing. It was perfect; I'm recommending this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Nine Coaches is by far my favorite books. With intrigue, romance, suspicion, mystery...this book has everything that is required in a gothic romance and one of Stewart's best. The sections are named \\"first coach\\" or \\"second coach\\" and so on and in each one it is literal reference to \\"coaches\\" or cars, as it is in modern times (payphones, airplanes, etc). The first coach is the one that brings Linda to the French mansion as a governess for the young Comte de Valmy, Phillipe. The last coach (or last chapter) is when the love of her life takes off in a car to go find Linda.I really enjoyed that the book was divided into headings of \\"coaches\\" and after the first two I came to realize that it means literal vehicles arriving or departing. From then on when a new section came up with the next coach in numerical line, I knew that something exciting was going to happen.Nine Coaches is definitely a page-turning and knuckle-whitening novel with twists and bends that have nothing to do with the zig-zag road leading up to the mansion. Linda falls for one of the relatives of the Valmy family and then is led to believe he is in on the plot to kill the young heir, Phillipe. Linda and Phillipe escape the Valmy mansion and spend two nights on the run until the entire story comes to a head and it isn't until the very end where we find out if Raoul, the love interest, is guilty or not. And until readers find out, they will be in a quandary such as the heroine Linda is--wanting to believe in Raoul's innocence but forced to look at all the evidence to support his guilt.This book is a keeper and one I will read again, in fact, I am already looking forward to re-reading it so compelling and gripping it was."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"The book was great. Typical Mary Stewart, with a clever, beautiful but slightly damaged heroine, mystery and adventure and a child character. Witty writing, increasingly scary atmosphere and well-written characters, both charming and creepy. She is the absolute mistress of the romantic suspense genre, and one of the best first person writers out there."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"After ten long years of living as an orphan and expatriate in England, Linda Martin has finally returned to Paris. There is something right about the cool spring night, and how the language has come back like it never fell into disuse. Although she enters the country as a governess and technically hired help, Linda is relieved to come home, even if it is to the great estate Chateau Valmy outside of Paris. Her charge, nine-year-old Phillipe, is an orphan himself, living with his uncle Leon and aunt Heloise, and is due to inherit Valmy when he comes of age. As comforting as it is for Linda to be in France there is an underlying feeling of wrongness to the estate, managed by charming, imposing Leon and cold, remote Heloise de Valmy. Beneath his own charm and attention to Linda, Leon's son Raoul even bears a resemblance to his father that is both uncanny and a little frightening. As mysterious accidents begin to happen without a logical explanation Linda realizes her fears are founded, but who can she trust, and how can she keep herself and Phillipe safe?I'm just going to come out and say it: Nine Coaches Waiting was an absolutely lovely read from which my senses haven't fully disengaged. The lush, evocative writing describing a dreamy, heady Paris drew me in from the first pages. Then it was the characterization. Linda, and her own unknown past - fond and painful memories both wrapped up in this iconic place - and I was intrigued. What was this loneliness that she carried with her? I immediately connected and sympathized with the conflicting nostalgia and disquiet she felt so acutely from the time she stepped off the plane onto the wet tarmac. Amongst such an atmosphere, little by little the sense of foreboding builds and builds until the feared danger is confirmed. Then the suspense! It does not let up even when you think it should be clear who is guilty and who is not. And then if your heart hasn't already broken from the pounding it is threatened by heartbreak of another kind. Of course I would also be remiss to leave out the hints of Jane Eyre and Rebecca - a great, haunting estate, a governess, a mysterious master, a Gothic air, and a bit of romance (complete with sigh-inducing declarations) which made this all the more enjoyable. Add to it fully-fleshed characters and thoughtful dialogue and I'm hard pressed to find any fault with this atmospheric, cozy mystery. Nine Coaches Waiting was a fine introduction to Mary Stewart and the perfect comfort, rainy day read. I suspect this will grow even fonder in a reread and I can't wait to read more by this author. She is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"If you like this author's other books you will love this. Even if you haven't read her stuff but like gothic/mystery/light romance books you will enjoy this. I don't read romance books and was a little leery that this was going to be too much on that end of things, but I was surprised. The \\"love\\" story is secondary and not in your face romance. The mystery part of it was the driving force."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I read this book when Iwas a young teen and have reread it so many times I needed a new copy.It is a great book."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Linda Martin has no idea what she's gotten herself into when she arrives in France to work as governess to a nine-year-old child at the Valmy estate. There she meets young Philippe's guardians, his aunt and uncle Heloise and Leon de Valmy. Heloise is a somewhat dim character, but Leon is charismatic one moment and sinister the next. He reminds Linda of the devil, seems as cunning as the devil himself too. He and his wife are under the impression that Linda is an ignorant Englishwoman. After all, she had been picked up from an orphanage. But Linda is actually half-French and fluent in the aforementioned language. As Linda looks after young Philippe, who is to inherit the Valmy estate in six years' time, she notices some strange activities. Someone is trying to kill Philippe, but who and why? What's worse is that the attempts coincide with the arrival of Leon's son, the attractive and darkly mysterious Raoul de Valmy.Nine Coaches Waiting is so well written and well crafted that it kept me turning the pages. Mary Stewart does a wonderful job with the ebb and flow of the story. The heroine discovers things just as the reader does. Stewart also lets the reader jump to the right conclusions and interpretations without hitting the reader over the head with the details. I hate when authors tell us what is happening as if they think the reader is too stupid to figure it out on his/her own. Stewart doesn't do that, thank goodness. Actually, she does tell the reader that Linda falls for Raoul instead of showing it, and that is why I take away a star. In any event, most old romantic books had a tendency of telling instead of showing when feelings emerge between two main characters. Perhaps it's due to the fact that in those days things like sexual and romantic tension were more reserved and left to the reader's imagination. Anyway, as I read the book, it became obvious that Jane Eyre was a major inspiration for this novel. Gothic language and suspense aside, the heroine is an orphan turned governess, and Leon jokingly refers to her as \\"Miss Eyre\\" in more than one occasion. The characters are very well developed. Linda is sharp and caring, Raoul is dark and mysterious, Leon is also very enigmatic, and Heloise comes across as weak-minded. They are three-dimensional and fascinating. This is my first Mary Stewart novel and it won't be the last. She, like Daphne du Maurier, who happened to be her contemporary (both were writers during the fifties and sixties), does a wonderful mixture of suspense, plot twists, literary language and romantic intrigue. Stewart has sold me. I've already ordered The Ivy Tree and Madam, Will You Talk? and I look forward to reading them."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"A Cinderella story. I loved it when I read it years ago. I have continued to re-read it. And I love it now.My public library had to dig it up from the hidden stacks, but a few years back I checked out and read The Revenger's Tragedy, which Stewart quotes as epigrams before chapters. I fell in love with Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" after reading \\"This Rough Magic,\\" and other novels assume a knowledge of Greek drama. It's great to see this new edition, but I wonder if a Gothic romance of this erudition could be published today."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This is an absolutely fantastic mystery/romance. I own it and have read it multiple times, along with most of the rest of Mary Stewarts books. It's one of the books I never get tired of. No matter how many times I read it, I still can't put it down when I'm in the middle of it. I highly, highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Like most of Mary Stewart's novels, this one also centers around a beautiful and brave heroine. However, each and every one of these novels are different in content as well as in plot, so that even though you think you know what the outcome is going to be, in reality you don't! I read most of Mary Stewart's novels when I was a teenager (when I used to borrow them), but 15 years down the road, I find myself rummaging through bookstores for them - to be able to reread them, but more because I want to own my own copies (so that I can reread them yet again in a few year's time)! (Hint: London bookstores carry many of them, esp. Dillon's and Books Etc..) 'Nine Coaches Waiting' is great in the sense that it transports the reader into the rustic countryside of France, which Mary Stewart describes, as always, with so much pleasurable detail. The sense of mystery is heightened as the heroine searches for the truth behind the troubled family for whom she works; and the romance is made more even more romantic with the notions of 'unrequited love' and 'forbidden love'. I think that with most Mary Stewart's novels, there is never a huge emphasis on romantic love in terms of action or words, but better still, she concentrates on the inner feelings of longing and sacrifice (esp. before the official 'start' of a relationship) which serve to enhance the romantic atmosphere of her books."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I have read quite a few of Mary Stewart's books and for anyone who is interested &quot;This Rough Magic&quot; ties with &quot;Nine Coaches&quot;. &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; is very good, so is &quot;My Brother Michael&quot; and &quot;Airs Above the Ground&quot;. These are more along the romance line as opposed to fantasy as in &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; which was very good but a different style of story.I first found Mary Stewart when I was rather young The Wonderful World of Disney did &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; with Haley Mills. I was hooked and I still enjoy her books as true mystery romances with the covers falling off and all."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"The language is lovely, the setting as much a character as the protagonists themselves. The mystery is wonderfully crafted with just the right element of whimsy, allusion, magic and sophisticated romance. Ms. Stewart has the formula down to an almost perfect science; she is the wordsmith of description. As all her novels have been virtually overlooked by today's readers, I recommend that all her earlier books be re-issued in trade paperback format, so that another generation may enjoy the almost perfect structural honing of her craft. While categorized as 'romantic suspence', I don't believe these stories were ever given the literary praise they deserve."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"They don't write books like this anymore. Sadly, even the author didn't write books like this for long. Her writing has deteriorated since the Merlin books (which I also disliked), but her 1950s and 1960s romantic suspense were superb. What do we need to do to get more of Stewart's works reissued in paperback? If there's a petition, I want to sign it."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Linda Martin, an English governess, accepts what she considers the perfect position. She is put in charge of young Philippe de Valmy, nine years old and heir to the Chateau Valmy in France. The unusual requirement for this position was the governess was to know no French. Reason given for this strange requirement was that young Philippe was learn English perfectly with no help in his native tongue. Linda wanting the job desperately, lies and thinks no more of it...That is until some strange and dangerous incidents occur; and she realizes that someone is out to harm young Philippe. The likely suspects are his uncles, who would stand to inherit the Chateau if the young boy died.Not a mystery alone, this novel also a wonderful love story as Linda falls in love with Raul Valmy. Raul also stands to inherit the Chateau and Linda is torn between her love him and her love and the need to protect young Philippe. &quot;Nine Coaches Waiting&quot; was a beautifully written book that held my attention. I've read it many, many times, enjoyed it and consider it a &quot;Classic.&quot;"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Next to Jane Eyre, the best &quot;governess goes to the big spooky mansion&quot; type of romantic novel. Has all the elements: a Cinderalla type love story, suspense, danger, and heroism. Excellently written and very superior to anything done in the past twenty or even thirty years. I first read this in high school, borrowed from the local library, and always wanted a copy, but was not able to find a copy of it until I started using Amazon. Reading it, I really became aware of how much romantic fiction has declined since then. The sheer quality of the writing is so good. Mary Stewart's best contemporary romance. I wish she had written more."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"Like several of the reviewers below, I read Nine Coaches Waiting when I was very young - in fact, all of 14 years old. It was the epitome of romance for me then, and in the years since I feel the same. I hope my teenaged nieces read this novel, and any young girl who loves a truly quality romantic suspense story. Today we have pornography instead of love, explicit violence takes the place of the aura of danger, heightened by imagination. This book is for the sensitive, those who are yet unjaded by the surfeit of sensation purveyed today in films and trashy novels. This is a beautiful story, full of fascination. It does start slowly, but so does Jane Eyre. The heroine in both must reach a mysterious and dark stranger, and win his love. What a spark for a young girl's imagination!"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I first read this book when I was in High School--I think it was the first modern romantic fiction I ever encountered. Now that I'm nearly 40 years older than I was then, there are little quirks of writing that are more noticeable (the heroine seems to bite her lip rather frequently, for instance), but all in all, the tale has held up well.The story concerns the trials and tribulations of 23-year-old Linda Martin, born and raised in France but more recently schooled in an orphanage in England, who returns to France as the governess of the young Comte Phillipe de Valmy. Phillipe, unfortunately, is all that stands between his uncle Leon, who is his guardian, and the Valmy estate, which Leon loves with an obsessive love made stronger by the fact that he is a paraplegic (I did mention melodrama, didn't I?). Circumstance piles on circumstance until Linda realizes that she must save Phillipe, even if this dooms her own budding romance with Leon's son, Raoul.Part of what makes Linda a real person to me is that she's very well-educated--not so much by her orphanage, but by her very literary papa. Because Linda's thoughts are full of literary allusions, Mary Stewart can play with all the stories of misunderstood maidens, poor governesses, and handsome wrecks of men. Cinderella walks hand in hand with Jane Eyre, and Lady Macbeth is also in evidence. By bringing these allusions to the fore, Sewart cleverly escapes the charge of repetition and makes what one might call the history of melodrama part of the plot.Mary Stewart is also a genuinely good writer. Thus, tense scenes have real tension, and romantic scenes have real romance. While she always stays within the conventions of the Gothic novel form, she does it with grace, elegance, and even, at times, beauty."},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"This was a wonderful book. One of my favorites by Mary Stewart. Ms. Stewart is a master of description......she had my mouth watering as she described the meal of asperagas soup and steak Linda and Philipe ate as they were running away from the villian. Also, my heart was pounding as they hid in the mountain cabin while the henchman searched for them just steps away.I agree with the other reviewer who asked why more of Ms. Stewart's book cannot be found in new print. My books are in tatters! Please reprint more of her books!!"},{"Title":"Nine Coaches Waiting","review":"I first read this book years ago as a young girl. When I reread it, I was delightfully surprised and just as absorded as the first time that I traveled through the pages of the mind of this truly amazing writer!

A brief history of how a person (me) from Newark, Ohio (where the author of the 76th Company was from) became transplanted to Hattiesburg and became friends with the great-granddaughter of Charles Miller makes this all the more a great read.But the fact remains that it is his personal narrative of history, not another person's understanding,that makes this book a great read!Chapter 12 talks about the battle at Vicksburg. Living within 2 hours of Vicksburg in 2004 when the battle seiged in the year 1863, makes you understand the fate of your family blood line. Brevet Major Miller was just 10-15 seconds early of being the only man killed (see pictue on page 98) by a cannonball coming across the mighty Mississippi in this battle.Chapter 15 talks about the politics of the day, when in Newark, Major Miller was exposed to the political view of those who opposed the war. He wondered how these people could be so violently against the very men who were keeping the war from their doors! When Blue coats came close to the people at the Valllandigham/Davis campaigne he would hear &quot;hurrah for Vallandigham and Jeff Davis.&quot;I hope you enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Struggle for the Life of the Republic: A Civil War Narrative","review":"Brevet Major Miller is an excellent writer who makes one feel that they were part of the 76th Ohio Volunteer Infrantry Regiment.

The big hitter in this category is Glen Cook with his Garrett series, but there have been other single entries where characters have had to play the role of detective (Sir Kay, for instance, in Phyllis Ann Carr's underrated \\"Idylls of the Queen\\", or the P.I. in the quirky Fred Ward movie \\"Cast A Deadly Spell\\").\\"Thraxas\\" is the first novel in a British series that so far comprises three volumes. (This edition was originally published overseas as two separate books.) It relates the adventures of the titular hero, a disgraced and fallen former Senior Palace Investigator whose affinity for the bottle has seen him reduced to straitened circumstances. Now an overweight and middle-aged drunkard and glutton, he takes on cases from low-lifes and those who are really desperate.The adventures take place in a small Roman-flavored corrupt city-state with a minor degree of magic. Dragons, elves, and fairies are about, and sorcerers abound, but only the most magically adept can carry around more than a couple of spells at a time, so matters are just as often settled by wit or steel as by enchantment.The mystery in the first half of the book isn't altogether that great, but the one explored in the second half is rather more compelling. More interesting is Thraxas' sidekick, Makri, a young former gladiator who escaped from years of combat in the orcish slave pits and who now is diligently studying rhetoric and philosophy at the local equivalent of a community college. And who also likes to unleash massive havoc when helping out her friend in his investigations.Because the two parts were originally published separately, there's a degree of repetition in the latter portion of the book, where the author has to remind us of things that took place in another book in the U.K. but that in the American edition occurred just a few pages ago. Also, he has an annoying habit of Capitalizing things that Don't need to Be capitalized. But aside from those quibbles, this is a solid work with a nice cast of characters and a light and droll tone. For fans of fantasy private eyes, this is well worth the price."},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":"The real name of the author of this series isMartin Millar. You can go to http://www.thraxas.com/to see what sort of fellow Thraxas is.There are seven books in the seriesso far, and the eighth is to be published in Spring 2005.Each one seems better than the preceding to me.This edition contains the first two.The Thraxas stories have been translated into severallanguages and have a worldwide following.Unlike many science fiction and fantasy works, in thesestories you get to know the characters through their owndialog and actions rather than second-hand throughdescriptions. Anyway, Martin Millar is amazingly creativeand I eagerly await the next installment!"},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":". This is the first book in a popular British series that seems to have reached ten books so far, starting in 1999, although the first US printing was in 2003. I wouldn't agree with the Guardian's \\"Blindingly funny!\\" quoted on the cover, but it's amusing enough and a rather different take on a fantasy-mystery in a Classical-like setting. Thraxas was an investigator for the king of Turai until his fondness for strong drink and low company got him fired; now he scrapes out an existence as a private investigator who's very good at what he does, at least as long as he can stay sober enough to function. Turai is an extremely corrupt city, so it isn't surprising that the royal princess wants to hire him to recover some \\"letters\\", or that her brother the crown prince is involved in drug smuggling, or that the traditionally incorruptible elves are acting in a very peculiar manner. With the help of his half-human, quarter-elf, quarter-orc sidekick, the beautiful female warrior Makri, and the sometimes help, sometimes hindrance, of Hanama, the head of the Assassins' Guild, Thraxas manages to bring things to a satisfactory resolution (well, fairly satisfactory), including a last-minute payoff of a gambling debt that was otherwise going to get him offed. There's a good deal of humor, though it's more in the Tom Holt or Glen Cook line than Terry Pratchett or Robert Asprin, if you've read those authors."},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":"This was not the worst fantasy novel I've read, but it wasn't the best either. The cover marketed the book as being funny, but I didn't find anything laughable in it. If you are looking for a laugh, don't buy this book. If you are looking to be mildly entertained, check it out from a library. I can't honestly recommend anyone who loves fantasy to buy this book. There are a great number of better authors out there.One of the most annoying things about the series is that the author has about 3 or 4 \\"catch phrases\\" that get over used by every character in the story. It get's really tiring to read \\"I'll come down on you like a bad spell.\\" for the 30th time.The plot is not original and the story wonders all over the place . The main character is clever enough to figure every thing out in the last couple of pages, even though he acts like a complete idiot through the entire book and can't put 2 and 2 together when the answer is staring him in the face.You might love the book or you might hate it. Me? I think it's \\"so so\\" with nothing outstanding to recommend it."},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":"I read it in one rush - something I do not with many books.As mostly the blurb blurts blurring words. Its not comedy but humorous and self-ironical sword &amp; sorcery.So if you look for a Terry Pratchett, Robert Rankin, Ester Friesner, Robert Asprin, Tom Holt or something like that - this book is none of that. But it's a little bit like Simon Green."},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":"The plots are OK, but it is not the laugh-romp promised by the cover blurbs.

Thraxas is a man you want at your side. Although maybe not when you are having pizza, or it is your shout and you are trying to keep up. :) Despite a lot of fondness for various narcotics, intoxicants and baked goods, Thraxas knows where his towel is. The half-orc with the pointy ears does cause him many problems, but is incredibly good at the slayage when he needs a hand."},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":"I like this book and was sufficiently entertained to actually finish it. (If you knew me personally, you'd know that was high praise.) If you're looking for a rich fantasy world, noble deeds and thought provoking themes--forget it! This is just fun. Not &quot;hilarious&quot; like the cover says, but definitely amusing throughout. I liked the main character, Thraxas, and his own honest assessment of his character and physical state. (Who could completely hate a guy who insists that no one sleep on his couch because he may need it himself if he can't make it all the way to his bed?)Generally, I despise anachronisms, but Martin Scott makes &quot;modern&quot; dective story superimposed on a fantasy background work for me.You can usually sucker me into a novel if the characters are good. That is, the characters must HAVE character. I much prefer characters that tend toward the more sterotypical comic book types than those that are so &quot;deep&quot; they bore me to sleep.This book doesn't take itself too seriously and is even handed.

I was mildly entertained when I read it and I would never buy this book. Good thing I went to my local library. I found this book a bit odd, quorky, far-fetched &amp; cartoonish at times. I found it strange that a fantasy book had alot of modern influences I thought was interesting and passed as believeable. For example, drug dealers that sold a drug called Dwa and Diplomatic Immunity for an Orc. The main character made it well known that he has a low self-image of himself. To top it off, he's over weight and in his late forties. Through out the book he was always hot and wanted a beer. It was hard to image Thraxas skillful using a sword against certain opponents that were faster that him. There were times I caught myself chuckle at certain parts. A good asset to the book was Thraxas's friend Makri. She was a young hot ex-gladiator wearing a bikini serving ale at the Avenging Axe most of the time. She wasn't a no brains all braun type of girl, basically she was both brains and braun. The 2nd part of the book Thraxas and the Warrior Monks was a bit more to my liking. I found it redundant that it recalled events from the first part of the book. Originally, there were sold as two seperates books. Honestly, I would never read this book again, but hey, I was entertained!!"},{"Title":"Thraxas","review":"Thraxas (1999) is the first fantasy novel in the Thraxas series. It is set in Turai, a small citystate ruled by a king and senate. Turai belongs to the League of City States with Mattesh and others. It is a port city and heavily dependent upon its trade throughout the world.Turai is administered by a Consul and a Prefect oversees each of the ten districts. The Civil Guards have a central station managed by the Consul and stations within each district commanded by the Prefect. The city has an official state religion -- the True Church -- governed by an archbishop and a council of bishops.Thraxas is a commoner who had been expelled from the college for young sorcerers while little more than an apprentice. He then joined a mercenary band and became a skilled warrior. After the war with the Orcs, Thraxas became a senior Investigator with Palace Security. But he made a pass at the bride of his boss during their wedding reception and was fired.In this novel, Thraxas is \\"forty-three, overweight, without ambition, and prone to prolonged bouts of drinking\\". He is a very competent fighter and tends to gamble at the chariot races. He also has a very high opinion of his various skills -- except sorcery -- which sometimes does not prove to accurate, particularly in his gambling.Now Thraxas is a Private Investigator living and working at the Avenging Axe within the Twelve Seas district where the port is located. Although he is licensed as a Sorcerous Investigator, his magical skills are minimal. He works cheap, but does honest work for his clients.Gurd is the owner of the Avenging Axe. He has fought alongside Thraxas around the world. Gurd is a friend of Thraxas as well as his landlord.Makri has mixed ancestry, including human, elf and Orc. She is a former gladiator in the Orcish slave pits and is highly skilled with her weapons. She often helps Thraxas, especially when she gets to fight with blades or axe.Makri is ostracized by most inhabitants of Turai because of her Orc blood. She is a barmaid at the Avenging Axe and wears a chainmail bikini to increase the tips. Despite her gender and ancestry, Makri is attending the Guild School and then wants to attend the Imperial University.Tanrose is the cook at the Avenging Axe. Although limited to common fare, she produces some of the best food that Thraxas has ever eaten. Tanrose is also Gurd's sweetheart and maybe his wife if he ever works up the nerve to ask her.Hanama is an assassin. She is ranked third highest within her Guild. Of course, the organization is not officially a guild, but nobody seems to care.Praetor Cicerius is running for Deputy Consul in the coming elections. Rittius -- the incumbent -- is associated with Senator Lodius, who is leader of the opposition party. He is also the man who fired Thraxas from Palace Security.In this story, Thraxas is hired by Princess Du-Akai to recover some letters that she has written to a Niojan diplomat named Attilan. Nioj is the large kingdom to the north. The League of City States exists primarily to prevent Nioj from conquering them piecemeal.Since the princess is the third heir to the throne, the letters would be powerful tools for blackmail. Any hint of their existence to the senate or the newspapers would immediately bring scandal upon the Royal family. The Populares party would sweep the elections. The letters must be recovered quietly and quickly.Thraxas sneaks into the house of the diplomat and finds the box that supposedly contains the letters. Despite his client's orders, Thraxas takes a peek in the box. It doesn't hold letters, but rather a magic formula.On the way out through the garden, Thraxas stumbles over a body. Then a servant appears and finds him standing over the remains of Attilan. Thraxas quickly discards the box. Then the Civil Guard carries him off to jail for murdering the diplomat.After the Guard releases him, Thraxas has a confrontation with Princess Du-Akai. She claims to know nothing about a magic formula. Then the King's new dragon is slain and the Princess is arrested. Thraxas gets drunk.Praetor Cicerius comes to take Thraxas to the palace to talk to Princess Du-Akai. Thraxas tells the lawyer a few truths, is carried off to the palace and given deat to make him sober. The princess gives him much more gold and insists that he try to set things straight.This tale presents Thraxas with several seemingly irrelevant problems. Among them is the disappearance of a bolt of red Elvish cloth that blocks magic probes. It cannot be found by magic in spite of a magical mark temporarily placed on it to allow tracing the material.Thraxas knew nothing about the cloth, but people seemed to think that he has some information about it. But now he knows where the cloth was hidden and something about the suspects. Then he is hired by two Elves to find the cloth.Turai seems to be the remains of a larger empire. The term Imperial is used for both the university and the palace. The names seem to be Romanized, so maybe the author was thinking of Rome. The population appears to be degenerate enough to be Roman. However, the author is a resident of Great Britain, so maybe the association is closer to home.Thraxas is a private investigator much in the style of Mike Hammer. Although having the weight of Nero Wolfe, he is willing to fight -- or kill -- those who oppose him with fists or swords. But Mike Hammer never had to battle against sorcerers.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the format. Sometimes a &quot;hint&quot; or description of a place would start in the middle of a page that was describing something else.

It also doesn't distinguish between places for small toddlers (the Portland, ME children's museum which my 4 year old loved) versus older kids (like my 10 year old who was board at the Portland musuem). Places are identified by address and phone only (no directions), the maps are difficult to use as they only show parts of each state (be sure to get a New England road map from AAA). Also, the restaurant recommendations are good for the most part only if you are looking for standard kids menu fare, i.e., chicken nuggets, etc. Our kids want better food, e.g., lobster while in Maine, and so we had better luck on our own (or from recommendations from the \\"locals\\", like ordering take out lobster cooked at Bayleys in Old Orchard Beach and eating it back at our condo (with our own side dishes) and in a more relaxed state than we could ever have at a restaurant with 3 kids.While I wouldn't discourage you from getting it since there are some helpful ideas, don't expect to rely on it as your primary tour book."},{"Title":"FamilyFun Vacation Guide: New England","review":"I have read this book cover to cover and absolutely love it!

Gimbutas was one of the worlds leading archaeologists and even her opponents had to admit that virtually no one could match her encyclopaedic archaeological knowledge. Then she started to argue that there has been a prehistoric matrifocal culture in Europe where the Goddess were worshipped and suddenly she was quite mariginalized in the academic community. Of cource no on denied her outstanding archaelogical knowledge but she was suddenly not politically correct in this male dominated community. If you read this powerful book you realize why. This book presents the essence of Gimbutas life long research and her final conclusions."},{"Title":"The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe","review":"Gimbutas's lifetime of archaeological research comes together in this panoramic view of Old European civilization. And her work helps blow the frontiers of known history back by about 3,000 years, exposing cultures far older than Sumer or ancient Egypt. Her patient calibrations of dentochronology with radio-carbon dating of artifacts shows large villages and towns from the 6,000s BCE forward, dotted across Eastern Europe. And her compilation of cultural clues shows cultures which challenge all previous notions of how civilizations evolved. The basic equality in size of houses and graves, the emphasis on feminine images in art, the lack of defensive walls or caches of weapons, suggest civilizations focused on the arts of nurturing families, plants and animals. Perhaps the survival of the fittest here meant the flourishing of those best able to care for each other.

The story that these images claim to narrate, that of a peaceful, matriarchal utopia, sensual and celebratory, made my heart sing and gave me hope that we might someday return to the \\"old ways.\\" Gimbutas reads the sherds and statues and decorated pots as symbols of the goddess. Thus, slashes = rain = water = primordial symbol of the goddess. Triangles = vulvas = primordial symbol of the goddess. And so on.Unfortunately, Gimbutas is guessing, or, more charitably, seeing meanings she wants badly to believe. She presents no evidence for her interpretations; she simply shows us a picture of a pot and tells us what she has decided it means. If you think the evidence must be SOMEWHERE (that's what I thought), even if in another book, or a series of articles, guess again. Most archaeologists and anthropologists who are familiar with her (including many female scholars) reject her theory. They point to evidence that directly contradicts Gimbutas' vision of a pacific agrarian utopia: These people had weapons, they had armies, they had male gods who were aggressively sexual. Gimbutas simply selectively ignored evidence that didn't fit her thesis. She committed other violations of scholarly integrity too numerous to list here. Type \\"Gimbutas\\" into Google and you'll find several web sites belonging to archaeologists and anthropologists who are saddened by the public's rush to embrace her blatantly revisionist view of the neolithic.Despite this book's scholarly bankruptcy, I have to rate it three stars.

This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot.

Having a copy of the script in my hands puts the final touches on my enjoyment of these episodes, not because it is a question of finding differences between what is in the final shooting script and what got aired on television, but simply because I finally get to see Whedon's stage directions. For example, after Joyce has learned Buffy is a vampire slayer there is a scene in Buffy's living room. There is no dialogue, just the shot, which is described as follows: Joyce sits in the living room with Spike. They both are silent and uncomfortable, like it's Sunday and he's come a 'courtin'. Joyce has a glass of bourbon in her hands, which shakes only slightly.For such small gems of insight into the mind of Joss Whedon picking up this collection of scripts is going to be worthwhile for &quot;BtVS&quot; fans. Completing the Angelus story arc that covered the second half of Season Two begun in Volume 3, you will find in Volume 4 &quot;Killed by Death,&quot; &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You,&quot; &quot;Go Fish,&quot; &quot;Becoming, Part One,&quot; and &quot;Becoming, Part Two.&quot; Actually, I enjoyed &quot;Go Fish&quot; a lot more being able to read the inside jokes, production notes, and cut dialogue than I did actually watching that rather [weak] episode. Overall I think it was a good move to have divide the scripts for Season Two this way, so that the first two volumes do the Spike-Dru story arc and the last two the Angelus story arc. I was going to point out that all six of the episodes for the &quot;BtVS&quot; Season Two video tape set are from this latter arc, but now that we are in the world of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; on DVD this is no longer a concern."},{"Title":"Never call it loving;: A biographical novel of Katherine O'Shea and Charles Stewart Parnell","review":"Katharine O'Shea is the trophy wife of Captain William O'Shea. For years there has been no love between the 2 of them, for Willie has thought only of bettering himself, leaving Kate &amp; their 3 children to be supported by her elderly aunt. Now has come a time when Willie has decided that he wants to go into politics and Kate is to help him by holding a dinner in honor of Charles Stewart Parnell, considered the laymen's King of Ireland. Kate, who has never known true love- sees something is this new face that is exciting, caring, and dedicated to his family and the people of Ireland. Charles sees a beauty of love that has never been unleashed. It is a story of a love affair between 2 people that went thru hell for each other- Kate with her family, friends &amp; neighbors against her, and Charles with the politicians and people of Ireland pulling him. But Kate finally won only to give Charles back to Ireland through sudden death.This is a reprint from the original back in 1966. I pulled this one off the library shelf remembering it being a dear book I had read in the early 70's during high school. The story is taken from a diary that was kept by Katharine (Kitty) O'Shea Parnell that DE discovered and then based her fictional biography on to tell Kitty and Charles' &quot;sides of the story.&quot; I realized while reading it how romance writing has changed- for the passion wasn't boldly described, but I could still feel it.

You will not waste your time reading this one."},{"Title":"Never call it loving;: A biographical novel of Katherine O'Shea and Charles Stewart Parnell","review":"This work of romantic historical fiction is a worthy effort by its noted author. With its title, taken from a poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, setting the stage, the book, based upon a true story, regales the reader with the nineteenth century love affair between Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell and Katherine O'Shea, wife of one of his political colleagues.Often referred to as the \\"uncrowned King of Ireland\\" for his passionate partisanship and his advocacy for home rule, Charles Parnell was a man dedicated to the betterment of the lot of the Irish under British rule. He was a fairly single-minded individual, until the day that his path crossed that of beautiful Katherine O'Shea. From the moment that they met, it was love at first sight, and never would they waver from that path of true love, despite the scandal that their affair would one day cause.Locked into a loveless marriage with the dissolute and impecunious Captain William O'Shea, Katherine was the mother of three children when she first met Charles Parnell.

This is a fabulous resource for the art student because few universities teach geometric drawing. Too many of the art professors trained in US over the last 70 years don't know it and don't teach it, yet geometrical drawing skills are essential to success in many areas of art and design. (Perhaps why some professors teach instead of doing art.)The author shows how to use simple tools (T-square, 45 and 60 degree squares, a compass, and protractor) to make geometrical drawings. The first chapters introduce techniques such drawing perpendiculars, dividing a line into equal parts, and reducing or increasing a shape proportionally. The author then delves into increasingly complicated topics such as dividing circles into equal parts, drawing conic sections (for example ellipses), and spirals. Spirals are used for many things from gun engraver's scroll work to painting a still life of a chambered nautilus. Irrespective of whether you use software such as Illustrator or a pencil, the information in this book will help you solve problems in composition and design."},{"Title":"Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh: A contribution to a typology of polysynthesis (Typological Studies in Language)","review":"TheThe World Atlas of Language Structuresopened me in a remarkable way to the world of linguistics - one I felt I had a reasonable knowledge of beforehand but which as a result I began to feel seriously inadequate about. The possibility of languages vastly different from what i had imagined emerged to a great extent, especially with the mostly extinct head-marking languages of Native America and the North Pacific.Nivkh, formerly called Gilyak, is more of the most fascinating of these languages, and one that has, as Johanna Mattisen shows very clearly, been much misunderstood by tyopologists, even ones as skilled asJohanna Nichols. Nivkh has neither simple case marking on nouns nor extensive person marking system on verbs, but it is nonetheless, in a manner Nichols does not grasp, a highly polysynthetic language: Matthiesen uses the term \\"impersonally polysynthetic language\\" to describe the structure of Nivkh because, although personal pronouns are the only indicator of a pronominal subject, words in Nivkh can, via incorporation and affixation, otherwise comprise full sentences.\\"Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh\\" gives an outline of the basics of Nivkh grammar and sentence structure in a manner that is not difficult for someone with moderate linguistic experience to grasp. All the basics of the structure of nouns and verbs in the language are discussed in very easy detail so that the linguist will be missing out on little that is of significance to the study of the language. Especially notable is the discussion of how dependents like attribitive adjectives incorporate into their heads (nouns) in normal Nivkh practice.However, as its subtitle suggests, \\"Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh\\" goes further than that. Mattissen looks in very good, yet equally clear, detail at how Nivkh fits into the pattern of polysynthesis in better-known Native American languages and the few languages of the Old World (Munda, Northwest Caucasian) that have the characteristics of polysynthetic languages. She shows that polysynthetic languages can be divided along two parameters. These are affixally versus compositionally polysynthetic languages on the one hand and templatic versus scope-order word structure on the other. The examples and details of this aspect of the work are done as well as the parts dealing specifically with Nivkh and are related very well to the Nivkh language itself, with the result that there is not the slightest loss of continuity throughout \\"Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh\\".All in all, \\"Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh\\" stands as much more than the study of a fascinating language. Without being a tough book to read, \\"Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh\\" goes into very effective studies of what is possible in language life few other books written on the topic. Examples are abundant and explanations clear, so if you want to stir your imagination or simply learn more about linguistics, you should try to find a copy of this rare book."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Daughter (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Usually I don't read romance , but the cover of the book captivated me.

The book comes with clear qualifications about the scanning process that enabled printing. Unfortunately, this process means that the original pagination was lost, as was the table of contents. The text is hard to read, and the page numbers won't be useful for citing in academic works.

I have suffered from arthritis for 20 years, taking many pain medications which only controlled, not eliminated the pain. After 4 months of following the instructions and diet, I realized the pain was virtually gone! It was a slow easing that was nothing short of a miracle. My doctor was skeptical that it would work, but said why not try it. It does work. Give it a try."},{"Title":"I cured my arthritis, you can too","review":"I read this book about 8 years ago. I also worked personally with the author as a mentor. It was hard. I was over 200 lbs and just had a baby. I my arthritis was more severe then it had been in a long time. I was struggling to even walk without meds. But the meds only to the edge off. I have had psoriatic arthritis since I was 12yrs. It wasn't until I was grown that it started to get really bad. Anyways I read the book and tried her methods and read her health blog and soon I was loosing weight and my soreness. In about one year. I had lost about 100lbs and most of my Arthritis was gone. I only struggled still to run because I did not keep up with the exercise so I was still out of shape. But otherwise I was doing tons better and so healthy I went from a 2x to a small to medium. Now this is not a weight loss thing but when my body got what it needed then it just started to clean itself out and naturally dropped weight and I also didn't need my thyroid medicine anymore, I could hear better because I had less ear wax. Anyways the stuff in the book is effective helps you get to know your own body. Everyone is different so there are different things that could make you swell up and even stress can contribute but learning to listen to your own body is what I learned and now I have a better idea of how to keep myself healthy and well in so many ways."},{"Title":"I cured my arthritis, you can too","review":"Margie Garrison tells us her story on how she overcame the painful disease of arthritis.The book gives those of us who have been dealing with this disease hope.

The book came in a timely manner, and very informative. vitamins listed in this book to take on a daily bais was listed."},{"Title":"I cured my arthritis, you can too","review":"I have finished reading half of this book...so far. It is NOT well-written by any means. She does not give you a solid plan to follow, just a very rough idea of what she did, but without any back-up to why the things that helped her worked. She basically expects you to become a vegetarian, and even suggests eating tomatoes, potatoes, and other well-known trigger foods that cause arthritis sufferers a lot of pain!Other than telling you to eat a bunch of fruits and vegetables, all she says about eating any other foods is exactly the following, \\"Dairy foods and meats are the culprits, stay away.\\" It's not even a proper sentence! She doesn't even say anything more about this, such as WHY dairy foods are bad, WHICH meats are bad and why, and what does she have to back this up? She later states she has an ALLERGY to beef. From what I've read in other books on arthritis, food intolerances make-up a large part of the problem for arthritis sufferers. This is the case with my husband, who has NO allergies to any foods or anything else (we had him do the full allergy prick test along with allergy blood tests - they came up with nothing). But he absolutely has food intolerances, which are completely different than food allergies (what I have).She also writes as if she is talking at you - she tells you, \\"Read about vitamins, try to find a doctor who treats with Orthomolecular method.\\" Again, not a proper sentence. Also, instead of telling us what vitamins help with arthritis sufferers and what vitamins may harm them, she has us pay good money for HER book so that she can tell us to go read some other book. Ridiculous! And she doesn't mention ANYTHING about \\"Orthomolecular method\\" prior to or after the aforementioned sentence.I don't think I will bother reading the rest of the book, as nothing in it thus far has been based on any form of scientific fact, has nothing / no research to back it up, and is really all hearsay. I may finish reading it on the slim chance it could have something useful in it that could help my husband. But that's also because I already bought it. I bought it used for about $3 and paid the $3.50 shipping, and I STILL feel like I've been ripped off! If you ARE going to try it, don't you DARE pay the $29.95 price tag I've seen. I also bought, \\"Conquering Arthritis - What Doctors Won't Tell You Because They Don't Know!\\" by Barbara Allen. Although her \\"reviews\\" for her book on Amazon need to be deleted since they are NOT reviews, but are in fact written by a bunch of people who know her personally telling you how great she is rather than by people who actually read AND used her book, after finishing Chapter 1 I am already impressed. Of course, I haven't gotten that far, but it is already obviously a well-written book filled with research, facts, and proof to back up the statements she gives. Nothing like this stupid book's lines like, \\"Eat at least two salads daily, two helpings of steamed vegetables, brown rice, or potatoes. (They are not fattening.) Lentils or Chinese vegetables, grains and fruits. \\"My!!! What a feast.\\"\\" And no, I did not change the punctuation. She actually puts random sentences inside parenthesis and says condescending phrases like, \\"My!!! What a feast.\\" Lines like these are all over this book. And since when are potatoes, particularly regular brown, Russett potatoes, not fattening and good for you?! These are well-known to raise your blood sugar levels much the same as when you eat white bread!Anyway, I could go on and on with quoting and bashing this book, but I think I'll instead just read the OTHER book I bought by Barbara Allen. For this book I paid the Amazon price of about $24, and it is SO MUCH BETTER than the $3 I threw out on this piece of garbage!"},{"Title":"I cured my arthritis, you can too","review":"For those of us plagued with the pain and stiffness of arthritis, this book is a great resource.

Have benefited from her advice."},{"Title":"I cured my arthritis, you can too","review":"This was a good book, I bought many and this and another one were my favs. I no longer have Arthritis because I learned about food and changed my diet. I learned about the hallelujah Diet & Lifestyle (see my other reviews) and now I am healthier and younger looking than before. Arthitis is not a death sentence, it's a wake up call! Change what's causing it (Not old age either) and that is as simple as changing what you have been eating all your life... Learn and read as many good books as you can. You will learn as I did, Doctors are not taught much about nutrition as it relates to sickness and disease. Let food be your medicine and Medicine be your food -Hippicates said this 2000 yrs ago! We have so much to learn about healthy eating in this country (USA) other poorier countries don't have the sickness's and diseases we have here. READ and research, and never stop learning...in time you WILL learn what took me years to learn. You can control your own health! And being sick (any sickness) is not normal or old age related. God made us right! We just have abused our wonderfully made bodies by throwing all kinds of junk in it and expcting it to run flawlessly year after year! Well it doesn't work that way... and if you don't change your diet you will soon learn and be at a doctors office taking pills and heading down that same slipperly slop so many americans are on. We don't need health CARE... We need to be taught correctly about health and what is healthy and life. This begins with a journey and desire to LEARN about health. This book was helpful along with others in helping me to open my eyes that something as simple as FOOD was causing my problems, not a gene, not a disease, not some odd virus, not cause mom or dad had it... it was our standard poor american fast food diet, even healthy food is not so healthy as you will learn, this book helped me years later to learned about the hallelujah Diet & lifestlye. This later helped me to reverse my Arthritis and help others to change their health and their lives. it is power to know that YOU can change YOUR health, when you get sick enough, you'll start looking for answers. I did... and I found them and now I am much healthier than I have ever been in my life!"},{"Title":"I cured my arthritis, you can too","review":"I was diagnosed with Arthritis last week and was searching for information.

The title should be \\"Feeding my ego writing a book helps my arthritis and my bank account.\\" Thank goodness I didn't pay $30 for this piece of drival. It is little more than a pamphlet, with sketches from what appears to have been done by second grade students, wherein the author expounds on her day to day life with little information about nutrition, foods, etc. and a few recipes that just take up space. In addition, there are Bible and other quotes which were totally out of place. How she found a publisher for this worthless booklet is beyond me!!! Oh! I see, it is self published, big surprise.

It starts with explanation of the classical theories of concepts, the reasons of their forming, and what they are lacking.Starting from that, it goes carefully, without presuming anything, through a set of empirical studies done with young children (pre-school, and early school ages), tightening the ring arround the possible theories.As a result, at the end the theory of theory based concepts seems to be best fitted.Closing chapter made me eager to read following books of the author, where he is supposed to analyze what kind of early theories there are in children, if there is just few general , or more specific ones.Very clearly and well written."},{"Title":"An ABC of Music (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"This is a gloss that moves very quickly from elementary notation to dodecaphony.

Although it is adequately thorough, the book's explanations are poorly organized and consistently cluttered with unnecessary &amp; outdated commentary. For example, the book goes so far as to chide electronic instruments as \\"gloomy\\" and \\"hollow,\\" insisting they have nothing to offer a serious musician. ABC of Music was published in 1963 and repeatedly shows its age. I've yet to see an adequate music theory companion, however, if you are strictly intent on being snooty about your compositions, Music Fundamentals: Through Pitch Structures and Rhythmic Design by Elvo S. D'Amante is worth the extra expense."},{"Title":"An ABC of Music (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"Ahem. In case you're wondering, the author of this wonderful introduction to music is Imogen Holst, daughter of Gustav Holst and a brilliant musician in her own right--as well as a supurb writer of lucid prose. The introduction is by Benjamen Britten. Who are Gustav Holst and Benjamen Britten? Along with Ralph Vaughn Williams, the most famous and highly regarded British composers of the twentieth century, that's who.

But being from the US, it uses different terms for the notes, which can drive you nuts. Not only are you trying to learn music but also trying to learn the different language for the notes. So its very frustrating.A big problem is, this book is many decades old. When starting to learn music, its best to practice on songs you know, so that when you see the stems and flags you can tell how they are to be played. Chances are, you will not know a single example song in this entire book. And then comes the real problem mentioned above. It doesnt use terms like whole note, half, quarter, eighth, etc. It uses terms like semibreve, crotchet, quaver, etc. Meaning i had to constantly keep referring to some early pages to see what they are talking about. I read half the book, learned almost nothing because of this aggravation, and tossed it on the shelf for my dust collection. If you're from the US, you need a US written book. I would highly reccomend \\"YOU CAN Read Music\\" by Amy Appleby. It even includes a CD. Very recognizable songs to practice on and everything is explained in very easy to understand terms. Another OK one is simply called \\"Learn to Read Music\\" by Howard Shanet.Im sure a few decades ago this ABC book did wonders for students in England, but this doesnt work today in the US.

In these short pieces many of them excerpts from longer walks we can feel the heart of his puzzling, mysterious, unique genius. Also in them we feel the way Kafka makes of a seemingly abstract argument a mystery story . There are parables on many different subjects, from Quixote and Sancho, to the Great Wall of China, and from Prometheus and the Vulture, to the Parable itself. Often there are variants of the parable and variants of the paradox and Kafka makes us feel not simply how elusive a single definition of a reality can be, but how wonderous and strange it can be also.Of course in Kafka there is also dread , anxiety and a whole sense of the world as being somehow stranger than we can think or even imagine .Even the everyday details of life which Kafka is so much a master of making into parables of poetic beauty turn mysteriously into something else which we cannot really hold in mind or finally define.Who reads this book reads a work of genius, the condensed essence of one of mankind's most original literary minds.What a pleasure what a wonder what a dream."},{"Title":"PARABLES AND PARADOXES","review":"Too bad this book is out of print.

I think Kafka's mysterious style is quite excellent, and I encourage anyone who has liked his other works to give tthis lesser known collection a chance"},{"Title":"PARABLES AND PARADOXES","review":"The pieces here were posthumously gathered from Kafka's notebooks, diaries, letters, and short fictional works. Though generally short, they do seem to go remarkably well together. The pieces are arranged in 4 broad sections: the imperial area including the Great Wall and The Tower of Babel. (\\"If it had been possible to build the Tower of Babel without ascending it, the work would have been permitted.\\"). There is a section that is Midrashic on the Older testament (\\"We are fashioned to live in Paradise, and Paradise was destined to serve us)\\". A favorite of mine was \\"The Animal in the Synagogue\\", though what the animal may symbolize is open for discussion. The section on the Greeks, introduces Poseidon, who has become a bureaucrat, checking \\"the last row of figures.\\" And \\"Leopards in the Temple\\" presents another animal in another temple ... and \\"becomes part of the ceremony\\". The final section includes unrelated fragments such as \\"The invention of the devil\\" and \\"The truth about Sancho Panza\\". I found these pieces all heavy in irony and paradox, speaking of a wonderful and mysterious world, without some of the darkness of his longer workReaders who enjoyed this would also enjoy Labyrinths, by Jorge Luis Borges."},{"Title":"PARABLES AND PARADOXES","review":"These short pieces often excerpts from the longer works concentrate the essence of this dazzling most unique of minds, whose enigmatic questioning and trembling anxiety nonetheless behold and present the world with awesome uncanny beauty. In these little pieces we go to the heart of the Kafka riddle understanding that no paradox is ultimately paradoxical enough, or no parable parable- like enough to fully contain this mind.If Genius is uniqueness then Kafka is the quintessential Genius, if Greatness is paradox and parable then Kafka is alone in the stars."},{"Title":"PARABLES AND PARADOXES","review":"Amusement is likely to be the aim of most people who read this book, but those who can appreciate a deeper side, in those moments when our relationship with reality is in bad shape, might also study this book as a higher intellectual calling. If intellectuals in modern society have lost the high standing that they had when intellectuals could be expected to support basic norms, it might be due to their ability to identify with the level of mental acivity evident in this book more readily than with the norms of a society in which people desparately need to believe that they are being understood. First, I would like to recommend this book to people who would like to do some original thinking in the area of religion. In my own religious history, it was surprising how well I could identify with the Edgar Allan Poe-ness of my nature, whenever ultimate problems needed to be faced. I have come to realize that, for the intellectuals of the world, the works of Edgar Allan Poe are like a collection of worn out American horse feathers compared to the depth which can be imagined by those who read the works of Kafka. I'll vouch for that, too."},{"Title":"Carry A. Nation: Retelling the Life","review":"A fascinating account of an important and little known American historical figure. The book is well researched and very well written."},{"Title":"The War Against the Terrorists: How to Win It","review":"Is there an adult who hasn't asked: Do we have to spend the rest of our lives being sitting ducks for terrorists both here and when we travel abroad? In this book, one of the world's most experienced counterterrorists shows exactly how we can put a stop to terrorism once and for all.The chapter on skyjacking should be read as a reminder before the reader takes any trip by plane. Mr. Rivers shows why security measures such as metal detectors, X-ray machines, frisking, and sky marshals don't stop terrorists. He gives the reader ten precautions to take at the airport before he or she boards and nine additional lifesaving recommendations to follow if he is ever on a hijacked aircraft. That chapter also shows how the hijacking of TWA's Flight 847 out of Athens, which caused the death of American Robert Stethem and a seventeen-day media event that benefitted the terrorists, could have been stopped cold in its tracks during the first hours. Counterterrorist rapid response teams were already in Europe and ready to go. For the first time in print, the author shows exactly how such a counterterrorist team would do the job.The author revealsAmericans are aiding the terrorist killers and who those Americans are, why appeasement of terrorists and retaliation against them doesn't work, and what does work. He details the new weapons of terror already in use that go far beyond machine guns and hand grenades. He tells where atomic devices are now being peddled and which groups in America are eager to get their hands on them. He also shows how the terrorists can cause radioactive explosions by the use of materials already in their hands.Mr. Rivers shows how embassies and business installations can be protected against car bombings, how Canada got tough with its terrorists and found that it worked, and what can be done now to deal with the terrorist training camps within Libya, Syria, and Iran by knowledgeable professionals without endangering innocent civilians or causing confrontations that could lead to war.Mr. Rivers, who has killed terrorist leaders on covert assignments by Allied governments such as Spain and Britain, throughout this book names names, identifies the killer groups, tells who their leaders really are, and how to prevent further terrorist acts by the same and other groups with means that are currently available. If ever there was a book for our time, you are holding it in your hands right now.why America is now the number one terrorist target, how some"},{"Title":"The War Against the Terrorists: How to Win It","review":"I just finished Rivers book, published in 1986. Robert Ruman's review is right on point. In light of current events, this book should be reprinted. As a frequent flyer, my anxiety has increased. Two weeks ago we went thru one recent minor incident aboard a flight by an obnoxious passenger. In light of this book, I now realize that the initial disturbance that attracts everyone's attention, be it at the airport, aboard a plane, a shopping center, restaurant, etc, is often the distracting event, while the real event is actually beginning to unfold. As you are drawn to watch the event, stop, turn, see who is not and what they are doing. His discussion about the attempted assassination of Pres. Regan is an excellent example.Last night my wife and I partied with a former Clinton bodyguard, Secret Service agent, and I told him what Rivers had to say. He said Rivers was right and they have totally modified their procedures. He also affirmed the distracting event theory.Mr. Rivers provides excellent descriptions of many such terrorist incidents, almost a micro second analysis as it unfolds, and what and where and how it could have been aborted. Query: Why haven't El Al flights been hijacked? Rivers tells you.A great book, and haunting.

I would certainly like to hope that the Special Operations Command are making this required reading for their operatives."},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"First, let me set the record straight because it is not true that this and Kreuzer's books are the only references on Omega watches. In fact, they are the two poorest.The best written source is, of course, Marco Richon's book, \\"Omega Saga\\" published by the Brandt Foundation and distributed by Omega (ISBN: 2-88380--010-3). However, this is available only in French. But I'm told Mr Richon is working on an English book about Omega.That being said, Goldberger's entry is interesting only because of the high quality of his pictures. They are numerous (approxinaltely 250 models are represented, consistent and professional.While the pictures are nice, there is practically no information at all on the watches themselves, the technology, or the history of Omega. No production dates for the timepieces are indicated, which might have provided at least some feeling for a historical timeline.We might also have been interested in Mr Golberger's experiences as a collector, and some knowledgeable information on the current market for vintage Omega timepieces.Maybe it's a good thing that text is scarce because where there is text, there are errors, not the least of which is that the author is named \\"Goldbeger\\" in his bio on the endpage. These 6 short lines have 6 errors in them, and I easily found at least seven more in the two-page Introduction by Mr Giampiero Negretti: clearly some copy reviewer did a very lousy job..."},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"Let me begin by saying that budding Omega enthusiasts who are looking for a general overview of Omega watches and history may be better served by reading (the albeit flawed) Omega Designs by Kreuzer. On the other hand, if you are looking for a visual compendium of Omega watches, than this could be the book for you. The photography is first-rate, and the hardcover binding is high quality and should be durable. Each page is devoted to one watch, usually with a three-quarter view and sometimes with a view of the movement. Commendably the author has provided data for each watch, including dimensions and movement caliber. The watches mainly come from the author's private collection, and span a broad spectrum from Omega's early days to its current existence under the umbrella of the Swatch Group. Many unique pieces are presented, from early pocket and wrist watches to a platinum cased Constellation. Especially impressive are the numerous photographs of 30mm caliber manual wind chronometer watches in both sub-second and center second versions.That being said, it is important to point out flaws in the book, especially given its high list price. First of all, except for commemorative models, there are no dates given for each watch. This is significant because it is quite easy to get an approximate date of manufacture from the movement serial number. Also, the movement views are too small. Collectors are interested not only in outward appearances, but also what is \\"underneath the hood\\". My biggest complaint is with the design format of the book. Though devoting a whole page to one watch is a good idea in theory, it results in a lot of wasted white space. All that space could have been better utilized (and given real value to the book) by adding enlarged movement views, other case views, or, like the excellent Dorling Kindersley books, informative text boxes.As an owner of numerous watch books, I'd like to give some suggestions to both the author of this book and future authors. First, an appendix would be useful. Data such as movement serial numbers, movement types and approximate periods of manufacture would help and add value. A few close-up views of famous movements would be fantastic. Candidates include the 30mm caliber, the 321 chronograph caliber, Omega's first bumper automatic, and a full-rotor Constellation movement. Finally, the author seems to be a prolific collector of watches. I'm sure people would like to read about his experiences relating to watch collecting, and Omega watches in particular, in his own words. There must be some good stories...In conclusion, this book plus Kreuzer's book are the only options currently available for the Omega enthusiast, until a book like the excellent Rolex Wristwatches by Dowling and Hess comes out for the venerable Bieler firm."},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"In my view, this is the worst book ever printed; it's acctually not a book because it has NO informations or anything you can learn from; it shows pictures and pictures of Omega watches. One watch pictured for the whole big page leaving much empty space. It's such a waste of paper and ink printing this so-call book."},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"I recieved this as a gift and was really pleased. Its beautifully done.

Mine is that it is a nice book to look at, a picture book.I miss information with the pictures as one cannot find reference n of the watches, date of production , calibre used ,etc. Some brief info together with the pictures would have been very nice to have.I like it anyway but I miss the above mentioned info very much.Best regards+++jmbanzo, Spain."},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"This book should be sub-titled: \\" - an illustrated history\\". It is an extremly well illustrated book spanning almost the entire history of Omega from early pocket watches to recent Speedmasters from 2005. On every page there is a full-page detailed photograph of an Omega model with some minimum written text on Model name, Caliber and sometimes year of production. Though the text is minimal the photos are all in colour and in large format enabling details of each watch/model to be easily picked out. Not only many variations of the better known models but also less well known time-pieces, clocks, stop-watches and so on give a well rounded presentation of the brand. As such it is invaluable for collectors or anyone interested in Omega watches. For the quality of its photos and spectrum of models covered it gets 5/5. The minimal text brings that down to 4/5. Nevertheless I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"if you are an omega lover this is the quick guide direction for you to be the collector"},{"Title":"Omega Watches","review":"Gave this as a Christmas gift and the receiptient was so thriled to get this product!

A story that's especially valuable for young kids.But adults will enjoy it, too and not just because of Mike Reiss's funny writing.

I read this story to a group of 3rd graders and not only were they laughing, but their teachers were as well. More than a few kids (and teachers) approached me afterward to ask if they could take the book home. The illustrations are so strange that kids will laugh even without reading the story, and its absurdity will entertain adults as well. It's a great story with a great message about accepting yourself.This is also a case where I agree somewhat with the people complaining about the book. Adults will definitely \\"get\\" the joke at the end, with little brother Dickie in front of a tape recorder waving the peace sign. But come on folks. How many 3rd graders know that Nixon's nickname was \\"Tricky Dick,\\" that he flashed the peace sign in the manner shown in the book, and that he got in trouble from recordings that he made? The only thing that is going to be going through a child's mind is the fact that the brother's name is Dickie and that his nose looks like a phallic symbol. Stop assuming that children are more sophisticated than they actually are. They spend time on the playground making jokes with the other kids and not all the kids are all that innocent. When I was that age, I certainly knew what \\"those\\" words meant, and so did all my friends. Get real.The best way to read this book, if you're concerned about that last page, is to just skip that page and end it with the class election joke. It works as an ending on its own, and the kids aren't going to feel like they were denied the true ending (unless they've already read the book, of course). That's what I did to avoid a potentially uncomfortable talk with some teachers about inappropriate books, and it worked out fine."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"Benjy is spending the summer at a camp for kids -- each of whom looks like something else. Benjy looks like Abraham Lincoln right down to the wart and beard. Other kids looks like frogs, toasters, even the backside of a horse. Benjy was used to be teased all the time at school for how he looked. It's at this very special summer camp that Benjy will learn important lessons about himself and just what makes people special. One of the staff writers of the popular \\"Simpsons\\" television show, Mike Reiss brings a very special touch to this engaging and original fable which is perfectly and whimsically illustrate by the colorful artwork of David Cathrow. The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln is a strongly recommended addition to any school or community library collection."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"My kids didn't actually find this book very funny (5 and 7). They didn't laugh at all while I read it. And when I got to the last page, I about died. After reading more about it, I do see that they are trying to pull it off as a joke of Richard Nixon, but that is NOT the first thing you think when you look at that page. And it is FOR SURE not the first thing that an elementary student will think of, considering most of them don't know anything about Richard Nixon. The first thing you will notice when you look at this picture of \\"Dickie\\" is the child's nose. The author/illustrator can say whatever they want about this book, but I'm sure they meant to put this joke in the book. I mean, Richard Nixon had a big nose, but it certianly didn't look like this. I just thank God that my kids didn't seem to get it, but I think older kids will for sure.

But Laurel and Hardy used the same gag concept in \\"The Chimp\\" (1932), I think a lot of fuss is being made over a very minor (sorry!) issue.The only reason to consider the last page to be adult humor is that the subject isn't going to be familiar to the kids, since it refers to an individual whose heyday was in the late '60s and early '70s. A quick explanation would make it clear to almost any child, who would then be able to get it.

There's a kid who has a head like a toaster, another who looks like the Titanic, one who looks like a football, and there's even one kid who looks like a horse's behind. Benjy returns home having learned an important lesson about life: it's not really on the outside what counts when the chips are down, but the character of a person on the inside.As for the so-called controversy surrounding this book, ignore it.

I know the author is also a writer for the TV show \\"The Simpsons\\", but I think he could have gotten his point across just as effectively without the use of the weird humor at the end.

It's funny, and has a sweet message about accepting who you are. There is a section where the boy who looks like Lincoln goes to a summer camp for kids that look like other things, and each time my kids get to that part they laugh out loud. As for any controversy with the last page, I'm surprised that anyone could read anything into it, other than poking fun at Richard Nixon."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"This book is great, and totally appropriate for children of all ages. Our 5 year old loves it. As far as the reviewer who thought the last page contained an inappropriate adult joke, I think she was mistaken. The reference to \\"Dicky\\". is clearly to Richard Nixon, and nothing dirty. It may go over kids heads, but there is nothing to be offended by."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"I picked this book up from the library because I am a huge fan of David Catrow's quirky illustrations. I wish I would have just admired the art work and ignored Reiss' story. It is funny but in an offensive inappropriate for children sort of way"},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"This is a great gag gift for an adult who enjoys children's books and/or presidential history. But it really isn't appropriate for children. I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud, I'm not a robot, I give my children all the intellectual credit they deserve, but the under 8 crowd is just not going to see the Richard Nixon joke. The book has a great message and I love how Benjy comes back from summer camp to tell the bullies just what he is thinkin'... I just don't need to give a moral message a gimmicky and crude spin to interest my kids. They are better than this and deserve more."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"I bought this book for my love of David Catrow illustrations. Catrow proved once again to be a very talented artist making the pictures very comical. There is an excellent moral to the story about being happy with who you are no matter how others may tease you. I must say that the last page with baby brother Dickie is probably the most entertaining! Yes, Richard Nixon even gets some lime light in the end!However, some of the humor seems more for adults. Did Reiss really need to include a horse's butt? I also do see how some people may see some male anatomy on the Richard Nixon page.I'm very torn about this book. I thoroughly enjoy it, but know it may offend others which is why I am weary about using it in my classroom. I truly can see this book going either way."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"This is a charming book. Funny, interesting, with a really creative premise. There's even a cute twist at the end. I've been thinking about it for days, that's how charming it was. But then I looked at its page on Amazon.Some people on the internet, it turns out, are crazy people. I suppose in any sample of the population there will be people who haven't paid very much attention to American history. And I suppose there will also be people who look at Richard Nixon's face and think they're looking at a groin. But just because a reaction like this is possible to have does not make it reasonable to have.So here's the deal. If you don't recognize the person on the last page, you should have paid more attention in history class. That's your fault. Don't take it out on this excellent little book. If you recognized the person on the last page as Richard Nixon and understood that he was a less well-reputed president than Abraham Lincoln, and by implication less enviable to look like, and still thought the reference to \\"Little Dickie\\" was an inappropriate joke, then that's something you need to work out with your therapist.And if you are a parent or a legal guardian and your child laughs at the end because of the word \\"Dickie,\\" use the opportunity to teach the little bugger about Watergate and explain why it's actually funny."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"I read though all of the reviews posted here and I have to say that I'm puzzled by the people who think there is inappropriate material in this book.

On the last page, we meet the brother of The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln--his name is Dickie and he looks just like Dick Nixon. He even has a TAPE RECORDER and is making two V's for Victory! Anyone who interprets \\"Dickie\\" in another way has no sense of history and a VERY DIRTY MIND."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln","review":"This book is absolutely hysterical and will have kids and adults (at least those who aren't librarian reviewers or prudes with no knowledge of American history) laughing their behinds off. The author, Mike Reiss, writes for The Simpsons and just like that great show, the humor here is geared at one level towards kids and at another for their parents.

In his book, he not only illustrates the struggles that conservatives have faced as an opposition movement, he has also shown the struggles that continue to exist even after conservatives have succeeded in gaining power. By tying the conservative movement to the careers of four individual politicians, Edwards succeeds in giving a human face to the movement. In the early days of the conservative movement, as personified by Senator Robert Taft, Edwards shows how the movement grew in response to America's increased international prestige following WWII. With the emergence of Republican Presidential Candidate Barry Goldwater, Edwards shows how the conservative movement began to gain ground among the American public. The emergence of the conservative movement increases dramatically with the election of President Ronald Reagan and is then capped off with the 1994 election of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House. Luckily, Edwards does not end there. He is evenhanded in showing the errors made by conservatives as they take control of the branches of government and suggests that this is a struggle that has not yet seen its final chapter."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"As a young conservative I have sought to learn as much history of the movement as possible. I have read stacks and stacks of books on conservative thought and those by the great conservatives. None cover so comprehensively the breadth and depth of the pivotal role of each of the four men about whom Edwards writes. Senators Taft and Goldwater, President Reagan and former Speaker Gingrich are the giants on whose shoulders all other conservative leaders today stand. Edwards intimate knowledge of the four is apparent and his writing ability is tremendous.If you're looking for a thorough, well written introduction into the whole world of the conservative movement, this is where to start.I'd be buying this book right now, if I didn't already own it."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"The Conservative Revolution is an engaging read that will peak your interest with every page. It will surprise you in that so much of what happened almost forty years ago when the modern conservative movement was born, is occurring in the movement today. In the sixties, it was the conservatives that finally took the Republican Party away from the &quot;me-too&quot; liberal Republicans, and at the same time wrote the John Birch Society and Ayn Rand out of the movement. Today, the moderates are trying to write those of us that are principled conservatives out of the Republican Party. This well researched work will inform even those who lived through the birth of the movement. I highly recommend The Conservative Revolution to every reader that is interested in politics and conservatism."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"We conservatives like to sermonize about the historical ignorance of the average American, but too many of us are just as ignorant of the history of our own conservative movement. If you're in that category, take an afternoon or two to read Lee Edwards' &quot;The Conservative Revolution.&quot;Edwards surveys the high points of the conservative movement, starting with &quot;Mr. Republican&quot; Sen. Robert Taft, through the Gingrich Revolution of 1994. He craftily threads the behind-the-scenes details of the movement with the historical events of the world at large, being sure to explain those events and their meaning and connection to the American political scene.This is not &quot;objective&quot; history, of course; Edwards is one of us, and he isn't afraid to make his opinion known. But he is careful to provide a balanced, detached look at the facts, keeping his opinion separate.If you enjoy this book and want to learn more about the two greatest political victories for conservatives this century, be sure to read F. Clifton White's &quot;Why Reagan Won&quot; and &quot;Suite 3505: The Draft Goldwater Movement&quot;."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"&quot;The Conservative Revolution&quot; is a fascinating detailed look at the history of the Conservative movement from the end of World War II until the late 1990's. It is a very good history and I learned a great deal that I did not know before (I especially appreciated the background on Robert Taft).As a Gen-X conservative, though, I feel I probably have a different view about events than Lee Edwards who apparantly is old enough to have witnessed most of this history first hand. For one thing, I find it extremely hard to think of Barry Goldwater as a true conservative, given his pro-choice abortion views and his anti-school prayer stance. Also, as a person who experienced his teen years during the 1980's, I also can't forget that Barry Goldwater loved to run to the microphone to criticize Ronald Reagan any chance he got. To me it is obvious that conservatives of the 1960's were following a complete charlatan, and it is no wonder he went down in landslide defeat.Which brings us to the point that the book should have had far more information about Ronald Reagan than it did. Ronald Reagan is the true Rock of Gibraltar of the conservative movement and he should be the centerpiece of the book rather than sharing space with Goldwater and Gingrich.However, I do highly recommend this book simply for the reason that most conservatives do not know the history of the conservative movement and this book is the best I have seen in giving that history."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"Lee Edwards' book is a brilliant, informative, and educational chronicle of the rise of American conservatism over the past 50 years. He deftly examines the liberal excesses that led to the increasing acceptance of right-of-center ideas. The book is most effective in its analysis of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, although a bit more could be written about Newt Gingrich and post-Reagan conservative figures. But overall, it is required reading for those who seek to understand America's rightward shift."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"Lee Edwards has always done a wonderful job writing the history and biographies of many of the key players that made conservatism what it is. Unfortunately, trying to cram the events and people that made conservatism what it is, even by only focusing on four of those players, tends to obscure the individual strengths and weaknesses of those players. I commend Edwards for his effort in writing this book. God knows that conservatism has not received its due attention by historians. And as usual, Edwards' book is very readable and informative. However, in my opinion, his time would be better spent continuing to write about the individual heroes of conservatism rather than trying to summarize the movement."},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"America is being remade, but not by these guys. A hollywood B actor, an adulterer, and other assorted criminals. Not that many of those on the other side are a lot better. Start thinking, judging each candidate for who he tells you he is. They usually do. Deep insight?"},{"Title":"The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America","review":"A pretty good overview of the Conservative movement. I was especially moved by the eloquent pages on Barry Goldwater, the last true Conservative to run for President. Reagan wasn't bad but he never got far enough away from his Holywood socialist roots (and he infected us with the Bush twins - better than Clinton but liberals none the less). Even as he was facing down the Soviets he introduced about as much government intrusion into our lives as Clinton has. But then too many young conservatives today don't even really know what the word means or can explain the roots of the philosophy behind it. This book is a good start but make certain you read some of the classic post-war capitalist writers like Ayn Rand to get a full view of the birth of the American conservative movement."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is perhaps one of Miss Austen's most controversial heroines. From the age of match-makers and suppressed feminism, comes a book which makes you angry, ashamed and overpowered along with Emma herself. Accused of being materialistic, Jane Austen has written a timeless tale of a pretty girl living on the assurance of beauty, sensitivity, and wealth, and perhaps there is more than a touch of money in this story, but in this century, and the one past, there is more than a touch of money in everyone's story. In every story comes a lesson for everyone, and Emma is no exeption"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a loveable character who isn't really sure what she wants at first.

I loved the book...what more can I say? It's definitely geared towards females, obviously, but anyone can read it for lighthearted, enjoyable reading. It isn't that long of a book, and, after all, its a classic. So read it as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Lovable Emma Woodhouse, Pretty, bright, and rich, not to mention a little mischievious. Since she has lived nearly twenty-one years with very little to distress or vex her, carefree Emma spends her time match-making for her friends. But when she undertakes the office of matching pretty, but not very bright Harriet Smith with the local Vicar she gets more than she bargains for.The characters are rich and consistent, and Austen again gives us, the ridiculous; mr. woodhouse, Miss Bates. The scoundrel who pretends to be an angel of light;Frank Churchill. The concerned friends; Mrs. Weston, Mr. knightly. Then there is Emma, who belongs in a class of her own. She is the most fortunate, yet the most flawed Austen heroine, which flaws only endear her all the more. And in the end they pay off, when she falls in love with someone as imperfect as herself.The language and diolouge are as shining, bright, and charming as the characters themselves. Overall this novel can do nothing but please, just as Austen's novels before and after Emma show. A must-read for Austen fans."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Wonderful!

This is by far my favourite as I thought the character of Emma was very well developed and very enjoyable - I couldn't help but love her despite her pride and prejudices. Haha.I did attempt to read Pride & Prejudice a few years back and gave up because of Austen's writing style. Emma has encouraged me to persevere, and I just love the P&P; BBC series - it's amazing!Emma (the book and the character) is not to everyone's taste but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"If no one else liked this book, I would be responsible for keeping it a classic.

As for the plot, I think it goes something like this -- they talk, they talk, they talk, then they shut up, and the book is over."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I have always loved Emma the movie, the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in it. Her Emma is so clueless, so innocent, yet somehow loveable. I finally decided to pick up the classic novel to see if the movie missed anything and to get the full story straight from the author. The book delighted me just as much as the movie did, as I am pleased to say.Emma Woodhouse is a young, rich woman living with her germaphobe father in the town of Highbury. Bored and eager for some sort of excitement, she decides to matchmake her new friend Harriet Smith with the local vicar Mr.Elton. Emma is convinced that her matchmaking skills are among the best, wrongly taking credit for pairing her governess Miss Taylor with their neighbor Mr.Weston. Many mishaps occur, and many hearts broken and confused, but in the end all is well, with all three of the main couples finding happiness.It took me a little while to get in the vocabulary of the time, but once I did the book breezed by. Emma is so flawed like all of us; that is why we love her. Just because this book was written almost 200 years ago doesn't make it bad: it makes it better."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I think Emma is a sparkling, witty and engaging story that beats a lot of modern works hands down. I found it hard to choose a favourite Austen but I think this one is just brilliant and Mr Knightley is definately my favourite of her heroes.

I had seen the movie, but I wanted to read the book, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; not only that, but I would thouroughly recommend it to others, because I loved it that much!!! I was appaled to read the reviews of the 1 and 2 star people. I can see that these people don't read very much at all and only, say, Babysitter's Club Books or some crap like that. I know that a lot of people hate reading in general and so, therefore could not possibly comprehend a wonderful novel like Emma. They obviously don't recognize classic literature when they &quot;read&quot; it! I liked this book because of the wonderful characters. I especially liked Mr.Knightely!

If you enjoy reading REAL literature, I would certainly recommend Emma, by Jane Austen!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I, like several other people who responded, have half a brain and taste in literature and therefore greatly enjoyed this novel. Not only does it have excellent plot, amusing dialogue, and a happy ending but it also lends a great amount of insight into this time in history. I am 18 years old and have read this book several times, surprisingly enough before any films were released, and can honestly say that it was my favorite novel ever written. Obviously those who only gave it one or two stars are more at home reading such low class literary works as Stephen King novels, which certainly have more excitement but don't actually require any real thought. I don't believe that the responses of such people to real literary works would really have any true value in my opinion since they quite apparently have no real intelligence or taste in literture whatsoever. My advice to such people would be to avoid real books and to stick to what they are actually capable of understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate. Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys. This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful. In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry. But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character. It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is. And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself. Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This difference is more a matter of degree than in kind. In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic. The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book. The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play. Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself. The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not. Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting. I found it slow, with way too many words and descriptions. I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature. How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong? We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature. She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good. Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations. And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both. Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short. And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising. And we like her none the less for it. Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms. It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways. Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two. Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating. Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much. Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I must admit, I had really high hopes for this novel. However, after reading the first chapter, I put it down to go onto a different novel. A few months and a few novels passed and I again picked it up to try again. History does, indeed, repeat itself. Another chapter down, I went to another novel.Finally, after owning the book for 8 months, I decided it was time to just do it. So, I refused to allow myself to put it down again for another novel. It took me about twelve chapters to become involved in any character besides Mr. Knightly and to enjoy the story... but it did come.Had I reviewed this book before chapter 12, I would have said, &quot;No way... this book is too slow and long winded!&quot; However, after finishing it, I appreciate the author and the story more than I did before.I will say this much, however: I have discovered that I am a reader of Charlotte Bronte, but a viewer of Jane Austin movies adapted to film."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"While doing research for a high school paper on Pride and Prejudice, I often came across the statement that Emma was Austen's masterpiece. Having practically memorized P&P; and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text. Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words. Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement. The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author. Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul. The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P;, or even S&S;, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse. If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation. She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak. While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness. Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit. The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her. Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity). Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional. Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty. Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted, young. Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do. They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre. Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity. It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so. As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch. What is amazing is how logically it all flows together. Genius.Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman. While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking. Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley. He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical. His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural. After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.; All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language. It's really quite impossible to compare P&P; and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot. This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I think most people are already familiar with the story of Emma, and many are probably also familiar with the back-story, which is that Jane Austen decided to write about a character which she thought \\"nobody but myself will much like.\\" I dare say there are plenty of people who indeed do not like Emma Woodhouse, but I have loved plenty of books, TV shows, and movies centered on a character I disliked (or even hated) far more than Emma, whose faults do not, at least, include witlessness, stupidity, or true ugliness of character.Added to Emma's attractiveness as a protagonist and other well-rounded characters that we may love or hate, is Jane Austen's excellent prose and story plotting, and, most importantly, her cutting humor and social commentary. Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park)."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with \\"Sense\\" as my favorite Austen work!\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma has been well known since it's publishment. In the 90's, a successful chick-flick movie, Clueless was based on this novel. Even though the movie does not in any way depict the intelligence of Jane Austen, it serves the main characters' personalities. The book by far was absolutely and brilliantly written while easy to understand in fairly relatable modern English. This book is a great read for literature analysts because it serves a wide variety of character traits within their society. It can also be used to analyze the socio-economic stereotypes and lifestyles of their time. The plot and storyline were at a consistent pace with a surprising climax and turn towards the end. Because it is a love story, it does follow the usual typical love story scenes. However, love is depicted differently by each couple and character, which sets it apart from other cinderella-like stories, which were popular during that time period. It is a very relaxing book -- not an intense read. It is also a classic even though not as widespread or as known as other Austen's novels such as Pride and Prejudice. It is definitely a recommanded read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels. That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites. That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse. Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said. At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma. She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing. And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith. While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match. Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her. She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter. Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending. Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless. I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father. Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Her mother has died and she lives with her father and her governess. Her family is at the very top of social standings in town, and Emma is all too aware of it. The starting point is her governess's engagement to a good man, which Emma imagines she has engineered by herself. Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"While this novel is certainly a cut above most modern fiction, Emma is not Austen's best work. In contrast with Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey's tight narrative structures, Emma is long and rambling. The narrative presents many insignificant details even as it leaves out more important scenes. For example, we are privy to several examples of Miss Bates' idle chatter, but Harriet's capture by the gypsies and Robert Martin's proposal happen offstage. Although Miss Bates is supposed to be a lovable character, I found myself putting the book down during one of her conversations and not returning to it for several months (which is unusual, as I read Northanger Abbey in a day).Nevertheless, the novel does have its redeeming features. Several people have noted that they disliked Emma's snobbishness, but we're not meant to adore her, and the author gently pokes fun at her elitism. Prior to the book's publication, Austen wrote that she feared no one else would love Emma as much as she did, so the protagonist is not intended to be a likeable character. Her flaws balance out her good traits, such as her wit and liveliness. Her dialogues with Mr. Knightley and even Harriet contain subtle zingers that may not be readily apparent to a 20th century reader the first time around. If you think you didn't like this book, you will appreciate it more on a second reading (and you can always skim the boring parts, like poor Miss Bates!). You will learn a great deal about the classist ideology lurking beneath Regency Britain's prim veneer. And if nothing else, reading with the intent to pick up on the characters' oblique but witty repartee will help you sharpen your own wit and social skills."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels.

Emma takes patience but it's a rewarding read, with all the complications, misunderstandings andbanality of your average soap opera yet shining with Austen's trademark subtle wit and mordant intelligence which has made this novel a classic.Books do require a little more time, effort and thinking than sitting mindlessly in front of Alicia Silverstone, but what you take away from the experience is a much wider understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so.

The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible.But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.A nice story, just not a great one.

(Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason.

It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Be warned: this book is slow. very slow. i loved pride and prejudice, but i would have quit partway through this one if it hadn't been a gift.However, if you have the patience and fortitude to get through it, you will be rewarded. Though i could have done without so much detail about the planning of a party, or full chapters of Emma and Mr. Knightley talking things to death, it was an overall good book. Emma is very fully developed. She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom. Especially towards the end, I had a lot of fun picking out hints and speculating, and seeing my guesses come out right.The book isn't so amazing that i would urge everyone to struggle through the whole length of it, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. it just could have been much shortened."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This was the first time I had \\"read\\" Emma.

You must read it."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I will admit that when it comes to reading things that are regarding as &quot;classics&quot; I usually want to kill myself. I find the language and story etc. boring. Emma, is actually the exception to that.Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband. Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege. Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable. Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco. The first man actually likes Emma. The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes. Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.It is an amusing read. The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes. She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot; or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read. you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily. It didn't. I had to work to read Emma.For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning. She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all. But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book. So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl. I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine. More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax. The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen. This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it. One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith. Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love. Austen usesirony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious. She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton. Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"\`Letme entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38). There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty. Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank. We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together. There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him. All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along. Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley. Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister. It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid. With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible for the reader to realize whatis actually going on. This adds to the surprise ending. How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever. Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance. Emma the character professes not to desire marriage. This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time. The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune. Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status. Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society. It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment. The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm. Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from. True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determined by the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth. The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch. The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch. In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit. Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction. From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink. Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\" Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities. You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far. EMMA is no different. An excellent read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a touching, comeing of age story. It is about a young girl who is close to becoming spoiled and conceited, but through many experiences both good and bad she slowly turns into a caring considerate woman. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and Emma is definately my favorite. It contains more humor than most of Jane Austen's stories and is fun to read. I would recomend this for a first time Austen reader, because it is such a fun book that is somewhat lighter and easier to read than some of Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This book is well-written for a love story. The outcome fits the story line perfectly. Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another. Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste of her own medicine. Her love set ups are not going as she had planned. Then everything hits her all at once. I love it! I would recommend this book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff. Jane Austen did it again."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her. Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet. Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters. For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go. Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal. Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"When I first picked up \\"Emma,\\" I was expecting it to be as charming and alluring as Austen's well-known \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". What I found, however, was it didn't quite measure up to my expectations. Although I had high hopes for this book, and anticipated it's spectacular outcome, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I found it hard to connect with Emma, the main character. At first, she seemed like a sweet young lady, caring for others and rarely found at fault. But once I learned of her snobby disposition, wealthy pride, and little care for the feelings of others, I wasn't as fond of her. Her character was set up as the stereotypical \\"snobby, rich girl\\" we think of today--one of whom makes sure to always get her way. The idea of the upper-class's success and how they are, evidently, the most intelligent of people, was the way Austen seemed to portray her character. Because of Emma's lifestyle and family setup, she was able to get most of what she wanted, most of the time. Although she wasn't always arrogant and rude, she certainly did have her flaws.Emma delighted in matchmaking, but, while doing so, didn't think of the feelings of others--which would later lead her into trouble. This \\"hobby\\" of hers often caused misunderstanding and, ultimately, ended in heartbreak. When Emma recognizes her \\"gifting\\" in this area, she uses it to her full potential. Even though she would try to turn things in the favor of those she was closest to, she often ended up in control of their lives. She went along assuming the emotions of others, when in reality, their feelings were not at all what they had seemed. Emma's assumptions led her nowhere. But, through all the distress she caused, she discovered a great deal about herself and her unrecognized love.When Emma's only mother figure in her life--Miss Taylor, the family governess--gets married and moves away, Emma becomes distraught. However, this discomfort soon gets pushed aside when Harriet comes into her life. Harriet is an orphan who becomes a friend to Emma. But, this relationship doesn't do good for either of them. Emma takes advantage of Harriet as her \\"pet\\", pulling her around and using flattery to make her do things. She puts things into Harriet's mind that aren't always true, trying to give her a hope of love.Throughout the many complicated relationships of Emma and her friends, there is one particular friend who stood beside her the entire time. He was Mr. Knightley--an old friend who steps in whenever he thinks Emma is taking things a little too far. She rarely listens to him, though, and must suffer the consequences. Even as smart as Emma was, she didn't have the intelligence to understand the feelings of others. She hardly put anyone before herself."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Thank you for the quick shipment!

Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for? Grade: A"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her. Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Clueless, which was based on &quot;Emma&quot;. Clueless was made in the 1990's, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700's and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that &quot;Emma&quot; came first. I know this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were during English class. Back to the book, though - I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is the first Jane Austen novel I ever read, and 13 years later it's still my favorite. It's also the most accessible, easy to read Austen novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Emma, were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that I've met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library. I would suggest \\"Emma\\" above any other Jane Austen's classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a \`new style of novel' designed to \`suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviiiIf I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch's essay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented. Good separation of characters. Her rendition of Miss Bates is incredible - leaves one breathless."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously. Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet. Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him. Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come. Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed. Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her. Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him. Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching. Emma is so busy arranging other people's lives that she neglects her own wants and needs.

My teacher loved it and boasted about it's greatness. I was very disturbed because, I read it.....got through the first four chapters and went into a coma.... BORING! This story not only lacks any action or plot of sorts but insists on spending copious amounts of pages on meaningless blabber. I had to make a summary of the novel. It took only 1 page. My teahcer could not criticise my summary. I had covered EVERYTHING in the novel! I found Emma to be one of the most irritating characters ever created, for those who boldly state she is the greatest 'heroine', I will say, Joan of Ark was a heroine, Mary mother of Jesus was a heroine, Mother Teresa was a heroine, EMMA is a pretentios, self absorbed, controling, spoilt, BORING individual and should be left in her time and not studied in ours. In Austen's own words, &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom NO ONE BUT MYSELF will much LIKE.&quot;, Here, here!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a &#34;classic&#34; read. I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book. I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it. As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible! People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"You must have patients to read this book. The basic story line is really good.Emma lives in Highbury and has a way of getting into everyone else's business. She's witty, popular, rich, and beautiful.

Pride and Prejudice is better."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Yes, that's how I feel about the book. I absolutely LOVE Pride & Prejudice and Northanger Abbey, so I thougt: time to re-read Emma. And boy did I have to push myself to finish it ! Like another reviewer said: it looks like a blueprint of the movie Clueless. But less funny and al lot more boring.But maybe I'm being to harsh on Jane Austen. Not all books survive the teeth of time like Pride and Prejudice. If that is what life was like for a lot of high class girls in the early 19th century, than I am so gratefull that I'm born at the end of the 20th century !!! Miss Bates monologues were kinda funny the first few times, but after that... The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies.We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good.Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences. Of course, we still have them, but it is not like they cannot mix, these days. Or that we still have those rules about visiting and inviting. or at least nog were I live."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm sure for some people out there, this book's a godsend, and I'm sure some people actually like Emma. Me personally, the book's not all that great, and I despise Emma. Why?, you may ask; because a) too many words, there's at least twice as many words to describe one thing as there is necessary. Yeah, so maybe I don't feel like 'hard reading' but it doesn't leave much to the imagination, and I'm a person who likes to have my imagination do the driving. The other reason I didn't particularly like the book - well, I don't get my kicks from reading about manipulative, immature women, which is my opinion of Emma. Manipulative, because she assumes it's her right to make matches, immature because she doesn't see anything wrong with it, especially when she's confronted with it. she has the 'i'm always right' feeling you'll sometimes find in a five year old. Other than that, for people who like wordy books, and as someone else said, like soaps, then read the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This book tell us such a simple story.

I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television, or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know when I'm going to be finished.And this is coming from someone who studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However, a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push through some dialogue that runs longer than one page.As for what the book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma complete illustrated novel by Jane AustenAusten's witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful.

It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on withlittle thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works. She is the indisputed queen of romance fiction and is as popular today as she was when the book was published in 1816. This fall Masterpiece Theatre will be airing dramatizations of all six novels. We Janeites are a growing army of devoted fans. Jane only wrote 6 books but each is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment. Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives.While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another. In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance.In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit. Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love.Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father. Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school. The plot revolves around Emma\`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men. Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.Several young couples court and become engaged in the course of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts. Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most. She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior. What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting butdoddering father.This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present. The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix. Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda. Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings andrelationships? Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders? EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a must read for Austen fans.

In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often. In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue. Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith. In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.The comedy ripples through every chapter. Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners. Along the way, the reader will be treated to Emma's education in life, a worthwhile journey with an interesting ending. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is somewhat of a flip from Pride and Prejudice. Not as good, but still worth reading. Emma is the privileged one in her society and as she tries helping a less fortunate friend find love, she discovers that she is not as wise as she once thought. With a steady flow of characters and a great growth depiction in Emma, I just might read this again.The beginning dragged on a bit, you really have to get past 60% before anything particularly interesting happens, and I even really disliked Emma at first. However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions. Don't read for a fast moving story, but if you want something that is relaxing and refreshing, Emma is your thing."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Beautiful Deluxe Edition!

There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her &quot;friend&quot; Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this &quot;little gem&quot; for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire.

I fell asleep at the first page. its great if youre into that old 1800s kind of speech."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Four hundred pages of the idle rich filling up their vain and empty lives by meddling in other people's affairs while exchanging gossip and pointless drivel about their relative social standing, followed by one hundred pages of an embarrassingly bad romance novel, plus one very annoying character (Emma's father) who clearly has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome. I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo, action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood. If only the book had been that tolerable.All right, Austen fans, slam my review if you want, but all you readers-for-fun out there, those of you I might have saved from a long boring nothing-happens kinda novel: YOU'RE WELCOME!!!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book.

For the last month or so, I've been trying to read \\"Emma,\\" and I believe I lack only 50 pages. I'm determined to finish. Actually, I started reading it about a year ago. If I can suffer through 10 pages a day, I think I'm doing well. I plan some type of celebration once I'm done.One of my graduate students used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Jane Austen. I agree 100%. Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say. Maybe not. She simply goes on and on and on.Personally, it's novels like \\"Emma\\" (or any other novel by the outdated Ms. Austen) that turn kids against literature. When I was in the 10th grade, we had to read \\"Silas Marner,\\" a totally painful experience. I reread it years later, thinking maybe I had misjudged it as a teen. I had. It was even more painful.i'm really thinking about beginning a Website, \\"Real Men Don't Read Jane Austen.\\" But that's sexist, isn't it? I can only hear Ms. Austin responding, \\"Do you mean to say if real men don't read me, unreal men do? What's an unreal man? Are there both real men and unreal men in the world? Is 'unreal' the opposite of 'real'? But what's 'real'? Is it the opposite of 'unreal'? Oh, my. My my. What's 'real'? What's 'unreal'?

Try another Austen book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"After reading this novel, I realized how entertaining/touching an old book could actually be. The story was about a woman (Emma) who despised marriage, and felt that there was no need to dedicate her life to only one person. I felt that Emma was a very strong character, she knew what she wanted and would not let anyone alter her decision about marriage. However, at the end of the novel the character succumbs to societal pressures and marries the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen. I feel that everyone should read this book, because even though it was written over a century ago, individuals now are able to read it and feel like they can relate to the characters, at least I felt that I could."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a wonderful story.

It's a classic worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is twenty years old, living in the countryside of Victorian England. Her father is a wealthy hypochondriac, constantly worried about his own health or the health of others. He dotes on Emma and can see no wrong in anything she does. Emma's mother died when she was a small child, and her older sister married and moved away some years ago. This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking.At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well. She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor. Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings.Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused. Will she be a successful matchmaker? Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married?I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow. I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book. Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature.This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen.Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Those who gave this book a three or lower must not know how to appreciate formal writing.

Hey, go out and read Remains of the Day. That was about a butler. And it was great. Emma was a good book. It's a good story. But I guess some people are to busy staring at the TV screen to notice.

However, for me it seemed to take to long for them to actually say anything & get to the point."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This is my second attempt at reading Emma. When I got it in late August, I got about twenty pages and had to put it down. Now, I picked up where I left off, and I really enjoyed this one. I don't know why I couldn't get through it before. Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice. Penguin uses 3D imaging to scan a woven pattern. So basically, you can feel the stitches on the front of the cover and the back of the cover (and the back side too.) Beautiful, beautiful design, and I look forward to reading some of the other books from this series.Emma was an enjoyable read; though I didn't love it as much as Pride and Prejudice, I definitely liked it more than Northanger Abbey.4.5 stars.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen is a master storyteller.

That said, I still like it a great deal.Emma is funny. If you liked Pride and Prejudice, then you'll love Emma.However, I like Austen's darker, heavier books, like Persuasion and Mansfield Park.Emma is long, far longer than S&S; or Persuasion, but it's also fluffier. Emma is rich, very quite rich, so she doesn't have the problems of the Bennett girls in P&P; or the girls in S&S;, or even the gentler money problems of the ladies in Persuasion.Emma is Jane's fantasy, what she might have done if she were rich.If you like Jane Austen, you'll like Emma.If you like Jane Austen's sharp, stinging wit, try one of her others.V."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I think this is Jane Austen's best novel. Its main character is lovable but incredibly flawed. Her saving grace is that she is prepared to acknowledge her repeated errors. The other characters are also both interesting and believable, though the hero Mr Knightley is a bit too good to be true - but then most of Austen's heroes are a bit bloodless except for Darcy and perhaps Willoughby. Emma, the novel, is also a mystery. Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel. The backdrop of privilege and patronage with its ever present snobbery and prejudice are gently but critically presented. Austen's most satirical, most humourous work"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I first read this in college for my intro to British Lit course - it's been my favorite Austen novel ever since."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"A classic story.

Emma is SO easy to relate to and yet her misinterpretations and \\"kind intentions\\" illustrate faux pas we all make! Each character one meets is so well-rounded one feels they could step out of the page into my everyday life! The story is enjoyable from start to finish, a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I confess: I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline. However, caution should be exercised in reading her books. Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events. In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike. It is a great tour de force. Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime? Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"As with all of Austen's novels, the reader will find the breadth of human character within the cover. The novel demonstrates a biting wit as well as a sentimenal side. I first read this book when I was fifteen and I was absolutely captivated. If you have not read this book then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.I just finished Emma. I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times. I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.I needn't have worried. Books are never the same as movies. I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less. While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I absolutely loved this novel!! I'm also glad that before reading this novel I read Jane Austen's other famous works because I had practice with Austen's confusing vocabulary. Once I got used to it I was able to appreciate what was truly happening with Emma. I highly recommend this book to young girls that have a pedestrian outlook on love, because after reading this novel I learned that love isn't always about emotions but you have got to be sensible as well. Emma is a woman to be emulated, not because of her match-making attitude but of her convictions and strenght. She does not need a man to complete herself, but after finally allowing her eyes to open she does find bliss with the man she loves. I can go on and on about this novel, but then what would be the use of reading?? Get yourself a copy now! You won't regret it.."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep, now years later I decided to give it another shot. To my suprise, Emma was a delightful book. At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists. Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author! I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily, but it is perfect for teenagers and up, esspecially girls. :)"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Having been a devoted fan since early childhood, I have read all of Miss Austen's books at least twice, and I find this the most endearing. 'Emma' is a dazzling combination of wit, not-too-dreadful mishaps, mild drama, and affectionate, though insightful, looks at society.Emma, though a little petted and given to overconfidence in her intellect (brilliant people often struggle so), is definitely endearing (even more so than Gwyneth Paltrow). And, of course, Miss Austen's inventive method of relating dialogue is delightful. Of Mr. Woodhouse, the definitive hypochondriac: &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive...He did not know what they had best do...&quot; Jane Austen has a splendid way of drawing the characters through such dialogue - it is almost as if they come alive.If you ever read one book of Miss Austen's, read 'Emma'!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I listened to this as an audio book which is a somewhat different experience than reading it. I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles. I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal. It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place. However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable. She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position. This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt! She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others. When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person. Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma was such a character who in my opinion, was a little bit too conceited - she had thought to know of the feelings of other people that made her feel very confident of her match-making skills; and yet, when these matches failed to be, she thought the failures were all her doing too! Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited \`hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well. During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions. She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her. However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person. She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination. I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures. Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates. But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.However, over all, I enjoyed this book. I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then. At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma\\" isn't the most sophisticated or complex of Jane Austen's book but is my favorite by far. The characters, especially Emma, are funny and moving. I'm such a romantic and this is just delightfully fulfilling."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"EMMA\\" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) \\"PERSUASION\\" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is \\"free\\" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be \\"well read\\"!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I purchased this copy of Emma and it was the first time I read it. The second Jane Austen I've read. I must say that I enjoyed Emma much more than Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the humor in Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"When Jane Austen sat down to write Emma, she had a tall order. Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"By E.G. (AP)\\"Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken...\\" This was a hard lesson for twenty-one year old Emma Woodhouse to come by. Emma takes on the role of a matchmaker, believing it is in her power to arrange marriages. Predictably, Emma eventually fails at her task. Failure causes Emma to lose innocence and become less ignorant to what in fact she can control.Emma is of a rich family; she's good looking, and she's clever. Emma is held in awe by most, especially her father who believes she is flawless. With such qualities and ideals at her disposal, Emma has very little to distress or vex her. The same circumstances convince her that she will never marry and promote naivete making reality a hard concept for Emma to grasp.Emma lacks knowledge of societal expectations especially where marriage is concerned. Taking place during the Victorian time period, one was expected to marry inside his class. Emma doesn't grasp this ideal which leads to failure and disappointment in her pursuit of making matches.Emma tries to acquaint Mr. Knightley with Harriet and to a certain extent, Jane. Emma discovers that she's once again led herself and Harriet astray. This instance in the book along with the knowledge that Mr. Knightley is one of few that can see faults in Emma, foreshadows an eventual change in plot. This is also the point in the story that a change in Emma's character becomes evident.When reading Emma, allow yourself plenty of time. There are many intricate details Involving who's interested in who that are interwoven into the plot and would be easy to pass by if not reading leisurely. It may be helpful to read a passage twice if you find yourself questioning what just took place. In order to fully enjoy the story; don't hurry through the book.A few of the characters have similar names. Sometimes the only thing separating one person from another is a subtle Miss or Ms. This can be frustrating if you don't fully grasp whom the book is speaking of. Again, read slowly and reread a passage if there's confusion about who the talked of subject is.Some characters are void of the story for an extensive amount of the book. This is also frustrating, as it may be hard to recall what role the character plays. It's beneficial to jot down character names and a few descriptors about them so when they reappear, their role can be recalled. Or, you may want to take time to flip back in the book and reread the scene in which they first appeared.Jane Austen did an exceptional job of writing satirically in order to portray silly ideals that Emma and society held. The standards for which marriages were arranged by become superficial and absurd through Austen's diction. Because it is apparent to the reader that Emma is chasing a dead end with her beliefs of who has taken interest in who, it's humorous when Emma comes to this realization herself. Austen chose exaggerated adjectives of perfection to describe Emma this creates a snicker because obviously Emma is not perfect but rather nave.Emma recalls memories of high school dance date set-ups that went wrong. It's comical to think back on either playing the role of matchmaker or having been the victim of a matchmaker when the quest for a date to the homecoming dance or prom is thrown into full effect. Most times the involvement of a third party misconstrues things much like Emma did. Feelings can be hurt similar to those of the characters in Emma making the matchmaker feel foolish but hopefully providing a lesson to all involved."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a great story, the heroine, depicted to be a selfish woman, who has been raised to believe she has no flaws, shows us through the book, how she learns tobe a woman that many people would dream to be. She shows true nature, adn acts as any human would. Her ongoing task to matchmake all her friends end in disaster, but in the end all is well. She handles her problems as one should, adn learns not to think so highly of herself. People say that it is too &quot;worldy&quot; but the book is one of the classics, Jane Austen outdid herself, this is my favourite Jane Austen book, it shows us that we all have flaws,a d that no one is ever perfect."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I really thought this book was wonderful! It was the first Jane Austen book I've read and I loved it! It was easy for me to keep the characters staight because I saw the movie first but totally enjoyed it the book too. Most people who gave this book a bad review called it, &quot;boring&quot;. One thing you should know: Jane Austen is not a writer of action novels. She likes to spread the story out. For anyone who have read her other novels, you know what I mean. If you found this boring, you should wait until your a little older to read this one. Although I like P&amp;P better, this was definatly not a bad book if your in the right mode to read it."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I love this book because it's timeless. True, it's set in the 1800's, but this book could have been written today. I know it's hard to sympathize with Emma, but deep down she just wants to see everyone happy. I love the part where she finds her own match right under her nose. I recommend this book to everyone who likes historical romances."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm just wondering what kind of a world those clueless people live in, to think Jane Austen is robbing some 90s movie of its story?"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"On a personal note I loved the book as I do all other Jane Austen classics, but I'm not going to trash anyone else's opinion. No one book can ever be loved by everyone. For other readers that enjoyed this as much as I did don't get upset when others don't like it, they just don't WANT to have to translate the different dialect from a different country over a century ago. It's not that they can't, but the more modern setting suits them better. It is true you do have to be a serious reader to get through this novel. If you loose hope in the first few chapters you're not giving it enough time, at this point you've just been introduced to the characters, dialect, and culture of these people. The first 4 or 5 chapters are the hardest, but that's because you're having to learn so much with out any aids to guide you. For everyone who did not enjoy this no one should scoff at your taste, but in the future don't trash mine either. We have different taste neither is betteror worse, just different. For anyone interested, yes, their is a plot but you have to understand Jane Austen's style to see it. If you like a challenge and you like to have your heart pounding in tune with the characters this is a book for you. Bye the way, I am now 16 but I read three of Jane Austen's novels as a freshmen in high school. It's not impossible but it's not easy either.I also recomend &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot; also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"As one of the few teenagers who will read Emma voluntarily, I'd just like to say that, thought the length is daunting, I loved reading it all the way through.

Dominating the novel is the character of Emma Woodhouse--vital, Interesting, complex, and predisposed to playing power games with other people's emotions. Austen called her a heroine &quot;no one but myself would like,&quot; but she endures as one of Austen's immortal creations. Charting how Emma's disastrous foray as a matchmaker precipitates a crisis in the small provincial world of Highbury, and in her own heart, this novel of self-deceit and self-discovery sparkles with intelligence, wit, and irony. In fact, as critics say,Emma is indeed a fine piece of work which was was written, surprisingly, by someone who lived a rather secluded life. It has all the Austen trademarks, as the constant concern over marriage and social status, which was a poignant and true characteristic of her time."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen was a truly gifted author whose simple stories, memorable characters, and insights into human nature make her writings as relevant today as they were in the early 1800's.Emma is the story of an attractive and fortunate young woman who has never had anything really bad happen in her life, and who believes herself to be much more wise and worldly than she actually is. For one who has led such a sheltered existence, never leaving home or intending to marry, Emma believes herself possessed of incredible powers of perception and feels that she knows what is best for those she loves far better than they could possibly know for themselves. It is this belief of hers that causes her to meddle in the affairs of those close to her, creating chaos, confusion, and misunderstandings everywhere. Her well-intentioned interference produes comical results and eventually teaches her a valuable lession about minding one's own beeswax.I was sorry to see this book end"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I have read few books written with such a brilliant pen. There is more than a touch of sarcasm when Austen writes of society, but this is perhaps what keeps this book so alive. It is surprising how little society has really changed since the Victorian era. Emma comes across as a spoilt child, but lovable, as there is a shade of Emma in all of us. We all share the need to be involved in everything, and meddle with everyone's affairs, and there is a tale of unrequited love in all of our histories, even for a short time. I have not yet seen the film, as I am not sure of whether or not this would spoil it, as though there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Hollywood, Jane Austen should be present to direct it"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma is the story of a young woman who at first seems to be self-indulgent and egotistical.

But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;) can match the high standards set by &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line.

She is a wonderful narrator. You might wanna check out Pride and Prejudice, which I loved.

Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma.Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love.In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams.In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a great classic novel and probably one of Jane Austen's best! If you like this book I also suggest the wonderful movie adaptations. Both the one starring Gwynneth Paltrow and the one starring Kate Beckinsale are quite lovely!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress ir vex her.\\"So begins Jane Austen's classic novel of the mishaps of matchmaking. Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess.The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma.Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being. She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well. For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result. Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.Of course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\" The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815.

Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma.

Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings.

Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

It is a long book, but worth every page."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Just to note: This review is of the Almost Sunday Publishing kindle edition.If you are like me, you want to buy books at the cheapest price you can get, while still getting good quality. Good news! The kindle version of this book is flawless as far as I can tell. It is simply the text, with chapters that you can jump to. There are NO annoying pictures among the text at all.The story itself is VERY good, and easy to read even though it was written over 200 years ago. I found it very amusing to read Emma's antics, and I could definitely relate to her and the other characters. For more on the plot, you can easy look at the other versions.The bottom-line is if you are looking for Austen for a low price, this one is the way to go!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Out of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters. The wonders, complications, and misunderstandings of love and marriage are told brilliantly in this entertaining novel!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"A wonderful read! This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty. And why not, since she is of a social standing where she feels she's entitled to look down on those inferior to her position. Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Siri Amster- OlszewskiAugust 24, 2006Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well. The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those timesI was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time. It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage. For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love. In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status. One could not marry below their status. Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I admit, it has been a few years since I read Emma. I haven't gotten to read the rest of Austen's works (yet!), but I think she is a fine writer. As a writer, that's a high compliment. I don't mean to say she's, well, fine.. I mean she is fine and honed and respectable.. and great.I picked this book up at my library when I was tired of random teen angst-based novels about first boyfriends and horrible pasts. I wanted something written with real language, with a style. I wanted something old and truly good, like the classics I had read and been read as a young child. I wanted something with SUBSTANCE.Because of this, it took me awhile to get back in the habit of really reading. For a week or so, Emma lay in a drawer, only partway read. It was difficult not to skim and my head would swim with the small print and dark pages. I lamented, but shrugged it off as life got busy.I came out of the shower one day, with an urge to get back into it, and ended up standing, hair wet, in front of my dresser, book rooted up out of the confines of my underthings, and wasting time.I read it constantly until I finished it, as I always do when reading a new book, but this one was different. This one invoked a hunger in me, and I was definitely satisfied when it came to an end.The constant little subplots and dramas surrounding arrogant, but rather good-natured Emma, the engaging characters, with such distinct and memorable personalities, and the wonderful twist of the ending (everyone else says they were so sure, but I, for one, was surprised, I admit) were all...wonderful. Austen is, I say again, a fine writer, and no wonder she is of the classics.I have heard, as well, that she did not think anyone else would love Emma. I ask, how could you not? The people who are so vehement about her flaws clearly have many of the same. She is one of the most enjoyable heroines I have had the pleasure of visiting, among such \\"flawed\\" characters as Anne Shirley (her incessant daydreaming and such a temper! ;), in all my years of reading. And that's a very long time."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen perfects the art of character development in Emma. The long, twisted plot carefully and slowly develops each character using rich detail that makes the characters come alive with personality. Without the rich detail and character development, I do not feel this book would have stood the test of time and become the classic that it is. Emma is a heart-warming book with enough orneriness mixed in to make it amusing."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I love this book, it is a fun must read if you love Jane Austen's writing.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma prides herself on her matchmaking ability. The happiness of the marriage of her former governess is her obvious proof. When she takes on Harriet Smith as her charge and determines to find the perfect match for her, her attempts fail time and time again. Disappointed in the outcome of her attempts, she resolves to only contribute to Harriet's happiness as her friend. In the end, when it seems that a match for Harriet may finally be made between Harriet and Mr. Knightley, only then does Emma realize the truth she has denied for so long and the folly of what she worked so hard for may cost her heart.Emma is a classic by Jane Austen and this is my first time reading one of Austen's works. I certainly understand why the book is considered a classic. Austen engages the reader who wonders about the outcome until the very end. The style in which it is written requires thought and time to truly understand the story. It is definitely not one that can be read through at a high speed and still comprehended at a high level.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Like all Jane Austen's works, Emma is a tale of self-discovery. Emma Woodhouse is used to her position of consequence as mistress of her widowed father's house, and proud lady of an old, respected family. She over-estimates her own power and importance, running into trouble when she tries to govern the affairs of her neighbors. Mr. Knightly, brother of her sister's husband, scolds and chides while her senile daddy worries more about her staying up too late, or dancing in a crowded room. Mr. Knightly is always right, as, over and over, the strong-willed Emma is forced to admit; but the reformation of her ideas may be too late in coming. He goes away to London just when she realizes she cannot be happy without first place in his heart. A must read for all fans of classic literature."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is memorable as the embodiement of reason. Harriet is fine as the poor girl caught in the middle. If you like this book, I suggest the movie with Kate Beckingsale as Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma was a very well written book in the Victorian era.

Emma is very much like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility in style. The characters are beautifully developed as with Austen's other novels. There may be a bit too much emphasis on understanding one's place in society. Emma's pickings become very slim making her eventual engagement predictable, and her attempt to play matchmaker and improve a friend's standing is met with disastrous results.

For the price, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover. In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate. Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma. She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong. And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father. To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking. She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage. Irony abounds.This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials. The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny. The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples. The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private. The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel. The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced. The plotting is intricate. Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book. The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud. This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book. The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye. Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me. Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written. In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together. Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than &quot;Emma&quot;, and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, &quot;Emma&quot; is a waste."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Having been forced to read &quot;Emma&quot; for an English Literature course, I feel that I know as much about it as anyone else, if not more so. &quot;Emma&quot; is nothing more than a trashy romance, like the rest of Jane Austen's novels. We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what? Anyone who describes an Austen novel as a &quot;classic&quot;, particualy this one, needs their head examined. She is an olden days Jackie Collins, whose fancy language seems to have deluded some into believing that she is something which she certianly is not."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I am not going to read through all the reviews to see if anyone had the same feeling I did when reading \\"Emma.\\" I had just read six T.

One \\"struggles\\" to decipher who, where, and when. This is much more than a comedy of manners. Holmes would have been baffled by the twists and turns, the hints and allusions; and that is what made it so difficult to put this novel down. A \\"whodunit\\", if ever there was one.

I have never read Jane Austen before so having it for free is just so convenient! I highly recommend this book. The quality in my kindle is also really good."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Among fans of Jane Austen in the U.S., most may not recognize Juliet Stevenson by name; however, they will certainly recognize her from her photograph as \\"Mrs. Elton\\" in the film adaptation of Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and therefore might be inclined to dismiss a reading of Emma by the deplorable Mrs. Elton. Big mistake. Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse. As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters. She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_. Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. We who love reading these treasures by Jane Austen are, therefore, in very good hands when listening to these unabridged audio versions."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Yet another charming & beautifully published book. If you have enjoyed her other writings you will like this one as well. Thank you, Jane Austen, for your legacy! Book arrived as described (brand new, perfect condition)"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I thought Emma was a deligtful book with a great ending i knew it would end that way but it was fun to read and jane austen is now my hero."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'.

It makes me cry everytime I finish it, because of The beautiful artwork of Austen's writing. Making all of Emma's mistakes seem so real, and her triphums seems as though they are your's. I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters. Thought it always finishes with a happy ending, it gives hope that even as clueless (not meant to be a pun) as Emma is and how many stupid mistakes she made her efforts are rewarded with all of her matchmaking adventures coming to an end and everyone who was caught in the confusing love web being freed."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Marvelous!

She has a kind, loving heart, and really wants to do good, but makes a tangle of everybody's lives, including her own.

The unabridged book is slightly complicated (such as old-fashioned language) but if you savor it slowly it is well worth it.

Jane Austen created a charming and hilarious heroine in Emma. The comic timing and great characterization proves that Austen was -- and still is -- the most sought-after and influential author ever! (Just look at the work of Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes and other female authors of this era.)Emma is a force to be reckoned with. She takes it upon herself to play the role of Cupid. She chooses her candidates according to social status, age, charm, etc. The irony, of course, is that Emma doesn't have a lover of her own. What happens when one of her conquests as Cupid goes terribly wrong? And will Emma find her own knight of shining armor? This is one of the funniest situations in the book.If you love Jane Austen, and if you haven't read this novel, please do!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma. Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands. Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances. As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved. Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with. For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home. In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk. Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages. Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today. It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction. Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"How could Jane Austen have thought that the character of Emma would please no one but the author?I was charmed to enter Emma's world, amused by her wit, stunned by her complacency, sympathetic when she made her mistakes. I finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.I had seen the movie version starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.There has been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today. After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated, immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that exist among all people, no matter the time or place."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; is definitely Jane Austen's best and most humorous book. The quirky characters, comic faux pas, and Emma's adventures in matchmaking keep you very entertained. Although it's funny, the vocabulary can be challenging.

Emma is extremely slow to begin with though it picks up about half way through. The story centers on Emma Woodhouse, the unmarried daughter of a man obsessed with ailments to be potentially caught from drafts, rich foods and just about anything that is part of ordinary life. Consequently he does not go out (as a rule) and depends on Emma substantially for companionship and general well being. Despite his eccentricities, he is well loved by the community and is a very genial character. Emma, resolved not to marry, takes up matchmaking after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries friend and neighbor, Mr. Weston and Emma feels that she had contributed to making the happy union come about. Against the advice of family friend and mentor, Mr. Knightly, she \\"takes under her wing\\" a young girl at the local school to groom and bring out into good society in hopes of finding her a husband - specifically Mr. Elton of the vicarage. Despite her unknown parentage and lack of good expectations, Emma convinces the girl, Harriet Smith, to aim high in her expectations of a husband and to reject the advances of those of her natural social set in preference for a gentleman.This goes on for so long that I was convinced that this was going to be the whole of the book. Joyfully, though, the Mr. Elton angle blows up catastrophically and simultaneously several more interesting characters are introduced. The icily reserved Jane Fairfax comes to visit her grandmother and aunt before hiring out as a governess. Though she had been taken in by the Campbells and raised very genteelly along side their own daughter, she has no fortune of her own. The same age as Emma, they are expected to be fast friends but Emma's resentments of Jane's superior abilities and deportment do not bode well for this. Then Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother's death, comes to meet his new stepmother and makes a splash in Highbury society. Mrs. Weston has designs for Emma and Frank. Emma meanwhile has designs for Harriet and Frank. No one can figure out Jane's designs though Emma suspects improper attachments between her and her benefactor's daughter's new husband. Mr. Elton then brings in a new wife whose forceful manner and arrogant air threaten to turn everything upside down against Emma when Mrs. Elton tries to force a relationship as Jane's benefactress. Similarities between Emma's presumptions with Harriet and Mrs. Elton's presumptuous behavior with Jane are unavoidable and provide a relatively subtle irony.In this last half as the intrigues play out, the story takes on the flavor of Pride and Prejudice and becomes infinitely more interesting. Though the first part was slow, it did serve to really build the character of Emma and she becomes very real through her actions in the second half. It also serves to humanize Mrs. Elton's character to some extent while softening Emma's.This really is a very, very good book and I would have given it 5 stars except for how slow it was in the first half. A patient reader will enjoy this but readers who don't have patience with character studies or slow bits would do better to read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read another one of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &quot;tangle&quot; of plot than Pride &amp; P/Sense &amp; S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &quot;heroines&quot; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader.I highly recommend reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people. Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking. Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma. The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband. Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel. Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters. By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting. For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times. Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions. Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes. In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her. Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot. For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together. Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters. Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet. However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma. Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage. Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups. However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with. Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee. Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's. The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I loved Emma by Jane Austen. I think that the best aspect of Austen's writing is her witty irony that is featured in all of her books. I thought that Emma was a touching and funny story about a young woman whose lot in life is to play the matchmaker. She tries to fix the world to her own liking, but it does not work. Finally, she stops being so critical and realizes what is standing right in front of her. If you enjoy the book (which I think you will), buy or rent the movie starring Gywneth Paltrow. It is just as funny as the book. If that is not your fancied genre, check out Clueless, starring Alicia Silverstone. It is loosely based on the novel and also very funny, with a modern twist."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it.. After reading all of Nicholas Sparks novels, I decided to go in a different direction and read some classics.. I decided upon Jane Austen after reading reviews of her novels.. So I bought Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma.. I choose Emma to read first because I thought it would be less interesting than the others.. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this book, it's the best novel I have ever read.. Now I fear that the others will not be nearly as good as this one.. I agree with the others that the beginning is rather slow, but it picks up towards the middle so just stick with it! You will not be sorry.. I have no other words to describe this book other than amazing!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was a wonderful book. I think it gives Pride and Prejudice a run for its money because you get to see Emma grow as a person from being arragont to being kind.Now here is a basic Readers' Digest summary. Emma Woodhouse, a bright and wealthy young woman, and her father lose Emma's governess, Mrs. Weston(\\"poor miss Taylor\\") because she has gotten married. Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself. She then wants to be a matchmaker. However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother. The two become good friends. Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet. Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town. Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town. Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma. Many speculate the two as a perfect match. While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it. I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening! So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me. There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I actually saw the film (with Paltrow as Emma) before reading the book and I must say, that I am glad that the movie was very true to the novel because I adore the movie. I was actually surprised that the book was so similar. It features one of my favorite Jane Austen characters, Emma of course. She is a joy to read about. The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times. Austen's longest work is an entertaining romp that shows what happens when one young girl gets too involved in the affections of (and between) others. Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen is one of the greatest women writers in history, and Emma ranks among her best. The characters are rich and varied. For anyone with an interest in Victorian literature, Emma is sure to be a hit."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I tried to read this book when I was in middle school and quickly returned it to the shelf when I found it slow and boring. I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before. \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions. Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned. Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship.I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned. Maybe after I've read some more of her novels I won't value \\"Emma\\" as highly, but for now, this novel is high up on my list, and I enthusiastically reccomend it."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women. All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world. This book is a bit boring and dry in the sense that everything is just always so beautifully fitting. Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities.At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it. The book is well written and clearly at a 187 years old, has stood the test of time. Nonetheless, at this stage in my life I was not motivated to finish the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Received my book 2-3 days after I purchased it! It is in even better shape that I thought it would be in, love it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Yet another solid Jane Austen classic.

I enjoyed the book, Emma, it takes me into an older, different era where gentility still existed. Refinement used to be an art."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I don't know what it is about Jane Austen's novels, but I've read two of them now and I find that I really do enjoy them. The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!! A wonderful story which held my attention from beginning to end. I read it on my kindle and could not put it down. The recent movie follows it very faithfully."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???) but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance, but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her. I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself. I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book. I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read. The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is. She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us. She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters. Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular. I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"It was hard to like the main character but it is supposed to be. I liked her father enough to make up for it. Good book very well written but I think it will not last in my mind like P&P."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she really loved it. The binding and printing is really beautiful and they look great on a shelf. Probably ok to read as well."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice. The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, &quot;flawed.&quot;The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were &quot;forced&quot; to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character &quot;Emma&quot; has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen's Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice. Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Highbury. She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman's journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone's lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen's characterisation is delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Dickens' characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen's dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED.

Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N; doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.SPOILER WARNINGOne of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Emma is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Emma, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma (Barnes & Noble Classics)Great Book if you like the classics as I do. Quality of the pages is very good (acid free should you wish to keep it and, smooth texture)."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly \`helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together.Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that.This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Maybe it was the way Jane Austen drew the reader into the story, or possibly the twists and turns of the plot, but whatever it was to add the extra flavor it worked.

It has a way of making it an impossible task to put it down. This story stands the tests of time and will surely work it's way into the hearts of millions more.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I can't remember the last book I disliked as much as I dislike Emma. GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen has a lot of fans. I am one of them. My wife is another. People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not. This is as it should be. We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though. It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel. This is also only right.The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works. Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!Yes, we are a family torn asunder. My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here. I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order. I bought this one for her.For the asking price of this book, including S&H;, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it. It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present. I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent! Trust me...I know about such things. Hey folks, this is not advertized nor is it a leather bound first edition! This is a workable, useful book for everyday use.Now I have both this work and P&P; down loaded to my Kindle. The chances of my wife ever using one of these reading machines are as about as likely as pigs flying next mayday. It ain't going to happen. Therefore, she now has a new hardback book; one that will quite likely outlast both of us; It did not cost me a fortune. She can read her copy; I can read mine and the war between us that has been going on since we were in our early teens can continue.Bottom line...this is a good buy.

Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in herTime to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography(a wonderful piece of writing too). And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her.

It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose. It has a poetic texture. Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry. The effect is immensely satisfying.She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively. Her main focus is on character. She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue. This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and televisionEmma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws. The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers. In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises. Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all. The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused.

The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period. Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot.

She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life. Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband. The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply. Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father. Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned. The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors. Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status. Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction. Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury. Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way. The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications. Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith. She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied. The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts. Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley. Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley. Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith. Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun.

In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it.

People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about.

The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc. Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama.

You can never tire of a truly well written book like her writing of Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"For some reason, I always think of Emma as my least favorite Austen, but I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it. Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings. Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto.

While Emma isn't as popular as my personal favorite Pride and Prejudice, I believe that Emma is so popular, and can be considered \\"literature\\" (that is, a piece of art) because the story really has a universal quality to it. The fact that we can relate to the situations and characters in Emma some 300 years later is what makes it seem so timeless, and why the Emma movie with a \\"modern twist\\", Clueless, was so wildly successful. When you compare both Emma and Clueless they show how little has changed and that privileged teenagers (and young adults) will find themselves in the same situations and social patterns, whether they are in 19th century England or 21st century America.Of course, while the wealthy and bored teenagers in Clueless might try to set up their friends on dates, the stakes were a bit higher in Emma. Emma (the heroine) attempts to match her new friend Harriet Smith with the new minister Mr. Elton not just for dating, but for marriage as long as they both shall live (remember, divorce was rare, if not nonexistent in early 19th century Britain.) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when Mr. Elton becomes interested in Emma, not Harriet. The problem was that Emma (already conceited because she successfully \\"guessed well\\" when she matched her tutor Ms. Taylor with a local widower Mr. Weston) failed to get to know Harriet and Mr. Elton well enough to figure out if they were, in fact, right for each other. Emma shows her class-snobbery when she (through some very adolescent mind games) convinces Harriet to reject the proposal that she receives from a local farmer (Mr. Martin, the man Harriet likes and eventually falls in love with), in the hopes that Mr. Elton will propose. Emma was too self-centered and (to steal the phrase from Amy Heckerling) clueless to notice that Mr. Elton was not, in fact, interested in Harriet, but in herself--a fact that leads to Harriet's heartbreak. Of course, this is only one part of the multi-faceted story that Jane Austen created about the life of a \\"handsome, clever and rich\\" woman living in Highbury, England, but it gives you a sense of the life and times of Ms. Emma Woodhouse (as we see them in the book)Fortunately, all is well in the end when Emma learns her lesson about matchmaking and toying with emotions and discovers that she loves her brother-in-law and well loved family friend Mr. Knightly. This is a classic \\"happy ending by way of falling in love with the best friend that you had all along,\\" but with a slightly dated feel. First, he is sixteen years older than her and he, in a way, helped to raise her (at least, in principles). The fact that he admits openly to having been \\"in love with (her) ever since (she) was thirteen at least,\\" slightly bothered me. Who, in the 21st century, would admit to having a crush on their 13 year old sister-in-law? In the context and time of the novel it's romantic. Now Mr. Knightly might be described as a pedophile. However, the dated dialogue (like the above) is the only qualm I had about the book, and I hope that it doesn't discourage anyone from reading Emma. Overall, I would recommend this book to any Clueless fan, romantic-comedy fan, or anyone who wants to read the wonderfully universal writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Very much like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Emma, a novel by Jane Austen, is a tale of confusion and intrigue over the universal topic of love. The reader's feelings of befuddlement and captivation, while nonexistent at the beginning of the novel, will grow exponentially until the climax. At the end of the novel, everything finally makes sense and the characters live on happily ever after. This is a very satisfying ending, clearing up all earlier confusion, although it leaves little room for wonder and thought after the reader has finished the book. Though I found this novel very confusing, and therefore unenjoyable at times, the intrigue and vivid setting and characterization overpowered my initial dislike. I would recommend Emma, to seventh through ninth grade students who are capable of deciphering meaning from complicated words and are able to pick out the essential subject matter of passages that do not state the meaning strait out. Readers will enjoy the frenzied, almost comical, characters in all their confusion over who loves whom, as well as all the wonderful descriptions, and the satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice.

I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV. Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\" In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly.

She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making. By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions. Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided. The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly. They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses.Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her. Comical witticisms pervade the novel. The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction. The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character. Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches. In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma. I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. Both of these paled in comparison to Emma. I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief. She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her. She was great because of her fallibility. Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions.The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets. It is more subtle and underplayed. It is above all a story about society. I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period. Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid. Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony. This explained the emphasis on connections.The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly. He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma. It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating. Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong. I wanted her to be right for once and laugh at him for being precocious. This, of course, never happened. Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire. If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love. At any rate.&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so. In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable. She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all. Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor. Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma. Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur. Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes. That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept. The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury. Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel! One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether. Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable. This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"The problem is that Jane Austen is so popular - her books are the only 200 year old novels to stay in the Amazon top 5000- that people come to her expecting easy reading. This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them. When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;. Jane Fairfax's father is killed in action (presumably against Napoleon - or maybe the Americans) Harriet Smith is the daughter of a tradesman decent enough to support her but not married to her mother. Women have no careers open to them and totter on the edge of poverty unless they inherit money or marry. An old man with rheumatism has to apply for parish aid."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"&quot;And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&quot; said Emma, &quot;and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&quot;&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!&quot; -Jane Austen, EmmaThe edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted by Josef Stieler. So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ? Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted courtships, so popular among all readers ? We well understand why she should have been a favorite of Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ? These questions are directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have political ramifications ? The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my favorite of her novels.At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless, which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever written. Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike. The plot of the tale is presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite eschewing the idea of marriage for herself. In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband. There follow the expected misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom (read Orrin's review). Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's decision-making. Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy requires to function smoothly. Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting with their best interests at heart. There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators intended.The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists. They decry the system of oppression which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance. In reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal. In its own way Emma is as stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon. That her books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Clueless is a lot like Emma. The only difference is that Emma is a story written in 1816, and Clueless is, like, a totally 90's story. I didn't know that Clueless was an adaptation of the classic novel until I read an article, and hey, the writer did a good job of updating Emma. 'Course, both Emma and Clueless are terrific and funny stories about the trials and triabulations of mediocre matchmakers. Additionally, I think Austen does a great job of creating characters that you love and hate with a passion. This is one of the funniest novels that has been written by Jane Austen. I like Emma, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the story upon which Clueless was based."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This book is one of many by Jane Austen that will put you into a total field of happiness. Emma's perilous journey towards understanding herself and her own wrong doings is funny and down to earth. The English is a bit hard to read but once you get into the book, the English becomes easy to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I enjoyed the quaintness of Emma's society. The heroine, Emma, was hilarious, especially when her schemes backfired. However, Austen's EMMA resembles modern day soap operas. As an example the heartbreaks of Harriet and the maliciousness of Mrs. Elton can be found on any episode of _The Young and the Restless_(granted, though, without the strong sexual content). Just like a soap opera, EMMA and the contents wherein get tedious. Suggestion to the would-be reader: don't linger in Emma's world for too long; the story will be better if done so."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm writing in reference to the Kindle version of this book. Since I like the book itself, I gave 2 stars; however, this version was lacking in extras. I was seriously disappointed to find no footnotes, no introduction, no nothing.

I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I guess I am an exception. I found the book, Emma, to be overly long and tiresome. The book focuses mostly on social calls between Emma and her neighbors and their dialogue. Emma is just so snobbish and aware of her high status that it was hard to find her likeable at first. I found myself liking her more towards the end of the book as she saw the error of her ways. I loved Pride and Prejudice...but this book just didn't really click with me."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England. Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful. Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic. Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous. Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times. Of course in the end it all comes out well but it is a wonderful ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I downloaded Emma for free on my kindle from amazon. This book is about Emma a vain wealthy and confident young woman who lives in a small town in Highbury, England. She cares for her father who is worried that she is not going to get married. She plays match maker for her friends and acquaintances by setting them up with different suitors. Emma realize that her matchmaking skills was not good and cause a lot of grief. So she vowed never to get marry, but ended getting married to a very unexpected person .This book is a typical romance comedy friction novel. It started of slow and then the pace pick back up again. You will see Emma finding herself and becoming a better person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"A lot of people have said that Emma is one of their favorite books but I would have to differ. This book put me to sleep every time I picked it up. It was dull and boring, this is only my opinion. I would not let this book effect and make me not want to read Jane Austen again. Since it is only one book out of many of hers. I felt this book was for a different crowd of people. Maybe I should have waited till I was older and grasped the concept more.Miss. Taylor Emma's good friend and governess get's married and move's out. Emma has no clue what to do with herself. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, gets upset and thinks Miss. Taylor now known as Mrs. Weston is making a huge mistake of leaving the family and things will never be the same without her living at the house. Emma then meets a girl named Harriet Smith, who is not as smart as Emma but she likes how she is willing to learn and listen to what she had to say. They went on daily walks around the town. Mr. Martin a very dull farmer that Emma's brother-in-law works proposes to Harriett who has had a crush on him before Emma tried to set her up with Mr. Elton. Emma influences her to refuse the offer of marriage, so she does. This was before n and got to know each other very well.Emma thinks she can match anyone up with love, if they gave her a chance. She herself has vowed to remain single. She tries to set Harriet, up with Mr. Elton, but Mr. Elton likes Emma instead of Harriet and wants to marry her. Emma refuses and Mr. Elton leaves and gets married to some person who nobody thinks is worthy of him. When Emma finds out Mr. Elton got married she doesn't want Harriet to find out since she is still hung up on him they found out Mr. Elton had married. Emma is very controlling when it comes to love, and this is one reason why I didn't like the book she aggravated me.Mrs. Weston's stepson is coming she is nervous he won't like her and confides in Emma. Emma is out for a carriage ride and she gets stuck. Mr. Churchill Mr. Weston's son comes and helps her get out, he doesn't tell her who he is till after and she is amazed by how good looking he is. She is confused with hr feelings for him after that. She thinks she may be in love but she doesn't feel like she is. Mr. Churchill likes a woman named Jane who is staying with Miss. Bates, a dear friend of Emma. Emma doesn't really like Jane since she always has one over her. For example at a party that was thrown they asked Emma if she would like to play the piano, when she is done Jane is asked to play the piano and everyone loved Jane's when people only like Emma's performance.At a picnic with Jane, Mr. Churchill, Miss. Bates, Mr. Elton, his wife, and Mr. Knightly, Emma's very good friend. Emma insults her friend, Miss. Bates. Mr. Knightly tells Emma off. Emma realizes she loves Mr. Knightly but is worried he loves Harriet. They secretly have feelings for each other but neither of them do anything. Finally they do confess there feelings and they get engaged. Harriet ends up with Mr. Martin and Mr. Churchill ends up with Jane.Mrs. Weston becomes pregnant and Emma does not want anyone to know about her and Mr. Knightly's engagement until the baby is born. Jane and Mr. Churchill are also keeping their engagement a secret.I couldn't really relate to this book. I would have done a lot of things different then what she did. For starters I would not have gone and meddled into every ones love life. Its their life and people need to respect that and not mess with it. I understand she thought she was helping everyone but truth be told she wasn't and it just was annoying to see how she kept going off and doing that throughout the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"While this isn't the only great narration of \\"Emma\\" available, I've enjoyed it for years.

I had to watch the movie to understand who certian people were but the book is even better. She is wity and funny.

Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works. Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer. Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire. Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived. In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates. Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society. Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live. This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance. Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money. It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority. I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable. I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma. I would most certainly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping. I am enjoying this book, what a great read! Thank you."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma was the first Jane Austen book I've ever read &, originally, I liked it much more than Pride And Prejudice but I've since changed my mind. While I love this book, it's not my favorite anymore.Emma is such a fun character because she is so sure that what she's doing is right when all the while she's just making a mess of things. The best part about her is that when she sees that she is wrong, she can laugh at herself & learn from her mistakes.Mr. Knightly is one of my favorite Austen characters. His name says it all, \\"knightly.\\" He is the perfect gentlemen...possibly moreso than Mr. Darcy, even.The characters in this book, as in all Jane Austen books, represent both the follies & goodness in human nature, which is what I love about her writing. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend for anyone new to Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married. As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage. Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life. Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma. She knows what's best for everyone around. Emma fancies herself a matchmaker. In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess. And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying. She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate. She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers. What more could she want? But Harriet needs Mr. Elton. A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates. Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories. The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable. Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing. She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her. Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course. Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story. The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years. (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.) It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors. Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star. That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book. The rest is wonderful. You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men. Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course. He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth). If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start. You won't be able to resist reading her five other books. I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around. Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.I found this novel incredibly amusing! Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not the same Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature.

'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes! The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her. If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both \`EMMA' and \`PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time. In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking. She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there. Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady. There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case. Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events. One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed. Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

Her complementary pace actually improves the listeners' appreciation of Austen's comedic plot. Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time. Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance. Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation. In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values. Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code.The very fact that Emma is looking for \`would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly. Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride. Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy. Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped.Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception. While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a \`know-all' attitude. She is utterly self-important and presuming. She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill. She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse. Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference. Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self.Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships. Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage.Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\". But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies. Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma. And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to \`socially inferior' people. Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery. She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation. She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth. In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way.Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans. We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are. For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations. The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system. The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator.Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values. These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption. It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being. Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reasonRonald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on the social conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change - love, pride, marriage, status and money.Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool. the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now. Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions. though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book. i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then. it's amusing, witty, and shocking. really great book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm in the fellowship of the \\"unashamed.\\" That is, I'm a whole-hearted MALE fan of all things Austen. It all began when I found my daughter's dusty college copy of Emma from our library because I was bored and could not find anything else to read. After struggling through the first 100 pages and trying to make sense of Miss Austen's enormous character list, I was hooked. What hooked me? First and formost was the very intertwined plot, much like a romantic \\"whodunit\\" or \\"who's gonna do it\\" mystery. The plot thickens with subtle clues as to who loves whom and the comedy surrounding the heroine's naive' and fumbling attempts to become a matchmaker to anyone in her circle that is marriage material. Never in my life have I read such succulent and appropriate dialogue. I was so enthralled I literally roared through the book to find out what was going to happen next. A second reading is mandatory for the first-timer because part of Miss Austen's genius is that a more deliberate reading mines the depths for the clues that lie beneath the surface of the story. Like the tip of an iceberg, the reader can storm through the book and enjoy it thoroughly; then do a re-read and luxuriate on how much richness and delicate detail lie below the surface. I was so caught up that I found myself talking to the characters alternately encouraging them and warning them on what they were scheming. The heroine Emma is one of the most charming, yet frustrating heroines in all of English literature. Give it a \\"go\\" as the English would say!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I've read it a million times, it was purchased as a gift for someone; but, since I never received the other two books, I didn't bother giving it."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This book arrived new and in good condition.

The book is timeless and the needlework cover will be as well. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece. I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read. As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease. It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.As the volume chapters are split, volume one makes for a very interesting read, as divided in between the chapters, we're almost immediately introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, and Emma's designs on how she plans to interfere in Harriet's relationship, and make her wed mr Elton, of Emma's choice, not mr Martin, of Harriet's choice. As she breaks up Harriet's relationship with mr Martin, we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but with Emma a lot less, and our opinion of her schemes, makes readers feel critical of her.In volume two, we sympathise with Emma a lot less than we are critical of her. On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one. By volume three, we get a better understanding of volume two, and the themes eventually link together, into something more conclusive. On first read, however, volume two can get quite tedious, and more put-downable as readers opinion grows colder towards Emma, because of how unfairly she breaks down Harriet's relationship, and also because of her prejudices towards miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.By volume three, our understanding of Emma grown warmer, as her feelings towards not wanting to ever be married begins to change, as her understanding of mr Frank Chruchill, and mr George Knightley begins to change. She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men. By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax, and we are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father was to a certain degree against this union of the two, believing that Emma had vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after Woodhouse, and not leave.If there were any further protests to the conclusion of who got married or not, or if there were ever any intentions for the centreing married couples to divorce, this is not identitifien by the author, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, centred about the characters getting married, and divorce is never a theme that has ever been explored in Austen's novels, even in less happier, eccentric, or less committed relationship.Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes in volume three."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

It was actually one of the reasons I had delayed so long to start another by Austen for though I had heard great things about \\"Emma\\" (as well as others) I found myself very reluctant to start for fear of being disappointed. I was very bull headed in believing I would not like Emma the main character going into the story because I hate when female characters for lack of a better word \\"meddle\\" in other characters business. Boy was I wrong.I came to adore Emma and only wish I had not gone into the book so stubborn to dislike her! For this reason I am tempted to start reading it again without the previous false pretenses. So to those who were like me and are nervous due to what they have heard, please don't be!

She had insights into human nature that make her story meaningful today just as it was in the early 1800's.Emma is a beautiful and fortunate woman who has had only good luck. She thinks she knows it all. But really it's just she hasn't experienced the world. But this belief makes her get involved in the problems of others and disrupts her peaceful life.

It's my favorite novel from Jane Austen followed by Pride & Prejudice. In fact I only like those two novels out of the six she wrote, but anyway, Emma was a really good read. The best part about this novel is that it isn't about a girl who is looking for love, it's about a girl who unexpectedly finds love where it has been all the time. Talk about right under your nose. Emma is friendly, kind, naive, smart, loyal, whitty, clever, innocent, and definatley worth reading. I truly love this book because I love romance in it's purest form, true love, when you know that these two characters will spend the rest of their lives together and will love each other faithfully!

Where Emma Woodhouse takes residents with her father. Emma is clever and yes, rich. She enjoys many of the same things young adults do today do including match making and visiting friends in 1800's fashion.Emma is the main character as you probably can tell by the title of Emma. She has a bad habit of match making just ask \\"poor\\" Harriet. Emma attempts to stop threw out the book but always ends up going back. She vowed never to marry early in life. Besides her father Mr. Woodhouse needs her and she enjoys calling on her single friends. If she had a husband to complicate things she could not go see those friends. Unless the man she married enjoyed calling on those same friends.Emma seems like she could walk off the page and appear in the 21-century, even thew she lived in the 1800's. Her habits are the same as many young women today of not marrying and the dreaded habit of match making.Emma is full of personality even thew she can be a little mean to long time friends and not relies it without someone telling her. But Emma appears real and grounded.I would recommend Emma to young women who are fast readers and who know someone or they themselves enjoys match making. Because Emma learns control the desire to mess with people's feelings.Get Emma today even if you don't read it you can tell your friends you own on of the classics by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I first learned of 'Emma' by watching the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow - I was instantly captivated by the high-class style of that era, Emma's life and her relationship with Mr. Knightly. After watching the movie probably 16 times, I went and read the book and was so glad I did! It's become one of my all-time favorite books simply because I love Emma's character and get lost in her life and world every time, and come back later craving to read it again! The book expands and clarifies so much we don't get to see in the movie and gives you the original view of Emma - apart from the movie. As a woman, I love romance and tales of older times where nobility and class presided yet values were down to earth, respectable and loving. 'Emma' combines both nobility and the 'down to earthness' in Mr. Knightly. If you love romance, strong female characters and getting lost in another world of balls, dances, society - definitely read this and watch the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow! It's gorgeous and guaranteed to uplift you."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Though not her favorite novel, Austen's Emma shines as one of her most beloved.

So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters. &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, as I do all of Jane Austen's works. The narrator is an interesting character, making comments on the action and people around her. I was surpised at how much the narrator disliked her heroine at the beginning of the story. The growth of Emma throughout the novel gives hope to every spoiled child or even prideful adult. My only regret is that I saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow (and even Clueless) before reading this. I think I would have enjoyed it even better not knowing what laid ahead. I highly recommend saving the movies for after the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted proteg&eacute;, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read.

I was engrossed in the story from the beginning. Although it does take patience to get through some of the less exciting parts of the book, it is a very enjoyable book to read. By the end of the book, these characters will feel like your own family. I learned a lot about English culture and about how the upper class families used to live. Jan Austen is a very good author and could be classed with the best of them. Oddly, this book has a strikingly similar plot as the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. After you read the book you will see a resemblance between Cher and Emma, Dion and Mrs. Weston, Elton and Mr. Elton, and Josh and Mr. Knightley. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"'Emma' is the first Jane Austen novel I've read in 20 years. My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance. Was 'Emma' any different? Er,.. no.The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play. It is almost all dialogue. No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk. This makes for a very tiresome read.Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad]. Any dramatic moments are very tame. Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all. And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living. Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.So why bother with 'Emma'? Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature. She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time. True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done. But she was the pioneer. So please give at least one of her novels a try."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\""},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers. Perhaps these were fresh in Austen's day. That to one side, even the plot itself was too simplistic and much too easy to see through. These shortcomings combine to leave the reader with a sense of tedium. It does not \\"work\\" today, classic or not."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"IS THIS BOOK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CONSIDERED an......AR rated book.??..."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I appreciated the service I received.

Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain.

The use of some of Austen's words and phrases from 19th century England (around 200 years ago) may make it somewhat incomprehensible for many readers, though. Since this book is focused more on characters than on the plot, and Jane Austen's own style is very elaborate, it tends to drag on with detailed descriptions of people and events. This can get very tiresome and tedious. So, if you're going to read Emma, you may need to save quite a bit of time because it might be necessary to read some parts a few times to understand them. Because Emma is such an old tale, there has been a movie made of it to make it easier to understand. Of course, it is not as detailed as the book, so the movie can not replace it. The movie Clueless, a modernized version, could also help decode some of the tough parts; just remember, watching it doesn't replace reading it; as characters were added, and names changed. Also, if you are looking for ways to create more effective characters in a story you may be writing, this would be a good story to find examples in. There are many characters who have very distinct and individual personalities in Emma. In this way, it relates to another of Jane Austen's novels, Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a long book with many creative characters, settings and plot twists.

It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but nave! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's \`beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,Make me a match,Find me a find,Catch me a catch,Night after night in the dark I'm aloneSo find me a match,Of my own.- Fiddler on the RoofIn this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the best plan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.

I've read it over and over again...and the book never stays on my shelf for long."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Without a doubt, the most whitty and comical Austin novel. Not as heavy and deep as say, &quot;Sense and Sensabilty&quot; or &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;...but, just as wonderfully written. A real treat."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"that people think it was a rip off of Clueless! It was written 150+ years before the movie came out. How can you all be so clueless about this?"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I was surprised by the rather divisive views expressed by other readers. Written at the height of her powers, Jane Austen's &quot;Emma&quot; boasts some of the most memorable charaters and the most lucid conversations in English literature. And such penetrative understanding of love and relationships! How they came to a woman who never married herself is always a wonder to me."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"It is Jane Austen... It is really long but it is worth the read. Emma is the perfect example of any girl trying to grow up."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma. Austen's mystery novel with no mystery. I enjoyed Emma as Austen discusses the dangers of tampering with other people's lives, the characteristics a perfect gentleman should have, and what ignorance a spoiled class snob with managerial power could have.Emma is really a little different than Austen's other works. It doesn't have as much impact in story or romance. The story is going to feel dry to many people. It's a mystery novel with no mystery. But it's a good read for Austen fans and a great novel with many aspects to discuss."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Emma is a favorite in our house, and it's great to have the text in a free Kindle edition.

It just didn't captivate my interest. I did read it to the end only because I was curious about Emma and how it would end. I remember very little of it and it is a long novel. It took me 5 months to finish it. I usually finish a book in a few days once I get started. Also it was written in an Old English style and some of it I did not understand.I would only recommend it to someone who likes the Old English writing style."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and I'm tickled my oldest daughter also loves her novels. I prefer paper books, but nothing beats a Kindle loaded with amazing books when you are traveling and don't want to carry the bulky dead tree editions."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Jane Austin captures the styles and manners of the period so well. I find her works very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Some might think I'd be ashamed, giving to this celebrated Jane Austen novel a mere 4 stars. But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out? Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma. Well developed characters and relationships between. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading!"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I am currently reading this book and loving it. It fills in all the details that are missing in the movie. I love Jane Austen's style of writing and it amazes me how long ago she wrote this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Despite being believed to be a ladies' book, the story and language of Jane Austen are invaluable regarding language studies, classic British cultural and social research, and overall knowledge expansion. Charcters are enjoyable, whereas their intelligence and findings are quite applicable across countries and times."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book.

It was wonderful. a great classic, a great look back in time. The characters are rich and the prose keeps you reading. Best of all, it was FREE."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"To put it simply, this is a story about love in various forms and degrees. The most important thing about love and relationships, however, is that no one can control who a person does and does not love. It's entertaining to follow Emma Woodhouse as she tries to play matchmaker, thinking that she knows best, and in the end she even surprises herself. You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth)."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"\\"Handsome, clever and rich\\" is how Emma is introduced to us, and a happy, carefree existence she leads, with very little to worry her other than idle gossip. The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while, she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Written in a very different dialogue, sometimes hard to understand what she means the way she express's her thoughts and feelings. I would call it very old English setting"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I finally finished Emma after months (yes you heard me right) of reading. I lked this book but I didn't adore it.I think the characters were well done. My favorites were Mr. Woodhouse and his germaphobic ways...as well as his distaste in people getting married and leaving their cozy little lives. I also liked Harriet Smith because she had a simple and almost innocent way about her...the way she blindly followed Emma and molded the desires of her heart according to Emma's approval. I felt a connect to Harriet in that way...especially thinking back to high school...the popular girls trying to get you to think a certain way and telling you would make a good boyfriend.Emma Woodhouse is a likeable character. She is a matchmaker who gives up on the hobby due to her matches never fall for each other and drama is the result. The secound half of the book is about Emma finding out her own heart.The reason I only gave two stars was because to me this was an okay read. I saw some of the new movie and the theme interested me...so because it was free on my Kindle and because I wanted to try a sophisticated and chic lit type read...I read it.If you can keep up with drama and who likes who...and if you enjoy a well written novel with a long letter thrown in for the juicy details you crave...than leave the gossip behind and stick your nose into one of Austen's lesser known novels. As for me I prefer Dickens and anything with a bit more action."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"I bought this book to be a decoration on my shelf.

However, I reviewed this book as a 4 star simply because it lacks the strong story that other books from Ms. Austen display.Emma is a bit scheming and conniving and the story actually is more about events that just happen because of her medling ways. When I reviewed Pride and Prejudice I wrote how I loved the language - and this is no different. The word structure is exquisite. If it wasn't for the fact that I find Emma sometimes a bit too nosey I would love this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

As a teacher, I would love to offer a course in Jane Austen in general; in the current educational environment, I doubt that will happen. If I were allowed to do so, I would have students compare this novel with Pride and Prejudice simply because I think the papers would be interesting to read. The book is written in typical Austen style, the characters are endearing, and the situations are frequently funny - all in all a good read."},{"Title":"Launch out into the deep","review":"Mark Rutland was a methodist minister who was fighting his own deep personal issues.

The book will be of interest to child development specialists for its findings on how 3 and 4-year-olds make use of role-play to co-construct their understandings of roles and relationships, plus it has an outstanding theoretical chapter. As an exemplar for students of methodology, the book is truly extraordinary. Corsaro narrates with loving detail his entree into the preschool playground, his establishing connections with kids, his use of video to record spontaneous play, his conventions of transcription, and his static and processual approaches to the analysis of play events. In these respects it is better written and more lively than a doctoral dissertation, but just as detailed and thorough."},{"Title":"Jimgrim and the Seventeen Thieves of El-Kalil","review":"Again told from the point of view of a pretty much no-name assistant in events, this details Jimgrim holding together a situation to try and prevent a bloodbath in Jerusalem and elsewhere.This involves some cunning, making some deals that can't be refused with Ali-Baba and light-fingered offspring of various generations.

He was a wild man when he got at the controls of the fighter planes, but he was disciplined enough to write detailed diaries during training and in Italy. He kept his letters from his wartime girlfriend. From these diaries and letters we learn about the escapades of the flyboys, in the air, in the barracks, and with the girls. We see the suffering of the Italians who lived near the US airbase--the children who begged for food and ate from the Army's garbage cans, and the women and girls who turned to prostitution to survive. From Lt. Curtis' viewpoint in the sky, we see the US bombers down below which have been hit by German fire and realize that another 14 GI's have probably been killed. We learn of the rationing of fuel oil and how it affected those living through a New England winter. I was a child during World War II, and this book was a great education for me about what actually went on during that time."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"Here's a must read for anyone interested in the life of a combat pilot for any war, any nation. Lt. Curtis' story blends his training, combat, day to day activities, romance, and his own self-doubt with the major events of the WWII and the key decisions. It's facinating to read about how the decisions made by FDR and Churchill affected this man's life. I found myself pulling for Myrt to say yes, and feeling proud of the moral code Dick lived by. Here's a man I would have enjoyed meeting.My father flew B-17s out of England, but he would speak very little about his experinces. This books fills in many of the gaps in my father's story. As a book author myself, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"This book was well written and Mr. Curtis explains his exploits in great detail and without modesty as of most of us wouldn't be quick to admit that we were almost court martialed on several ocasions for disobeying flight restrictions, victory rolls over airfields, etc.I don't want to give this book such a bad review even though I agree with a lot of the other reviews of this book about it lacks any combat at all really. I admire Mr. Curtis for wanting to be a minister and spending so much time in Italy with the chaplain there, that part of the book is great. This book is really not about a memoir, if you will, of a combat aviator but more of a memoir and life of a fighter pilot who was stationed in Italy, who wanted to be a minister, and was just counting the days of his 50th mission so he could go home. I would definately not read this book again and I'm sorry that in all honestly I would not recommend it to anyone else to read who loves books about aviation combat."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"I am a big fan of this book. The author was a human guinea pig who was sent to a front line fighter group with minimal training, as the government wanted to see how little training pilots could receive and still be effective and survive. This is not the usual account of a figher pilot, who normally tells you exactly how good he was. He candidly informs you how unprepared he was. The title says it all. I am also glad to hear about a unit and theater of war that is not often written about or published. The Eighth Airforce and the Fifteenth Airforce were partners that worked together to keep the enemy off balance. Together they did much to finish Nazi Germany. The Mighty Eighth is well covered in many books, especially a handful of groups. You could fit all that is written on the fifteenth on a short shelf. I found the author engaging and humorous. He also helps you see the ugly side of war, even though he flies the \\"glamorous\\" P-51 Mustang."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"Well I have read in excess of 20 world war 2 pilots books and I very much enjoyed this one!I was completely drawn in and read it straight through...I enjoyed reading about all Richards exploits and his ability to put you there with him during his time in the sky.If you are a fan of the Army Air Force during WW2 then I highly recommend ready \\"Dumb But Lucky\\" and see how a regular guy managed to be very clever and yes a bit lucky as well!"},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"This is an easy read and goes into much detail on what daily lives were like from being an air cadet to being in combat. For those who want to get a vicarious description of a WW2 pilot this is highly recommended.I also agree with the author's opinion that being a bomber pilot was so much less desirable to being a fighter pilot. The bravery of bomber pilots cannot be overstated in WW2 and yet they in effect won both the European and Pacific theaters.The policy of taking raw pilots out of advanced training in AT6s and the throwing them into combat was planned murder in my opinion but then again I was not there and do not know all the details but wasting such assets seems so callus on the surface."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"The author served in the same fighter squadron as the man that I was later named after, who like many others gave the ultimate sacrifice. I found this book very enlightening, because it is not just a recount of the military strategy and the tactics of air battles, but a broad description of the culture, technology, training and hardships of a very young man doing his patriotic duty with honor. Mr Curtis reveals some of the reckless and foolish things that he and others did, and the lucky and un-lucky pilots that he served with. His colorful descriptions of the pilot's life in P-51 Mustangs and in Italy paint an vivid picture. The long-distance love story with his one-and-only Myrt adds another dimension."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"Well written but ultimately lacking any big set piece action. The author had a major upheaval in his life caused by the war and his wartime service, and he explains the nuts and bolts of learning to fly, then training on, and flying a cutting edge fighter - the Mustang - very well. But his wartime service in Italy appears to be mainly long spells of grinding boredom interspersed with brief spells of action. For anyone interested in the day to day routine of learning to fly, then operational life as a normal everyday pilot in a fighter squadron, this is a well written and good book. However for anyone interested in the \\"edited highlights\\" of the cut and thrust of combat only, this book will be a disappointment. There are also no particularly shocking or even exciting \\"confessions\\""},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"Richard Curtis was clearly a good man for the job when he became a pilot. He was also a good choice to write about his experiences. I would say, that he might be a bit too modest in the title and the credit he gives to luck and the lord. He did what he needed to do to become a pilot and then serve his country bravely.The points that come out in the book for all to see are that many deaths in war are hardly war related. He was around a fair number of deaths that seemed to be preventable or worse from negligence resulting in a pilot's own death or someone innocent on the ground.I will say the Mr Curtis did some dumb things, I would go so far as to say I was getting a bit frustrated that he didn't seem to learn as he matured into a full fledged fighter pilot. I won't spoil the ending but he was careless until the very end - don't worry he survived to write the book and lead a good long life."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"With all due respect to a man who served his country during WW2, there is nothing at all extraordinary about his service, or this book. I don't know why he bothered to write it. It seems it was written to perhaps cash in on the WW2 craze of the past decade or so, with all of the promises of \\"action and excitement\\". But a \\"...hair-raising account (that) captures the air war in all its split-second terror and adrenaline-pumping action\\"?? Please. I WISH my hair had been raised! I kept waiting for it to be raised, but nothing ever really happens in this book. If he ever shot anyone down, I didn't see it in the pages. His missions were like that of a lot of pilots during the war; Nothing much happened. That's a little known fact about the air-war...most fighter pilots didn't get to engage in dogfights. But do we really need first-hand accounts of things that didn't happen?While he addresses the crashes and mishaps that took at least as many lives as the Germans did (if not more) in pretty good detail, it's really only interesting to the historian or student of WW2 history, perhaps, and even then, only as a relativity minor footnote to that part of the war. But for the general history buff, it just kind of lies there as far as being an engaging literary piece on the the air-war.I'm always glad for any first-hand accounts that we can get of my favorite history subject (WW2), and while I do appreciate this book for it's contribution, as far as it being \\"adrenaline-pumping action\\", I think you'd get a better rush from a simple cup of coffee. Sorry, but that's just a fact."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"My Grandma taught me that if I can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. God Bless Richard Curtis; he was smart enough to survive, and still lucky enough to get this book published. At the very least he contributed to the strength of our numbers at a time of World War, but he reveals precious little more about the times except to say that he was there, and lived to tell the tale. Perhaps that is all there was to tell; personally, I made a point of reading the book through to the very last page so I can be sure that I never buy the book again under the impression that it is substantive history of the time, and the war he went off to fight.

Luck is a matter of being prepared when opportunity knocks. And, in spite of his self-depredation he certainly was not dumb. Of those pilots who were accepted for flight training, over 40% washed out and were assigned to gunnery or navigator school. The fact that he successfully completed his training and was assigned to fly the P-51 proves that he was neither dumb nor lucky.He was, in fact, an \\"Eager Beaver.\\" Over and over he volunteered for extra duties. This certainly would not have been accepted by his superiors if he was not quite intelligent.His experiences were not that different from many young men during the early 1940s. Almost all of those who joined the Army Air Corps were around 20 years old.I regret that he did not achieve his goal of shooting down an ME-109 or a FW-190, but those who fly as wingman also serve - and he did a good job of it.There is nothing remarkable about this book, and it is a bit disappointing that it just sort of ends, as if Lt. Coker got tired of writing and quit. It would have been interesting to learn more about his after-war experiences."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"I guess time fades a person's memory but a mag check for manifold pressure to determine if there was enough power to take off?? After reading several first person books by several Aces that served in the same place at the same time, flying the same missions (only flying as much as 150 missions to fulfill their tour, as opposed to Curtis' 50) and being involved in the same events, I have to say that this book is a very amateurish attempt.

This seemed to be his primary motivation to signing up with the USAAF. I don't have a problem with that per se as I am inordinately fond of my own skin. I guess my major malfunction with this guy is when he is discussing his future career with his intended. It sounds like he wants to bring civilization to the poor benighted slopes via being a Christian minister. Problem is he never actually mentions Jesus or salvation or any of that stuff.Fortunately for Asia and Christianity (but not for Ivy League undergrads) he chose to go into teaching after the war. The irony continues. His specialty was \\"communication\\". As I forced myself to read this book through to the end I finally found entertainment in his definition of \\"G force\\". I won't spoil it for you by saying he provides any coherent explanation.He did some nice things for Italian children and for that if nothing else he should be commended ( \\"Nothing you do for a child is wasted\\" Garrison Keillor)Buy any other WWII aviation book by anyone else and you will be better served."},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","review":"This was not an easy read.

A Sensible Guide to Hysterectomy and Other Procedures for Women","review":"Five stars for Michele C. Moore and Caroline M. De C osta's Do You Really Need Surgery? A Sensible Guide to Hysterectomy and OtherProcedures for Women. Physicians Moore and De Costa write clearly, humorfully, and usefully about women's options for gynecological surgery-remembering that hysterectomy used to be the most often performed unnecessary surgery, they offer numerous choices, always emphasizing the need for the empowered patient's choice. \\"Remember, you are the person having the surgery, not them [doctors]!\\" Michele and Caroline write, using their first names with pseudonyms for their patients. They offer personal narratives about their patients, some of whom have opted for surgery! -most notably hysterectomy-and some of whom have not. They consider the options of alternative medicine as well asmainstream Western approaches. Michele and Caroline detail not only success stories, but also they offer clear explanations of the risks and consequences of gynecologic surgery. This book is written in clear colloquial language. (...) Some possible bad consequences, often temporary, are concisely described with \\"Yuck.\\" The technical details are there, clearly presented using as little jargon as possible. I have friends facing some of the conditions Michele and Caroline analyze, and I will give them a copy of this book enthusiastically.Particularly wonderful sections are those on what to expect after the surgery that squarely face women's sexual fears and realities that follow many hysterectomies-Moore quotes one of her patient's delighted analysis: \\"Hysterectomy takes away the baby carrier and leaves the playpen.\\" The concluding section-tips to make a sensible decision-is brilliant.

After reading the first chapter, where he explains his assumptions that you understand the concept behind digital photography and want to learn what a dSLR (digital single reflex lens) camera can do, I nearly bought it, because it sounded EXACTLY like what I was looking for. I've been using digital point-and-shoot cameras almost since they came out.Unfortunately, I ended up finding this book to be less than helpful. I'm glad I read it, because it does give a great sketch of all the things you can do with a dSLR (and also mentions some of the things you can't and why). Unfortunately, I don't feel like there's anything I can do now with my camera that I couldn't have done before. Since using Aperture priority and Shutter speed priority is where most amateurs will end up using a dSLR (once they get off point and shoot mode) I thought there would be more information about how to conquer everyday problems using different settings. For example, you're trying to get pictures of your son on a bike on a cloudy day: suggestions? Instead, I found very little information about dealing with unusual conditions, and even fewer photographic or other examples.The rest of the book covered things like the composition of a good photo, the structure of a dSLR, and how to edit images on the computer. Frankly, I have my hands full just learning to use my camera and I have no interest right now in advanced image editing on the computer. And while I appreciate that understanding the inner workings of the camera does help explain the concepts of aperture and shutter speed, I also don't think he used those sections in the best way to get people to taking better photos.In the end, I thought the book was worth glancing at, because it has really helped me better understand what my questions really are, and that is definitely a helpful step. Nevertheless, I mostly found the book to cover too much information in too little detail, and frankly, I do not think this book will help many people take better quality photos than they were taking with the P or Auto modes already."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Lots of valuable information in this book.

Not only it explains basic and advanced concepts, but it's full of pictures so you can visually understand how each parameter affects the exposure."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"The Dummies people have finally recognized that books about digital photography deserve to be published in full color, and this one amply demonstrates the reason why.

It's perfect for new DSLR owners who are puzzled by the many options, features, and settings found in these cameras. It's also a good guide for those seeking to improve their skills. I now fully understand things like continuous autofocus and single autofocus, how to select lenses, when to use aperture and shutter priority, and why I should not ever use my D70's full \\"automatic\\" mode.Unlike some other DSLR books I've seen, this one covers both cameras and photography thoroughly, so you'll learn how to use your camera as well as how to take better images."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Like many snapshooting amateurs, I upgraded from an ordinary point/shoot digital camera to a digital SLR because I wanted to take advantage of the features these new cameras offer. Plus, a camera like my Olympus E-500 doesn't really cost much more than the high-end non-SLR cameras. However, once I got my camera, I didn't know what to do with it.This book cleared everything up for me. It provided a clear explanation of the advantages of digital SLR cameras, plus it listed some of the drawbacks I was not aware of at first, such as the inability to shoot movies. Then it told me about all the different controls and how to use them. There were great sections in this book on how to take specific kinds of pictures and how to choose an image editor. The editing portion got me started and inspired me to buy a Dummies book on Photoshop Elements so I can learn more.As I said, this book really told me what I could do with my new camera. There was even a section in the Parts of Tens that listed things you'd never thought of doing with a digital SLR and I certainly hadn't.

All the illustrations are in full color, so you can see exactly what kind of results you'll get if you follow this book's advice.There seem to be a lot of D-SLR books on the market now. Many of them concentrate on the technology or spend too much time describing how to \\"fix\\" your pictures in Photoshop.

The technical portions of the book are excellent--you will have a much better understanding of the capabilities of your camera and, more importantly, harnessing those capabilities. Other non-technical sections, such as pointers on composition, are helpful as well. Finally, while not as crisply written as other sections, the book includes a decent discussion on available software and the process of editing images.If you are buying your first digital SLR, add this book to the order. One hint--READ YOUR CAMERA'S MANUAL FIRST. It makes it much easier to digest the information provided and immediately experiment with your new understanding of your camera's functions."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Since I do a lot of my reading on subways, I've always felt a little embarrassed when carrying one of the books in the \\"For Dummies\\" line. At the same time, I've always found that the series really does provide a broad spectrum of knowledge for entry into a new field. This book is no exception.Although Busch expects the reader to have some knowledge of the controls on his or her digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR) and how to operate a computer, he leads the new DSLR owner by the hand to the information necessary to get good photographs. Moreover, he clearly keys this knowledge to the digital side of photography. For example, he spends several pages talking about the use of the camera's histogram (a chart of the distribution of light values in a picture) to improve exposures. He also explains the differences between camera formats like JPG and RAW, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Some of the material, like the discussion of different focal length lenses, may be applicable to film single lens reflexes as well, but if you are coming to a DSLR from a point and shoot camera, this will be useful information.There is also information about processing your photographs in image editing software with a brief explanation of the different image editing functions. He finishes up with the \\"Part of Tens\\" which includes tips for better pictures not covered elsewhere in the book, suggested projects and even useful websites.For someone who doesn't expect to push his or her photography skills beyond the bare minimum, this may be the only book ever needed (besides the camera manual). But DSLR's have a way of pulling you into the hobby and then this book just won't be enough. For example, even though this book covers image processing software, it's more from the point of knowing the potential. Actual use of Photoshop or other software will require much more information. In addition, there are many other decisions that a serious digital photographer will have to address, like whether to use in-camera sharpening, that aren't even addressed here. Also not mentioned was the use of Adobe Camera Raw, which is the front end of Photoshop and Photoshop Elements.Another area that I felt was weak was the section on composition which did not even cover some of the basic guidelines like the \\"rule of thirds.\\" (Busch mentions a \\"rule of thirds\\" but only in terms of where to put the horizon in a landscape.)Finally there are a few mistakes in the book like the perpetuation of the myth that wide-angle lenses have greater depth field than telephotos. It's a rule of optical science that for a given aperture and image size the depth of field is the same whether you use a wide-angle or a telephoto lens.Notwithstanding these complaints, this book will provide a good introduction to photography with a DSLR."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"The Cadillac's of the digital camera world are the Digital Single Lens Reflex cameras. Here is where the camera companies put forth their latest research, the latest components in sensing, image processing and everything else. For the average advanced amateur, the question has to be, what will I get with a dSLR that makes it worth the extra huyndreds of dollars?This book answers that question. It covers the design of the dSLR camera and uses this to explain the advantages. It will enable you to decide if you need to spend the extra money or if it would suit you just as well to have a high end point and shoot camera. As you might guess, the author is a solid fan of dSLRs, but he is kind enough to point out that they may not be for everyone. He gives the advantages and some of the disadvantages of both the dSLR and what you can expect out of point and shoot.One point he doesn't mention, the features that you now get in a dSLR such as increased pixel count will move their way downward into the cheaper cameras as time goes on. Of course by then, the dSLRs will have a bevy of new features.Finally, to round out the story of dSLRs he does cover image processing and printing. Again, he concentrates on the unique features that dSLRs bring such as RAW files, etc."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't really know much about how digital SLR cameras work. The book provides a general overview of the main areas of interest to beginner photographers, but the book is rather basic though, so unless you are a true beginner, the book is probably not for you. Personally, I think the main value of this book is that I now understand enough about the different terms/principles to seek out more specific books for further reading.

Still the slight datedness factor doesn't diminish the overall usefulness of the book.In later chapters about digital makeovers and enhancement, the author refers mostly to fixes using Photoshop, a goliath of a program that most beginners aren't going to own or even want to own.

He has enjoyed it. thanks. Excellent service by the way."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"A very disappointing and useless book..Please dont waste your money on this book..It will teach you nothing about cameras or photography..This may have been the worst book I ever purchased, double period"},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Where to start...let's begin with the included photographs of bad picture, good picture. For someone who claims to have an outstanding resume, most of these photographs are a joke. Lots of overexposed shots with poor composition. I was astounded. Next, he relies heavily on post-production techniques using Photoshop. While I understand the infatuation with Photoshop, how about we learn how to properly use lighting pre-production first? Also, in one book he attempts to take the reader from the very basic lighting concepts to the most advanced. This should not have been a Dummies book. I have a few others, and none attempts to appeal to all levels of users. Hence the name \\"For Dummies.\\" Lastly, the author, who teaches photography at a university, is sadly not a writer. At all. I will be re-selling this book here and buying a different one."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"This is a great DVD. This is my first SLR camera and I know very little about the many, often daunting and intimidating, features of my camera but this DVD explained them clearly and intelligently. I now feel confident about using my camera and have already had some good initial results. Olympus should include this DVD with every camera."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))is well designed to teach amatuers like me on the different features of an SLR camera.

However, after i read the book i relaized that this not a new photgrapher friendly book. The language is too difficult with a lot of technical expressions that are not explained. I believe you have to be a photographer to benefit from this book. I am crrently learning abut the basics of digital SLR photograohy from a free website which is much easier and more illustrative. My advice is if you are a budding digital SLR photographer this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"The book has the basics of what you need to decide on which DSLR you want..and even some idea about which lenses to buy...it is a good book.The book is good for understanding the basics...but..-it is repetitive and doesn't have enough concise content-the author seems to be a bit old school..I can't trust him to cover everything in the current environment-put me to sleep many times"},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"This book was a great bargain.

Very advanced photographers who feel they already know everything probably won't be satisfied with this book's content. But the rest of us will find a lot to learn here."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"This book covers just about all the questions you can have about Digital SLRs and then some. All topics are explained clearly and concisely. It is worth the price."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"This book is good for those who don't know much about the digital photography world, such as flash cards, the digital sensors, etc. It also covers how to choose a DSLR camera and the accessories for it. The book also gives you a good beginners primer on how to take pictures. It covers all aspects but a bit shallow. If you're thinking about getting a DSLR and are also brand new to photography in general, this is the book you want. If you already know how to take pictures well and are moving from a film SLR to a digital, you can learn the digital nuances online. No need to buy the book. For just taking pictures, I learned a lot more from Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"This book has a lot of information about the basics about Digital SLR cameras.

Good to read for short blurbs or sit and read chapter after chapter. It is detailed and show lots of examples."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"First off I will say that I am a pretty technically savvy person. I am the person people hand their digital goodies over to figure out how to make it do something. My secret is I LOVE dummy books. Just give me enough info to be dangerous and I will explore and figure out the rest on my own. I have decided to step out of the realm of point and shoots and bought a Canon Digital Rebel xsi. Now what do I do? Buy a Dummy book of course! However as I am reading this book I quickly realize that the author is tossing out f stops and other lingo like he knows that \\"I\\" know what the heck he is talking about. Here is how he explains F-stops: \\"F-stops use all these weird intermediate numbers that do represent halving and doubling the amount of light passed by the aperture.\\" WTF? How about show me, the \\"dummy\\" a single shot using different f-stops? How about the same for shutter speed, and ISO, and how these three relate together to get me to take great photos? It's like the editor took a dull how to book and tried to add in some catchy chapter subtitles and some very weak attempts at humor and called it a dummy book. NOW with that said, there is useful information in the book and I am sure those with a little more technical expertise would benefit. It's just not what I have come to expect from dummy books. This is not for the beginner beginner and is going back to Amazon."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Very good book for beginners in the digital field. Covers all aspects of a new film less era. Shoot and instantly view your shot keep or re shoot. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"TO much comparing point and shoot cameras to SLR. That was not what I bought it for. His other book on NikonsD5000 is all I needed. I wasted my money on this one."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I picked up this book as a refresher but am astonished at how much I was missing out on all these years. I am an avid photographer mostly when I travel. I also enjoy taking outdoor head and shoulder shots of nieces, nephews or anyone photogenic. Currently I am exploring the depth of field settings on my DSLR. Next I am going to get more involved with wide angle shots using objects in the foreground and show its environment in the background.I highly recommend this for new owners of a DSLR camera."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I recently bought a Canon Rebel XSi and bought this book, hoping it would make life easier. It doesn't! I am new to the dSLR world, but this book spends about 3 chapters telling you why a dSLR is better than a point and shoot. Way too much nonsense info. I did not find this book useful for someone who wants to better understand hwo to get good shots from their camera. If you are a Rebel XSi user, I recently purchased a 3-hour XSi specific training DVD put out by Michael Andrews a professional photographer. It's very good. I believe the site is canonrebelxsidvd dot com."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I wish you would come out with some DVD's for Dumimies for people like me who are visual learnes more than reading text. Just a suggestion I found on e-bay for &55 that take you from how to charge your battery all the way through the man parts and how to use them, I think that would be a good tool along with the books. Thank you, Kisti Hckam"},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Bought this book as a gift but wasn't what the person was looking for so it was returned.

The author provided clear and concise explanations that helped me understand how my camera functions and he also provided basic photography concepts. The author came across as modest and added a tad of humor, which made for an enjoyable reading experience. I definitely recommend this book as well as thoroughly reading through your owner's manual and you should be taking great pictures in no time!"},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Let me be forthright -- I recently bought the Canon Rebel XT SLR to take pictures of my two month old daughter. I wanted those warm and fuzzy candid shots of her (you know, like the ones they have in those parenting magazines). After fiddling with the settings on the camera and taking tons of pictures, I noticed they were an improvement over my old point-and-shoot camera. However, not enough to justify the big $$$ I spent on the Rebel and the fancy lens. A beginners guide on SLR cameras was definitely in order.After skimming over the first few chapters of this book, I decided to buy it. After all, I've had good experiences with other books in the \\"Dummy\\" series in the past. Once I digged deeper into the book, though, I discovered the book was no help for me at all! For example, the author spends an considerable amount of time writing about the benefits of SLR cameras over point-and-shoot cameras, how to pick the best SLR camera, and the difference between memory storage devices. This was no help for me at all because (1) I wouldn't have bought my Canon if I wasn't already convinced it was better than my old camera and (2) I'm kind of stuck with the memory card the camera is compatible with. I just want to know what buttons to push and which levels to set on my Canon to keep my baby's pictures from being blurry!!!!This book reads more like an textbook on the inner workings of a camera and the jargon that goes along with it. But, since I just wanted a practical guide on how to take cool pictures, this book was no help for me."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"The book is logically laid out, as are all the Dummies books. Busch certainly prepares a brand-spanking new beginner to the world of SLRs. But if you have the least bit of experience or an artistic bend on how you take your pictures, it's much too simple for you. (I've owned a Nikon 6006 for several yrs & recently finally bought that Nikon D70S.) I still haven't found the book I'm looking for - giving you great technique and composition. The book is just average - keep looking if you're needing more inspiration."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],q={key:0},H={key:1};function W(s,e,n,m,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(t(!0),o(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",q,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(P,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-641cc737"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/51.md","filePath":"glossary/51.md"}'),B={name:"glossary/51.md"},D=Object.assign(B,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,D as default};
