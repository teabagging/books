A pity, because the plot intrigues; but in the end I found myself not really caring overly much how it turns out. Still, bland characterisation is a besetting fault of Pocket's Voyager series (with the notable exception of Christie Golden's efforts)."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"Although it isn't the absolute best, Echoes was a great all around Voyager book. (The best would have to be #6 The Murdered Sun and Mosaic.) It definately goes onto my favorites list. I really liked all the little differences between the Voyager crews (example : orange uniforms instead of red) I found myself skipping a few pages ahead just to find out what was going to happen. The authors did an excellent job in writing about the different universes. I thought that the only flaw was that no one had any memory of what had happened, but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of Echoes."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"anyone who enjoys reading star trek books, this is a must. the writers involve many dimentions and make distinct refrences to past episodes (ie deadlock)the ending is not at all in the way of been predictable.

Maybe I'm just a sucker for parralel universes, but I thought it was wonderful! The only slight downside was that it was hard to keep track of which universe was which."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"I always like the stories about paralel universes in Star Trek such as 'Q' Squared and 'Dark Mirror'. However, 'Echoes' gave me confusion about the universes. The best example to use is 'Q Squared' where Peter David used Track 1, Track 2, and so on. This eliminates the confusion of the multiple universes, especially when there are only slight differences between the universes in 'Echoes'. Furthermore, the ending in 'Echoes' is somewhat puzzling. If the Voyager ended the timeline, then what is the purpose of the story in the first place. Other stories about paralel universes show endings in the timeline, continuing the timeline itself, not ending it. Well, this novel is a good effort, but it should have become better."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This is definitely ne of the better Voyager books, and goes to show that you don't always need a six book series for a good story. Basically, the story involves some sort of rift in space which spans across parallel dimensions, and after a period of time, it beams the entire population of a certain planet into space, each time accessing a different dimension, weird stuff. Voyager comes across this vast pool of bodies in space and investigates, and along the way bumps into some parallel Voyagers, and some of the crew get misplaced throughout these dimensions.The story ends as most time travel/alternate dimension stories end, with the crew sacrificing themselves to preserve the timeline, and afterwards, nobody really knows what happened, sort of pointless in a way, bit like Year in Hell.The writing was solid, excellent characterisations, and nearly every major character played a role, even Kes. The novel was set in season 3, pre seven of nine Voyager, so the story wasn't centered around the Borg. I felt this story really captured the 'essence' of season 3, each season of the show has a distinct look and feel about it, this book was most definitely season 3.The novel also dealt with the alternate dimensions well, the left/right system was a good analogy, not as confusing as a more recent J&amp;G novel series, the authors made it fairly easy to understand. Another point of mention, what was the go with three authors? It's a rare event to see a novel with three authors, but the results are there is this one.A good read, reminiscent of the days when Voyager was relatively innocent, before the plot became too convoluted, maybe not worth buying, but definitely worth borrowing from a library of friend."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"First of all, if you're the kind of person that gets headaches thinking about temporal loops and alternate realities, then this isn't for you.It's a bumpy road until you understand the multiple universe construction of this story. But once you get a handle on it, within 4 or 5 chapters, it's a smooth action filled ride. The confusion you are feeling actual enhances the story adding to the complexity of the mystery the crew faces.The story also provides vivid imagery and well placed emotional introspection by many of the crew giving the reader a up-close-and-personal view of the crisis.The multiple universes lend nicely to the short chapters and making it a fast read."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"As Soon as I started reading the first two pages it got my attention right away.

So If you are a voyager fan this would be a excellent one to Read! I recommend It To All!"},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It can make you step back, zoom out a little from life, if you will. I am in my entirety addicted to temporal paradoxes and dimensional phenomena, and let me tell you, I found this book to be one of the best I've read. My greatest hope is that someday I'll be able to write like this, my being fourteen at the moment. Well, my best advice is try it out! You'll either be hooked or asleep."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"I thought this was a brilliant Voyager book but at times it tend to become rather like an episode from the show.

Echoes has a very intrigueing plot, but the problem is that the plot doesn't really go anywhere (with the notable exception of universe 2410) until nearly the end of the book. The ending is surprisingly cliche, but I suppose I shouldn't have really expected much more. The different universes could have been explored much more in my opinion than they were, and unlike some of the other people who reviewed this book, I would have liked to see more universes included, with bigger differences in each one. Overall, this is a good book, and it is worth reading just to read a take on an interesting idea, but don't expect too much out of it."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"Finally. A voyager novel that goes beyond simply &quot;we are out of food and must replenish. better make friends with a new alien culture and best some wicked enemy along the way...&quot; What a refresher. Each chapter takes the oint of view of a voyager in a parallel universe, and only small differences exist between each. I actually had to engage my brain to keep track of which was which. Janeway was especially inspiring in this one, in all of her guises. If you are a fan of good science fiction, and don't mind using a little brain power while reading star trek, then rush right out and buy this one. Easilly the best since Violations. 5 enthusiastic stars."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"I enjoyed all the alternate universes. Love this TV series and thoroughly enjoy reading the books again. Reading new one now."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"The story was very well-written, but I found some of the basic assumptions that were required to make the plotline work dubious at best. If there were that many parallel universes involved, and tiny, but noticable differences appeared just from one to the next, it seems to me that there would be much more noticable, much more significant changes by the time you got to universe 2410. Therefore, the various \\"Janeways\\", \\"Chakotays\\", etc, would come up with much more varied responses than these did; they were so identical that they made the same decisions in every single case. Surely in some cases, there would have been an away team sent to the planet, and in other cases, not. In some cases, the away team would have varied just a tad, it wouldn't necessarily have included the same four people every time; maybe sometimes, Janeway would have gone herself, rather than send Chakotay. In others, maybe Paris would have been busy with other things, or would have been a touch under the weather. Maybe in some cases, Tuvok would have been sent instead of Kes. There are plenty of variables in such a decision; there's no reason to think that the same decision would be made in every single parallel universe. Certainly, when the situation was different, different decisions might be made, so we might have had different (or non-existent) away teams when there was a populated planet, and when there was a ghost planet. I also find it somewhat dubious, for the same reason, that in every single universe, they came up with the same solution. Maybe there wasn't a better solution available, but surely, in some cases, they would have failed to come up with that solution, and offered less-workable solutions.At the very least, in a parallel universe that differed so much from ours that in it, a planet that existed in our universe is rubble in the other, there might be more noticable differences, and in those realities even farther away than that (on the other side of that one) differences would begin to rapidly accumulate.As I say, the story was well-written, the concept interesting if dubious, the characterizations well-handled. I just have difficulty suspending disbelief sufficiently to swallow the basic plot concept."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This was a A Great Book! I have Been Reading Trek NoVeLS for 5 years, and watching it for 10. You say that's Not a long time? Well YOU probably are not 14. I am really into Trek, Star Wars too, and I agree that Q-squared and Dark Mirror WERE great, but so is this book.

My favorite types of science fiction stories deal with time-travel and alternate universes - this novel contains the latter as its main plot device - yet even I found myself becoming lost in the multiple upon multiple Voyagers and Voyager crews.An excellent example of what this novel could have been is Peter David's &quot;Q-Squared&quot;, a very complex but entertaining, fascinating, and non-confusing Trek story containing multiple time-tracks. Also recommended is &quot;Dark Mirror&quot; by Diane Duane, the first Next-Gen encounter with the &quot;evil&quot; universe from the original series &quot;Mirror, Mirror.&quot;After reading David's and Duane's books and seeing the &quot;Year from Hell&quot; episodes on TV, I was very disappointed in &quot;Echoes.&quot; It really doesn't cover any new territory that hasn't been covered before. For hard-core Trekkers only."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"Three parallel stories going at the same time with the same characters was just too confusing for me.

When the story ended I was left with, &quot;Wait a minute they ended too soon. Where's the rest of the story?&quot; The book set up too many plot lines on the planet surface that went unexplored. Such as the need for more amacolite. I thought they could have added about 10 more pages that found a reason, any reason, to go to the planet afterward and get their amacolite and see what normal life is like on the planet. Also don't read this book until you can find enough time to read it in one day. It is difficult to follow otherwise. This could be one of my favorites if there was a better ending."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"So here we have it.Throughout the years we have seen Star Trek books that are completely based on time-travel and restoring the timeline. So it was about time we get to see a novel that leans completely on the other science-fiction clish&eacute;: parallel universes.Inspite of the horrible premise &quot;Echoes&quot; holds itself together surprisingly well. Yes, the plot is virtually nonexistant, and the whole purpose of the book is to show us different Voyagers than the one we are used to. We get to follow two of these alternate Voyagers and their crew in this book, plus, of course, the 'regular' one.Unfortunately, the only things that are different in these alternate Voyagers in relation to the familiar one are the uniforms, hairstyles and minor differences in the layout of the interior design of the ship.The most annoying thing with this book is that it is a combination of few of the most popular Star Trek TV episodes and offers absolutely nothing new. It is apparent throughout the book wich episode is being copied with each scene.The biggest strenghts of the book are good characterization, and especially each Janeway is being portrayed extremely well. The other one is the fact that our universe isn't any more prominently portrayed as the other ones. At least one other, that is.The book doesn't take any risks. In fact it cannot take any risks. The ending becomes aparent after the very first chapters, and the novel isn't nearly as dark as it could, and probably should, have been.Entertaining, but has all the bad characteristics Voyager is infamous for."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"For several years now I've been reading all of the Star Trek series books in order of release dates. That said, up to the point in which \\"Echoes\\" was released, with few exceptions, most of the Voyager books left a lot to be desired. That is certainly not the case with this book. \\"Echoes\\" is an extremely exciting book that at it's core uses the standard plot line - we're in the Delta Quadrant and we're short on this or that supply, we need to stop and find it - which has been pretty much worked to death by the previous \\"Voyager\\" books.\\"Echoes\\" involves the Federation starship picking up some odd sensor readings, so they decide to investigate. Once Captain Janeway arrives, she and her crew are instantly involved in a tragedy so large in scale and magnitude, it seems almost unsolvable by one small ship. The residents of the planet have created a planet wide transporter system, and tied it into the planets core for power. This has disastrous results. Like clockwork, the transporter system kicks everybody on the planet over to the next \\"reality,\\" \\"plane of existence.\\" Where there's a planet, no problem, where there is not a planet, welcome to the vacuum of space.

And since Voyager met a parallel universe in a critical episode on the television series, it fits within the book.I enjoyed reading and seeing the subtle differences between the Voyagers -- although in the last half we hear and see and learn little of the planet they are trying to save. The climax occurs very late in the book, and the story ties up a little too tightly, but the characterizations make up for it.An enjoyable read -- the titles under the chapters are also unique and inviting, helping readers keep track of which universe and which \\"shift.\\" Definitely more reliable than the Stardate system. ;)"},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This book was the very first Star Trek book I had ever read.

The idea of multiple dimensions and Janeway over a com-line with various versions of herself from those dimensions is quite intriguing to me. While this is by no means a new idea, I enjoyed the manner in which the story was told.Since my reading this (in 2001) I've read numerous other Trek Books and this is still my favorite."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This is a very good book. The idea of parallel universies has always been a captivating one and the author handles this very well. A lot of small details of each character are brought out but most importantly you feel like the author is being true to the characters. I am currently reading Voyager #9 - Invasion #4 and you feel like the author has just watched a few episodes and doesn't understand the characters that well. This is certainly not the case with Echoes. Another reviewer complained about the ending of the book being too abrupt but to me, another ten pages explaning what happened after would have spoiled the book. The book ended prefectly."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"I agree with the sentiments of most in here, especially Barry Nabbs, when I say this is a definately MUST READ for a Voyager fan.

However, if you love Janeway and the way she aggresively takes command when the going gets rough, as well as her sensitive side, you really should read Echoes. it's a real treat because you are not only dealing with Voyager...but SEVERAL Voyagers with several crews.

But I'm happy with my score because I have been in IT for less than three months,with no hands on experience.I would also recommend you use something other than the practice exams software which comes with the book. I started to use it but it was not that good,so I used the Braindumps instead. The dumps along with this book were all I needed to pass the 70-210 exam.

Also as a freelance reviewer I never do comparative reviews, my reviews are based solely on the content of each book. This book ranks as one of the best for passing the 70-210 exams and will be a nice addition to my technical library.The book starts from the beginning with installing, configuring and administration of 2000 professional, then you move to administration of the resources, file &amp; print systems, troubleshooting, optimizing, networking, security and user accounts to make this one of the most complete books on the subject.Each chapter breaks down the topics in the smaller more understandable sections and gives you exercises to perform along the way to enhance the learning process. There are also questions, labs, a two-minute drill and self-test in each chapter.The book is also the perfect classroom book, as it seems to be tailored made for instructor lead classes. The book includes a cd-rom with CertTrainer, a lab simulator and ExamSim with adaptive practice exams. Finally there are over 30 minutes of audio material on the cd and also an electronic version of the book included.The authors have left no stone unturned and have given you a great opportunity to pass the exam the first tie around.

Not that the NT track was easy, but if you knew your facts, you would probably pass. Not so with 2000. The Shinder's book not only covers all of the objectives on the Professional exam, but it teaches it all to you in the same manner that Microsoft tests you on it. The exercises, the real-world type questions, and the CD make this a really comprehensive study tool. I passed the exam using this book, and I'm studying for Server now using their book. So far, it's just as good."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Professional Study Guide (EXAM 70-210)","review":"This is another great book by the Shinder's and the Syngress team.

I didn't need to read any other books, but I did do all of the labs and exercises at home a few times before attempting the exam.Tom and Deb Shinder have written many, many books on the Windows 2000 OS and all have been superb.

Had the information printed in this book been accurate you could probably consider it to be a \\"Getting Started\\" type book that introduces you to the basics of Windows 2000 Professional. This book was obviously put together in a rush to meet a marketing deadline. In fact, I consider it dishonest to say the least, if not criminal, to even put a \\"book\\" like this on the market and claim it to have 100% coverage for the 70-210 exam (and how it is \\"Microsoft Approved\\" beats me!). The answers to the questions are wrong, there are even different answers in the book than on the CD for the same questions! Here are some mistake examples: the switches for WINNT.EXE and WINNT32.EXE are mixed up with each other, they talk about right clicking a file to share, the names of files, tabs and other titles are incorrect, the authors have confused kilobytes and bytes when talking about the size of disk sectors and file sizes, one exercise starts by changing a drive from NTFS to FAT but somehow the exercise changes to changing a drive from FAT to NTFS half way through, System File Checker's and Sigverif.exe's functions and results are confused with each other, bottleneck limits mentioned are incorrect, hardware minimum requirements are wrong, (you'll find different values on different pages for the same item), the content and quality of the \\"videos\\" are appalling - they've been added on as an advertisement gimmick - they have no value whatsoever in preparing for the exam ... and the list goes on.I read this book from cover to cover and was disgusted with the amount of mistakes, inaccuracies and inadequate information - I marked each mistake with a Post-it note until I ran out of notes (after about 50). I read the book for a second time from cover to cover and also checked for the correct information from Windows Help. As I haven't ever taken any MCP tests before I had no idea what the tests were like and relied on the book's CertTrainer and ExamSim questions to give me an idea. I recently took the exam and got the shock of my life when I saw the questions - this book does nothing to prepare you for the exam, the difference between the questions in this book and the actual test are like day and night. Many of the questions in the exam require networking expertise; this book does nothing to prepare you in that area.Needless to say, I failed the exam miserably and I don't really know what to do now. I knew everything in this book, after taking the exam I realized that the information in the book is even more inaccurate than I had thought and doesn't come close to being adequate. I would appreciate it if somebody could let me know where to find practice tests that actually resemble the real exam.Unfortunately I had already bought the 70-215 book before completing this book and before realizing what a total disaster it is. I shall throw the 70-215 book away unread - the money wasted buying these books is nothing compared to the time wasted reading them.

Well, of course you never needed to reinstall components after installing a service pack. In WinNT you needed to reinstall the service pack after installing new Windows components. Or &quot;Once you format a disk or portion of the disk, you can set aside all or part of the formatted space as a partition&quot;, p. 269. Hello, editor! You format a disk after you partition it, not before. There are dozens of equally egregious errors.And the questions at the end of the chapters are completely useless.

There is a lot of good information in it, but the lack of technical precision, and lack of attention to detail is very frustrating in the text of this book. For example, Three different minimum supported memory requirements are given in the first two chapters. One exam watch point calls our attention the fact that Winnt, and Winnt32 switches are different, but then Page 178 gives an example of a Winnt32 command, but it uses all Winnt switches. There are numerous examples in this book of the actual text being a direct contradiction of text elsewhere in the book. I thought there must be posted errata, but upon not finding it on Syngress' web site, I e-mailed their support to ask for this information. However, instead of a response to the questions on the more than 10 direct contradictions I found in the first four chapters, I only received an automated reply with a URL to register. However, since this product was not listed on the page referenced in the URL, so it was not possible to register for support.Additionally, I needed a reference for many command line tasks I schedule in NT (like updating r-disk information) that just do not appear in this book.There is a lot of good information, but let the reader beware of the contradictions in details.

It was the most complete book of its genre to be published at the time, and is still the standard against which other regional hurricane histories are judged. The late David Ludlum was a stickler for detail, and it shows. No matter whether you are interested in systems that affected Maine or Texas, this book delivers. The reader can see his enthusiasm in the text. One of the few flaws is its total lack of pictures. Granted, satellite and radar were new technologies in 1963, but even mere damage pictures are absent from this book. At a glance, Gulf Coast storms seem to get less attention that their Atlantic counterparts. This is not the author's fault, however, since data/newspapers from that region are extremely scarce before 1870. It does, however, include tracks when possible....it some cases, back to 1800. This is a feat still in the making for the official maintainer of hurricane records in the United States, the National Hurricane Center. Whether you're a historian of United States history or a hurricane nut, this is your book. How Ludlum intertwines history and past storms is a marvel to behold.

Joe is living with his mother in 1950s East End London, where he is always surrounded by hard-working people. From his neighbour Mr. Kandinsky and the wrestler Shmule to the shop owner Mrs. Abramowitz, little Joe is accompanied by people who are very fond of him and who take good care of him.As all of Joe's acquaintances seem to need a little bit of luck in their lives, Joe brings home a unicorn (which is actually a goat) since he hopes that his \`unicorn' will fulfil his friends some wishes. Mr. Kandinsky needs a steam press for his shop and Shmule needs to buy a ring for his beloved Sonia. Joe and his mother also have a wish - to join Joe's father in Africa. Will Joe's \`unicorn' really be able to fulfil all these wishes?A Kid for Two Farthings is a lovely book full of wonderful people who work very hard and who have humble wishes. Although they are very busy, Joe's neighbours still make time for little Joe because the boy doesn't really have anyone to talk to, since his father is away and his mother is working. Joe really likes to be surrounded by his neighbours, because he can ask them many questions and thus, he gets the attention he needs. In return, Joe wants to do everything in order to see his friends happy. That's why he brings home a \`unicorn' - the little boy hopes that his new \`pet' will grant all of their wishes.I really liked this touching book and I liked reading about little Joe. The little boy is very curious and has a great imagination. He believes in the magic of his \`unicorn' and he wants to help his friends and see them happy. Joe is very playful and inventive; he always wants to know everything and that's why I liked him so much. I also liked the other characters, as they are all very friendly, humble and warm, despite the fact that their lives are hard. Mr. Kandinsky is a very great person and he is like a grandfather to Joe. When the little boy brings home his \`unicorn', Mr. Kandinsky doesn't tell Joe the truth, because he sees how happy Joe is. Therefore, he lets Joe believe that his goat is a unicorn, which can grant wishes and make people happy. Mr. Kandinsky encourages Joe's imagination and creativity and that's why I liked him so much!Overall, I must say that A Kid for Two Farthings was a great book, which I enjoyed very much. It's a quick read and I recommend this adorable little book to everyone who likes to read books set in the past and to everyone who likes to read a heart-warming and hopeful story."},{"Title":"A kid for two farthings;","review":"Reason for Reading: I love early 20th century British lit. and I'm enchanted by the entire line of The Bloomsbury Group reprints.Summary: Joe is six years old, lives on a street near Whitechapel which seems to be the Jewish quarter. Joe and his mother live in a room above Mr. Kadinsky's tailor shop; he is a trousers maker and his assistant Shmule is a young engaged pugilist training to work his way through the ranks to becoming a champion. Joe's father has gone to Africa to make a life for them and will be sending for him and his mother sometime. Joe mostly spends his days with Mr. Kadinsky in the shop while his mother works all day and Kadinsky is a talker and storyteller. He's told Joe the story of unicorns and why they no longer live in England but since everyone seems to be wishing for something Joe decides to check out the market anyway. If he can buy a unicorn he can make everyone's wishes come true and on that day what does he find but a unicorn, now the owner seems to think he's a crippled goat but Joe knows a baby unicorn when he sees one. You can even see the nub of his magical horn starting to grow in the centre of his forehead so Joe brings him home and Kadinsky pays for him. Perhaps now Joe can see that all his friends' humble wishes will come true.Comments: This is a touching heart-warming story, what I would rather call a novella than a novel coming in at 128 pages and only that because of the large font. At first one is puzzled whether this might be a story for children, with the large font and the six year old protagonist. But it is not. We are shown all the poverty of the immigrant living conditions and the hardships of working continuously just to get by. Sure there are parts a child would enjoy, but not overall. The book is told in the third person and though we see things through Joe, a child's point of view for the majority of the time we also see from Mr. Kadinsky's where the tone and subject matter become deeper. Discussions of trade unions, business dealing and wrestling matches put the book above a children's story. Joe himself is a wise little boy who has learnt a lot in his adult world and often speaks with a deep wisdom that can only come from a child who has been in the adult world. But Joe is a sweet, kind, loving boy with an innocence about him that his world has not touched. He believes in unicorns and magic and this belief may just be enough to enrich everyone's lives. Wonderful characters and an inspiring ending, this book will sure to please readers who like to read about simpler times and want a good, clean read."},{"Title":"A kid for two farthings;","review":"Whimsical little story set among the Jewish community of London's East End of the 30s. Vivid descriptions transport you to a very different world- the markets, the struggling clothing manufacturers, the wrestling matches...The hero of the book, 6 year old Joe, lives with his mother (his father is away in Africa on unspecified business) over Mr Kandinsky's tailor shop. While his mother works at a milliner's, Joe spends most of his time with the tailor, and a bond grows between them.Mr Kandinsky tells Joe about unicorns, a wonderful description combining magic and pragmatism:'Every animal when it was made by the Almighty was given one extra-special present...But the unicorn got the most special present of all. He was given a magic horn...It could grant anybody's wish- straight off. And this horn consequently was worth 10,000 cash on sight'.So when Joe sees a unicorn (a small deformed goat) going for five bob, he has to have it. Whether it manages to grant the wishes of Joe's friends (a victory in the wrestling ring for Shmule, a trouser press for Mr Kandinsky and the return of his father from Africa), you will have to see.Although targeted at an adult audience by Bloomsbury Press, I have another edition which is certainly a children's book with illustrations; I would say it could be enjoyed by either group."},{"Title":"The Making of Toro: Bullfights, Broken Hearts and One Author's Quest for the Acclaim He Deserves","review":"&quot;The Making of Toro&quot; is one of those books (like, say, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;) that may not make much of a splash when it first appears, but that is destined to be passed from hand to hand and reader to reader until a small cult builds around it and its author.For starters, this book is flat-out hilarious. But it also marks the arrival of a writer who is bound to make a huge impact. Comparisons with Eggers and Sedaris aren't out of line: Sundeen blurs the line between memoir and fiction with the requisite postmodern relish. &quot;Toro&quot; is a tale told by a narrator so charmingly unreliable and self-deluded that we actually can't help rooting for him.But the writer Sundeen most resembles is probably Mark Twain (seriously!). In &quot;Toro&quot; (and in his earlier book &quot;Car Camping&quot;), Sundeen shows the same dry wit, the same trust that the reader will actually get the joke, and the same faith that sometimes the naive, deluded bumbler might see truths that more worldly types do not. And, like Twain, Sundeen conceals genuine depth beneath light humor. &quot;Toro&quot; begins as a comedy, but by the end it deepens into a surpringly poignant coming of age story.So buy this book--it's funny and original and thoroughly enjoyable--then pass it on."},{"Title":"The Making of Toro: Bullfights, Broken Hearts and One Author's Quest for the Acclaim He Deserves","review":"Sundeen has done it again. This is another deep, multi-layered composition much like &quot;Car Camping&quot;.

Whenever I read a book like this, I hope for one or two passages that will resonate within me and justify (in my head) my own experiences. This book is filled with them."},{"Title":"The Making of Toro: Bullfights, Broken Hearts and One Author's Quest for the Acclaim He Deserves","review":"A great story told in a simple and colorful tone. Mark Sundeen is a great American writer who melds the classics with the modern. A tale of travel that envelopes the reader in characters and color."},{"Title":"The Making of Toro: Bullfights, Broken Hearts and One Author's Quest for the Acclaim He Deserves","review":"I really like Mark Sundeen. I feel like he's a kindred spirit, even some of his reminisced memories are similar to mine. He is a writer who wants to have preconceived notions and delusions of grandeur, yet he also realizes where he truly fits in his oft-referenced \\"canon.\\" Basically--I like his style. He's pretty rad.The Making of Toro is about his ill-fated quest to cover bullfighting, in both Spain and Mexico, and to turn it into a book for a book deal he has already received an advance for. Car Camping-style, his quest is filled with mishaps and missteps. But Sundeen takes it all in stride, all the strange characters, all the failed attempts at relationships or even just hopes of relationships. Sundeen calls himself, his literary heroic alterego, Travis LaFrance. All things are possible through Travis LaFrance.Sundeen often mentions that his life is not interesting enough for literature. That's where Travis LaFrance comes in. He *is* literature. He *is* that interesting spark in life. \\"My life is my art and versa vice.\\" But what I really like is that Sundeen (intentionally, for obvious reasons), undersells himself. His life actually is interesting as literature. He has enough cynicism and self-doubt to turn his bizarre vignettes into a narrative that ends with a small, understated emotional punch that leaves you a little empty, a little wanting more, and a little inspired.--- ---\\"that which we do is never as pretty as that which we think about\\" (83)\\"There's still freedom left in the country, ... but you gotta walk two days from the end of the road to find it.\\" (141)\\"You must write for yourself. It must be personal, not commercial. The writer must have no ego. His work is a service to mankind.\\" (95)"},{"Title":"The Making of Toro: Bullfights, Broken Hearts and One Author's Quest for the Acclaim He Deserves","review":"Cleverly plotted and well-executed, packed with dancing, ironic prose and endearing characters, Mark Sundeen's The Making of Toro was an excellent read. Fun, light and true, this short excursion across the border into Mexico's bullfighting culture had me bent over and sniveling with laughter. I smile to think of it.This book is an easy-going, comedic exploration into the sad impotence of modern American masculinity. Set against the backdrop of the bloody bullring and the grit of Mexico City, the reader sees what the protagonist himself is not able to recognize - that he is not his alter-ego Travis La France, the great bullfighter and irresistable romantic - that he is in fact simply an author and a man, accident-prone and lovable, trying to set the record straight about his misunderstood first novel, and doing his best to amend himself for being the man that he is, and not the man he would like to be."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"Charity investigator Callie Webber finally seems to be having some joy in her life. Although heartbroken by the death of her beloved husband in a boating accident, she has just started to explore a relationship with Tom Bennett, Callie's boss and the philanthropist behind the J.O.S.H.U.A. Foundation. As they are ending their vacation together in the North Carolina mountains they receive a devastating call; Eli Gold, Tom's friend and Callie's mentor, has just been shot and his last words before sliding into unconsciousness were to ask for the couple's help.After rushing to Eli's bedside they discover that he had been tracking down a woman he had thought was dead but is apparently very much alive. Callie also learns that Eli has been hiding his own secret past, namely his history with the National Security Agency and his ties with the mysterious woman. As Tom and Callie follow the trail to the Caribbean island of St. John they find themselves involved in a complicated scheme involving art fraud, secret identities, and double-crosses. Complicating matters is that just as Callie allows herself to believe that it's possible to find two loves in a lifetime she must confront Tom's own past and whether she has enough trust left in her to believe in him.Although labeled an inspirational Christian mystery, Quarter for a Kiss easily crosses into the mainstream thriller genre with its fascinating plot and fast pace. The action speeds up as Tom and Callie use his rock climbing skills to stage an elaborate break-in into an extensively guarded home and coordinate their investigation with federal agents. One of the most entertaining scenes is the detailed description of Callie's attempt to place bugs within the home of their suspect by using actual bug traps. Additionally, Clark so vividly paints a picture of St. John that the reader feels the breezes and sees the clear ocean. The author successfully creates great characters that are conflicted and very real, from Jodi, Eli's immature adult daughter, to Sergeant Abraham Ruhl, the St. John's police officer who is unwilling to give up his investigation to Interpol or the NAS. Of course, Clark's greatest achievement comes with Callie and Tom, who are both very engaging and slowly building a stronger relationship together. Callie's wit, investigative skills, perseverance, and faith will ensure the success of this fourth entry in the winning Million Dollar Mystery series."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"Tom and Callie finally get to spend some time getting to know each other in person. Almost alone at a retreat in North Carolina, one week has stretched into three, but the real world is calling again and they must reluctantly part ways.Just as they reach the airport, Callie gets a phone call from Stella Gold. Her husband Eli has just been shot by a sniper and is in surgery. Before loosing consciousness, he specifically asked for the two of them to come. Since Eli is such a good friend, they drop everything and rush to his bed side.A PI, Callie wants to figure out what happened to Eli. The only clue is a warning from someone named Nadine. When Eli and Stella's condo is searched, it is further proof that someone is after him. Where might he have hidden his notes? And why did Eli request Tom's presence?As this series has progressed, the plots have only gotten strong, and this book is no exception. It starts with a bang and keeps right on going. Every time an answer comes, it only leaves more questions. Yet Callie and Tom keep digging, getting themselves further and further in trouble. While some things seemed obvious a little early on, there are still several nice twists along the way that keep the reader guessing.Fans of the series will be happy to learn that Tom is a very active part of this book instead of only a presence like in previous entries. In fact, we even get to learn what he does, finally. His relationship with Callie continues to grow as she continues to move on from her husband's death. In fact, one of the strong points of the series is watching Callie finally truly deal with her grief.The writing style is still a little rough, keeping the reader a little more at bay by telling instead of showing. It's not a big problem, however, and I found myself staying up too late reading every night to see what would happen in the next chapter.The only problem with this book is the cliffhanger ending. Even though I saw it coming (I've read the back of the next book already), it still left me wanting to pick up the next book right away. Which isn't really a bad thing at all.With a strong plot and great characters, this Christian mystery series is wonderful entertainment."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"The latest in the Million Dollar Mysteries series is, as always with this author's work, better than the last (and that was pretty good to begin with). Her characters are deepening, she has a gift for plot and structure, and she leaves you wishing she could write the next book fast enough to read as soon as you're done with this one. As Callie and her new beau (and still boss) Tom investigate the shooting of an old, dear friend, the stakes are higher than usual, the emotions are more intense and the story is propelled forward more forcefully. The secrets are many, the solutions make sense and the reader is left wanting more.

To sum up how I felt after finishing 'A Quarter for a Kiss' in one word would be...Wow!This was not the first time I've read 'A Quarter for a Kiss' (I read the entire 'Million Dollar Mysteries' series years ago), but I was still captivated by the story and read it in about one day!!! I now want to finish the series by reading 'The Buck Stops Here' again.I loved 'A Dime a Dozen', but 'A Quarter for a Kiss' was even better! It's definitely one of my favorite books!A 'Quarter for a Kiss' ends with such a cliff-hanger that I can hardly wait to read 'The Buck Stops Here' and continue Callie and Tom's story.All-in-all this is definitely a book that I recommend if you enjoy a great mystery with romance and don't mind being \\"on-the-edge-of-your-seat\\"!*I received a complimentary copy for my review.

I recently read book three and really enjoyed it so I decided to give this book a shot too! I was not disappointed.In A Quarter for a Kiss Callie is vacationing with her beau Tom when their mutual friend Eli gets shot. Eli is like a father to Callie and she is devastated. Tom and Callie rush to Eli's side and when they get there they see Eli is struggling to live but he has told his wife that Tom and Callie can help figure out what happened to him. This starts an investigation that sends them to the Virgin Islands is search of Eli's shooter. Little do they know about the mystery they will unravel?This book was quite an adventure for Callie and Tom. There are all sorts of pieces to a major puzzle that they have to put together and I was intrigued with all the little details that emerged to find out what happened to Eli. This wasn't as dangerous feeling as the last book was until you got to the last 100 pages or so. That is when the action really picked up and you were on the edge of your seat.A Quarter for a Kiss had a lot more about Tom and Callie's relationship than the previous books, which was enjoyable. We got to learn some of the mystery surrounding Tom and we also were able to see them grow closer together and it was very touching. However, I won't spoil the ending but there is a new development that emerges that will forever affect Tom and Callie's relationship and I know I will be looking in to book five to figure out what they will do.If you have enjoyed the previous Million Dollar Mysteries than be sure to read A Quarter for a Kiss. Great page turner, intriguing mystery and a delightful romance!!Disclosure: I was graciously provided a free copy of this book from FIRST Wild Card Tours in exchange for my honest review and opinion. All opinions are my own."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"The first book in the Million Dollar Mysteries that you get to see Callie and Tom work so closely together. Clark drives the story along amongst breathtaking scenery, and mounting action. She kept me turing the pages and I finished the story in a short time. The Christianity part wasn't overbearing. I enjoyed being able to see a bit more of Tom, and can't wait to read what the next book will tell of him and Callie.The only flaw with the series is that the story is \\"told\\" to you. I feel as if I don't get to feel and see as Callie actually does, that she is holding me slightly at bay. For a story written in FP POV, I'd like to have more of my senses involved. But it still is a good read."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"The Million Dollar Mysteries by Mindy Starnes Clark was wonderful!

Are Tom and Callie ever going to have a Happy Ever After??"},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"A Quarter for a Kiss by Mindy Starns Clark is the fourth book in the Million Dollar Mystery series. Callie Webber and her boyfriend, Tom Bennett, are just finishing up their first vacation together and are regretting their return to the real world when she gets a terrifying phone call. Eli, her mentor and father figure, was shot by a sniper and before going unconscious gave instructions to his wife Stella to tell Callie to find his notes and that she would need Tom's help. The pair head down to the Virgin Islands in hopes of solving the mystery Eli was working in and learn who tried to kill him. Clark manages to mix just the right amount of suspense, thrills, and romance to keep the pages turning and pulses pounding. I'm not normally a big fan of romantic suspense novels, but Clark's elevates this above the standard fare. I could not put this book down! I hope I don't have to wait long for the next one."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"While I read and enjoyed the previous book in this series, A Dime a Dozen, I wasn't crazy about it. Consequently, I began this book, A Quarter for a Kiss with some trepidation. In the end, all my worry was for naught! The story kicks off with a great start and, really, doesn't slow down till the end. Besides being a bit wordy in areas, from start to finish I completely enjoyed this book.Maybe one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much more was because Tom was with Callie during this investigation. I loved watching these two interact and deal with the case. Through it all, Tom and Callie's relationship felt so...natural. Believable. They spent time together, enjoyed each other's company, often were tempted, but each time triumphed over the temptation. One point that Mindy drove home that I just loved was when Callie had to urge Tom to leave her room. They were getting tempted, and the reason she made him leave her room was because she loved him. I saw that, and silently applauded Mindy Clark. I don't think I've seen it put just that way in a book before, but it is all so true.The plot was, once again, very intricate and complex. I kept trying to figure out \\"who dunnit\\", but once again...had a hard time doing that! In the end, I was able to deduce who one of the bad guys was before Callie and Tom. I felt so proud of myself. (lol!) There wasn't anything inappropriate in this book outside of a few kisses exchanged between Callie and Tom and an old affair that they uncovered during their investigation. Mindy doesn't go into detail in either area and keeps the whole story very clean as a whole.I finished the book with batted breath and was so pleased at how everything came down. But then that last scene totally threw me! Way to go, Mindy Clark, ending with a cliffhanger!! Now I am going to have to get my hands on a copy of the next book as soon as possible. Tom might have a rough past, but Callie hasta forgive him--those two are so perfect for each other! If you're into mysteries, then I don't think you can go wrong by looking Mindy Clark up. Her books are sure to keep you entertained and deducing for hours, right along with Callie the sleuth!I reviewed this book for FIRST Wild Card Tour.

Somehow along the way, though, I missed out on the final two books in the series. Thankfully, though, A Quarter for a Kiss came my way, and I absolutely loved it!This series is reminiscent of the Nancy Drew mysteries that I grew up loving. Just the perfect amount of mystery and a smidge (or more!) of tasteful romance thrown in. I love this genre of mystery stories (if there are genres within mysteries). It's good, old-fashioned sleuthing / detective work.I absolutely loved Callie's character and found myself wishing we could be friends. She seriously has the coolest job - investigating charities so that she can give them money! Clark weaves together an intriguing plot that keeps you guessing as to what will come next. The way Callie seems to just \\"stumble\\" into trouble makes her endearing and kept me rooting for her to solve the mystery until the very end.If you haven't read the previous books in the series, you'll have no trouble picking up here. However, my guess is that you will want to go back and read the rest! I highly recommend this entire series and can't wait to read the conclusion!I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my fair and honest review."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"Callie is one step closer to finding a new start and the love of her life when another mystery stops her in her tracks, putting her life, and that of her friend in peril.

I am about to read the next one so I might change my mind. While the first three books started off slow, this one started out from the beginning keeping you in suspense. It was at least 1/3 through the other books before it even got suspenseful. Also in this book we learn a great deal about the mysterious Tom Bennett. We learn about his past and his connection to Eli. We also learn some secrets about Eli but I won't mention it here and spoil the story for you. Callie and Tom's romance grows stronger in this one. Another thing about this book and I believe which has already been mentioned is that this book ends on a cliffhanger. None of her other books have done this. I'm starting book five which is the last. I regret it is the last. I'm going to miss Callie and Tom."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"The entire series has been exceptional. I have learned a lot about charitable organizations while enjoying the mysteries. Mindy Starns Clark is one of my favorite authors and she did a great job on this book. Each book has had a major mystery, but a secondary one in the person of Tom. It has been interesting as we have learned more about Tom in each book. I think a movie series could be made of these outstanding stories - expecially this one."},{"Title":"A Quarter for a Kiss (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 4)","review":"In the North Carolina Mountains, Callie and Tom spend three weeks together becoming acquainted in person with one another after only meeting over the telephone due to work. Tom is the philanthropist behind the J.O.S.H.U.A. Project while Callie investigates non-profit groups for grant suitability. Tom introduces Callie to his favorite hobby, mountain climbing while Callie does likewise with canoeing. Both feel something special connects them.As their time together draws to a close, Stella Gold calls to tell them that her spouse, Eli the man who brought Callie and Tom together has been shot. They rush to Cape Canaveral to visit Eli in the hospital. The ailing Eli asks Callie and Tom to find out who shot him. The duo would refuse nothing if Eli asked so they begin investigating and soon find themselves in danger in the Virgin Islands from someone who wants certain truths to remain hidden.The fourth Million Dollar Mystery' is a fantastic story that moves the series forward on a personal level as well as providing the audience with a delightful who-done-it. The relationship between Tom and Callie evolves beautifully as each finds they are falling in love with the other, but has baggage holding them back. The amateur sleuth inquiries is cleverly handled because of Callie, who though she is not a detective, her work makes her something more than an amateur. Mindy Starns Clark keeps the suspense going from the moment the dynamic pair reach Florida until the final confrontation in St. Johns and the romance blossoming from the first wall climb to the closing discussion making the upcoming half dollar tale something to look forward to reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Sicilian Romance","review":"I've read all of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, except for her last one. I must admit that this novel is not as good as The Mysteries of Udolpho. But I think when reading this novel it's important to keep in mind why Ann Radcliffe wrote it in the first place.It's impossible to appreciate Ann Radcliffe's intentions in writing this book and the complexities of The Italian without having first read Matthew &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis' The Monk. Lewis was so inspired by The Mysteries of Udolpho that he wrote The Monk, which has characters engaging in activities that are horrifying. (Lewis became so identified with his book that he was nicknamed Monk Lewis.) Mrs. Radcliffe was very upset that Lewis was inspired by her book to write his. In response to The Monk, Mrs. Radcliffe wrote The Italian. Mrs. Radcliffe &quot;corrected&quot; in The Italian what she felt was wrong and horrifying about The Monk.For anyone who finds The Italian lacking at all, I highly recommend he or she read The Monk to gain a better understanding of what Ann Radcliffe was trying to accomplish. And for anyone who has not read The Italian yet, read The Monk first- then I'm sure you will find The Italian a much more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Sicilian Romance","review":"This is the first book I have read by Radcliffe, and only the second gothic novel I have read. It is, by all standards of style and method, a gothic novel--so I doubt there is any need to elaborate on the moods, the romanticized environmental settings, or the literary devices found in the novel. As far as the writing itself goes, it becomes clear that the author is a very young and relatively inexperienced writer. The two major flaws of the novel that bothered me the most are: 1.) There is a great deal of redundancy in how the events unfold. For example, several times various characters would find themselves lost in the woods, suddenly see a faint light in the distance, follow the light, then find themselves in a perilous situation, only to escape by a similar means. This type of formulated plot was prevalent throughout the entire novel. 2.) Radcliffe seldom utilized transitional phrases. Often, paragraphs would shift from one location or person to another location or person with no transitional phrases such as \\"meanwhile\\", or \\"back at the castle\\", etc. The next sentence would just be about something different.In the simplest description, the plot was about a tyrannical, ambitious father who tries to marry off his daughter to regain his social standing and wealth. His daughter, whose heart belongs to another, escapes the castle, and proceeds to experience one perilous adventure after the other. But this is not really what the novel is about. It appears to me that it is more about the difference between men and women. In Radcliffe's world, the majority of men are to some degree corrupt, power-hungry, ruthless, debauched, selfish, insensitive, and tyrannical--and the effect these men have on the persons and environment around them is usually tragic. Even the presence of the few virtuous men in her novel seems to create in the women around them feelings of turmoil and anxiety. Even when they evoke the feelings of love, it is always bitter-sweet and agonizing. When men are present all is awry; violent thunderstorms cloud the sky, and even the natural environments are treacherous, gloomy or desolate. But not so with women! All women but one in this novel are virtuous, pious, demure, pure, innocent, submissive, and noble, and the natural environments that surround them are serene, beautiful, inviting, and sublime-at least until a man arrives. Throughout the novel women are constantly victimized by men, and Radcliffe seems to suggest that only when left to themselves can women be find peace and happiness in this world. Of course, considering the few rights and privileges enjoyed by women during her time (1764-1823), one can hardly blame her.Overall, I found the book a bit too tedious to really be enjoyable. Reviews site her novel The Mysteries of Udolfo as be her best, though I have not read this one. I would only recommend this book if you are serious about reading all the gothic novels you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"A Sicilian Romance","review":"My favourite novel of Ann Radcliffe's is The Mysteries of Udolpho, but I think A Sicilian Romance is a promise of what Mrs. Radcliffe will be able to accomplish in her later books. For Ann Radcliffe and Gothic romance fans, this novel is a must because it plays on all of the classic themes of the genre. This is also great escapist reading to a world very much unlike our own. Radcliffe's heroines and heroes do suffer greatly and go through some extraordinary (perhaps sometimes unbelievable) events, but I find it thoroughly enjoyable to read about their adventures as I am a true romantic at heart. It's good to read about a world where when virtuous people are put through struggles at the hands of villians, the heroines and heroes are able to triumph."},{"Title":"A Sicilian Romance","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie.

On occasion, it grudgingly concedes the existence of other things, like R&amp;B, country, and rock and roll. Oh, wait--I already mentioned rock and roll.

The premier denouncer of rock among pop singers, Frank Sinatra, is included, however, though Perry Como, who had many times more hits, is nowhere to be found. The Beatles are mentioned any number of times in the introduction, because, naturally, anyone consulting a record price guide will want to know about all things Beatles. Cliche City, U.S.A.

Although I would have preferred a textbook with instructor materials to save me some prep time (there are none), this was the best choice out there. I reviewed at least 5-6 other wireless security books and this one had a good intro section on security basics and lots of great material on tools, threats, solutions, etc. I would highly recommend this book to anyone studying wireless security or someone in the field who needs some practical guidance on protecting WLANs."},{"Title":"Taming the Wild Field: Colonization and Empire on the Russian Steppe","review":"While analyzing the geography of a country and the influences on its history is not a novel concept (Richard Pipes has a fascinating first chapter in Russia under the Old Regime detailing that), I found Sunderland's approach to be original and provocative through its complexity. He focuses on just one geographic form, namely the Russian steppe, and builds his argument brilliantly: in his view, the intellectuals and political officials of the 18th and 19th centuries transformed Russia, through the colonization of its wide steppe, from a nation initially viewed as barbaric, with vast lands of wilderness, to a serious European player. The steppe certainly is for Sunderland not an arbitrary choice, but rather serves as metaphor for the wide, agriculturally challenging unknown.Perhaps the most useful idea for me to take away from this book was the clear distinction between imperialism and colonialism that the author makes. Too often these two terms are being used interchangeably, and yet they are not at all synonyms. Unlike imperialism, which suggests complete subordination of new territories, colonialism suggests transfers of population, allowing them, however, to continue to exercise their political loyalties to their original country. In that regard, I considered the most illustrative description of that specific distinction to be made as part of the chapter detailing the changes implemented during the reign of Catherine II. Arguably an \\"enlightened despot,\\" the empress \\"opened the gates\\" to the steppe with almost no restrictions whatsoever. People's preferences and aspirations were very little important in the official view compared to the sheer desire to populate those lands.One cannot satisfy all questions in such an already vast undertaking, but still I do have at least two curiosities. First, especially since Sunderland links so much of his comparisons to the American wild west, I would have liked to know in further detail whether captives like the ones from the famous Pugachev rising were exiled throughout the steppe lands. Secondly, and possibly more importantly, I would have enjoyed learning about the tensions amongst the various ethnic groups that populated the steppe. I cannot imagine that did not exist, especially since it seems there was no coherent plan implemented as part of the colonization process, so such occurrence almost seems inevitable."},{"Title":"Taming the Wild Field: Colonization and Empire on the Russian Steppe","review":"The great nineteenth-century historian Kliuchevsky observed that colonization was the basic fact of Russian history. In \\"Taming the Wild Field,\\" Willard Sunderland has offered readers one of the best books on this crucial aspect of Russia's past. Based on years of research--much of it in overlooked Russian archives--rich with insight, and written with rare elegance, \\"Taming the Wild Field\\" should be read by everyone interested in the \\"big questions\\" of Russian history."},{"Title":"Taming the Wild Field: Colonization and Empire on the Russian Steppe","review":"The book is not so interesting even tho I will read it in a better mood sooner o later!"},{"Title":"Arco How to Become a U.S. Citizen","review":"The book was informative and useful. My techer called it a goldmine."},{"Title":"Alcatraz","review":"Richard Cecil's dry wit shines in this volume of poetry. From cold sweat of interviewing in &quot;San Francisco Modern Language Convention&quot; to contemplating death vs. just living on in &quot;Writing with Olive&quot;, _Alcatraz_ offers elegance that says &quot;right on, man&quot; that grows sweeter with time."},{"Title":"Time-Kissed Destiny","review":"I love time travel romances, especially modern woman-meets past century man. What didn't work for me in this novel was the fact that the hero (Michael) thought the heroine (Kate) was a big fat liar for 99 percent of the book. He didn't believe her \\"I'm from the future story\\" despite the S.C.U.B.A equipment and her contact lenses that she had as proof. I mean, I suppose if someone told me he was from the future, I might scoff, but if he was in his flying car or hovercraft, I might be less skeptical. True, a contact lens isn't a hovercraft, but it's enough to make you start suspecting that something less than normal is going on.The contact lens plot device bothered me too. I wear contacts, and back in the eighties and nineties you used to have to clean and \\"cook\\" them in a little box every night, or else they killed your eyes. The fact that she keeps them in drinking glasses full of seawater and then rinses them with fresh water doesn't make much sense. You can't rinse them with water. The minerals in water coat the lenses and make them impossible to wear. This seems a minor detail and kind of nit-picky of me to bring up, but if you're going to introduce a plot point like that and make it important later and then never come back to it is kind of frustrating for the reader. What did she do with her lenses for the rest of the book? Did she have to toss them and have bad eyesight? I dunno. I guess the writer didn't feel it was important enough to mention later on, but it bothered me that she dropped it.The bigger issue I had with the romance was (and spoiler coming, but you probably guessed this already since it's a romance novel)why would you marry a guy who thought you were a big fat liar? Moreover, why would the guy marry someone he thought was a big fat liar? He never even believed her story was a possibility, and they never resolved that before they married. Then suddenly, at the end of the book (new spoiler warning inserted) they're transported to the future, and that's the end! We get an epilogue of some dude (who must have been a recurring character throughout a series of time-travel romances by this author) who is reflecting on all the couples he brought together and now it's time to move on. Kate spent so much time in Michael's world, adjusting to it, and doing without modern conveniences (like contact lens supplies and birth control! D'oh!) that I would have like to have seen Michael assimilation into the modern world. I don't give a crap about this other guy and his accomplishments.And is it really a good idea to have sex when you're time traveling? I mean, you don't know if it's permanent or temporary, and you have no birth control. Bad idea, dudes. At least Kate could have had a moment of panic afterwards, thinking \\"Oh, crap! I could get pregnant back in a time when women died in childbirth all the time! And there's no cure for venereal disease!\\" It would have made the story more real to me. Plus, I kept thinking the whole time they were on the island \\"I bet her legs and armpits could use a good shave.\\" I guess it would have detracted from the romance due to the \\"ick\\" factor. I'm sure they both had nasty body odor and breath, but that's not exactly sexy for the reader. I just couldn't help but think of it though, since many modern women are very conscious about those things.Plus, I could see the \\"big reveal\\" about why Michael's mother hated him coming a mile away."},{"Title":"Time-Kissed Destiny","review":"A wonderful time-travel, romance.

In merely an hour, I read the first 100 pages, I've never read anything that quickly before. This novel will literally have you on the edge of your seat, capturing you're full attention until the very end. The connection & ignited fire Michael & Kate possess is absolutely breath-taking.Even though this novel was written in \\"87\\" it's extremely easy to relate to.

A great read."},{"Title":"Time-Kissed Destiny","review":"I loved how this series of books connected together and revolved around each other. Intriguing story line. Good read."},{"Title":"World of Leonardo 1452 1519","review":"One of the greatest accolades that can be bestowed on a person is, if you will pardon my sexist language, \\"A Renaissance man.\\" This is of course a reference to the ideal behind the statement, Leonardo da Vinci, in my opinion, the most talented person who has ever lived. The range of his talents is incredible. The \\"Mona Lisa\\" and \\"The Last Supper\\" are two of the most recognized pieces of art in the world, so they alone would have made a career. From this book, you can learn of his enormous achievements, as well as see glimpses of what might have been lost.He was also in more ways than one a visionary. His drawings of the turbulence of water as it flows across obstructions describe it precisely, something that was not verified until the invention of slow motion photography. He helped invent the science of human anatomy, and his drawings were so precise that they can still be used in anatomy classes today. Some of the other scientific achievements listed in this book where he was most likely the first to describe the phenomenon are:* The laws of phyllotaxy, which governs the distribution of leaves in plants.* The laws of heliotropism and geotropism, which govern the growth of plants towards the sun and into the earth.* He was able to determine the age of plants and trees by studying their features such as the annual rings.* He described features of the human heart and was very close to the discovery of the circulation of blood, something that was not accurately described until a century later.* There is a passage in one of his notebooks, \\"Make glasses in order to see the moon large.\\" This, in conjunction with his demonstrated knowledge of optics, indicates that he perhaps knew how to build or perhaps even did build a telescope.* He correctly identified fossils for what they are and was the first to describe the formation of sedimentary rock.* His sketch of a photometer to measure the intensity of light was just as functional as the actual one invented three centuries later.* While he didn't quite get there, it is clear from his writings that he was very close to describing the physical principle of inertia. In fact, the principle of inertia was called the principle of Leonardo for many years.* He sketched out what was the equivalent of a piston moving in a cylinder, apparently the first time such a device was described.This list could be continued, and it must be noted that much of his written work has in fact been lost. It is simply mind-boggling to speculate on the number of additional marvels that he conceived and described in his notebooks, but will probably remain forever unknown.He was also the first to construct an aerial view map. His sketch of the watershed of the Arno River, complete with elevations, has a quality that was not exceeded until the advent of manned flight and photography. Leonardo was also a first rate military and civil engineer. He was the first to describe modern artillery; he anticipated many of the weapons of modern warfare and was capable of designing effective defensive structures.In reading this book, I was simply in awe of his talents. Had he been only an artist, or even only an inventor, or only a scientist, he would have gone down in history as one the greatest intellects of all time. However, all of them in combination make his productive life one of the most interesting throughout all of history. Reading this book has been one of the most humbling experiences of my life. Even through centuries of history and human achievement his greatness still emerges stronger than ever."},{"Title":"Horse Sense: An Inside Look at the Sport of Kings","review":"Horse Sense is a book written in order to either bring to life a flicker of love or reignite the passion for horse racing. Once you have read this book, your interest and fascination for this \\"Sport of Kings\\" will give you a desire to experience this for yourself, to be at a race, to watch the jockeys, the owners, the crowd. You will want to see and hear the sound of the horses as they sweep down the track.Bert Sugar's book may contain some factual errors, but he introduces the novice to the charm, glory , dangers and the history of this amazing sport. His ability to reveal life at the track from the point of view of owners, jockeys, trainers and even those who wager at the windows is intriguing.He gives a striking overview of the tracks, from the glorious tradition of Churchill Downs, to the grand and beautiful Arlington Park to the lesser ranked tracks.The future of horse racing which took a major hit in attendance due to legal casino's and off track betting is also a subject that is well covered.Bert Sugar shares the joy and intensity of watching the horses run and the appreciation for what goes into making winning horses, great jockeys, and successful trainers."},{"Title":"Horse Sense: An Inside Look at the Sport of Kings","review":"Bert Sugar goes behind the scenes, interviewing owners, breeders, trainers, jockeys and track operators with anecdotes, history and charm only he can do.Horse Sense follows the money behind the business of racing which was once dominated by eccentric families and strange characters.A real nice read for any horse enthusiast!"},{"Title":"Horse Sense: An Inside Look at the Sport of Kings","review":"The murmur of the crowd, the electricity in the air - \\"they're off\\" and the smell or dirt and cigar all permeate this fine book by Bert Sugar- Runyonesque, wheeler dealer, yarn spinner and general sports know-it-all.You'll love the cast of characters; jock's, trainers, owners and the horses, colorful, and bizzare, a whole stew of odd ducks and delightful stories."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"I bought this book after having borrowed and read it just because it is a splendid keepsake. The two authors take turns relating informative stories about various plants and shrubs; and, more than that, they do so with wit and humor to create something very entertaining. I trust in their experiences and feel like they give me a real feel for their subjects. At a time when you can read the exact same cookie-cutter descriptions of plants in four places on the web, and you are not sure what any source really knows, you should appreciate somebody actually telling you they really enjoyed the fragrance of Four O'Clocks growing next to their porch with their family every evening in Georgia."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"This book is full of humor and not your ordinary garden book. Very informative too! Absolutely love it!! Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"Fun book to have for gardeners and whoever love plants. Lets you know what can be divided and \\"passed along\\""},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"This book is taking its place among my top 10 gardening books of all time. A wonderful read filled with down-home Southern humor, it tells the stories of over 100 plants that Southerners have loved and passed along for generations. This is not a how-to-grow it book, it is more of a why-to-grow-it book, although there are growing tips scattered throughout; this plant likes some afternoon shade, this one fertile soil, etc. As for the plants themselves, I have been gardening in the South for 35 years so I was familiar with most of the plants, but there were a few I had never even heard of and quite a few I now intend to add to my garden. That, of course, is the danger of this book; after reading it you'll want almost every plant in it! I have already ordered and planted the Kwanso daylilies and I intend to find and order the Golden Glow soon. Steve Bender and Felder Rushing are both excellent garden writers, but I must admit that I thought Bender had a much more natural sense of humor than Rushing. Several times during my reading my husband came to see what I was laughing about, and it was always one of Steve Bender's stories. How can you not love an entry called Stuck on the Needles of Your Love, Bender's hilarious story about his experience pruning a trifoliate orange. If you are a Northern or Western gardener, this book would still be funny and some of the plants would grow in your area, but it is of most value to those of us living and gardening in the South. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves the South, its people, and its plants."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"This is a wonderful reference for old-time plants that your Great-Gandmother might have grown.

It is my favorite gardening book ever. I hope to find most, if not all of the plants in this book because they are very hardy! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"Passalong Plants is a terrific book for gardeners. The book tells about all the old plants that perhaps we knew as children, or that our grandparents might have had in their gardens. Not only does the book describe the plant, but it includes many lovely pictures of these hard to find Passalong Plants. It also gives the plant's common and botanical name, size, hardiness zones, light and soil preference. Additionally, each plant has a number of listings for mail-order sources where you can actually order the plants. This is a treasure for anyone who loves plants and flowers and a good suggestion for a gift."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"Currently, I'm on my third copy of Passalong Plants. The first two were loaned out to fellow Southern gardeners and when their reactions were so enthusiastic, I gifted the books to them and bought myself another one (on Amazon, of course). Being a Southern gardener, raised by Southern gardeners who rarely purchased a plant for their extensive collections, this book truly struck home. I laughed myself to tears at points in the book, remembering similar incidents with my own grandmother, mother, aunts, cousins, and neighbors. When my grandmother passed, one serious point of contention between the relatives was who would be digging up the peonies and the lily of the valley! Besides being very informative about Southern plants and gardens, it's just great entertaining reading! This is another very affordable volume to keep handy when you're being taught a lesson in patience and have to sit somewhere waiting on someone who thinks their time is more valuable than yours!"},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"Passalong Plants contain the stories of plants that gardeners have passed along for years. Allen Lacy describes this book as a hoot and a holler. The author states this is a book about old plants, old people, young people, and memories. Every member of the Passlong Club regularly states the refrain, \\"You've got something, I know what it is, and I want a piece of it.\\" This is not a demand or threat. It simply reflects that people don't own the wonders of nature, they just take care of them for a time. What brings joy to one should bring joy to all. The book has a southern gardening slant, however the 117 plants discussed will grow for gardeners everywhere."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"I was tempted to buy this book years ago when I became interested in heirlooms. The fact that it was about \\"southern\\" passalongs discouraged me from doing so. New Jersey is one growing zone north of what is considered \\"southern\\". There are classic southern plants that can be grown here in sheltered locations but all it takes is a colder than normal winter and those delicate immigrants succumb.Thanks to global warming, my zone 6 garden is now closer to zone 7, the northern-most \\"southern\\" growing zone. Colder than normal winter temperatures are rare now. I am more open to the idea of growing plants that are considered borderline in zone 6. I got out a pad and pen, ready to take notes as I dove into a whole new world of plants via \\"Passalong Plants\\".The authors, Steve Bender and Felder Rushing, have chosen to tell a story about each plant rather than just describing it. Southern gardeners and their gardens come alive through their anecdotes. The reader comes away from the book with much better \\"pictures\\" of these old-time favorites than any photograph (which are supplied in abundance throughout the text).The essays can be read in any order. They are helpfully arranged according to the characteristics of the plants so that, for instance, if you are looking for fragrant plants, there is a section on those alone. There are also groupings of essays on plants that are aggressive spreaders, the most common \\"passalongs\\", plants with strange characteristics (such as \\"naked ladies\\" and walking iris), plants with garish colored flowers and bare root shrub passalongs that are commonly sold in nurseries.By far my favorite section was on yard art. I don't \\"get\\" bottle trees but plastic animals, painted rocks and especially tire planters took me back in time to my childhood in largely rural upstate New York. The book ends with a chapter devoted to organizing plant swaps for your own passalongs.I finished the book and realized that my pad was empty. I had been too caught up in the stories to stop and take notes. It's on my bookshelf now, waiting for winter when I am making decisions about what to plant next year. I will page through it again in my constant quest to plant something new."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"Another great book.

I can't recommend this book enough- I'd give it ten stars if I could."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"Wrote with Southern charm, Felder Rushing's and Steve Bender's &quot;Passalong Plants&quot; is chocked full of humor and downhome anecdotes on how and why all gardeners should &quot;share the fun and joy&quot; of passing along a favorite flower or plant. That boils down to mean giving to others what the soil has gave to you! A fine book that will add lots of useful and practical gardening information to any home gardener's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"I received this book for Christmas and it was my favorite gift. The moment I opened it I read it cover-to-cover--although that took quite some time. It is written by two very different, but very knowledgable authors, Steve Bender and Felder Rushing. The essays on the different plants are written by either Bender or Rushing. Rushing's essays are donw-to-earth and friendly while Bender's are downright funny at times (just read his hilarious description of why no one grows old purple phlox). Another good attribute this book possesses besides its talented authors is its frequent use of more familiar common names than hard-to-pronounce, ever-changing Latin ones. That fragrant, night-blooming vine that climbed up your grandmother's porch is not Ipomoea alba, but moonvine. And the powderpuff pink flowers that blossomed by your great aunt's white picket fence are no longer Cleome hasslerana, but spiderlegs. If you are a Southern gardener who loves those old-fashioned plants that are ripe with nostalgia, or any gardener at all for that matter, you simply have to buy this book. It combines the easy-to-understand, entertaining writing of two talented authors and those evocative plant names you grew up with."},{"Title":"Passalong Plants","review":"I read this book last fall and this spring I was invited to share the many plants growing at an old mansion in my river town.

Each listing contains the botanical name if you need to reference additional information, and there are sources to order plants and seeds.

While there are other plants mentioned, I think you would be better served if you live in the south. I like that this book broke plants down into types, and areas that they typically do best in. This way your not having to play any guessing games about what may grow best in your area.If you are fond of of heirloom plants, this book is ideal for you, as it has many plants that are of older stock. It also gives you ideas for sources as well as sources for these older variety of plants. This book also tells you how to propigate the plants and make more!This is a great resource. My only personal drawback is that while their are pictures for 80% or more of what is mentioned in the book.

The methods credited in this book are failures.One serious disappointment is this book contains absolutely no information that the reader can apply to market timing.Another major disappointment is Weingarten uses this book as a platform to brag about all of his supposed accomplishments at past market timing.This book is a feeble attempt to justify the use of astrology as a market timing tool and an obvious attempt to enrich Weingarten's pocket and ego without providing any useful data to the reader.Weingarten is slick and makes his market timing skills sound bigger than life. Reality proves just the opposite; here are just a few of his Mar through Jun 1997 failures based on astrology and this list constitutes a clear majority of his biggest predictions for 97 (i.e. he is wrong far more often than right.)(1) Weingarten claimed 3/11 would be the high for 1997 at 7085. Fact is: the DJIA has made several new highs.(2) For many weeks, he predicted the DJIA would drop to 5200 by June 97 but here we are at the 7800 level mid June. That's 2600 point off.(3) On 4/21, Weingarten e-mailed subscribers predicting the Dow would fall 1000 points in the next 15 days to 5703. Fact is: a 10% correction ended on Apr 14 then the Dow rose almost straight up to new highs at 7200 by May 5.(4) Again on 5/16, he predicted the Dow would drop from 7320 to 6240 in the next 15 days. Fact is: the Dow pulled back a couple hundred points and recovered those losses to finish the month slightly off recent new highs at 7331.(5) Weingarten then predicted the market could slide 250 or more points or even crash on May 14, 21 and 22. The DJIA gained 12 points on the 14th; it fell a mere 12 points on the 21st; and lost a whole 32 points on the 22nd.(6) Again on 5/21, he proclaims 7350 the top. Fact is: the DJIA continued to make new highs and on May 27 closed at 7383.(7) Still insisting the market is heading down, again on 6/12, Weingarten proclaims 7640 the top. The DJIA closed that day at 7711 and moved up to another record of 7782 on June 13. The market will fall sometime, but how much money will be lost in the meantime by following his wrong predictions?(8) Since Dec 96 and based on astrology, Weingarten claimed Disney was destined to have poor earnings and would be a $40 stock by June. Fact is: Disney has traded from the upper $60's in Dec to a recent high of $85 and has twice reported solid earnings. And sadly enough, he incorretly claims as of 6/13 this recommendation is profitable. Fact is: he has preached shorting Disney while the stock has moved over $20 against his recommendation making this trade a very big loser.(9) Weingarten boasts that astrology shows most major technology stocks have made their 1997 highs in the 1st quarter, specifically Intel and Microsoft, and that he sees big declines in technology earnings for the year.(9a) At the beginning of Mar just prior to a 10% correction in the DJIA, Compaq was $80 in late May $110; Dell was $72 in late May $113; Gateway was $59 in late May $74; IBM was $145 in late May $179; Intel was $145 in late May $169; and Microsoft was $99 in late May $126. All of these major technology bell weathers have reported great earnings and have all achieved significant new all time highs. On 5/30 Intel warned of a 2nd quarter earnings situation but Compaq, Dell and Gateway have said their 2nd quarters look good.(9b) On 4/18 even after announcing great earnings, Weingarten recommended shorting Microsoft at $100. Microsoft shot up to new all time highs at $126 without falling below $100.(9c) On 4/22, Weingarten recommended shorting IBM at $140. On 4/30 IBM was $160 and had not closed below $140; but he recommended shorting it again. In the next 4 weeks, IBM went on to make a new all time high at $179 and did not once close below his $160 short.Even an incompetent fool continually making ignorant proclamations will at some time be right. Someday Weingarten will be right and can write another book musing about his great vision and wisdom and maybe the proceeds will replace the money he has lost in the markets.Sadly, INVESTING BY THE STARS is a book that fails to provide the reader with any useful material. It reads like a book written by Henry's mother extolling his questionable virtues and skills. Following his web site recommendations for a few months has proven his book a waste of money.My recommendation, save your time and money by finding other reading material.

In these days of computerized research and financial programs, his unique approach situates the often perilous trade of Investing within the high reaches of the cosmos.

When I met him in the late 80's he was the head of the New York Astrology Center, but he ran a computer consulting service on the side. I was an independent computer consultant/programmer working as a subcontractor. Now here comes the good part.....when I went to my initial interview for a consultant position, instead of looking at my resume for even a second, Henry asked for my birth date and time! He then put the date and time into his computerized astrological program and ran his chart on me. I was amazed and a little amused as Henry and his partner read my chart, and offered me a position. Apparently something they saw in my chart impressed them enough to give me a job....but they wouldn't tell me what those characteristics were!Soon after I began working with Henry, I would come into his office each morning, and find him with his portable Quotron attached to his hand, punching in figures and symbols into his computerized astrological-financial program, and barking orders to his broker on the phone! As I worked I made mental notes of Henry's trades. When I got home at night I would check the WSJ to see how he did. In most of his trading, Henry was doing well. By and large, the stocks he purchased went up and his short calls would usually fall! I started copying some of his long calls on my own, but never in such large quantities. Maybe a hundred or two of Electronic Arts, etc. I don't know how he did it, but according to my calculations, Henry consistently made money, and therefore I made money as well!Granted, during the incredible bull run of the 90's, and before the tech meltdown of 2000, just about EVERY trader was making money! I have not read Henry's book, and therefore am unable to offer any recommendation, but it seems there is some method to his trading. My advice is watch the technical indicators, keep an eye on overall market sentiment, and develop a strong gut instinct for talented companies. Good luck......"},{"Title":"Investing by the Stars: Using Astrology in the Financial Markets","review":"Of all the astrology books I've read dealing with finance and the markets (around 15 of them), this is the MOST obtuse of them all. The author gives examples of his own successful \\"predictions,\\" while ignoring all the failures. It's as if I went to the racetrack and came back telling you about the horses I picked and money I won, describing my amazing deductions for selecting winners, but neglected to tell you about the losers and the fact that I came away with an empty wallet.

Astroharmonics? Please, you might as well promote Dianetics or the Psychic Hotline as alternative investment methodologies.Adding to the disastrous possibilities of adopting this pseudo-system is the author's gigantic ego.

I got the book because I liked one poem called &quot;To Be a Hero,&quot; reprinted in Datlow and Windling's 5th Year's Best Fantasy and Horror. It's the best poem in this book, and uncharacteristic of the rest. Springer would never have gotten this material published in real poetry magazines. It is not characteristic of her best work, for which she is deservedly known (e.g., &quot;The Boy Who Plaited Manes&quot; [1986]). Besides the above mentioned poem, I can recommend two others here: &quot;So the Battle's Won,&quot; a meditation on what's left of love after the strife of life; and &quot;Happily Ever,&quot; an amusingly modernized &quot;Cinderella&quot; (&quot;Cinderella grew short of breath / And needed bifocals / And radical bladder surgery&quot;).

That having been said he wrote no bad ones!The plot isn't as strong as it could be or as believable as it could be. Also Brace never seemed to get beyond the forties with his contemporary writing. His fifties and sixties books all have a decided forties flavor, this one included. I tend to like his pre-1950 books better as a whole than his later work. I loved \\"The World of Carrick's Cove\\" and \\"The Spire\\" was okay but I think his work was stronger in the thirties and forties. Again, all his books are way better than most and I recommend reading anything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction! It was written about him that he never wrote a bad sentence.

This makes it difficult to flip through and find what you're looking for, and is just sort of a mind-bogglingly idiotic thing to do. Compounding the problem, many pages are simply not numbered!That little complaint aside, I guess Hays does do a pretty good job with his selection of essays. If anything it illustrates how much the discourse has obfuscated itself over the last 30+ years. To give you the the flavor of the book, here are a few selections:&quot;The concept of architecture is itself an inhabited constructum, a heritage wich comprehends us even before we could submit it to thought. Certain invariables remain, constant, through all the mutations of architecture. Impassable, imperturbable, an axiomatic traverses the whole history of architecture. An axiomatic, that is to say, an organized ensemble of fundamental and always presupposed evaluations. This hierarchy has fixed itself in stone; henceforth, it informs the entirety of social space.&quot;(Jacques Derrida)&quot;The combination of the system theory of the urban realm with its dynamic interpretation as a pressurized field gives rise to an assembly language based on impregnation, with system elements existing simultaneously, and at least virutally, everywhere, emerging to actualization only within nodes (conjunctions) of mutually interfering systems.&quot;(Stanford Kwinter)&quot;This suggests the idea of architecture as &quot;writing&quot; as opposed to architecture as image. What is being &quot;written&quot; is not the object itself - its mass and volume - but the act of massing. This idea gives a metaphoric body to the act of architecture. It then signals its reading through an other system of signs, called traces. Traces are not the be read literally, since the have no other value than to signal the idea that three is a reading event and that reading should take place; trace signals the idea to read. Thus a trace is a partial or fragmentary signal; it has no objecthood.&quot;(Peter Eisenman)They are not all quite like that of course, but most will not find this 'easy' reading. Learning to read english like this is a skill that takes some time to develop. Hays's little blurbs preceding each writer are decent enough, grounding you a little before you take on the selection, but they are not spectacular.I simply cannot recommend this book to anyone other than students forced to read it or those with a highly devoted interest in contemporary architectural theory. Anybody else will find it useless. (The Nesbitt and Leach were somewhat better)"},{"Title":"Architecture Theory since 1968","review":"This is a great book for students and professionals alike. As a collogue once said, &quot;A Hayes book is like buying a greatest hits CD, all the good things are there&quot;.

Pages are also east to underline and annotate in the margins."},{"Title":"Architecture Theory since 1968","review":"I praise Michael Hayes for his succinct and accurate notation and massive inter-article references. This text is the bible of a discipline that ostensibly began in the twentieth century, as self-conscious writing began to absorb architecture as a theme or subject.Each successive wave of theorization about architecture contains similar elements of concern and patterns of approach, each multivalent through time or the pen of the author. Hayes gathers the contentious groups and individuals who have jumped into the fray of Architectural Theory and presents them neatly, their most salient essays all within one binding."},{"Title":"Architecture Theory since 1968","review":"Save your money.Content- Although this book collects many scriptures, it makes no attempt at demystifying or clarifying them (not to mention English translation from French). Thus, most of the content remains up there in the realms of theoretical vagueness, that is-illegible.Fortunately you can find most of the text on the interwebs! Easily translated into coherent everyday English and well explained.Form- Spacious margins mean smaller text, means savings in printing, means difficult to read. Small ,grey fonts, again, translate into savings in print- very difficult for the reader. Not all pages have numbering. Why is that? Go figure. For example from p.329 to p.337 no numbering and not a single image to try and explain this bad design.

I bought this book because of the weighty and important subject the author was purporting to write about. What I got was the WORST WRITTEN BOOK I've ever tried to read. How does [stuff] like this even get published? Are there no editors at this publishing house? The book is 90% dialogue, and the dialogue is 100% horrible! Where on earth do people talk like this? The \\"like\\" that the main character kept uttering drove me crazy; that his erstwhile girlfriend kept at it with her annoying \\"y'all\\" and equally painful \\" I'll tell you what \\" ( this from a girl whose father is named Vladimer!) drove me right up the wall. Now I could accept this writing if it was something for Writing 101 being handed-in by, say, an engineering major. But a publishable work of fiction? Please! The author should stick to flying his Cessna, sailing his boat \\" in the French Antilles \\", and doodling with his wiring diagrams. I'm sorry my [money] will help pay for his ultra-cool lifestyle, but we all waste money now and then. By the way, I was able to get about 70% through the book when I decided to stop torturing myself. I looked at the ending real quick; it confirmed my worst fears! I couldn't go on with it and threw the book into the garbage. It will probably take me, like, weeks to get this taste of y'all's writing out of my mind - I'll tell you what!"},{"Title":"The Highest Mountain","review":"Outstanding!In my culture it is inappropriate to use foul language or talk about sex in a literary work. So, at first, I was taken back when I began reading The Highest Mountain. However, I soon realized that, in order to be true to the 1960s culture in America, Worman used language as a tool to demonstrate the protagonist's growth of someone rising out of mediocrity.I come from the Buddhist tradition. So I can say that Worman has hit the nail squarely on the head regarding what it takes to rise above one's own self-limiting beliefs and coming to terms with ego. I was captured by the protagonist's spiritual journey. It reminds me a little of my own passage, a different time and a different continent.For me, The highest Mountain is an important work. So much so that I purchased two additional copies and will one day make them gifts to my daughters, now 3 and 5.Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Highest Mountain","review":"I'm impressed!

Schultz is a darned good writer."},{"Title":"Gully Town: A Novel of Kansas City","review":"**This book was received as a free Advanced Reader's Copy.This was one of the better books I've read in awhile. In fact, I absolutely loved it and felt really drawn to the characters. I was even brought to tears at one point.Gully Town starts during the Civil War and ends in the early nineteen hundreds and covers Kansas City. Most specifically, the lives of a few inhabitants are followed. Friends that came together through different circumstances, they make an impact on the city and from them their children continue on the legacy. Red goes from being a young boy good with horses to a notorious outlaw. Jack starts from humble roots (as does his friend Kevin) and becomes a big name in the city. As Kansas City grows they go on with their lives to the best of their abilities.This book had great characters. They were all written in such a way that you cared about them. That you wanted to know what happened to them. I have to say my favorites were Red and little Joey. Red was such a complex character and even though he had his ups and downs he was a genuinely good guy. Joey, although he played a smaller role in the book, was very vibrant and just made you feel good. All the other characters were wonderful too of course, I can't even recall any that I didn't particularly care for. The relationship stories are very compelling as well and I found most of them quite sweet.This book was based partly in reality and though I don't know much about that part of the world in that particular time, it seemed authentic and well researched to me. And I enjoyed following these characters through that time in history. It was interesting to see how quickly things started progressing and the change in life and technology in only a few years. The writing style was fluid and had a nice pace. There weren't any lags and it always kept things interesting. One should note that there is mention of violence, sex, murder, etc. so those who aren't into that kind of thing should be warned. I should also mention that the book included some old photos of Kansas City, which was a nice touch.This book was very nicely done. Its definitely deserving of a permanent position on my bookshelf.

Instead, some of it is about the author's life as a human being, and some of it isn't even about her. Wanklin takes time to describe a large number of mental patients she meets, most of whom are completely irrelevant. A description of Borderline Personality Disorder is not given to the reader. If I wasn't a BPD sufferer who knew the traits of the disorder like I knew the alphabet, I would have been completely lost as to what BPD even was.A redeeming factor for me was when Wanklin DID show what it was like to live with the disorder. I found myself nodding at many parts, laughing at how familiar they sounded. I loved the probably unintentional action justifications and undertones of cynicism.The ending made me wonder if Wanklin was &quot;ok&quot; like she claimed to be. She found a music group that she liked, and realized that the internet was a great place. Good? Yes. But a resolution? Not really. The ending seemed trite and hasted.&quot;Let Me Make it Good&quot; shows people with the disorder that they are not alone, but other than showing us that we're not alone, it doesn't do much. I don't think this book will interest that many people. However, I DO give props to Wanklin for getting her story out, something I have always wanted to do. The self fufillment aspect must be nice."},{"Title":"Let Me Make it Good: A Chronicle of My Life With Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of their BPD diagnoses.I would give this book five stars, if it weren't for its embarassingly high amount of typos.Now, I'm not one to 'nitpick,' but at one point I found this so irritating that I actually had to put the book down for a minute.For instance, in one chapter, she discusses someone named &quot;Wayne.&quot; Then, out of nowhere, she starts calling this same person &quot;Joe.&quot; I'm sitting here thinking, 'who the heck is Joe?' (Mind you, I am a very careful reader!) In the next chapter, she talks about a college friend named &quot;Adam,&quot; but a sentance later, refers to him as &quot;Allan.&quot;There are *numerous* other mistakes of this sort that I won't bother listing. Either the author just didn't proof-read her book (*at all*!), or the editor just did a deplorable job.I hate to harp on a book for something as trival as grammar.

In retrospect, I should have fictionalized it, to make it available to a wider audience, as well as asking Mosaic Press to re-edit the manuscript and then order more. It was sloppy and embarrassing and probably damaged my reputation as an author. For that, I have profound regrets.I wrote it as a stark and unflinching look at bpd through the eyes of a sufferer and hoped that by using it as my autobiography, it might help other people afflicted with the disorder. I didn't care if the book made money--that was not my intention. This was not a publication that was in any way going to cause me to dawn the gilted trapings of the writing elite--it was my way of making something that took away more than half my life actually mean something positive for others.I will contact my publisher, Howard Aster with regards to the somber fact that my book is nearly out of print.

Depression and anxiety are a big part of being borderline as well.i hope you will take the time to read this book, particularly if you or someone you care about has the disorder.

Although the book doesn't describe what BPD is, I know what it is because I have it myself and wasn't confused while reading the whole book. She described a lot of people she met in the psychiatric hospital, and I grew tired about 3/4's of the book reading about the characteristics of them. She went through a lot of the same things that I went through, so I can relate to her. There were a lot of typos, but considering everything else (she wrote while being on psychotropic medications, etc), I thought she did a very thorough job, detailing every aspect of her life.

I'm not sure if your aware, that BPD is a biological condition that is complicated by environmental/social factors. Much of the psychiatric community is not aware of this fact and tends to blame people with BPD for their condition and in some cases deny patients treatment purely because they have a mental illness that they deem to be \\"untreatable\\".TARA, the international advocacy association for BPD, states on its website that \\"patients with BPD are currently the most stigmatized in the mental health system.\\" According to Dr. Joel Dvoskin former Comm. of the New York State Office Of Mental Health, \\"Why would psychiatry and psychology turn so viciously against people they call mentally disordered? Apparently the greatest sin a client can commit is poor response to treatment. What is apparently so wrong about these unfortunate souls is that they have yet to demonstrate the ability to get better in response to our treatment. Thus, they don't make us feel very good. With a few notable exceptions, we have simply given up on helping people who desperately need us to do a better job of helping them\\"(CAMI Journal on BPD, Vol 8)You seem to think that the author had no right to expose the reality of what she and many other patients in the mental health system/psychiatric hospitals have experienced both in Canada, the United States and many other countries around the world. You do not seem to have considered the possibility that a lack of understanding/training in field of BPD has led to many false perceptions about BPD and negative stigma. As such, patients diagnosed with BPD are black listed, and blamed and shamed for their behavior both in out patient treatment and in-patient facilities - if they can get treatment at all.Keeping in mind, that BPD and learning disabilities (perhaps this might account for her spelling mistakes as cited by the another Reviewer: below) are often co morbid conditions, it is not unusual for a person with these disorders to hear insensitive remarks like \\"Just Try harder\\" or \\"You can do anything if you just set your mind to it\\". Perhaps this doesn't sound all that terrible to you but imagine if these invalidating statements were being repeated over and over again throughout your life. Randy, imagine someone saying these exact words throughout your childhood and all the way into your adulthood. Imagine trying to \\"try harder\\" but not being able to make the \\"er\\" part of \\"Try hard...\\" come into effect despite putting way more effort into your studies, social and emotional development than your peers. \\"Try harder\\", \\"You can do it if you just put your mind to it\\".... Do you hear it now Randy? Imagine your teachers telling you this, your parents, your guidance counselors and finally once you have reached rock bottom and develop a serious mental illness, imagine the very mental health professionals who are supposed to know about the biological underpinning of BPD, telling you these exact same words. These are the people the author was supposed to be able to turn to for support, compassion and treatment. How would you feel? Might you not have a BPD moment yourself, Randy?.One more thing Randy:You come to the clinical conclusion (that you may or may not be qualified to make) that the author was engaging in \\"splitting\\" behavior \\"classifying select people as her saviors, whilst the remainder are discounted as thugs - emotionally abusive, physically abusive, sexually abusive.\\" Have you considered that the author might, as we all tend to do (in a book especially), simply be trying to recognize the people in her life who helped her cope with her illness and weed out the ones that have hurt her. Obviously, there have been some supportive and some not so supportive people in her life. I find it disturbing how readily you seem to be able to use a characteristic of a mental illness for the purpose of ridicule."},{"Title":"Let Me Make it Good: A Chronicle of My Life With Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I dis-like how long $hipping takes from this site ;(I am looking forward to reading my newest books, in time ;)"},{"Title":"Let Me Make it Good: A Chronicle of My Life With Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I just finished reading this book and I could not put it down.

Horrendous editing abounds throughout as well as boring emphasis and details on irrelevent characters in her life. I question if the diagnosis of BPD is accurate for the author. Much of her problems seem to relate to her abuse of drugs, overmedication with neuroleptics, etc. Perhaps she suffered severe depression and her attempts at self medication via drug abuse and eating disorders sent her \\"over the edge,\\" resulting in her entry into extraordinarily incompentent psychiatric treatment. No doubt that \\"treatment\\" was further devastating to her psyche, setting her recovery back years. She received little or no therapy that granted her any insight into her illness, was merely medicated heavily and innapropriately without regard to a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. This book at least shows the grave pitfalls of dropping a loved one off in a psych ward, blindly trusting the experts to weave magic. Some one should have demanded a diagnosis, medication review, and comprehensive treatment plan for Jane.

Instead of focusing and drawing attention to the things that would help you overcome this difficult disorder, the author has decided to direct a large amount of venom at her hospitalization and treatments. For someone who vilified the psychiatric community, she has certainly had more than her share of slices of this particular pie. There seems to be little recognition or appreciation of the amount of money, time and effort spent with her.The author seems to expect other people and professions to supply her with a blueprint for life, without taking into effect her own culpability and responsibilties in this life. As typical to the BPD behavior, she chooses to classify select people as her saviours, whilst the remainder are discounted as thugs - emotionally abusive, physically abusive, sexually abusive.It comes as no surprise to me that positive reviews are from other BPDs as birds of a feather do flock together.The only problem being that these birds are vultures, picking the flesh of the only system that will support them."},{"Title":"Rapid Reading Made E-Z (Made E-Z Guides)","review":"Technically, this book and \\"PhotoReading\\" are the same book.

The system goes through five steps: Prepare to read by going into a relax state- Previewing and surveying what to read - Photoreading means going into a relax step and after visualization taking in a whole page at a time then waiting about 20 minutes to overnight before activating - Activate means to ask questions and find the purpose for reading the material - Rapid Reading is reading at a fast pace; speed depending on the amount of detail needed. The book uses Neuro-linguistic programming popularized by Anthony Robbins to read books and improve comprehension in a relaxed state.The time need to follow the steps takes as much time if not longer to get through the material compared to the traditional way of reading. The book seems to focus more on improving comprehension rather than speed. The author referenced many books that deals with alternative learning techniques as listed in the book's Bibliography. The book does it's best to promote and sell the system by advising the reader that when working in a group, to buy each member a copy of the book to get them on the program. The problem I have with this book and may other speed reading books is the defining and redefining of speed reading as PhotoReading or Rapid Reading etc is that it's mostly all the same system. Prereading and asking questions, previewing to understanding the structure of the book, reading the first sentence and the summary then reading at a fast pace finally finishing with a review by rereading the difficult sections for clearer understanding. My definition of speed reading is taking any book to read and reading it at a fast pace and comprehending 60% or more of information read. The way these speed read systems are set up; you are reading the material at least 3 times and the review is just saving all your rereading you would do until the end. This book is no good for speed reading and should be used as a companion book for another speed reading book. The idea of relaxation while studying is sound advice.

Some of which have blossomed into far greater form than was known by the book's authors. Take the book's discussion of MUDs. Then primarily text based. But given continuing trends in cheaper memory, faster cpus and better bandwidth, MUDs have morphed into mass multiplayer online role playing games. With the biggest instantiations probably being in South Korea, Japan and China. As opposed to the early MUDs, which were mostly in the US. The MMORPGs are now big business, with revenues in the millions of dollars. The idea of a role playing game community has also led to people making their livings in those environments, by building characters and selling these.Then, considering community networks, in the book you might see glimmerings of the blog phenomenon. Or the various activist websites that blossom around election time.Overall, at this time of writing, 2006, there are far richer examples of social computing, broadly defined, than as recently as 1997.

In a world that seen so much published regarding this subject, this work stands as benchmark. Ms. Dawidowicz addresses herself to the most fundamental of questions regarding this unspeakable policy of ritual race murder; how could a modern, sophisticated and industrial country such as Germany have perpetrated such a deliberate reign of horror against a whole people simply because they were Jewish? And, although we have seen recent books such as \\"Problem From Hell\\" that deal more systematically with the issue of modern examples of state sponsored genocide, the simple fact is that the Holocaust seems to have occurred because, for the first time in modern history, it was both politically and logistically possible. In other words, the Nazis had both the method and the impetus to do the unspeakable.Seen in this fashion, the equation becomes at once political, social, and technological; given the irrational impulse to do so, the modern Nazi regime was able to harness all of its energies, spiritual, political and material, into such a devastating and sustained campaign against the Jews, and was therefore uniquely able to forge the most bloody of final results. The author's approach winds the reader through several phases of the Holocaust phenomenon with a careful, meticulous and methodical consideration of the social, economic, and political influences swirling through this witches' brew of evil. In the first part of the book, entitled \\"The Final Solution\\", she traces the origins and growth of anti-Semitism, a form of patent racism so virulent it threatened to exterminate the Jews from all of continental Europe. In so tracing the roots and origins of the Nazis and their fellow travelers, she shows how the rise of National Socialism revolved around the scapegoating of the Jews.The execution of this plan was enacted in the ghettos and small towns of Poland and Germany as well as in a network of forced labor camps and concentration camps throughout Eastern Europe. In the second part of the book, \\"\\"The Holocaust\\", the author dramatically describes how the plight of the Jews was gradually worsened and how the violence and deprivation grew systematically more and more horrible with each passing month. Inhabitants of camps or ghettos led lives of incredible hardship and deprivation, struggling helplessly against hunger, disease, exposure to extremes of temperature and weather, and of course, to the wanton cruelties of the Nazi regime. This is indeed interesting material, detailing the ways in which Jewish groups both within the ghettos and the death camps worked together to make the best out of an impossible situation.This is a heart-rending book, one that accurately portrays the ways in which Jews were deceived and betrayed by the authorities, convinced they were being resettled rather than being slated for extermination. Ms. Dawidowicz writes with compassion and authority covering this intrinsically difficult issues, as one reads of lives torn asunder, families ripped apart, and wholesale rape, mutilation, and murder. This book, published more than thirty years ago, is one of the most comprehensive, best documented, and well-written book to have appeared on the subject of the Holocaust. I recommend it for anyone with an interest in the subject."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"This book provides a good detail of how the German leadership convinced itself that genocide was not only correct and legal, but a necessity for their survival. I thought the book was going to be a description of one atrocity after another, but it provides the reader with more of the details of why it was happening. Don't get me wrong, there is enough of the horror represented here. I would have liked a larger review of all of the holocaust crimes across Europe, but there are limits to the size of any one book. This book is a good start to find out why it happened."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Ms. Dawidowiczs managed to hold me through the grim realities of the shoa as no other author has. I believe it to be the definative text on the development of European, and particularly German anti-semitism. I wish I had read it twenty years ago. She explains how the enlightenment notions of individual autonomy challanged the notions of the clan and ethnic nationalism held so tightly by the Nazis. Hitler reject his own Catholic background, from which the enlightenment had arisen. He replaced the God of the Jews and Christians with the Gods of Nordic mythology. Individuals were of no importance in Hitler's world view only the tribe mattered. Dawidowiczs explains how Hitler found fertile territory for his avowed hatred of Jewry in Europes long history of anti-semitism. She explains in frightening detail how Hitler took anti-semitism into the land of terror. Hitler, as she explains, used the ideals of ethnicity and tribalism to convince Germans that they were under attack from within by a virus called Judaism that would destroy them if they did not destroy the Jews first. Hence &quot;the final solution&quot;. Dawidowiczs style is reader friendly. She manages to pull the reader along through horrible subject matter with clear and precise prose. The use of charts and graphs to show the decline in pre and post war Jewry is staggering and a great illustration of the ferocity of Natzi hatred and fear. How ironic that the Nazi motive for the murder of Jews was that they were afraid of them. Nordic supermen notwithstanding, their pathological fear lead to slaughter. All serious students of the 20th century should read this book."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Although an ocean of material has been written about the Holocaust, this book stands alone. The author has chosen the best way to present the material; by simple factual recitation. No amount of pejoratives would suffice, and even one would cheapen the book. Salut!!!!!!!!Davidowicz examines the underpinnings of pan-European anti-Semitism, its &quot;legitimization&quot; by the Third Reich, its consequences on the victims, and the awful results masterfully. Especially excellent are the sections on why so little resistance was offered until the end, when resistance was a gesture, not a viable tactic.You will never forget the first mayor of the Warsaw ghetto, Adam Czerniakow. This book is unforgettable, and earns the highest rating possible."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"This very well written history of the origins and progession of the Holocaust has much to recommend to it. It provides a strong and concise overview of Naziism and advances the disturbing but plausible idea that World War II was intended in part as a cover for the Holocaust to come. It offers a chilling look inside the ghettos of Eastern Europe and shows how wretched life was and also how life didn't stop immediately despite the horrors heaped upon the Jews. Where she forcuses her attention, she provides a strong and complete overview.However, the book stops at the gates of the death camps and at the western boundaries of Germany. While an appendix touches on the fate of all of Europe's Jews, the body of the work leaves out the progression of atrocities in Western and Southern Europe. Maybe there was little to say as most of the Jews ended up in the ghettos but she doesn't make it clear till the appendix. And she makes no effort to talk about like in the labor camps or death camps. While there was little to talk of but doom and the barest hope of survival, many books since have covered this topic, so I wonder why she didn't.Still, this work makes an excellent overview to the Holocaust, to the inhumanity of the Germans, and to the efforts, no matter how small, by the Jews to never surrender."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Hitler. The very name seems to invoke black and white images of a charasmatic madman pushing his country to global domination. But the story goes much deeper than that. His intense hatred of the Jews pushed him to implement his \\"Final Solution\\". To exploit and then kill every Jew in Europe before they, in his twisted mind, did the same to every one else.Thankfully, his \\"appointed\\" task was never completed. But not before nearly six million Jews and countless others who either resisted or simply didn't conform to his Ideas of the perfect human were destroyed.This is the story of those Jews who died and those survived the largest mass murder in recorded history. These are the things they didn't show or talk about in Public School. This book shows the strength and weakness of a people on the edge of anihalation. It doesn't show the Jews as a strong race overcoming their problems, or as a weak race sniveling and grovelling, waiting to die. It shows them as any other group of humans reacting to their circumstances in a wide variety of ways.This is probably the longest time I have ever spent reading a book. After reading a page or two (especially in the second half of the book), I would generally have to put it down for a few days to read some lighter material. Overall I think it took me about nine to ten months to read. But I would definatly put it in the best books I have read.So, if you are looking to understand what was happening to the Jews during WW2, or if you are just looking to fill in some of the gaps from history class, then I would heartily recomend this brilliant work."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Anyone looking for a single volume history of the Holocaust should start with this one. It is not an easy read, but it is informative and works well as a reference book. The table of contents sets up the material well, though it is by no means encyclopedic. The writing is straight forward, allowing the facts to speak so that readers make value judgments for themselves. The starkness of the tone serves as a reminder of how the Third Reich went about its final solution to the Jewish question, business as usual. Those of us who read it as an assigned text for an Issues in the Study of the Holocaust class found it somewhat dry at times, but our own outrage at how an \\"advanced society\\" could do such things made up for any tediousness of the book.My 20 year old copy holds a place of honor on my shelf of frequently used history books."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"At a family gathering, a relative of mine asked the question \\"why didn't the Jews fight back in a more organized way during WWII?\\" Not having an immediate answer, I went in search of one, which this book supplied.

It shows how the program to destroy the Jews went hand-in- hand with the Third Reich''s overall effort to conquer Europe.It also goes into great detail describing the destructions and terrible suffering the Jews went through in various communities in Europe.It in short describes the roots and execution of what is arguably the greatest crime in human history, the deliberate Nazi effort to destroy an entire people, wherever they were on earth."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Jews have been assaulted throughout history, but National Socialism was something new. It took a long time for even its victims to realize how different it was.Not until 1942 - by which time many more than a million Jews had been murdered - did the captives begin to discern that the goal of the Germans (enthusiastically seconded by the Latvians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians and others) was to do them all to death. Until then, the old motto of \\"hold on and hold out\\" had seemed likely to serve the community, if not the individuals within it, as well as it had always done through the centuries.That was the reason why, when the Germans demanded that the communal leaders select, say, 10,000 of their people for deportation, the bias was to select the good-for-nothings and the old among the good-for-somethings. Let the young live, they will carry on the tradition, was the feeling.Lucy Dawidowicz divides her history into two parts. First, the development of the ideology of total destruction - a policy that in recent years acquired the name of eliminationism from Daniel Goldhagen, a term not much in use when Dawidowicz wrote in 1975.The idea was so alien that civilized people, Jews included, had a hard time accepting its reality. When couriers and escapees brought in witnessed accounts of death factories, the underground Jewish press downplayed the news, unsure how much of it to believe. Outside Europe, recognition of the monstrousness of the crime was even slower to take hold.Probably, Dawidowicz says, many Germans did not understand that elimination was the goal. It was asserted in \\"Mein Kampf,\\" but few read that turgid book, not even Adolf Eichmann. This is not to say that Germans (and Polish Catholics and many others) had any objection to murdering Jews. It was rather that they didn't quite see the point of murdering all of them.The Jews felt the same. Surely, they thought, the work we do for the German army (sewing uniforms, making boots and so on) in its struggle with Russia is so valuable that at least the strong and skilled will be spared.Dawidowicz is a legal and social historian. She makes the point, although military historians have subsequently made it even more strongly, that the Germans were so devoted to destroying all the Jews that they let that task harm their war effort. When trains were desperately needed to get munitions to the front, or to organize an orderly retreat, the SS was able to commandeer as much rolling stock as it needed to keep the gas chambers filled.She believes that Hitler, Himmler and at a somewhat later date Heydrich were commited to eliminationism. It wasn't really necessary to let others into the grand plan. As long as they were willing to perform their small tasks - and there were few who demurred - then the great killing industry could go forward without holding a plebiscite on annihilation.The other half of the book concerns what the Jews did. Until very late, each time their little worlds were shrunk by deportations, they regrouped and tried to maintain or revive all the communal, religious, social and economic institutions that had sustained them under persecution for so long.It was late 1943 or even 1944 before the grimmest truth emerged, and then the Jews turned, after much consultation with their rabbis and secular leaders, to forlorn hope resistance, rather than the passive resistance that had served them in the Middle Ages and, so they thought, even against the Nazis.In the last few pages of her book, Dawidowicz makes an impassioned, and convincing, argument that collaboration is not a charge that can be laid against the Jews (with some individual exceptions) because they were never free actors. In the endnotes, she has harsh words for Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt, who, she says, failed to grasp the essential status of the Jews under German domination: They were condemned, and their only freedom of action was to decide whether to die before the Germans killed them, as Adam Czerniakow, the leader of the Warsaw ghetto, chose to do.There were, and still are, people who like to pretend that Communism was worse than Nazism, because more people died under the Communists. Dawidowicz approvingly cites Karl Jaspers on the subject of Nazism. She writes:\\"The German state, deciding that the Jews should not live, arrogated to itself the judgment as to whether a whole people had the right to existence, a judgment that no man and no state have the right to make. 'Anyone who on the basis of such a judgment,' said Karl Jaspers, 'plans the organized slaughter of a people and participates in it, does something that is fundamentally different from all crimes that have existed in the past.' \\""},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Maybe you watched \\"The Killing Fields\\" (Cambodia), \\"Hotel Rwanda\\", or \\"Amistad\\". If you didn't, you must have seen a few films about the Holocaust. I saw a few, long ago, but for the last many years I've avoided them because they are just too painful. I've read a lot about that terrible era in human history, I've known people who lived through it, and there are museums all over America dedicated to preserving the memory of what happened. For the education of younger generations, this is good. For myself, I can't bear it. When faced with not only evil, but stupidity, rigid, unswerving bigotry, and lies---lies, bigotry and stupidity that led to the extermination of nearly six million people as a national goal, I find myself overwhelmed. But still, after all, I thought I should read THE WAR AGAINST THE JEWS one day and actually bought it a dozen years ago. I could never sum up the courage to begin. At last the day arrived and I picked up the book and started reading. I read of the poisonous, vicious lies that circulated in Germany and Europe before the Final Solution became a reality, I read of Hitler's view of Jews (I'd read \`Mein Kampf' forty years ago, so this was not exactly new territory) and the anti-Semitism that lurked under German rocks for a long time before streaming out to cause the Holocaust. I reflected on how all these stupid lies still exist; some moral perverts still propagate them. You can find their sites on the Internet. My mental state began to decline, everything began to look gray, then black, I found myself full of anger and hatred. I don't want to be that person---I refuse to be that person. I closed the book, and I didn't read further, but I assure you, it's all here in carefully documented order. If you doubt me, read some of the other reviews. I don't think I have a lot to add. When people deny the Holocaust, it's like denying that dinosaurs ever existed, that the world is round, or that Obama is a Christian. They tried to kill all the Jews. They managed to do a lot. But we are still here !! Life ! L'khayyim ! If you can read this book, you are just tougher than me.

The author has compiled a book with grim statistics of the annilition of European Jewry. Of all the books I have read about this tragic time, Ms. Davidowitz has captured the horror of the \\"Final Solution\\"."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Lucy Dawidowicz's \\"The War Against the Jews\\" tends to be one of the first one-volume works on the Holocaust that most people read, me included. One reason for this is that it's not very long: it's about half as long as Martin Gilbert's \\"The Holocaust\\", to name another one-volume book on the subject. Another reason is that it came out in the 1970s when the general reading public suddenly became fascinated with the Holocaust. Dawidowicz's book sold many copies, and is still regarded by many people as one of the definitive works on the subject.Most historians, however, would disagree. The greatest of all Holocaust historians, Raul Hilberg, whose monumental three-volume \\"The Destruction of the European Jews\\" is one of the greatest works of scholarship ever published, had nothing but contempt for Dawidowicz's work and wrote a scathing critique of it in his memoir \\"The Politics of Memory\\", showing how she makes many basic mistakes of fact. For example, one of Dawidowicz's major flaws as historian is the extent to which she suppresses or ignores evidence of the extent to which Jewish authorities in the ghettoes cooperated with the Nazis - often with the best of intentions, because they sometimes just couldn't believe that the Nazis actually meant to kill them, but with catastrophic consequences nevertheless.Elsewhere, Dawidowicz uses a naive and statistically innumerate way of counting the number of Jewish dead. Most importantly, her general thesis that Hitler had a master plan to exterminate all of the Jews from early in his career, which he then took great pains to carry out, is not supported by evidence.I should point out, here, that no serious historian disputes the existence of the Holocaust. \\"Holocaust deniers\\" live in a fantasy world in which overwhelming quantities of evidence can simply be ignored. The Holocaust is an established historical fact; if we know of any 20th century historical event that definitely took place, it's this one. Nobody can argue that the Nazi authorities did not murder millions of European Jews, but what is still a matter of dispute is the extent to which this was a plan from the outset or whether it was something that the Nazis started doing in a small and relatively ad hoc way and subsequently decided to organise on a mass scale. That they ended up doing it on a mass scale is likewise firmly established as fact. But Dawidowicz sees it all as having been Hitler's secret plan all along, and the fact remains that while there is plenty of evidence that Hitler knew of the murder of Jews and indeed that he supported it, there is no evidence that he ever had any sort of scheme in his mind about how it would be done. The planning happened at a lower level, and it didn't always happen purely because Hitler wanted it to happen. There is no slip of paper in some archive somewhere on which Hitler wrote down \\"Kill all the Jews in Europe\\". Holocaust deniers take this to mean that he didn't want it to happen, but that's just silly. We know it happened and we can be sure that it happened with his blessing; beyond that it gets complicated, more complicated than Dawidowicz can handle.I would advise curious readers to consult the one-volume abridgment of Hilberg's great work, or failing that Martin Gilbert's popular history \\"The Holocaust\\"."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Dawidowicz takes a long detailed look at the Holocaust and how it was allowed to happen, from the events shaping Hitler's life, to the history of Antisemitism in Europe. The author shows in great detail, utilizing many first person accounts the steps from the Enabling Act all the way to the closing of the war. Her account is vivid and heart wrenching, while it does show some of the more unscrupulous sides of the Jewish response, it also details the great measures the Jewish community went to in trying to avoid the Holocaust as well as the inconceivable pains that it suffered during it."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"Having read many books about WWII and the Holocaust, this book combines the two around the overarching theme of Hitler and the Third Reich's declaration of war against the Jewish population of the world. More than the Holocaust of the deathcamps and the legal restrictions, this book puts the entire war in context as a war against the Jews rather than the Holocaust being merely one part of WWII. While the same information is available elsewhere, this book brings it all together concisely and thoroughly. It is also well-written and presents the historical facts like a storyteller."},{"Title":"The War Against The Jews, 1933-1945","review":"When I received the book it had a crease in the front cover, I'm a book fanatic so they have to be in pristine condition.

I couldn't read Japanese, so of course I bought this romanized dictionary. It was a mistake. When I looked up an English word, there were too many possible Japanese words to choose from. After trying to use them, and my audience not understanding them, I showed them the book. More often than not, poth parties became more confused than before.Here's the solution: buy a dictionary that uses kanji. Every kanji character has a meaning, and all Japanese people can read the 2000 or so basic kanji that are likely to be in the word you looked up. If you buy a good dictionary, like Kodansha's Furigana dictionary, the kanji's pronunciation (hiragana) will be displayed over each kanji character. This makes the dictionary usable by beginners.If you can't read hiragana, I suggest you learn. Don't waste your money on a book that you'll stop using as soon as you learn hiragana, which should be within the first month of studying Japanese."},{"Title":"The Rivers of Klairn: Book Two of the Klaien Series","review":"The planet of Klairn is an amazing planet where the natural resources are watched over by the Protectors.

Iona poses as the wife to each man as the mission progresses.Joby the Black and Lexti are paired as field researchers.

She goes undercover as a secretary of the advertising department of Magusa Petroleum Products. Magusa is the company believed to be guilty (even if indirectly) of polluting the river.***** This novel is, in my opinion, even better than the first! The trees and wildlife can actually communicate with Protectors. In fact, they have even learned to speak a few words to help the process of communications along.You do not HAVE to read the first book to understand everything that is going on, but you will have a much better time understanding the romantic sub-plots. All-in-all, this is one spectacular series that I highly recommend to all fans of Science Fiction! *****"},{"Title":"A Wedding Gift: And Other Angling Stories","review":"John Taintor Foote, one assumes he is somehow related to Shelby &amp; Horton, was a playwright and screenwriter of the 30's (his credits include the great film The Mark of Zorro). In addition, he penned several of the best fishing stories ever written in the continuing misadventures of George Baldwin Potter, collected here with introductions by Foote's son, Timothy.Potter, a fly fishing pedant, is a bachelor in his forties when the series opens, but he has decided to take a young bride. The first story, the eponymous Wedding Gift, finds him pouring out his soul to our narrator. Seems that George's new bride, Isabelle, was not terribly impressed with the honeymoon that he so carefully planned, a one week trek into the wilds of Maine to fly fish. As George's tale wends it's convoluted way to it's conclusion, it builds towards an awful, but truly hilarious, climax which leaves the newlyweds' marriage in a shambles. In the next story, the marriage has again foundered on the rocks after George, dispatched to an auction to purchase a coveted antique, instead finds himself mesmerized by a fly rod collection. And in the final tale, Isabelle gets her revenge by using a brilliant but devious ploy to trick George into buying her a farm in Connecticut.The stories are a delightful screwball combination of fishing and battle-of-the-sexes comedy, sort of Isaak Walton rewritten by Preston Sturges. I can't recommend them highly enough.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"A Wedding Gift: And Other Angling Stories","review":"I received the original printing of this book by my father who purchased it in Europe. My mother found the follow-up book at an auction some twenty years later. This was a dream come true. I am currently looking for the 3rd book (original printing) of Mr. George Potter and his lovely wife and everlasting antique shopper, Isabelle. It helps if you are a fisherman but, you don't necessarily have to be to fall in love with these books. Author, John Foote , puts into words the true feeling of a perfectionist, this one just happens to be a fly fisherman. Every ounce of blood from the character, George Potter, is put forth through his vision of what fly fishing is all about and why everyone should feel the way he does about it. An outstanding series of stories by a writer I know very little about.

Also simple things like just letting people see their own home dir in the smb share and not everyone elses is impossible. I struggled for a week with the product, which at least the book explains well, but in the end gave up and am now happy and content with my bombproof Samba."},{"Title":"Winning With the Smith-Morra Gambit (Batsford Chess Library)","review":"Graham Burgess does a great job in not only organizing his work, but also presenting the tactical pitfalls that come up so frequently in this wild gambit. I do admit that his book is a little optimistic, but there is no proven way to get anymore than equality for black.I recommend the Smith-Morra Gambit to anyone who plays 1. e4, is tactically inclined (positionally impaired?!), and doesn't mind a sharp struggle. And if you want to play the Smith-Morra Gambit there's no better book than Winning With The Smith-Morra Gambit. Note: Winning With The Smith-Morra Gambit is part of the Winning With... series (even though you may very well win with it.)The Smith-Morra Gambit isn't for everyone, and consequently this book is not for everyone, however if you are failing to comprehend the complexities of the Open Sicilian, or your failing to make progress with your anti-Sicilian pet line, give the Smith-Morra Gambit a try, you'll be surprised at how many people blunder when only following common opening principles. For example, after 1. e4 c5 2. d4 cd 3. c3 dc 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6 6. Bc4 e6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Qe2 Be7 9. Rd1 the natural developing move ...O-O leads to a hopelessly lost game for black after 10. e5!.Contrary to common belief, The Smith-Mora Gambit is a sound and very dangerous weapon against the Sicilian, notwithstanding a player has to have an excellent instinct for tactics, thus I cannot recommend it to anyone less than 1700, and of course, the timid.5 stars because it's the best representation of the Gambit (it's organization is second only to Pirc Alert, it shows tactical patterns, and it's all you need in oder to play the opening confidently.)"},{"Title":"Winning With the Smith-Morra Gambit (Batsford Chess Library)","review":"The Smith(Morra)gambit is an exciting way for an agressive player to oppose the siclian defense (1. e4 c5). However, the gambit does involve some risk (for both players, really) which is why many players are put off by the variation.If you are an attack minded 1. e4 player and you like razor sharp positions in which you may be more familar than your opponent - look no further. If you like to push wood for hours and play safe, unassuming chess - forget it!Burgess does a very nice job of explaining the ideas behind the Morra gambit in the introductory chapters - something that I wish a whole lot more opening books would emulate! The book contains a large number of master game references for study. There is even a game featuring World Champ Garry Kasparov as black (and he nearly lost against the Morra!!).The only reason I have given this book four stars instead of the full five, is that there are some places where I feel that Burgess is a tad optimistic about whites chances. All openings have good and bad points and the Morra is no exception. However, the book sometimes stretches a bit and tries to convince you that white can hardly ever lose. (If an opening could really promise all that everyone would start to play it and the game would become obsolete)."},{"Title":"Winning With the Smith-Morra Gambit (Batsford Chess Library)","review":"As a Morra-Gambit player I found this book to be very useful. All known traps are covered with the best way for white to avoid or counter-attack them. For all you black players, it also covers the best ways to beat the Morra-Gambit and it is a bit surprising to see how this is best done"},{"Title":"Winning With the Smith-Morra Gambit (Batsford Chess Library)","review":"On the one hand, it's impudent to put together a couple of commented chess games and call it an opening book. If Mr. Burgess would have bothered to open ANY opening book published in the former Soviet Union, he would have seen what a decent opening book looks like. (There are even translations available.) Since he probably won't stoop to that (because the greatest chess nation on Earth is, of course, England), I better explain what I mean.1. One thing that an opening book can't do without is system. Though Mr. Burgess has succeeded quite well in arranging the games in his book in a logical sequence, the reader will still have to write down his own variant tree with page references if he ever wants to find his way out of the Burgessian maze.2. An opening book is supposed to analyze both good and bad sides of a variant. It is not considered solid to attempt to sell one's stuff whatever it takes. The title of Mr. Burgess's book is too pretentious, not to say misleading. Morra gambit (who's that Smith guy, anyway?) is by far not as powerful as Mr. Burgess claims (or as his sometimes not very thorough analyses attempt to show).On the other hand, this incapable work, unfortunately, is the best source of information on Morra gambit I have seen. (However, I've been out of the active chess life for a few years, so there might be better books available today.) That's the first reason why I can't help giving it four stars. The second reason is that Morra gambit seems to be aggressive player's most promising way of avoiding Sicilian. I have experienced devastating disasters with b4 variants and, after that, played mostly 2. c3, which is, of course, a bit to passive. A few times I have played 2. c4; however, that is not quite my style. (You really should try it, if you like closed positions!) My first results with Morra aren't too great but it looks much better than anything else.One thing I especially liked about the book was the introductory chapter which explained the main ideas of the Morra gambit. Well done!If you are desperate to find an aggressive way of defending yourself against the perversity called Sicilian Defense, you really should consider Morra gambit. This book will give you a good start. If you're just curious, don't waste your money on Mr. Burgess before he has gained some experience on writing chess books."},{"Title":"Rimas/ Rhymes (Clasicos / Classics) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Was a great buy and was in great condition.

It shouldn't be isolated in Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library, and/or Johns Hopkins' University.The H.L.Mencken room at the Pratt, has been called &quot;the cradle of 20th Century literature.&quot; Alistair Cooke, said it exists...&quot;for the comfort of sinners and the astonishment of the virtuous.&quot;As you can see, the author of &quot;Newspaper Days: 1899-1906&quot;, was regarded as an iconoclast during his lifetime, and is still celebrated for fresh, refreshing views and commentary. H.L. Mencken was, above all else, a critic.Mencken wrote his autobiography in three separate volumes cumulatively known, in the world of journalism and literature, as the &quot;Days Books&quot;. In addition to the work under consideration here: &quot;Newspaper Days&quot;, the other two are &quot;Happy Days: 1880-1892&quot;, and &quot;Heathen Days: 1890-1936.&quot; As the title suggest, this book looks at H.L. Mencken's life from 1899, when at 19 he began his half-century career in journalism - at the now defunct Baltimore Morning Herald - through his move to the local newspaper of record: The Baltimore Evening Sun. This relationship with the Sun Papers (there was also a Morning Sun) lasted until 1950, when H.L.M. retired from the board of parent A.S. Abell Company.It was apparent, even this early in the career of &quot;the irreverent Mr. Mencken&quot;, that his niche was writing opinion and criticism; some of it shocking to the establishment; all of it entertaining.Don't let the early period under discussion in this book (1899-1906) lead anyone to believe that the material is dated or old fashioned. Au contraire, Mencken is indeed talking of events which occured a long time ago, but evey word is perfect for the job it is called upon to do. His diction and syntax are all-important.After all, the reason for remembering and reading a critic of an earlier time, like Mencken, is not the issues he wrote about, but the manner in which he said what he said. It is the WAY he said it -- he was a stylist.A great man. A great book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Newspaper Days: 1899-1906","review":"H.L. MenckenNewspaper DaysThis memoir, which treats Henry Louis Mencken's milieu as a fin-de-siecle newspaperman, finds the great critic in an uncharacteristically sympathetic mood, putting aside much of the sass of its predecessor Happy Days, which tells the story of Mencken's amusing slog through adolescence. Mencken admits in the preface that he holds his tenure at the Baltimore Herald in rosy esteem, perhaps the most cherished era of his long career. The famous (and famously fat) critic here appears downright giddy as he discharges himself of more than a few outrageous anecdotes from his seven year lustrum at the Baltimore Herald.Mencken opens with a narrative of his courtship, in 1899, of a reporting job at the Herald: On the heels of his high school graduation, Mencken brushed himself up in his smartest garb and planted himself, with absolutely no credentials, before the city editor Max Ways. Ways told him the staff was full but, as it was common for reporters in those days, either sloshed or just incurably languid, to go AWOL, suggested that the runt come back the next day to check for an opening. Like clockwork, lil' Henry showed up, and was similarly turned down, every day for months until at last he scored a one paragraph blurb in the back pages. Ways recognized his talent and diligence, soon hiring him on as a full time reporter. His responsibilities (and his pay) soon began a rapid and steady climb, landing him an editorship at the Herald at the precocious age of 23.The range of reportage that Mencken was called upon to perform, as well as the nature of his work in general (journalism in this ancient Baltimore apparently amounted to little more than salaried gossip) put him in touch with a sinful amount of scuttlebutt, and effectively launched him into high society: judges, policemen, editors, reporters, restauranteurs, artists, press agents, magnates, actors, politicos, and innumerable other forces are exposed in this memoir.The tales told are of the fireside variety, often ribald, typically recounted with a certain wide-eyed wonder, and fraught with some of the writer's most pungent witticisms.The young reporter's antics are largely benign and waggish, where he cares to share them - despite all he divulges about his peers, the man mostly keeps mum on his own affairs. Indeed, for a memoir, this one is quite lean on the beef. Where his feelings finally threaten to denude themselves, the goodies leak out in short, memorable snatches, never wholesale and direct; apropos to his profession, he does little but report the facts of his actions, and doesn't dote on private details. It is not apparent whether he endured the crises of young adulthood (perhaps this is one of the boons of avoiding college), or whether he ever doubted his own abilities. For better or worse, his editorials, featured in his Chrestomathy, remain the best source for his particular brand of froth.He comes close at least, to full disclosure in the preface, which he capitulates with a remarkably lucid passage on the state of journalistic affairs circa 1941:\\"Whether or not the young journalists of today live so spaciously is a question that I am not competent to answer, for my contacts with them, of late years, have been rather scanty. They undoubtedly get a great deal more money than we did in 1900, but their freedom is much less than ours was, and they somehow give me the impression, seen at a distance, of complacency rather than intrepidity. In my day a reporter who took an assignment was wholly on his own until he got back to the office, and even then he was little molested until his copy was turned in at the desk; today he tends to become only a homunculus at the end of a telephone wire, and the reduction of his observations to prose is commonly farmed out to literary castrati who never leave the office, and hence never feel the wind of the world in their faces or see anything with their own eyes. I well recall my horror when I heard, for the first time, of a journalist who had laid in a pair of what were then called bicycle pants and taken to golf: it was as if I had encountered a stud-horse with his hair done up in frizzes, and pink bowknots peeking out of them. It seemed, in some vague way, ignominious, and even a bit indelicate. I was shocked almost as much when I first heard of reporters joining labor unions, and describing themselves as wage slaves. The underlying ideology here, of course, was anything but new, for I doubt that there has ever been a competent reporter in history who did not regard the proprietors of his paper as sordid rascals, all dollars and no sense. But it is one thing (a) to curl the lip over such wretches, and quite another thing (b) to bellow and beat the breast under their atrocities just as it is one thing (a^2) to sass a cruel city editor with, so to speak, the naked hands, and another thing (b^2) to confront him from behind a phalanx of government agents and labor bravoes. The a operations are easy to reconcile with the old-time journalist's concept of himself as a free spirit and darling of the gods, licensed by his high merits to ride and deride the visible universe; the b's must suggest inevitably a certain unhappy self-distrust, perhaps not without ground.\\"Not just personal but professional curiosities are confounded as well: Writers come hither sniffing for tips will be bilked, for the sage neatly denies us of any useful particulars about his craft. The only specifics he offers are in one of the closing chapters, enumerating the ways he and his colleagues often fleshed out meager leads with private inventions, sometimes going as far as fabricating the entire story. Mencken's methods must, it seems, remain lost to posterity.An important lesson, however, is continuously dangled before the reader, and it helps explain both Mencken's remarkable sedulousness and his highly refined prose: Do what you love and do it to death! While his peers toiled away as \\"simian sophomores\\" pursuing lives of quiet desperation, Mencken was chasing down his reporter's dream, going to bed every night exhausted, but never weary. I was so incensed after I finished this book that I marched right down to the office of the Cooper Point Journal, my local student newspaper, and immediately put in my resume. Let's hope fate smiles on me quite as kindly!"},{"Title":"See!","review":"One of my favorite design books!

I personally love purple and it is such rarity to see it used well, without being overpowering.

I think he's a wonderful writer, head and shoulders above most of those writing today, especially in the suspense or murder mystery area. Unfortunately, I feel that Cimarron Rose was a disappointment. Three of Burke's qualities that have made him so much better than others are his psychological portraits of the characters, even the minor ones; his evocative descriptions of place; and his almost poetic word imagery. On all three counts Cimarron Rose fails to live up to his previous novels. There are plenty of images and characters and place descriptions; however, many of them seemed strained or contrived, almost like a parody of the Burke style. I felt that Burke was struggling to write a novel in the manner to which we have become accustomed, but he was trying almost too hard.Too many writers run out of things to say (or ways to say them) before they quit writing; I hope this doesn't happen to James Lee Burke. Perhaps his next one will see him back on form."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"At last, an author that does not patronize you with their main character; He was straighforward-truly a Texan.

I don't think originality is too much to ask for."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Burke has set a standard for the genre with the Dave Robicheaux series; a mystery writer who not only engages the reader with twists, mayhem and suspense but whose command of the language puts him in the ranks of the finest authors. Burke writes in the first person, and while the reader doesn't expect Burke's narrators to take it in the neck in the course of the story, be warned that no one else is exempt - he wipes out principal characters who have survived two, three, or even four novels without breaking a sweat. In Cimmaron Rose, he breaks with his traditional setting of the Louisiana bayou and follows the sun west to Texas, where a Texas Ranger turned small-town lawyer tries to unravel a grisly series of homicides, digging through the mulch of history and turning up ugly revelations with every spadeful. The reader won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Like an actor, type-cast and losing steam, Dave Robicheaux's (briefly) on vacation, until the muse is rekindled. Instead we have Billy Bob, a ragged around the edges guy, whose nightmares, are thankfully fewer than our Crescent City pals.Like many, I've read all JLB, in chronological order, and like many, I've rushed sleeplessly through a story, then more leisurely re-read each to savor the fine writing and local flavor.I could eat chicken-fried steak or nopalitas with Billy Bob as well as piping hot beignets and po' boys with Dave. The tarnished hero, tilting at personal windmills is the common thread, here. The story is engrossing and tightly plotted. Here here, James Lee for trying something new. I enjoy Dave Robicheaux but I am willing to try something else-reaching a little outside a tried and true series to devour a new treat. Excellent read and ultimately rewarding on many levels."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Substitute tortillas for beignets to provide the local flavor, a haunted ex-Texas Ranger for a haunted ex-cop to play the tough-as-nails arbiter of good and evil, and a precocious little half-Mexican son-of-a-drunken-slut boy for a precocious little Central American orphaned girl to embody all that is innocent, pure, and worth protecting, and you've got a Robicheaux novel transplanted a few miles west. I can imagine that Burke has gotten tired of Robicheaux; all the books he stars in are pretty much the same. But changing the names and locale isn't enough to inject new life into the formula. This is decent airplane reading, but no more than that."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"James Lee Burke is perhaps the best writer in his genre working today, and he continues to improve. He combines the ability to craft taut, suspenseful crime thrillers, an eloquent voice, and deep insight into the flaws of human nature. It is our flaws make us human, and our struggles to overcome them that carry the potential for nobility, and Burke's characters strive mightily to get past their own limitations.In Cimmaron Rose, Burke may have crafted his best story to date. The characters are multi-faceted, the dialogue gritty and real, and the sense of place so strong you can smell the hot dust in the air.If you want more than a cardboard-cutout hero who remains untouched by bullets, his own emotion or the suffering of others, bet on Burke."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"I loved this novel from first to last. I have read all his other work and Cimarron Rose rates right up there with the best of them. I especially enjoyed the setting and atmosphere of the story. The sights and smells of a farm and its livestock as well as the small town in Texas took me back to other times when I lived in a similar place and setting. His characters are real. One recognizes them as the story progresses. Their actions seem inevitable in the end. I can't wait for the next book from this wonderfully gifted author."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Having read several of James Lee Burke's novels now, I have come to see that his approach to weaving together a story is intriguingly unorthodox. His narrative is choppy and at times almost disjointed; short vignettes, encounters, and episodes are cobbled together, and change-of-voice digressions and flashbacks are not unusual. Readers accustomed to a smoother ride will find Burke's approach difficult in places.At the same time, Burke can positively hypnotize readers through the beauty of the language he employs and his ability to capture a thought, a moment, a mood, or a concept in a few well-chosen words or phrases. This combination of organizational looseness and powerful, evocative writing makes reading Burke a truly distinctive literary experience.In *Cimarron Rose*, Burke has taken a break from his Dave Robacheaux series and has introduced a new protagonist, Billy Bob Holland in a new setting, Deaf Smith County, Texas. Still, the overall tone and style of the story will be familiar to readers of previous Burke novels. Holland is another fallen lawman-type haunted by his past, and his similarity to Robacheaux in terms of his patterns of action and thinking are hardly surprising. The story itself is populated by desperate criminal types, fallen women, drunkards, corrupt &quot;leading citizens,&quot; a demented maniac, and in fact, a entire cast of typical denizens of Burke's stories.With its loosely woven whodunit plot line and its accompanying quota of broken noses and gunshot wounds, the story is a kind of classic combination of police mystery and violent pulp fiction novella. Added to this are some interesting added elements, including recurring reference to Billy Bob's great-grandaddy's journal and the regular appearance of the ghost of Billy Bob's ex-best friend and partner. Combined with a rather weird ... ending, the whole mish-mash makes for interesting reading but doesn't constitute a satisfactorily well-woven novel overall.Despite its flaws, *Cimarron Rose* is worthwhile not only because of Burke's talents as a wordsmith, but also because of his astute eye for social and class interactions and conflict in his small-town southern setting. His descriptions of the myriad ways in which the affluent &quot;East enders&quot; dominate the small Texas community in which events unfold in this book shows Burke's keen understanding of the sociological and economic as well as psychological aspects of his human subject matter. Clearly, his own sympathies are with the lower classes, the downtrodden, the underprivileged, and the way he skewers the powerful and hypocritical in this book is impressive, indeed."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"If you have never read a Burke novel then you may like this. If you are familiar with the Robicheaux novels, then pass this one up. I like James Lee Burke's novels, but this book is just the same story and same characters with different names and in Texas instead of New Iberia, LA. Billy Bob is just Dave Robicheaux except as a small town lawyer rather than a small town cop. He has a woman partner, has semi-adopted a young ethnic child, talks to a ghost, defends the down-trodden and his father was killed in an oil company accident just like Robicheaux's father. He deals with sketchy characters from his past and has to deal with the &quot;psychic scars&quot; of his past as the NY Book Review put it. Sound familiar? If you have read the Robicheaux series then, of course it does. I found myself missing the antics of Clete Purcel. Same idea here: the rich and powerful screw with the down and out. Guess who wins in the end?"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"I liked part two (Bitterroot) of James Lee Burke&#8217;s Billy Bob Holland saga so well that I gave this first part a listen on unabridged audio. Boy howdy, Billy Bob gets better with age!Cimarron Rose is our introduction Billy Bob Holland, an attorney/former Texas Ranger (the Law Enforcement kind &#8211; not G.W.&#8217;s former baseball team) and his friends and relatives, including his dead ranger partner, L.Q. Navarro, for whose death Billy Bob, a &#8220;river-baptized&#8221; Baptist turned Roman Catholic, feels all the guilt that the latter can impose.The plot exposes small-town caste sociology to the light - without proselytizing - like Stephen King did in the horror venue with &#8220;Carrie.&#8221; But what&#8217;s up with Great-grandpa&#8217;s journal? This reader doesn&#8217;t see the point - except to exploit the extreme predjudices of the period against Native Americans. The author&#8217;s forays (via excerpts from an old journal) into Billy Bob&#8217;s outlaw/preacher great-grandfather&#8217;s lust for the &#8220;savage&#8221; Cimarron Rose, and concomitant self-hatred, seem superfluous and gratuitous.Burke&#8217;s writing is superb. At one point I just had to stop and write down a quote. Billy Bob (the tale is written in the first-person) is telling us about his Daddy, who had gone nearly blind as a welder. Then, &#8220;Clarity of sight&#8221; came only when he was welding &#8220;and saw again the flame that was as pure to him as the cathedrals bells were to the deaf bell-ringer Quasimodo.&#8221;This tour of Burke&#8217;s Deaf Smith County, Texas is well worth the trip. Stay on board for Bitterroot, Montana!"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"James Lee Burke continues to produce thought-provoking and thoroughly readable fiction. Cimarron Rose weaves a fine tale with strong characters, good plotting and excellent first person narration. Drawing from his usual themes, Burke reflects on how the past informs the present, how men like hero Billy Bob Holland, (an ex-Texas Ranger) reconciles the violence in his life whilst trying to be decent as he raises a surrogate son in the form of a young mexican boy, (echoes here of Dave Robicheaux's adopted daughter Alafair). Cimarron Rose begins well and continues to grip the reader as a gallery of typical Burke villians(revolting pyscopaths, obnoxious federal agents, crooked law enforcement officers and rich spoilt, vicious brats) give hero Holland grief. Varying in style only slightly from Burke's earlier books, those who have enjoyed his work before should enjoy this book too."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Fans of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux/cajun cop series now have a new series with Texas lawyer Billy Bob Holland. If this had been the first Burke book for me, I would have rated it higher.The main plot involves Billy Bob defending his illegitimate son against a murder charge in a fishy-smelling situation involving a rich kid deviant with fetal alcohol syndrome and speed on the brain, a former football hero, DEA officers, and a sociopath named Garland T. Moon.The inner plot involves Billy Bob wrestling with ghosts and demons from his past, namely private conversations he has with his old partner from their Texas Ranger days. There is also some mystery surrounding the death of Billy Bob's father in 1965.Burke does an excellent job weaving all of the plot threads together, and the characters are believable. His descriptions are spare and elegant, and he has the ability provide sensory detail in a few short sentences.One word of warning is that the cast is a rogue's gallery, like other Burke novels, and features a very flawed protaganist, but one we can root for just the same. Still, we're in some dark territory here, and Burke's writing is edgy, graphic and not for everyone.While the book was well-written, I didn't get enough distance between Dave Robicheaux and Billy Bob Holland, who are essentially the same character. Both are men in their forties who stay in good shape, have father issues, and share similar demons in their past. The same self-righteous attitude was evident in both men. I hope that Billy Bob's voice takes a different shape in future novels of this series.The other problem is that Burke is starting to recycle some of his details. The wealthy southerners always hold glasses wrapped with paper napkins secured with a rubber band. He's used this one a lot. There's also one where the night smells of fish spawning that's been used multiple times.Still, this was a gripping read filled with tension on every page that made me want to know what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"All right, for some reason I haven't been familiar with Burke's writing up to now. Nobody e-mailed me about him. I was surfing the Mystery Writers' Association website and I noticed that Burke has this habit of winning Edgar awards over and over, so I thought I'd check him out.This is one of the Edgar winners, and it supports my previously-expressed hypothesis that they don't give out the award by drawing names out of a hat. This is a very strong novel with a West Texas small-city/rural voice, with currents of Ross MacDonald and Dashiell Hammett, a touch of Larry McMurtry, and highlights of raspberry, chocolate, and tobacco. I'm sorry about the 'highlights', I realized I sounded as if I was describing wine and couldn't resist.I mean the other stuff, though, and it's all complimentary. By referring to MacDonald, I mean that Burke displays the same sense of complexity: of setting, of interaction. I mean, everyone has a history, everyone has secrets, and not just every major and minor character, but every place, every barn and lot and stream. And all of these secrets are liable to bubble up and confuse everyone at any moment and knock the plot into a new and surprising direction. Nobody is carrying out any one plan. Everyone has a lot of things on his/her mind. It's the exact opposite of the sense that you get with one of these serial-killer novels where the villain is omnipotent and single-minded and supremely organized and does nothing all day except perfect his serial killing plan. Here most of the people are at least somewhat friendly and at least somewhat dangerous, and the tensions seldom get resolved.However, Burke's style is not MacDonald's brooding tapestry of similes; it's much more like Hammett, spare, brisk, and violent; for example:&quot;... [I] rode my Morgan up on the porch and through the doorway, ducking down on his withers to get under the jamb. ..&quot;'I hope you brung your own dustpan and whisk broom,' the bartender said.&quot;I rode the Morgan between a cluster of tables and chairs and across a small dance floor toward the pool table. The man eating from a paper plate looked at me, smiling, a spoonful of chili half-way to his mouth ... I whipped the loop three times over my head and flung it at the man with the blond beard ... He tried to rise from the chair and free himself, but I wound the rope tightly around the pommel, brought my left spur into the Morgan's side, and catapulted the blond man off his feet and dragged him caroming through tables and bar stools and splintering chairs, into an oak post and the legs of a pinball machine and the side of the jukebox, tearing a huge plastic divot out of the casing.&quot;Note how he uses the rhythm of the clauses to pace the action, short and simple as the action impends, then exploding along with the action into a sprawling run-on sentence. The action leaps along; the average 'scene' is a page or a page and a half long, and since something happens in every 'scene', by the time you are on page 10, things are moving fast and furious. This is also very much like Hammett: think about &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, for example.Later, the county D.A. complains:&quot;I work in a county that's so corrupt I have to confide in a defense lawyer who rides his horse into barrooms. I grant you, it's a pitiful situation.&quot;That last line is the sort of thing that makes me think of McMurtry - I mean the best McMurtry, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; in particular. Isn't that a gem? Can't you imagine Woodrow Call saying that? Or maybe it isn't McMurtry at all, maybe they just really talk like that all the time in West Texas, and Burke and McMurtry are just reporting it. Whichever, it's an attractive feature.The narrator, Billy Bob Holland, is a former Texas Ranger who has retreated into criminal defense work in self-imposed penance for accidentally shooting his partner and best friend, L. Q. Navarro, in a chaotic battle with drug smugglers down in Coahuila. He sees Navarro everywhere and talks with him, but these dialogues don't hurt the plot much. He is also re-reading his great-grandfather's journals, which are the stuff of a novel in themselves, in an attempt (I guess) to explore the question of whether and how you can get out of the rut of living in a violent and self-destructive culture. You can either treat this as an interesting interlude, or skip over it, or try to tie it in convincingly with the main action. I never really managed this last, but it doesn't bother me much.The plot starts off with Holland being summoned to defend a young man on charges of rape and murder, and the trial winds up near the end of the book, but to say that the book is 'about' the trial is to ignore the 15 other subplots that turn the narrative structure into a 'bush' rather than a 'ladder'. I guess the book is mainly about trying to do what's right even if you live in a really corrupt county and have a great burden of shame of your own. Unless you argue that the style itself is the content, as if it were a work of instrumental music. Whichever. Anyway, I recommend this book very highly."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Cimarron Rose is a typically offbeat James Lee Burke tale, set in the small town of Deaf Smith, Texas. Defense attorney, Billy Bob Holland, is asked to take on the cases of two young men, and soon finds himself in the middle of a complex set of corrupt relationships that will not be sorted out unless he does it. The book has a fascinating story within a story delivered in the form of a journal inherited from his Great-grandpa Sam that Billy Bob reads almost daily while pursuing the case. The book has fascinating characters whose evil, blindness, and carelessness make the story develop in unexpected ways. Although the book has much violence in it, there is a genuine attempt to keep the violence within some sort of limits that makes the book more appealing.I like books that feature significant character development, and this one does an exemplary job with Billy Bob and Lucas Smothers, who is accused of a rape and murder. These two men are very complicated but in a way that will draw you in, and cause you to root for them to keep following their ideals and dreams.The backdrop is a crooked town, in a corrupt county, with lots of bent government types running around. Although probably no worse than a lot of other places, this book is about a sort of Texas Sodom and Gomorrah. There is a need for someone to do more than what is required, and Billy Bob takes on that role. You will find those who are satisfied with their wealthy lives just as culpable as those who are totally corrupt.Fans of the Dave Robicheaux novels will find this one follows the general approach of those rich, complex stories.Clearly, Billy Bob is a fellow who operates well outside the law, a sort of modern day Lone Ranger. At the same time, he can barely keep himself from going off the deep end mentally. As a result, he is sort of like a ticking time bomb, and you keep expecting him to go off. And he does.The plot culminates in a trial that presents the kind of unexpected developments that you will recognize from Perry Mason stories.After you finish reading this novel, you should think about when you should follow God's law, when men's laws, and when your own conscience. How would you have handled the dilemmas presented here for Billy Bob and Lucas? How could they have handled them better?Live in the present and make a pathway for good!"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Defense attorney Billy Bob Holland is an ex-Texas Ranger who has taken a murder case where the chief suspect is his illegitimate son. But this isn't a simple plot; it involves his father and his great grandfather's diary as well. The past also haunts him literally-in the form of L.Q. Navarro. As a Ranger, Billy Bob accidentally killed his partner and friend. Periodically L.Q. appears to Billy Bob and offers him advice. The intricate plot and fluid writing definitely draw you into the Billy Bob's world in Deaf Smith. For instance, there isn't just one villain; the novel is full of unsavory characters. I fell in love with the lyric images floating from the pages and atmosphere, but I have to admit the ending was a bit confusing."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Like many of James Lee Burke's legion of devoted fans, I have read all of the Dave Robicheaux novels (in the order in which they were written). Before I added my review for Cimarron Rose I read many of the ones written by fellow fans. It was interesting to see that while JLB still has a loyal following, there are those who were (and are) disappointed by some of his recent efforts. The other thing that truly amazed me has been the quality of the writing in the reviews submitted by other readers. It made me wonder if many of them worked as literary critics or college English professors. Needless to say, there is a surprising lack of consensus on the quality of Cimarron Rose. When the book first came out, I was initially disappointed that Dave, Clete, Batist, Alafair and Bootsie would not appear between the two covers. The move to small-town Texas also did not appeal to me at first but, as I got into the book, I realized here was something new ---James Lee Burke was venturing further afield than New Iberia parish or even his other erstwhile home, Montana.I am a Northerner who has lived in the South and find Burke's writing evocative but also very unsettling. He knows from whence he writes but for me, he reminds me of everything I saw in Georgia and came to hate. Cimarron Rose, while set in Texas, stresses that there are truly vile, ignorant, bigoted people populating these newly popular Sun Belt States who deserve nothing more than our enmity and vilification. The Billy Bob Hollands and the Dave Robicheauxs of the world notwithstanding, the novels of JLB, while beautifully written, paint a sordid picture of the South (and Southwest)that confirm the rightness of my decision to return to the Northeast.All of the books JLB has written have stressed a darker side of life. While he has heroes, there is nothing heroic about these books. They are almost always well crafted and yet, they remind me of things I'd thought I'd left behind in the Coastal Empire of SE Georgia. His writing also makes me wonder if his southern readers like him or hate him for showing the rest of the world the darker side of the region they call home. The Robicheaux novels are set in Louisiana and if as it appears, Billy Bob Holland continues as an alternate character in another series, will he make us cringe while he writes about the bigoted half-wits in Deaf Smith, Texas?I often wonder, is James Lee Burke trying to tell us all how much he despises us? I ask this question because he makes a lot of money from his readership. His single most popular character, Dave Robicheaux is the one that got him noticed as a writer and yet, JLB had at least 6 other novels out years before that barely brought him attention. Almost all of them have been or will be re-released and all because of the popularity of the troubled cop from New Iberia.Is Billy Bob different from Dave? Not really. Does that change the fact that I really enjoyed the book? Nope. But, some of my fellow reader critics seem to have hit the nail squarely on the head. JLB may just well be starting to turn out novels on a formulaic basis. I say this because I came to that conclusion about John Grisham. I also have wondered if Hyperion has hooked JLB into a multi-book contract and the only way he can fulfill his end of the bargain is to churn out Robicheaux &quot;look-alike, sound-alikes.&quot; After all, Grisham, while changing his characters from book to book, is already well past his prime. He should try to enjoy those royalties; he doesn't really need to work anymore.In any case, I say all of this from a distance but not with malice. After all, James Lee Burke is making a very nice living indeed from doing something I wish I could do and that's write popular fiction that's well received. For that I am grateful, because he keeps me entertained and wanting more. I just hope that he and Dave (and Billy Bob over there in Deaf Smith, Texas) find their voices again. All three of them still have a lot to say."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Cimarron Rose has many of the same elements as the Robicheaux novels, but it's a great leap for Burke. The writing is tighter and more condensed, yet magically evocative of strong characterizations and sense of place and time. More than any of his other books, there are several places where one sentence is simply perfect in its description of a place, scene, or person, bringing the entire picture together in the reader's mind. ( I can't believe the Kirkus reviewer wasn't able to figure this out). The story is satisfyingly complex, with no loose ends or &quot;wait a minute!&quot; suspensions of belief. Yes, Billy Bob is something of a clone of Robicheaux (and Burke might have used a less sterotypical name name for his protagonist). But every author must get sick of writing about the same character time and again. Billy Bob has great potential (no wife or kids) which will allow Burke to take the character into uncharted directions in future books. I especially love what Burke does with descriptions of not only sights but sounds and smells. Within 50 pages, the reader is simply THERE, and feels as though he/she has been there and knows these folks like they were long-lost neighbors, relatives, friends and enemies. Bravo, Mr.Burke"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"I enjoyed reading Cimmaron Rose. It was good entertainment. I liked it better than the Robicheaux novels, because it was less depressing. I liked the women in it.I have lived in 2 very small Texas towns as a teenager. Kids were not immune from the town's pressure to conform to its moral standards. The rich kids were the children of the town's leaders, and were under more pressure to conform and be &quot;good&quot;. When teenagers get drunk,parents seem to always find out. Kids generally got into trouble when there were not enough activities. They &quot;parked&quot;. The best looking girls were always in danger of getting pregnant.I think this novel was good fiction and I hope no one assumes that small Texas towns have so many misbehaving children (or corrupt police)."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Jame Lee Burke is one of the finest story tellers writing today. When one of his new novels comes out I drop everything and read immediately.

In \`Cimarron Rose' James Lee Burke proves that he is one of the best descriptive writers we have. His ability to set moods and describe characters is tremendous. \`Cimarron Rose' creates the anger and injustice that has always been at the center of Burke's books. The grit from his early works such as \`Two For Texas' and \`To The Bright and Shining Sun' is now combined with his ability to craft a stellar story line. True, he has more than his fair share of ghosts in the closet, but what the heck, that's what fiction is for."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"I respect JLB for trying to develop a new character and place, but I have to say -- having read all of his Robicheaux books - that I was disappointed in this one. Perhaps it will take another novel to perfect the Billy Bob character. I think the plot is rather confusing -- so many eccentric characters, as is JLB's signature -- and not enough focus on Billy Bob's character. JLB seems to dance around Billy Bob's ambivalence toward life, e.g., &quot;I had made a career out of living a half life,&quot; which might be a wonderful and powerful statement. This may be because the author hasn't decided who Billy Bob is. The author doesn't know Texas as he knows Louisiana. I am not from Texas, although I have been there, as well as Louisiana. The moody, lyric writing about the landscape of Louisiana in the Robicheaux books rings true, delicious and delirious, whereas the Texas scenes seem to be overwritten, as if the author is trying too hard. That may be part of the problem with this novel in general. I think JLB, nonetheless, is a top-notch literary writer in the mystery genre. He is one of the best. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"You can see, smell and feel that small Texan town and the people who pervert it.

I am not sure I am going to revisit this author again as I found this book a chore to get through. I remained dilligent and did wade through all the cutesy comments and sayings that Burke's characters threw in along the way, I did feel as though it distracted from the story and book. Some of the comments would have added color and flair, but it seems as though Burke deemed it necessary to make a jaded or colored comment from every character at ever turn. This distracted from the story and made it hard to follow and get down to business. Also I felt as though his characters werent developed as well as they could have been for many reasons I won't get into. I am not a prude, but also felt the story was weighed down with lots of vulgarity in which a little would have gone a long way. The story overall was one that was a good one to tell, and you did find yourself rooting for the main character Lucas Smothers (Billy Bob's illigetimate son) that lawyer Billy Bob Holland worked to free of a murder charge. Later in the novel when the courtroom scenes appeared, I did think that this was well written as the evidence in the case comes to view. Some of the vial criminals and characters leading up to that were pushed a little too much upon us as readers I felt. Too there was Billy Bob's former dead Texas Ranger partner LQ Navarro that was brought to light along the way that made commmentary in Billy Bob's head, at times he added and brought light to the story and at other times he was just another distraction from the telling of the story. Perhaps it wasn't my cup of tea as some of my favorite mystery authors like Jonathan Kellerman, William Kent Krueger, and even western author Elmer Kelton develop and write with such a flair that the pages fly off the books like a hurricane raged stream that flows to a main river. There I added my own cutesy comment to the reivew. Going to give Burke the benefit of the doubt and not give him a rating of one, but a two because of the overall content and scope of the story. Again at some point I may pick up another book and see how it goes, but for now I am going to give it a rest!!!"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Perfect winter night reading. The memories. so realistic - like snapshots from the past. With the special Burke ingredients: intrigue, brilliant plotting, and likable/interesting characters that you hate to leave at the end.

It had an ethereal quality to it."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"james Lee Burke just keeps on doing it.He has a way of endearing a flawed character, which is a change from the stereotyped heroes most authors prefer.The fullness of the characters, along with their idiosycrocies, make for very enthralling entertainment."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"If you like Burke which means you like character development, good guys who are meaner than the bad guys, well developed prose, and a bit of quirkiness you will like this book. I started reading this series to help withdraw from Robicheaux but it didn't quite work out as I hoped. Robicheaux along with Clete make for constant violence and chaos but here Billy Bob scales it back just enough that you pause and think a little more. Not a bad thing but you will find yourself missing the action.If I were to reread all of Burke I would slow down on Robicheaux by filling in with the Holland cousins (Billy Bob and Hackberry) in between. They make for a nice change of pace but you keep waiting for them to bring the pain and hurt down onto the bad guys and occassionally it does happen but not enough.If had never read the robicheaux series than the Holland cousins would get 5 stars. But I did so they dont."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Sometimes you find an author whose work is so fine s/he makes you ashamed of your own pitiful scribbling. James Lee Burke does that for me. His book \\"Cimarron Rose\\" is a good example of his stellar performance.\\"Cimarron Rose,\\" one of Burke's Billy Bob Holland novels, is the story of Billy Bob's search for the killer of a killer and his adolescent associates when a teen age girl is killed in a hangout popular with teenagers wilding. In that, maestro Billy Bob Holland takes the lead defending an adolsecent whose lower class family background preselect him as victim. In the episode that follows Billy Bob kicks open a giant hole in town corruption, wealthy power and seemingly immoral leaders of the social upper crust.Billy Bob, raw fisted and quick tempered, seems to embody the fighting truth seeker a la Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer of 50 years ago. This novel is replete with uncountable fist, knife, and gunfights, mano a mano among the bad guys of \\"Cimarron Rose.\\"In this novel, author Burke follows the progress of attorney Billy Bob Holland gathering evidence of his client's innocence and stirs up a hornets's nest of the rich and their ties with evil forces in American life. The plot and conflict=tension is further enhanced by Billy Bob's dead friend, a PTSD-like ghost enduced by a shoot out with drug runners in northern Mexico, and wisdom found in reading his father's diaries.Author Burke's skills with characterization lie in his deft use of short descriptions such as: \\"On the trial he met a hollow-eyed preacher whose face had been branded with red hot horseshoes by Comanches north of the Cimarron\\"; \\"L.Q. Navarro [the ghost partner] sat on top of a stall, the heels of his boots hooked onto a plank\\"; \\"Mary Beth Sweeny . . . still in uniform from the night shift, her thumbs hooked into the sides of her gun belt\\". With these short machine gun bursts of colorful description, author Burke develops his characters, depicts attitude, and progresses the action all in a single phrase.Like the real estate legend of \\"location , location, location,\\" in crime novels it's \\"plot, plot, plot.\\" At that, James Lee Burk is the master plotster.As conflict after conflict, each more life-threatening to allies, it's Billy Bob's personal and cool-headed rage that saves the day time to time. But, that's not to say his sticking his head into the lion's mouth is not dangerous -- because it IS dangerous, but author Burke has developed tough but likeable heroes and we fear for their lives.Finally, James Lee Burke's \\"Cimarron Rose\\" will bowl you over with his \\"writerly\\" prose, i.e., control over language that literally sparkles with new views of life, e.g., \\"She pulled her T shirt over her head, her hair collapsing on her shoulders\\"; \\"he had crashed through the enemy line like a tank through a hedgerow\\"; \\"The headlights shone in my driveway, bounced across the chicken run and filled the barn and horse lot with shadows\\". If you like an unbridled wordsmith at the top of his game,you'll be as crazy as I am for the work of James Lee Burke. A solid read from the first word to the last."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Burke has created an imperfect protagonist with Billy Bob Holland, and although the book has some complex plots and subplots that may seem a bit conventionalized, the strength of the descriptive writing is such and the broad swath of characters he creates makes up for it. But more significantly is that James Lee Burke has in his more recent books created reverberations between the local and the culture at large. Virtually every law enforcement organization from the feds to the Mexican federales are shown to be not the law abiding and enforcing institutions they claim to be, and it's about as accessible a metaphor to the degradation of the cultural ideas of fairness, goodness, concern for the underdog and the perversion of personal independence that seems to have befallen a good number of Americans. You can read it for the language, the characters, the attention to emotional and physical detail, but when all is said and done, you have a portrait of America that is not very pretty and not painted by a so called 'liberal' but by a protagonist who, as Hemingway said every good writer should have, \\"A built-in Sh-T detector.\\""},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Having never read a James Lee Burke novel before, I gobbled up Cimarron Rose, enjoying meeting all the colorful characters, two of whom was Pete and his PI sidekick....couldn't wait to hear what happened to both of them and fully expected him to jump into the relationship he should have developed right from the gitco.I actually threw this book in the garbage (something I have very rarely ever done in my long reading life) after I read the last chapter. The recap of characters he gave us was [disappointing] and never once mentioned either of those two.It was a total let-down but obviously meant that I loved the book all the way to that point and was so emotionally involved with it that it hurt to close the book with so many questions still unanswered."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"the story began well, the reviews it had seemed to make it appear like it really was a good work of fiction. well its good, i just wasnt convinced that it was the winner coz on the last part or past halfway of the book it seemed to have lost steam, the only saving grace was the courtroom drama of billy bob and his son which isnt that exciting really. anyway its good in its own right and i havent read his other book &quot;black cherry blues&quot; yet' so i guess the award giving body still have a chance to prove to me if the award was given out of favorit--- or theres no other better choice that year."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Billie Bob Holland replaces Dave Robichaux in this tale of Texas violence. As usual, the author creates an intense and steamy atmosphere among the rednecks and backwaters of the south. His narrator is really the same voice as the indomitable,but flawed Dave.Once again the bad guys are truly evil, but meet their fate via the honesty and courage of a strong, decent, but somewhat tainted hero."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Billy Bob Holland, the hero of Cimarron Rose, could not have come at a better time for Burke fans. With Dave Robicheaux now settled, married and off the booze, he's grown a little complacent, and, I'm afraid, a little boring. Holland represents an opportunity for Burke to explore that familiar territory of the errant knight trying to bring law and order to a lawless community, and explore it he does. Burke's lyrical writing is at times breathtaking. His sense of place is keenly felt and he still writes about violence better than anyone in the business. While the plot gets a little confused at times, with all of the various low lifes, Burke manages to pull it off. Here's hoping we see another novel about Holland in the near future."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Burke introduces a new character and a new location. Billy Bob Holland is a ex-Houston cop, ex-Texas Ranger, ex-prosecutor and currently a trial lawyer. Holland is a complex character struggling with a violent past. Holland's illegitimate son has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend. The plot is complex with a multitude of characters. This novel is an excellent read, I didn't want to put it down. I think you will like this novel as much as I do."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"James Lee Burke is a master at setting the scene and creating a feeling with his stories. His novels are so heartfelt and deep, that even if the story is a bit familar as the above reviewers have stated, for me at least it doesn't matter.Corruption and greed are at play in Deaf Smith, Texas. Billy Bob Holland, a one time Texas Ranger, is man with scars that he can't hide. He's a walking wound, attempting to understand why people act as they do, and if some of those people get into trouble, Billy Bob is there to defend them.He cant shake his violent past, a past that includes the death of his best friend, a man and event that he can't let go of.The story center's around a murder, the accused is someone that Billy Bob knows well, he knows the boy is innocent, but there are other's who seem bound and determined to nail the boy and Billy Bob.The pace is fast, the dialogue is short but real, you feel as if you went to Texas you might just run into Billy Bob.This is a book to enjoy, to sit back when the house is quiet and just read, letting yourself disappear into the world of James Lee Burke."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"This was my first Burke novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing bugging me was this Avalon business. Does Burke have some kind of deal with Toyota to keep plugging this car? It's just a little thing but it got distracting after awhile. Maybe not what I'd call the number one mystery of the year as the Edgar's gave it, but it was enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Cimarron Rose carries the same style as James Lee Burke's other novels where the central focus is on the inner workings of the character's psyche and not some much on the plot, which takes a backseat. Once I got to know the new protagonist, Billy Bob Holland, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel.While the reading the book I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Burke and found that he really did have a great grandfather named Sam Holland who drove cattle on the Chisholm Trail, killed several men in gun fights and later became a preacher. As in the book, all this was recorded in a journal which Mr. Burke still has. While the novel is somewhat uneven and the plot muddled, even for a James Lee Burke story, I still can recommed it and look forward to reading &quot;Heartwood&quot; to see how this series progresses."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Having been born and bred in Texas but having traveled extensively throughout Louisiana, I was eager to delve into Cimmaron Rose, having read all of the Dave Robicheaux novels. My first empression upon finishing the book was that I had read a novel written by a Cajun ABOUT a Texas, while in all of Burke's Robicheaux novels I felt I was reading a book written by a Cajun about events that may have occurred in his own back yard. With Robicheaux, Burke created a protagonist that is REAL - with a wife murdered, a child adopted, run- ins with mob characters, and most importantly being fired from two different law enforcement agencies. That's real life, and as a reader and also a former police officer, I found myself actually &quot;smelling&quot; the swamps and feeling the dampness of the New Orleans &quot;dives&quot;. Dave is real life, while Billy Bob feels much more fictional. The Texan lingo and locale was real enough, but the character himself lacked depth, which is at the core of the Robicheaux tales. Without background for the reader to feed off of, it was hard to get into the book, although Burke has the phenomonal ability to make his readers feel the events rather than just read the words. I feel he should either let Billy Bob go, provide a great deal of depth and/or background to him (wife, children, childhood, etc.) or come back to the New Iberia Parish and the bait house and give the readers what they love the most - their Cajun Cop."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"As a fan of the Robicheaux novels, Neon Rain, Heavens Prisoners et all, I cursed the introduction of a new character(authors seem to tire of their creations before we do) but Cimarron Rose has no part of disappointment in the whole description. Billy Bob Holland and Deaf Smith,Texas deliver both the 'body bags and toe tags' of Burke's relentless realism; and,like Dave Robicheaux in New Iberia, also sandpapers our frequently dulled sensibilities. There is in James Lee Burke's work a prevalent theme of honor - lost,or misplaced,but like a gremlin sitting on your shoulder, always there just out of sight. While Burke has a storyteller's gift and the ability to create intensely vivid locale, the private lights of his tarnished heros are what transform paper and ink to flesh and blood. In all the Robicheaux novels, and now in Cimarron Rose,the protagonists seem to say....&quot;Bless me Father for I have sinned&quot;, while others in the cast echo the truth..........&quot;but so have you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"This was my first James Lee Burke novel. I really liked the writing style. Lee is spare with both words and discriptions but yet still creates full characters and a sense of what a small west Texas town is like. The plot has as many twists and turns as a rattlesnake slithering across hot asphalt. I felt though that with these twists and turns, there were too many plot angles left untied. And, I really couldn't understand Holland's infatuation with the cop. But, all in all, I couldn't put it down"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"James Lee Burke has produced another winner, and introduces all of us to a new, compelling hero. &quot;Cimarron Rose&quot; tells the dual tale of Billy Bob Hollander, and his great-grandfather Sam Hollander. (Sam's tale is relayed through excerpts of his diary which Billy Bob reads during the course of the novel.)Billy Bob is a flawed hero, in the vein of Dave Robicheaux. He is a man of strong moral principles and unapologetic faith. How he balances his ideals, and seeks justice in a corrupt world, makes or good reading; and provides food for thought.I believed that the latest entries in the Robicheaux series showed some tiredness on Burke's part. He has pretty well explored Robicheaux's character and world. It was time for Burke to move on, and he has wisely chosen to do so. Still, this new novel contains what we have come to expect from Burke: an interesting protagonist, other characters with both good and bad traits, and a sense of the world in which they all live. A classic touch: Burke's descriptions of the meals his characters eay. If the Robicheaux novels left you hungry for a po' boy sandwich, wait till you read about Billy Bob's meals of steak, eggs and refried beans!It is a wise author who knows when it's time to retire a character. James Lee Burke has made a smart decision in bringing us Billy Bob Hollander. I look forward to future tales of his adventures in Texas."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Burke is a &quot;reliable author&quot;. If you want to spend your time and money reasonably - &quot;Cimarron Rose&quot; is just what you need. Everything in the book is thought over thoroughly - characters, dialogues, places, actions. It is a well-balanced crime-story for leisurely reading."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"Burke describes characters who are as incongruous as the landscape. The heat, the rain, and the desolation make the reader mighty glad not to live anywhere near Mr. Holland. The stated and understated violence is unsettling. One doesn't expect the protagonist, Billy Bob Holland, to die. He takes a lot of chances with some seriously sick people. I wondered why he could be so lucky. But then, I remembered it was only fiction. I dare you to put the book down once started. James Lee Burke has a way with prose that is metaphorical and lyrical. When he is describing ponds and bayoux, he is at his best."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"I have read quite a few of Burkes books and am getting a bit bored with his reference to vietnam and LQ in all his Billy Bob books. Like the characters though and will continue to read James Lee just ready for another plot line will try Whit Dove next"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"This book is terrific, so why the 7? It's Burke's attitude toward soldiers and Viet Nam. In the Robicheaux series, there's always some demented, half-crazed, ex-&quot;machine gunning the children&quot; GI on the loose. In &quot;Rose,&quot; it's not a U.S. Army soldier but a crazed Mexican who was trained at Fort Benning. Memo to Burke: there are a lot of us veterans who served our country, went to war when we were told and did so honorably. Second, lighten up. If you're going to give us a &quot;dark brooding Robicheaux&quot; as a lead character, at least give us a character like Clete to make us smile occasionally. Know what I mean, Streak?"},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"James Lee Burke temporarily put his New Orleans bayeaux hero Dave Robicheaux on hold to introduce a new series featuring Billy Bob Holland, the haunted ex-Texas Ranger, now defense attorney in the small Texas town of Deaf Smith.Holland is a hero in the same mold as Robicheaux, the amalgamation of the strong, silent John Wayne stereotype, with enough contemporary angst to place him firmly in the present. Holland is haunted, literally and figuratively, by L.Q. Navarro, his partner in the rangers, who he accidentally shot and killed while battling drug smugglers in Mexico. This could understandably put a strain on most friendships, but Navarro doesn't mind being dead. It's pretty restful to sit around and swap lies without having to bother with mundane facts like earning a living. His role in the book is less avenging spirit and more amiable sidekick.Rounding out the setup is a son Holland's never acknowledged, a fine boy named Lucas Smothers whose mother died when he was an infant. He's being raised by a harsh and hostile stepfather who's sharecropping on Holland's land.Unfortunately for Lucas, he was found passed out near the body of his raped and murdered girlfriend, and Holland works to dig out the truth. Arranged against Holland and Lucas are an array of corrupt, evil and just plain psychopathic characters: the son of the town's most powerful family who may or may not be involved in the murder, the corrupt sheriff and his deputies and Garland T. Moon, a wandering psychopath dying of cancer, who came back to Deaf Smith on a mission of his own.Weaved among the contemporary story is the tale of Holland's great-grandfather, a drunken gunfighter who has since taken the pledge, and his true love, known mostly as the Rose of Cimarron. Everyone once in awhile, Holland takes down the family journal and reads about his ancestor's battle to win his true love's heart and remain a peaceable man despite his conflict with the Dalton-Doolin gang, who have taken root in the caves near his farm and are sending property skidding down by robbing trains, shooting innocent women, letting their hogs run free and shooting wild horses for meat.It's to Burke's credit that keeps these plates spinning; one is never confused over who's talking to whom and what's happening next. The problem with \\"Cimarron Rose\\" lies in the ponderous, carved-in-stone writing, and the utter incomprehensibility of most of the characters' actions.Burke has a fine talent for creating memorable images, but he lets his pen wander farther than he intends, leading to some very ludicrous sentences. While Holland recalls his father, a welder who died when the natural-gas pipeline he was in exploded, he reflects, \\"my mother said his vision had become so bad that clarity of sight came to him only when he struck the stringer-bead rod against the pipe's metal and saw again the flame that was a pure to him as the cathedral's bells were to the deaf bellringer Quasimodo.\\"That's mom, all right, always quoting Victor Hugo.This is a manly man's book, full of testosterone... and vinegar, where it seems like everyone is savaging everyone else. If Holland is not getting beaten up, his horse is getting slashed, his house ransacked, the new sheriff's deputy who may or may not be fed is getting ambushed, his son's getting drugged, stripped and dumped at the country club, or any one of a dozen acts of mayhem. Put it to music and you've got a country song.This over-the-top violence will either convince you that you're reading Deep Literature, or make you break out laughing. You can guess which side I landed on. By the time Garland Moon bursts into a house and torments the owner by twisting his nose, I'm thinking Three Stooges. And the epilogue which ties up the book into a pretty bow and everything is hunky-dory has the feel of a family sitcom."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"If you want a good mystery with Texas flavor and a touch of darkness - this is a great read."},{"Title":"Cimarron Rose","review":"This is the eighth James Lee Burke book I have read. It may well be the last. Unhappily, Mr. Burke has adopted the &quot;cookbook&quot; approach to his novels, and I, for one, don't approve. As long as they sell, though, I suspect that he will continue to use that approach. However, one can always hope.&quot;Cimarron Rose&quot; has the predictable human monster, hyper-introspective protagonist, stupid lawmen, and Burke's other standard characters. Unlike his earlier Dave Robichaux novels, though, characters in this book are cardboard-cutout in nature. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one.Mr. Burke, do better; you are eminently capable of that!"},{"Title":"Picking Your Battles: Winning Strategies for Raising Well-Behaved Kids","review":"I bought this book after reading the reviews and hoped and crossed fingers that this book would help me to get back to how I was before I became a mother or at least help me to be a good mother and not a nagging old witch that I have now become.Well I'm glad I did! I have two boys, one nine and the other twelve...and after reading the book I wished I had the book before I even gave birth to either of them. There's lots of valuable information on raising kids and how to discipline them. It also helps us to identify what type of parent we are and how to rate the behavioral breach.. but I especially liked the part about looking at our children and seeing them as a \\"work in progress\\" and \\"person under construction\\"., so whatever we do and say just remember this and it actually helped me better to deal with them.I had some trouble with my younger one, one morning (yup!just before going to school). He was moody, cranky and scolding me and everyone in the room about how we must have misplaced one of his workbooks.,etc, etc.... and I decided to try one of Bonnie Maslin's kidology ..and What she said \\"No matter how angry I get with you or how furious you get with me, we will always love each other. There is always love after anger.\\" In my own words of course, but the intention and the feeling conveyed, and the hug I gave him, actually did calm him down.What surprised me most was that he called me at work from school to say he had found the book and that he was sorry about what happened in the morning! Can you believe it a nine year old boy taking his break time to call me to apologize!!There were many more incidents that happened with my children and Bonnie Maslin's words of wisdom came in really handy.(Mind you I got the book only three weeks ago)Don't wait till you have children to read this book and get ideas on how to raise children, do it when you are expecting/planning them. It is an extremely useful tool for parents dealing with everday issues like misbehaviour and anger and even the more serious ones like lying. More importantly though to set reasonable expectations of our children whom we love so dearly."},{"Title":"Picking Your Battles: Winning Strategies for Raising Well-Behaved Kids","review":"Dr. Maslin's newest book is a winner. Her strategies for handling inevitable conflicts with your kids are very well thought-out. Some of her points are broader in scale while some of her suggestions are very specific, reflecting a very good eye for detail.One of my favorites (and trust me, this one works!) is the &quot;body block&quot; maneuver: When you're on the checkout line at the supermarket, invariably your kids will clamor for some of the brightly-colored candy that the store managers deviously place right near the register. How do you avoid a tantrum here? It's surprisingly easy - just put your body between the candy and your child: Out of sight, out of mind, and you're out of the store without a fight over M&amp;M's.Maslin's writing is also very clear and accessible. I've read all of her other books (which mostly focus on adult relationships, such as The Angry Marriage), and I think this one is her best so far. If you have young kids and want to learn how to reduce all the fighting (who doesn't?), then definitely buy this book."},{"Title":"Picking Your Battles: Winning Strategies for Raising Well-Behaved Kids","review":"Dear Readers,Thank you for your generous words of praise for Picking Your Battles (PYB).

I highly recommend it for everyone with children up to age 11 or 12."},{"Title":"Picking Your Battles: Winning Strategies for Raising Well-Behaved Kids","review":"This book should be much, much shorter. I think there was no editing before printing; a good editor would thin out the spreading, messy tree of Bonnie Maslin's thoughts and make this a book that would be far more readable. The author keeps repeating same things over and over; I read three or four sentences and they were all saying the same with a bit different words. Yes, repetition is the mother of wisdom, but endless repetition is exhausting and creates confusion, not wisdom.Exhausted is the reader, exhausted would be a child raised by Maslin's book. Talking and explaining ad nauseam is the core of author's strategy. You misbehaved? Tell me, what are the reasons behind it. We're gonna talk about our feelings. I have to lovingly explain to you I'm angry, how do I feel and why am I angry. Then we're gonna talk about the consequences and we're gonna plan a solution. I have to (lovingly) ground you for a week, because... yes, let me explain, why am I grounding you! And how do you feel about it? Do you have any ideas we could work into your punishment?The pity is, there are good ideas in the book. If you take out the essential elements and wash away all the gunk, you have the fundamentals of a good raising strategy. The chapters about what do \\"ordinary\\" parents wrong and how can they avoid it are good; the chapter on developmental psychology (here called \\"kidology\\") and how does it affect behavior are useful.So, I'm giving three stars, because this is worth reading (the babbling sequences can be jumped over), but not awesome."},{"Title":"Picking Your Battles: Winning Strategies for Raising Well-Behaved Kids","review":"This book should be required reading for all parents.

Nothing memorable or helpful here.I recommend books on PET (Parent Effectiveness Training) which offer the way(s) to connect on an emotional level with your child. PET is not just about controlling behavior, which is Bonnie Maslin's focus, but gives the child the gift of understanding, the most important first step in building a solid foundation for life-affirming communication and cooperation."},{"Title":"Physical Rehabilitation: Assessment and Treatment","review":"This book covers a wide variety of topics not only through the etiology and pathophysiology of a disease process, but also through treatment options and clinical presentation of a patient."},{"Title":"Physical Rehabilitation: Assessment and Treatment","review":"People who are getting involved with Physical theraphy should have this book in the life."},{"Title":"Dead Run","review":"Having read the three books openly written by Clay Harvey, I find this book also by Harvey, under the pseudonym of Leo Atkins, to be one with good character development, plenty of humor and action, but with too much killing. There are too many innocent victims killed, and Harvey (Atkins) comes a little too close to treating these killings with little regret or as a ploy to get the reader to want the bad guys killed with a vengeance, or possibly a little of both. Clay Harvey's strengths for believable characters (including the bad guys), catchy humor, seeing things in an adult world through the eyes of a child, and action scenes in writing you can actually visualize all come in this book. The book has some surprises in events and character interaction within the plot which makes the book interesting. One of the surprises in the plot has the girlfriend getting more attention than and stealing scenes from the hero.Even though the book is short, the reader is drawn into it because of the sometimes unusual and very human interaction between characters - sometimes between the good guys and the bad guys, and there are even some not so good guys. This is both refreshing and interesting. I have added this to my collection of Clay Harvey books, and am glad he is still writing. I enjoyed this book, and plan to also purchase \\"Play Dead\\" and \\"Dead Beat\\" by Leo Atkins."},{"Title":"Dead Run","review":"At the same time in Richmond, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; and Knoxville, and Tennessee, three pairs of similarly dressed and armed criminals using the identical MOs rob banks. Not long afterward in a family restaurant, two gunmen seemingly set on a heist open fire killing several people. A diner, Benella Mae Sweet manages to kill one of the thugs.However, the dead felon has close friends who vow vengeance on the avenging amazon who killed one of their own. Meanwhile Benella cares for her young niece Mary Leigh since her brother-in- law Damien died in the fracas and her sister has collapsed in shock. When the thugs abduct Mary Leigh, Benella turns to her lover private investigator Connor Gibbs for help. With the Feds involved and the criminals wanting revenge, anything can still happen and does to Connor and Benella as they attempt to rescue Mary Leigh.DEAD RUN is and exciting thriller that never lets up until the final page. The story line works because the action seems genuine and the characters real, especially Benella and Connor. The third Connor Gibbs mystery (see DEADBEAT and PLAY DEAD) proves that Leo Atkins is a talent that those fans who enjoy an exciting private investigator yarn will relish this.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dead Run","review":"I have to say, this book inspired me. It is one of the absolute worst suspense/action thrillers I have ever read in my 50 years on earth, and I read a book a week, so that's plenty of paper! It inspired me to go back to creative writing, because this piece of garbage was actually published, and the worst piece of writing I did on the worst day of my life is 1000 times better. Stupid, stupid characters who do stupid, stupid things (like, a bunch of guys stealing millions of dollars but then throwing it all away with their lives on a dumb hunt for vengeance against someone they never knew, or the supposed detective and his female partner who let a little girl run around by herself to be kidnapped when her father's been killed and several attempts have been made on their lives) and just really ignorant, dumb writing...how about characters in the story struck SEVERAL times by bullets while wearing a vest yet it doesn't even slow them down....has the writer ever been hit once, much less MULTIPLE times, with bullets at close range while wearing a vest? It will knock you butt down and out no matter how good the vest or how tough you are! It goes on and on. This book was so bad I'm not only avoiding anything else by Leo Atkins but definitely won't touch his early Clay Harvey works. One of the few paperbacks I've read over the years to go straight in the trash (not even to the used bookstore, I can't take the chance someone else buys and reads this dung!). Awful."},{"Title":"Dead Run","review":"A comic book of a story. No character development. Unlikey relationships. Stupid villains. Read as fast as you can turn the page. Save your time."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"Every child should read this book. The narrative reads as though your own grandfather was telling you the wonderful stories of history. All children who read The Story of Mankind will began to understand why the world operates the way it does. This book provides the young mind with the frame work for any good historical education."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"And I've read a several. I'm an avid student of history, and this is the best. More critical history of the world is compressed into this tiny book that I ever imagined possible. I continue to re-read it to gain perspective on history.Additionally, it is a great pleasure to read. A tremendous pleasure. It's like reading Arabian Nights. It will instill in kids a love of history, and that is as good as a hundred books on history.Furthermore, it taught me a few critical things about history:1. Histories from one man's viewpoint really are the best kind. It is precisely the fact that Van Loon is with us, telling us the story, that makes it so exciting. A textbook with multiple authors and diligent weeding out of all viewpoint makes for passionless writing, and pleasureless reading. On the contrary, points of view animate us. They may indeed bias us, but they will motivate us to seek other points of view.2. Be kind to people and places different from your own. You might have done the same thing in that situation. Van Loon has a lot of sympathy for the people of history, and he explains to us why they did the things they did."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I have seen some criticism that this book isn't religiously sensitive, glosses points or seems to be from one man's perspective. The thing about history is that, like the present, everyone interprets things differently. If Van Loon was to explore every opinion of every historical event in human history the book (apart from filling a stadium) would lose its blatant charm. For religiously historical stories of a less practical nature, one should really read their particular religion's prescribed texts.I found the book to be flambuoyant and enhanced by humour and opinion - qualities rarely found in history books. I have a copy of the original book and will be buying the revised version to bring it up to date.As Van Loon said - why buy story books when history is far more exciting?"},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I came across this book several years ago. I've not found any other author who could so clearly relate events of different places in such an interesting way. It would be great to have other of his books reprinted."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I borrowed this book (written in 1920's) from the library and really enjoyed reading it. Beginning with probable cavemen's cultural dawn, Van Loon describes Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and European civilizaitons and histories (except one chapter for Indian and Chinese). This book must be especialy good for teens to start with human history. It is written in easy way but doesn't miss the major historical episodes and how the history flows and transits. The book also makes me smile often because it has plenty of jokes. And I like also van Loon's way of expressing and metaphores. It is too bad I could not find his other books from the stores."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I returned the book because it was only the text. There are NO illustrations. Part of the charm of the book are the illustrations."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"If you are looking for a good informative book try Hendrik van Loon's Story of Mankind. From the stubborn Nehanderthals to the horrible World War 2. The exciting beginning of the Roman Empire and the way they treated the Christians.

In a scale to 1 to 10 I would give this book a 11!!"},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"This copy of the story is very poorly published (my version is from Hard Press). One example - there is a TOC (table of contents) with about 67 chapters listed (a recollection, as I have already returned my book). The chapter titles in the TOC do not correspond with the titles at the beginning of the chapters, but to a description of each chapter. All of the chapters listed in the TOC are not in the book, there are only about 44 in the book, only the first part of The Story of Mankind. I sent mine back and will look for a different edition."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"Hendrik Willem Van Loon was one of those marvelous authors who can make history come alive for young people. But when I ordered \\"The Story of Man\\", I had no idea the full-color illustrations and maps he designed to accompany the text were missing. Instead I got an A4-sized bound copy that advertised on the cover \\"High Quality Paperback\\". Hardly. The font is suitable only for manuscripts, not finished books, and the type is so light it's hard to see the text. Curiously, the editors used (sic) to point out mistakes in the original copy, but added many typos of their own, which of course were left untouched. But much worse is the missing maps and illustrations, which are an intimate part of the story. For example, his chapter on how hieroglyphics were invented and developed is incomprehensible without the four accompanying illustrations. It is worth reading his spirited histories (there are many of them) and contemplating his frequent original observations -- if you can get the illustrated version. It's a pity that of all the books the publishers could choose from, they picked this one and then left out what makes it special."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I read this book in my 30s or 40s, many years ago. I am only thinking of it now because I will be giving it as a gift to a high school graduate.

Yes, there are many offensive opinions expressed, so I call the book more \\"artifact\\" than \\"fact.\\" My children (born in the 70s) could not read it, his language was too dense and his humor foreign to them.The book gave me, reading it in 2004, great insight into my father's generation. I felt the great despair of Americans and Europeans after the Great War (WW I) and I forgave the un-PC parts for the sake of this message.I hope that everyone will follow the guidance of the parent who recommended one underline passages and discuss with their children. I hope that all will find/discuss passages they agree with as well as those that offend. This education in history can protect and defend your children in all their adventures in storyland.I also recommend the same treatment for another Van Loon experiment: Van Loon's Lives. In that book, his treatment of Nansen the Norweigian gives his ideas on true leadership. See how his Napoleon and Robspierre foreshadow Hitler."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"Van Loon's book has been a staple of family reading hour for decades, and more recently it has received renewed circulation among homeschooling families. Originally written in 1921, this story of civilization has been continuously updated, not always profitably. What's below is an excerpt from the current edition:\\"The civil rights movement escaped another defeat when the Reagan administration's attempt to grant tax exemptions to schools that discriminate against blacks failed. The economic future of young blacks remained bleak, as they continued to suffer the highest unemployment rate in the United States, while the government reduced many of the welfare programs that had helped the poor subsist.\\"Readers seeking a less partisan history are advised to find an older edition or to obtain E.H. Gombrich's excellentA Little History of the World, recently released by Yale University Press in an English edition."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"The author is a secular humanist and I find that all religions in the book are ultimately regarded as fanaticism. While he dealt with the ancients we were OK, although some chapters were entirely his opinion with no historical content whatsoever. I could barely accomplish the reading aloud of the Reformation chapter, but the next chapter made me give up this book as a History read aloud for homeschooled children entirely: Saint Ignatius is all wrong! If you are Catholic, or even Protestant--because Van Loon does justice to neither--Chapters 16 and 17 of Light of the Nations (Catholic Textbook Project) will give you a much better idea of the errors of the Church then, and of the Counter-reformation. For an older, wiser History student it would be OK, as Van Loon does have some delightful style bits and innovative History-telling perspectives. The book, is important to note, changes drastically in format midpoint, as if if the author pieced together things he had done in the past. The chapters become much longer and the reading/student level quite older. I would recommend both GombrichA Little History of the Worldand Hillyer's A Child's History of the World for children as better choices for a story-like classical History text at this point in the book!"},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I am only up to page 90 of the 1939 edition, but I'm troubled by two purported letters about Jesus by a Roman physician Aesculapius Cultellus and his nephew Gladius Ensa. The letters, about this new messiah and his effect on the Roman rulers and Jewish population, are fascinating. But I could find no other reputable source on the internet mentioning them; all search results relate to this book. Which has tempered my appreciation for Loon's well-written tome."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I thought The History of Mankind was fasinating. I think this is a good book for anyone learning about World History. It is a advanced, but well paced, so an Elementary student, reading carefully could read it as well as a Junior High or High School student."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I first read this book when I was in the second grade, and everytime I read it, it gets better and better. The stories are well written and easy to read, and it covers all the topics essential for a young child to know. Even though it is over 400 pages long, the book goes by as quick as a Dr. Seuss book. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"This book is very educational. I was never in to history but this book makes it more interesting.

It is still as fresh as when I first read it in 1952 with the exeption of the much later, politically correct, sections."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"My 1926 edition of this book is among my most prized volumes. The book is a much-compressed look at events, some facts obviously \\"of their time\\", from the beginning of time up to the \\"present\\". But is it also an opinionated, old-fashioned, wistful, and occasionally angry snapshot of the state of civilization, and more importantly **how educated people in Europe and America thought**, right after World War I, before Fascism and Communism were to wreck the world once again.Van Loon was born in the \\"old Europe\\", immigrated to and was educated in America. In 1921 he found himself on the threshold between a destroyed civilization and the rebirth of a new one. Now, as Earth begins to endure yet another cycle of destruction and renewal, those with open and especially young minds should read this book, put themselves in the shoes of Van Loon in 1921, duly note its anachonisms, and put aside policial correctness to think constructively about the never-ending cycles of history."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"Written in 1922 , this book is a history of the world from pre-historic man to the First World War , written in a rather satirical , philosophical and whimsical style that makes it a great piece of literature.He deals quite comprehensively for 400 pages with this broad work on civilization.It also flows nicely.It is fascinating to read of the murder by the Bolsheviks of the Romanov family , as described by the author as a recent event.It is indeed written from the perspective of 1922:\\"The world has just passed through an agony of pain compared to which the French Revolution was a mere incident. The shock has been so great that it has killed the last spark of hope in the breasts of millions of men. They were chanting a hymn of progress, and four years of slaughter followed their prayers for peace. \`\`Is it worth while,'' so they ask, \`\`to work and slave for the benefit of creatures who have not yet passed beyond the stage of the earliest cave men?'' \\"That being said , the work is not free of the authors own prejudices.A incorrect bit is his refferal to the ancient Land of Israel as Palestine , when speaking about he entry of the Hebrews into that land in 1700 BC.The term \\"Palestine\\" came from the name that the conquering Roman Empire gave the ancient Land of Israel in an attempt to obliterate and de-legitimize the Jewish presence in the Holy Land. The name \\"Palestine\\" was invented in the year 135 C.E. Before it was known as Judea, which was the southern kingdom of ancient Israel. The Roman Procurator in charge of the Judean-Israel territories was so angry at the Jews for revolting that he called for his historians and asked them who were the worst enemies of the Jews in their past history. The scribes said, \\"the Philistines.\\" Thus, the Procurator declared that Land of Israel would from then forward be called \\"Philistia\\" [further bastardized into \\"Palaistina\\"] to dishonor the Jews and obliterate their history. Hence the name \\"Palestine.\\""},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"While I appreciate the daunting task of putting all that history into one volume, you'll find this book to be like the old adage more &quot;His story&quot; than history. The writer's personal value system shines through the book as he interprets his view of history. One interesting rant about his major premonition about the Roman Empire and how it was defeated by a child in Bethlehem. Other than a giving us a few vague moral lessons, Van Loon gave us no insight of what Jesus Christ did that was so revolutionary to topple the largest superpower ever. Could you give us a bit of depth? I don't get it."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"Calling this a history of \\"mankind\\" was meant, tongue-in-cheek, as a joke, right? Any student of history perusing the Table of Content of this title would know how misappropriately titled and conceived this book was.That said, there are two principal criticisms one can level at it: first, who pens works on \\"mankind\\" anymore? -- that is, who still thinks that a book that leaves half of the human race out of its title and its content is in any sense comprehensive? The second, and even more serious, is, why write a history of Europe and call it a history of \\"mankind\\"? Why not just call it what it is? A History Europeans and leave it for others to write big history."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"If you are a Jew, Islamist Christian or just somebody that appreciates accurate history and science, than this book will be offensive to you. I encourage you to read it for yourself to see what I mean, but you will not want your children to read it.Depending on the maturity of your children, this book could be used as a tool to teach your children correctly. Here's how: get a pencil and draw a line through every sentence you disagree with. Tell you child why you have done this and let them read it. After each chapter go through the marked parts and tell them what you believe to be the truth."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I really like the selections that get the Newbery awards so it was a real dissapointment when I tried to read this book.

Then decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"All of us have that book which we remember fondly from childhood, that one book we saw in the school library which we wish were ours so we could keep it in our own private place and read over and over again. Van Loon's Story of Mankind is that book for me. Van Loon does a tremendous service to the study of history. Even though this is a childrens book Van Loon does not ignore or alter the facts of history so that he can comfort instead of educate the child who may be reading the book. And even though the book reads like one big bedtime story, Van Loon always tries to remain objective and never force his opinion on the reader. When he talks about Napolean he makes it very obvious that he does not like the man or what he stood for, but he also tells the reader that his grandfather fought alongside the man and that he(Van Loon) would have probably fought alongside him as well, that's just the kind of man Napolean was. At an age where you will believe almost anything told to you, especially by a man who has written a book, Van Loon tries to give the child both an appreciation for history and a sense of objectivity about events. This was one of the first books, if not the first book, that showed me that everything is not always black and white, good and evil, but shades and gradations of good and evil. I read this to all my nephews, and when they don't know what to read I hand them this book, hoping it will make them a wiser person for listening to Van Loon's lessons."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"THE STORY OF MANKIND is a delight. Contrast its wit and insight with the typical history textbooks to which our young are routinely subjected--as ably described by education historian Diane Ravitch:\\"The dullness of history textbooks is legendary. I am involved right now in a study of history textbooks, and I must say that I have trouble reading them because of their jumbled, jangly quality. I also have trouble lifting them because they are so heavy and overstuffed with trivia and pedagogical aids. With one or maybe two exceptions, most textbooks put more emphasis on visual glitz than on the quality of their text. By the time that these books emerge from the political process that is called state adoption, they lack voice and narrative power. They lack the very qualities that make historical writing exciting. Our history textbooks are distracting, and I don't know how students learn anything from them.\\"Van Loon's book won the first Newberry Prize, quite an achievement for a book on world history. \\"The Story of Mankind\\" remains a great read for any child thirteen and up (and up)."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"This is a classic history book written for children (probably ages eleven to fourteen) which can be fascinating even for adults. The book still rings true in 1999. In 1922, it won the very first Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature (the Melcher family had just established the John Newbery Medal). It concentrates mostly on European history since van Loon, in the early 1920s, is attempting to explain those factors that were present in the world at that time. His son William has written several new chapters which expand this view (his father had passed away in 1944). And, I have seen editions that are furthur updated. But, the elder van Loon simply had a style of writing history that seems attractive to children. I saw a previous edition of this book by van Loon when I was a kid and always wanted to read it.

Now I'm reading it to my 14-year-old son, and we're both fascinated. What we like is that it gives a broad sweep of history, explaining why things happened and why they're important. The author doesn't place a lot of emphasis on dates and battles and such, just the grand sweep. If your young adults are tired of all those reading lists that recommend only fiction, here's just the non-fiction book for them."},{"Title":"The story of mankind","review":"I first read this book in High School. It sparked an interest in history in me that has burned bright ever since. It, by itself, almost caused me to become a history major in college. Van Loon's style and presentation was the key. Instead of a dry recitation of dates and people, Van Loon puts you on the scene, you can smell the campfires, the thoughts the common folk might have had as they participated in the events, great and not so great, of our roots. As a sublime introduction to history for the young adult, a perfect follow-up for the adult reader is the &quot;Outline of History&quot; by H.G. Wells.

Modern editors have tried to bring the book up to date by including major world events since van Loon originallywrote the book, but their writing doesn't have the insight that made van Loon's writings what they are.Van Loon traces the history of mankind from the beginning, starting with a brief geologic description of planet earth.His writing makes it seem as if you are reading a docu-drama, and you'll keep wishing that he could spend moretime on each topic.I especially enjoyed the sections on the middle ages and renaissance, and this book serves as a goodintroduction to history for children with writing that brings history to life.At times, given when this book was originally written, you may be struck by van Loon's eurocentric flavor, butoverall, he does a remarkable job in providing a well balanced presentation of all major world events. He does a great job oflooking at major world religions.This is not an exhaustive epic of the history of humanity, ratherit is an excellent introduction to history.

Sure there are more scholarly volumes written on the rise of humanity but the author takes our collective tale and puts it in a form in which children can understand and adults can draw joy from. By all means this is a kids book but when you consider how many of us have been pushed away and unknowingly punished by history professors who thought it more important to tell us dates and not the story of the people making the dates significant, this book can be a valuable asset to adults. In a world which is being dumbed down this story, written on a childs level, may even be more apperciated. However to say this text is &quot;DUMB&quot; or lacking intelligence and well crafted words would be an injustice.. It's an incredible book. I have the hard back volume and it will stay in my family for the rest of time. I look forward to the day when my youngest son returns it to me after reading it and says, &quot;Thanks dad&quot;.

So far I haven't encountered such a well-written book that is dedicated to teaching children about history. The schoolbooks may have fancy pictures, text, and so on, but they always drone on and on using whole pages for one simple thought or idea. The Story of Mankind is different, in a simple but extraordinary way. The book reaches out to all parts of history yet does not run around important details to get to a slightly larger event. In my eyes, The Story of Mankind is more interesting and teaches more than the typical schoolbook. I can't understand why schools don't include this book in their history program. If this book were a part of the curriculum I would be very content knowing that a great Newberry book is being read in every school and possibly by every person in the world.

For example, the discussion of the impact of Freud on philosophy is interesting, as is the attempt to address Communism in philosophical terms.Throughout the book, Kaplan demonstrates a gift of making difficult-to-understand concepts easy to grasp. His survey of each area is quite deep and yet extremely accessible. He attempts to describe almost every school of thought in its own terms and provide a voice for it (the exception is Communism, where he seems more interested in looking philosophically at propaganda methods).This is an extraordinarily clear work. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"A very good WWII novel that in many ways is the literary bookend to the film 'Das Boot'. Both take place in small warships which is conducive to revealing personalities and dynamic group psychology. The reader sees the action primarily from the standpoint of Keith Lockhart, a former journalist who begins as a freshly minted volunteer reserve officer. His character resembles the author, Nicholas Monsarrat, who was RNVR himself, served in and eventually rose to command both a corvette and frigate during the war. Nearly uncontrollable bureaucratic forces at play as the war drags on leads to a greater impersonality as humanity seemingly loses out to weapons and toughness as they move from the 90 person crew of the corvette to the 170 of the larger, more capable frigate.In comparing \\"The Cruel Sea\\" to his other war book, \\"Three Corvettes\\": the former, a bestseller, is a better structured story, while the latter, a rivetting first hand account actually written during wartime is better journalism."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is excellent literature, a wrenching novel, a superb sea story, and entirely faithful to the history of World War II in the North Atlantic. Monsarrat's personal experience combined with his eye for detail make him an extraordinary writer. His prose will transport you to the very moment that he describes. This is an authentic classic and a must-read for everyone who would go to sea, as well as for every student of WWII. I've re-read my well-worn copy several times over thirty years."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I enjoyed this movie, but it was of course lacking when compared to the book. The cinematography is typical of its time but I was hoping for more actual footage being used....but all in all an enjoyable movie."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I first learned of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" from the U.S. Navy's recently revamped reading list. After reading the book, I can see why it was included on the list. It provides a first-rate, historically-accurate account of the Battle of the Atlantic, in which Great Britain endured a systematic commerce destruction campaign by the German U-Boat fleet.Nicholas Monsarrat allowed the reader to join the crews of the ill-fated corvette \\"Compass Rose\\" and the luckier frigate \\"Saltash,\\" by individually describing the lives of various members of the crew. Primary attention is paid to the Captain, Cmdr Ericson, and the Exec, Lt Cmdr Lockhart. On the pitching decks of \\"Compass Rose\\" during a winter transit of the North Atlantic, Monsarrat investigates what is necessary to forge a crew from conscript civilians, and to meld them into a fighting unit. From experience, I can say that he captured the way that the \\"personality\\" of a ship develops, based upon the varying personalities in the crew.Monsarrat is a good writer, and he definitely draws the reader into his story. I almost felt physically cold when he described the trials that a sailor undergoes in a winter storm. It definitely brought back some memories of my own North Atlantic experiences.I did not like everything about this book, however. Monsarrat went to a lot of trouble to develop the personalities aboard \\"Compass Rose,\\" but paid curiously little attention to the crew of \\"Saltash.\\" Perhaps he was running out of time or interest in writing, or maybe he wanted to indicate that a larger ship is more impersonal. In any case, I felt that the reader missed out due to his decision. Also, the love interest of Lockhart appeared to be out of place in the book. It was unnecessary, and took up space that could have been devoted to the story line.Do not let the above detractions prevent you from reading this book. This book is a must-read for World War II history buffs, as well as for leaders wanting to learn from challenges that Monsarrat placed before Cmdr Ericson. You will not regret the time you spend reading it."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Although written for the Royal Navy corvette duty of World War II it brings the adventure of the sea to life for anyone. As a U.S. Navy veteran, I found this book to be outstanding in its reality of the sea, the ships, the men, and the tensions of war. The Cruel Sea is difficult, if not impossible, to put down. I'm ready for other books by Nicholas Monsarrat, he is a powerful and enlightened writer."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"A brutal, dark, bitter-sweet insight in the life of a ship and it's crew during WW2.An amazing read, that will captivate you from the first page through to the last."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Product description matched the book's condition. After reading the jack and forward I realized the orginal book came with a map of the area of the ocean where the ships and crews fought there war.The map was missing,but I was unaware that there was a map included with the orginal when new.The vendor that the the edition came from took care to insure the sent item would arrive in good order and it did,and earlier then expected."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"As in all movies, the film tends to shy away from the direct action required to make this a memorable war film. The lacklustre portrail of Lt. Bennett RANR was very loosely portrayed even tho he had a marked impact upon the initial part of the action. Lt. Bennett's part in the set up was pathetically humorous. It was from this in-glorious start that the book captivated the reader, but was lost in the film. This initial portrayal set up a graphical accounts of the war at sea in corvettes. Not much bigger than a large fishing trawler these ships travelled across the Atlantic and on the Russian convoys, being commanded and worked by ordinary people from ordinary families and ordinary jobs. Young men turned into sailors virtually overnight, this film captures some, but not all, of the viciousness of people battling, not only the enemy, The Germans, but also the elements, continual rough seas, freezing nights and days, standing watche after watch, comotosed, little ot no sleep for days on end, fighting of attack after attack by Doenitz's submarines and by bombers of the Luftwaffe, sleeping at Actions Stations, dying not of bombs, torpedos, machine guns, but of exhaustion, fear, and freezing to death in the cold, cold waters of the Bearing Sea. These were the real things this film failed to bring home to its audience. Failed in a vain bid to sell the sailors as someone fighting to save his country at a massive, massive price. The war at sea could not have been won without corvettes, like Compass Rose and the men who sailed in them. It was the corvettes and the sailors of the Royal Navy who kept the sealanes open for supplies of fuel, arms and food, to keep the British Isles alive."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This classic story was totally ruined by a computer generated voice. We listened to this travelling interstate, and nearly ran off the road several times through sheer boredom...a monotonous disaster. Our last ebook 'Woman in Black' was good...so we were not expecting this type of presentation. Before purchase,can you indicate if the book is read by a real person or computer so we don't make that mistake again...otherwise you'll lose us!"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I really wanted to like \\"The Cruel Sea\\", a documentary-style flick about life on an RN warship on convoy duty in WWII. It's a worthy idea for a story, with great characters and dead-on acting. Jack (\\"Land of the Pharaohs\\") Hawkins is Captain Ericson, the proper yet amiable skipper of the \\"Compass Rose\\". When we first see him, he's correcting two new officers on the protocol for saluting superior officers - no apologies, he tells them kindly, if you're going to salute, just do it right. And this guy is a warship commander! He's an interesting character - in voice-overs, Ericson tells how the war pulled him from merchantmen and deposited him at the helm of a corvette tasked with hunting U-boats, with little doubt that he's unsuited for the new job. The story then goes on to tell of the newer officers - the ship's martinet of a first mate, the sonar officer and other crew, all of whom are only weeks past having been yanked from their civilian lives (the XO sold used-cars).These are interesting characters, but the story of \\"Cruel\\" doesn't sufficiently incorporate the stories of its officers, or choose one of them to focus on. \\"Cruel\\" begins before the fall of France: U-boats haven't yet gained the range benefit of French ports, so they're a rarity, leaving bad weather as the chief foe. When that changes, and the Atlantic becomes a U-boat shark-tank, the weather becomes the RN's ironic ally, and the seas become truly cruel. Because the story extends through the war, it has a lot of ground (sea?) to cover, and the effect seems pretty rushed, becoming little more than a series of unconnected stories linked by common character - the ship goes out, convoys get smacked by \\"wolfpacks\\", the convoys return, the crews realize the futility of seeking rest after sea duty, and the ship goes out again. There's one great moment in the story, as Ericson realizes that dozens of survivors from a sunk merchantman are floating over a U-boat contact, and he must decide on whether he's going to drop depth charges on them in a likely futile attempt to kill the submerged hunter. It's a great scene, but one the story passes it over in search of the next story. Unfortunately, the story relies for cohesion on wearing its heart on its sleeve - we're instantly sympathetic of the lower officers, contemptuous of the bullying XO, admiring of Ericson and so on - that undermine its otherwise effective appearance of docudrama. There are some moments that stretch belief (such as Denholm Elliot's glamorous wife dolling herself up for a night on the town, belying the deprivations of British war-time life) or just don't look right (German sailors abandon an apparently undamaged U-boat - couldn't they at least have smoke or fire belching from it, or have it sink on an unevenl keel?), but for the most part, \\"The Cruel Sea\\" tackles an extremely worthwhile subject but offers something less than the sum of its parts."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I read this classic many years ago & enjoying even more today. Maybe because I servrd in the RAN during WW2"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I got this for a friend who spent years in the military. He's been looking for it for years. I bought as a surprise and it didn't disappoint. The life at sea and the battles are so true to life. Sort of like a modern day Das Boot. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I enjoyed it. I could talk about the characters.

Liked it on first read, and loved it a second time.Was a merchant seaman diring latter part of WW II, and can relate to much of the atmosphere.Monserrat thinly disguised as the &#34;First.&#34;"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I don't know if Monsarrat was a naval officer in WW2 but it would seem so from the impression of reality when one reads this book. A must read for all naval buffs.Barry Pollock,Beijing"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Monsarrat's classic, The Cruel Sea, is primarily the story of a small British corvette and her crew engaged in combat with Nazi U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic. As a former naval officer, I can attest to the authenticity of the descriptions of the sea, the consequences for the crew of heavy weather and the anxiety of going into battle. But what makes this particularly compelling is the way Monsarrat develops his characters, both underway and ashore. Even bit players in this drama are fully revealed as real people with genuine strengths and weaknesses, all sharing the experience of life on a small ship while leaving their wives, families and girlfriends at home. Not everyone is a hero in this story, either. It's easily among the most important works of naval fiction written about World War II. Whether you've worn the uniform or not, you'll always remember The Cruel Sea."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Enjoyed the movie. Great story. Great acting, portrayed the feelings of the characters well. Was surprised to find the sub-titles in Korean."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Describes the horrors of WWII Naval Warfare in prose at the level of an ode. Loses points by the questionable choice of including an unnecessary, totally cliche romance."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"A very real story. Brings the reality of war at sea to life. A classic read for people that enjoy stories about the sea"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"British war movies are normally action movies with little romance. This British war novel has plenty of action but does not lack in the human end either. This book draws the reader in quickly and does not let go until the end. If there is any one word that can describe the characters and the plot it is endurance -- enduring boredom, hardship, weather, waves, food, and naval warfare. It is a good read for a warm summer evening. Even then, you will feel chills run up your back as the cold waters of the north atlantic pound the ship and its crew. A very good read."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This has been one of my favorite British Movies for years. It was adapted faithfully from a book by a Naval Lt. Commander who commanded a Corvette and a Sloop, both of which were convoy escorts in the Battle of the Atlantic. I enjoyed the actors, Jack Hawkins in particular. The Rank Organization that produced this superlative narrative of the heroic of ordinary Brits did a marvelous job of authentically reproducing Naval combat situations between the escort vessels for a convoy with the German Submarines that were constantly stalking them."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I read a lot of military fiction, ranging from \\"it's all glory\\" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but wish they had, by \\"it's all hell\\" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but are trying to send a message. Somewhere in the middle, with a bit of both aspects and a lot of experience, are the relatively few novels written by guys who've been there, writing from experience about situations that closely paralleled what they went through - a bit of hell, a bit of glory, and a lot of detail.The Cruel Sea sits near the top of the latter category. Nicholas Monsarrat was a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and spent his war on small ships, fighting German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. The main character of The Cruel Sea, Keith Lockhart, is a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and...It's a first-rate book. Even without Monsarrat's biography, it's obvious that he knows what he's talking about; it shows in the details. Most military fiction has a certain amount of scenes away from the front, dealing with the main characters' personal lives; The Cruel Sea has the same, and does it excellently... by no means glamorously (there's one particular thread, about a lieutenant's unfaithful wife, that is the antithesis of glamor), but very realistically; the scenes don't seem at all tacked on \\"to give the fighting men a human side\\", but feel like - and are - an integral part of the book. The characters are the same people in a London bar or in the middle of the Atlantic; you get the feeling that most of the people, and most of the incidents, are based on real people and situations that Monsarrat either knew or knew of, during his time in the war.A certain, very small, percentage of military fiction transcends the \\"military\\" label - fiction about people, in a military situation. The combat isn't the focus of the story; it's simply a part of it. Life at sea and character development take precedence over fast-moving plots; there are, realistically, no individual bad guys (how many soldiers or sailors know the names of the men on the other side?), but the work is executed well enough that a plot would feel irrelevant.I've read hundreds of books of military fiction. A bare handful are as good as this one. Thoroughly and absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Andrew Mendelson's review mentions a &quot;misplaced death&quot;. He misses the point it was as un-necessary and as useless as many in the war - and that is one of the points of this classic war novel. Monserrat writes well about the sea because he was at sea and this story is one of his strongest because he tells it from the point of view of someone who witnessed it for real.The Cruel Sea is an extensive fictionalising, reworking and fleshing out of his wartime short stories &quot;HM Corvette, East Coast Corvette, Corvette Command&quot;, published during the war when it was quite clear he did not expect to survive the Battle of the Atlantic on which the bulk of the Cruel Sea is based. The Cruel Sea is taughtly drawn, superbly observed and records the transition from amateur civilians into trained professional killers with all the physical, and emotional casualites that were incurred along the way.The 1953 movie (also available on Amazon) is also a good adaption of the tale."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I saw the movie &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; on the big screen in the 1950s.It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The VHS version omits scenes that have to do with deveopment of the character and personalities of the ships personnel.With out these scene much of the depair and lonelyness of the personl is lost.Let us hope that the film is reissured on DVD and the deleted are added."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"If a one-word review were acceptable, it would just be: &quot;Great!&quot;. You're living through the career of a moderately able submarine hunter in WWII. Like in real life, he was out there in a nutshell called a &quot;Flower class&quot; corvette, facing the stormy North Atlantic and loads of prowling German subs. Have you ever wondered how those heroes' lives really were like? You will live with the corvette's green crew through their hard training, through endless boring hours of seasickness, through personal problems like bad superiors or unfaithful wives, through mobbing and loneliness,... You will see ships around them explode and sink, till finally - oh, I shouldn't spoil the story, should I?A fascinating book, I couldn't stop reading day and night. Try to be part of WWII, let your imagination play, don't watch movies...If you're interested in more of it, try the other side of the coin, as described by Lothar Guenther Buchheim."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Battle of the Atlantic is often referred to as a crucial campaign in the history of World War II; in keeping the sea lanes open throughout the war, the Allies kept the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in the fight and began the build up for operations in the Mediterranean and in Europe. Popular and historical focus in the Battle of the Atlantic often falls on the German U-Boats as their captains' daring and their crews' boldness make for more dashing stories. In contrast, technologies such as radar, sonar and the cracking of ULTRA are often credited with winning the battle for the Allies, and little attention is paid, generally, to the ships and men who fought the Germans and prevailed in the Atlantic.The Cruel Sea is their story. It is the story of a British destroyer tasked to escort Allied convoys across the Atlantic. It relates the entire course of the war, and illustrates the challenges that the British Navy and the Allies faced at various points in the Atlantic: manning ships with draftees in volunteers in a time of war, the the fear and uncertainty of pre-radar/sonar escort operations in the early years of World War II, and the slow and gradual triumph over the U-Boats after 1943. The Cruel Sea also is a gripping story of human nature, providing insights into loyalty, leadership and courage through the actions of its characters.The Cruel Sea is not a book about war; it is a book about people, men mostly, in a time of war and how they react to adversity. As literature, it is beautifully written, a masterpiece. The author crafts his words so that the reader is gripped by prose as well as by the action and flow of the story. It was a joy to read. The Cruel Sea is a valuable bit of history as well, shedding light on a service and a battle that few know about beyond devoted students of World War II."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I've read this one several times over several years (first as a college history class assignment), and it still amazes me how Monsarrat is able to capture the spirit and tribulations of men at sea during war time. If you're at all interested in WW II or naval operations, you must read this book, as Monsarrat penetratingly explores the psyches, motivations and character of the book's principal characters. As the war in the North Atlantic goes on, the reader grows with the characters - who are for the most part Royal Naval Reservists or newbie volunteers, rather than professional Royal Navy &quot;lifers&quot;. Together, the men and the ship go through their shared baptism of fire against the U-Boat scourge during the dark days of 1940-1942 convoy duty. This book, like Alistair MacLean's HMS Ulysses, is a true naval history classic. Don't skip it."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"What a flick? Great acting! Stunning story line. As good as the book, which in my opinion is in a class of its own. Quite possibly one of the finest war films i have seen! I hope it comes out on DVD"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a naval story set during World War II. That should put off no one. Monserrat is a trul fine writer, who grips any reader so well with his detailed story about intelligent, able, men going about a horrific duty, taking every precaution available, grittily making plans to cope in the midst of danger, but knowing that their risks are great, and catastrophe frequent. It is truly a wonderful book - a wonderful mix of characters (and the author is as interested in character as plot). I would truly and strongly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Monsarrat's prose gives a description of events, feelings, and thoughts in great detail. One of my favorite parts was when he describes Barnard's thoughts on Russian convoys... more than just a novel, The Cruel Sea gives a historical context within which the story falls - it's obvious that he was very thorough with his research. There are historical references that documentaries can't capture or depict as vividly as the book does - the novel is that good."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is one of the most harrowing films I have ever seen. Based on real situations, and written by a man who lived through them (as Lockhart), the film, and of course more so the book, depict the Battle of the Atlantic from a relatively unspectacular viewpoint.Having read the book before seeing the film undoubtedly helps, but the level of acting and direction really portrays the situations, and latent fear inherent amongst the battle's participants. My wife has only seen the film, and she effected by it.If the object of art is to elicit an emotion, then this is art at its very best.Anyone looking for mindless Hollywood violence need not bother with this film, but if someone is looking for a true depiction of war, then this is definitely it.Unsexy, unglamorous; Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I read this book in spanish. The traduction was poor but still, I was able to flavor and sink myself into the reading from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book for those who have a devotion or at least an affection for the sea.In my case, I am the son of a boat owner, was basically born on it but was cursed with unavoidable seasickness. Reading the chapter when the Compass Rose goes on its first convoy with extremely rough seas I felt identified. I could perfectly picture myself in the middle of the Sea of Ireland riding 20 feet waves in 30 knot winds on a tiny ship with leaks everywhere. Knowing what it's like, I suffered every single line of the narration.I praise sailors of convoys during WW II, I can only imagine all the hardships and horrors they went through.

A magnificent and accurate story of men and their ships in the Battle of the North Atlantic from 1939 to 1945 told with understanding and experienced accuacy and intelligence. Beaautifully written. Having served in a ship similiar to the frigate Saltash for two years in anti-submarine warfare and convoy duty in much calmer and less dangerous waters I can, however, attest to the accuracy of what Montserrat has recounted about fitting out,,shakedown and cruising."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"the best drama-at-sea novel of WWII, really, and stylishly written, by a professional writer who served as a naval officer.

I mention this because having a father that served on USN convoy duty before the war started (USS Jacob Jones), and having lived in the UK amongst many who also served in the war, I realize now that the book and the film provide an accurate and vividly emotional portrayal of what it was like.

Good try but it didn't work. The Cruel Sea is one of the greatest novels to come out of World War II and a must read for anyone who ever lived on a ship.

Like life itself, in heroic situations, all who serve do not live as heroes. Nicholas Monsarrat brings this classic tale of adventure to life as only one who really knew the Cruel Sea could do. This book is best read on Kindle as references to obscure nautical terms such as asdic, (Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee) are used and the Kindle dictionary and Wikipedia are invaluable resources to better enjoy this fine book. A mistaken notion of war at sea is thinking the story is about ships in conflict. This story rings with reality because it portrays war at sea as one of men in conflict. Under pressure of such conflict judgement is questioned and enemy and ally alike are strained to find correct answers.In the final court of judgement, it is the sea that holds supreme, the sea, the Cruel Sea."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is a grab you by the throat hard and gritty story of two small RN ships and their crews in WW II.

Like the Latter, TCS focuses on the crew of two ships and views the war through the eyes of it's officers. But unlike the \\"In Which We Serve\\" the war and it's costs on the hearts and minds of men is detailed in grim, stark strokes. Gone are the class affectations of \\"In Which We Serve\\", there is no \\"stiff upper lip\\" hogwash here. Just men placed under extraordinay pressue trying to fight an enemy they cannot see or strike but who can see and strike them. You can chart the wars cost in humanity by watching the Captains face change over the years. You bear witness as he morphs from a cheerful compassionate man to an almost bitter \\"Ahab\\" like character strapped into his Captains chair and totally obsessed with killing the enemy that sank his first command and killed so many of his crew.When the movie is over there's no great desire to stand up and cheer or shout \\"God Save The King\\", you just shrug and sigh as did the Captain and his Number One, grateful that the terrible ordeal is at last over.Da Worfster"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a gritty, realistic (real warships), technically correct story about the entire war in the Atlantic.

Leave it to the English to get it right, this is definately not a Hollywood movie. You'll notice several actors who went on to star in other big films at a later date. Jack Hawkins, for example, was a leading figure in Laurance of Arabia. This film shows what it was really like serving aboard one fo the English Corvettes (destroyer) escorting convoys and dealing with the German U-boats."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I first saw this film soon after it was released in the U.S. In a nutshell, I believe it ranks right up there with \\"Das Boot\\" insofar as both films deal with WW ll's Battle of the Atlantic. \\"Cruel Sea\\" tells the story of the men and women who fought the war from the surface against the U-Boats in the Royal Navy and the Allied Merchant Marine. Great performances by Jack Hawkins and others who would appear in later films such as \\"Zulu\\".The film is an accurate portayal of this sea war. As a matter of fact, I saw this film screened at the Seaman's Church Institute in New York with an audience of merchant sailors - some of whom had survived the Atlantic in open lifeboats after a successful U-Boat attack. This film moved some of them to tears.Incidentally, the first warship introduced in the film is a corvette. The only surviving corvette is the \\"Sackville\\", a Canadian museum ship berthed in Halifax, NS"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is an absolutely thrilling, gripping, involving story of war at sea. I have no disagreement with those who say this is one of the best novels to come out of WWII. I've had a copy with me through the years, ever since I first read it in high school. Monsarrat has a beautiful feel of the language, made more so by his own familiarity with the subject at hand. Every time I pick up the book and reread passages, I am still enthralled by the fine writing. There is even a lovely, poignant love story in the middle of it. Here is a passage describing nothing in particular, merely the ship &quot;Compass Rose&quot; when the convoy was a quiet one and the men aboard her could relax a bit:&quot;They found that some nights, especially, had a peaceful loveliness that repaid a hundred hours of strain. Sometimes in sheltered water, when the moon was full, they moved with the convoy past hills outlined against the pricking stars: slipping under the very shadow of these cliffs, their keel divided the phosphorescent water into a gleaming wake that curled away till it was caught and held in the track of the moon....Compass Rose, afloat on a calm sea, seemed to shed every attribute save a gentle assurance of refuge.&quot; (p 105, 1951 Knopf edition)There was a movie made by the British earlier on, with Jack Hawkins as Ericson, the captain. The plot obviously had to be shortened, and I think the love story was changed a bit. The novel is better, still, and I do hope that they do NOT try to make another movie of it, for surely the Hollywood treatment will only cheapen this superb piece of work."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Finding an original hard cover version of this novel was quite a chore but well worth the wait. Monsarrat follows the exploits of the crew of a British corvette and later a destroyer as it escorts trans oceanic convoys during the battle of the Atlantic. The officers and crew are continually pitted against an always lurking pack of determined German U boats. The tension created as a result of the staggering losses of ships and human life and the battle of nerve and wits between the opposing commanders is gripping. Monsarrat does some wonderful character development of the crew members, showing how the strain of war creates serious personality changes. Its seems as if Monsarrat has served in the Navy as the authenticity of his story seems beyond question."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This book literally changed my life.In the eleventh grade in Greenville, South Carolina, i had an English teacher who designated Thursday as &quot;Free Reading Day&quot; and encouraged the entire class to read anything they wanted to (well, within limits -- &quot;Playboy&quot; would have been Right Out, i'm sure.) -- and, in case you had nothing of your own, she laid out an assortment of magazines and books on a table at the front of the room.On that table, one Thursday, was a copy of &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. Since i've always been at least a bit interested in sea stories, and it looked interesting, i picked it up. From the first i was hooked solidly.In the next three or so years, i reread it twice at least, possibly more than that.And then i joined the Navy -- and i am sure that it was because of what i read in this book, and what i sensed behind it, in what Monsarrat -- who, like his viewpoint character, Lockhart, was there from the beginning, working his way up to command his own ship before the end of the war -- didn't so much say as assume about the sea and the Navy -- *any* Navy.Monsarrat presents us here with a brotherhood of the sea, corny as that idea may sound. Sailors, more than the other Armed Forces, tend to regard other sailors -- even enemy sailors -- as brothers in arms, and, as Monsarrat says, the only true enemy is the cruel sea itself.As he shows us here, the sailor who was your enemy five minutes ago, who was trying to kill you as you tried to kill him, is merely another survivor to be rescued from the cruel sea once you've sunk his ship.And, even more so, as Monsarrat portrays it, there is a kind of brotherhood that binds sailors in the same Navy together in very mcuh a family manner -- you may not like your cousin, but you want to know what's happening to him and, when all is said and done, he IS your relative.The best summation of this sort of attitude (which i felt to some extent myself during my time in the US Navy) comes when Ericson, the Captain, is touring his new ship as she stands under construction in a Glasgow shipyard; he meets one of his future officers, and mentions the name of his previous ship, which was lost with over three-quarters of her crew, and realises that&quot;He's heard about 'Compass Rose', he probably remembers the exact details--that she went down in seven minutes, that we lost eighty men out of ninety-one. He knows all about it, like everyone else in the Navy, whether they're in destroyers in the Mediterranean or attached to the base at Scapa Flow: it's part of the linked feeling, part of the fact of family bereavement. Thousands of sailors felt personally sad when they read about her loss; Johnson was one of them, though he'd never been within a thousand miles of 'Compass Rose' and had never heard her name before.&quot;To be part of a band of brothers like that is a proud thing, and Monsarrat captures it perfectly.He also captures the terrified boredom of being in enemy territory with nothing happening as you wait for the enemy to make the first move, and the shock, confusion and horror of combat (particularly sea combat, in which the battlefield itself is the deadly, patient enemy of both sides).And he captures the glories and rewards of life at sea, the beauty of a glorious clear dawn at sea, the stars and the moon and the wake at night and so much more.This is the book that made a sailor out of me.It will tell you what it is to be a sailor."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"\\"The Cruel Sea\\" focuses on the British naval experience during World War II--more specifically, on the crew of a corvette during the first half of the war and, to a lesser extent, of a frigate during its waning years. Like most war stories, the plotting is at times necessarily predictable (yet still thrilling), but Monsarrat's epic is a cut above in both its human element (even in its occasional depiction of Germans) and in its presentation of the morally gray aspects of war. This is no ode to blind patriotism. Instead, the novel is an elegy on the selfless bravery and selfish survival instincts of a group of sailors whose reasons for being in the war are as varied as the men themselves: the stern but fair-minded Lieutenant-Commander Ericson, the indolent and tyrannical (and somewhat comical) First Lieutenant Bennett, the nervous and self-doubting Sub-Lieutenant Ferraby, the level-headed and thoughtful Sub-Lieutenant Lockhart (who, I would guess, is Monsarrat's alter ego), and a supporting cast of dozens. There are some spine-chilling and devastating battle scenes, but the book never once loses its focus: the men (and women) who fought and endured the war.Another surprising aspect of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is its intense lyricism. There are many sentences and descriptions that linger in the mind long after one has finished the novel. The death a crew member: \\"He did not exactly surrender to the sea, but he stopped caring much whether he lived or died; and on this night, an ambiguous will was not enough.\\" An officer finding out his girlfriend is pregnant: \\"The child would be the occasion of their marriage, not the cause for it.\\" Equally impressive is the novel's unusual wit--humor far beyond the stereotypical bawdiness of sailors: the friendly banter between crew members, the scrapes between men on leave and family members or other civilians, the hilarious clash of cultures when the frigate is docked for repairs in New York City.Generally, I am averse to \\"war novels\\" (with the exceptions of the usual famous classics); I'd rather read the real thing--journalism or history--and forego the shallow characterizations and poor writing so common to the genre of military fiction. So I can't explain what caused me to pick up this 500-page book, but I am certainly glad I did. This novel is a neglected classic and should be read by an audience far beyond the aficionados of war novels."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is an exciting and yet very poignant novel of naval warfare which took place in the North Atlantic during World War II. It focuses primarily on two English naval officers whose job it was to escort--with first an inadequate corvette and then a frigate--the numerous convoys that went back and forth across the Atlantic throughout the course of the war.It was a difficult job to begin with and got worse: by 1941 Allied shipping was being destroyed by German U-Boats at an alarming rate. During one memorable journey, eleven of the 21 ships they were sent to escort were sunk. This was an enormous toll, both in supplies and in lives lost.What this great book does is give us a first hand view of the action, and also the effect that it had on these men, and the lives of those around them. To be sure there is blood and gore here, but it is not sensationalized or glorified. It is simply recorded in a straightforward manner, and is all the more chilling because of it. What is really emphasized is the psychological effect. We get a clear picture of their exhaustion, their fear, their terror, and their frustration in their inability to deal effectively (at least early on), with an unseen and deadly enemy.They are at sea for months at a time and incapable of dealing with family problems on shore: philandering wives, sick mothers, far-away sons and loved ones. Their homes and villages are being bombed. They begin to feel hatred--not only of the enemy, but of the ship itself, and all that it represents: exhaustion, terror, helplessness, and death.The captain must make terrible decisions at a moment's notice. After one attack, he steams towards where he believes a U-boat to be, an area which also happens to be occupied by English survivors of an earlier wreck. He decides he must drop his depth charges, knowing for certain that these sailors will die. Later, he agonizes over whether there was a U-boat there to begin with.We get a sense of the dangerous nature of the sea itself. There is no place to go during wild Atlantic storms, and sometimes they last for days. Everything in the ship is tossed around. There is no hot food. Sleep is impossible when you are routinely thrown out of your bunk. Everybody is banged and bruised and sometimes severely injured by suddenly being heaved against a bulkhead. Of course there is also the terror of being swept overboard entirely. The only saving grace was that, during a storm, the U-boats didn't attack.The book covers this aspect of the war, and covers it thoroughly, from 1939, which is chapter one, to 1945, which is chapter seven. It is written from the perspective of adult men and women we learn to know well and come to care about deeply. We are saddened when they are wounded, or killed. And the termination of the love affair between the first mate and his \\"Wren\\" was nothing less than heart-wrenching. This is a great novel, and belongs on the shelf with perhaps the half-dozen or so of the greatest novels of World War II."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This movie is quite faithful to the novel, which was also spectacular. A good example of the interaction of men thrown together on a ship, at war, in difficult conditions, fighting a cruel sea in an even crueler war.This should be considered one bookend of the many movies covering the Second World War at sea, in the Atlantic, with the other being \\"Das Boot\\", covering the same war scenario, from opposite sides of the conflict.A must see for an understanding and appreciation of the war at sea in WWII."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"A realistic tale of the Second World War at sea This war time drama is played out through the desperate struggle of one man, his crew and their ship. We follow the expliots of a Royal Navy corvette HMS Compass Rose, as she carries out her duty in protecting the vulnerable convoys from the hunting packs of U-boats in the North Atlantic. All the experiences of the war at sea are there, in the faces of the men, the arduous conditions of the rough seas and in the horrors of war like the poor wretched survivors they pluck from the sea, choking and covered in oil. However, the most memorable scene, and one of which is surely equal to any other in cinematic history, has to be when Captain Ericson (Jack Hawkins) is forced to decide whether or not to attack a U-boat or save a group of British survivors that struggle in the water directly above his intended target.After 1942 this dilemma was turned into a blunt order when the Admiralty instructed anti-submarine vessels to make every attempt to destroy a U-boat thus carrying out their sole duty of protecting the convoy. At that time U-boats were believed to be diving close to the sinking ship so that their presence in the area would be harder to detect by the ship's Asdic radar. This often resulted in survivors losing their lives or being seriously injured from an indiscriminate depth charge attack. In the book by Herbert Gordon Male 'In All Respects Ready For Sea,' there is a true story of such an attack and the author gives such an account.My father served on a anti-submarrine armed trawler during the war and his experiences were of special interest to the film's main star Jack Hawkins whom he met and became friends with during the completion of the film. My father felt that this film was an important one as it told a real story of the men and their sacrifice during the history of the Battle of the Atlantic. Today it is as honest a film as it was then and shows the effects of war on the ordinary men who fought it. Only a few films have since dared to portray the personal and true realities of war with out the usual and expected thrilling pyrotechnics of the big screen action film."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is perhaps the finest novel written out of World War II. It is drawn on the actual service in the Royal Navy of the author. It is the story of two ships, maybe 200 men, German submarines and the constant relentless ocean. Even when there is no combat action, the sea is always there in all its forms - just waiting for a small defect to occurr and then it will claim another victim - be it man or ship.The sailors of the Compass Rose are a dramatic cross section. The captain is a reservist from the merchant navy while his officers are all volunteers from the civilian sector. One officer's only sea going experience is crossing the channel in a small yacht with a one woman crew. Not the best of material.The crew is even more diverse. The senior ratings, coxswain, signalman, engineer and several others, are all professional Royal Navy and it is one these men the captain will lean the most. The remainder of the crew is drawn from all walks of life from clerks to vet assistants. Together they are all molded into a working crew.The contacts with the German submarines are numerous but the end result is disappointing to some in that only two submarines are sunk between the two ships. Lots of survivors are pulled from the sea though as the submarines whittle away at the convoys chugging across the sea.One gets a sense of the unending grind that the men endure as the ships make thier rounds from Liverpool to New York with a side trip to Russia for variety. Even shore time is not enjoyed as the local Liverpool area is pounded by German bombers and wives and girlfriends are not willing to endure the constant seperation.Compass Rose is sunk and the crew, once more, is held together by the captain. Some men are heros and die a heros death and others are simply freightened men trying to stay alive which few do. It is a sobering time for the survivors as they look back at their life in Compass Rose.The captain and one officer move on to another ship and finish the war in her. Again, it is a return to the grind of fighting the sea and occassionally fighting the Germans. One submarine is sunk by the new ship and the war ends.There is little glory to be earned in this story, rather it is a tale of survival, hanging on to make it through the day or night. Everyone is a hero in this story from the junior sailor to the captain. It is a story that is being remembered less and less as the survivors of World War II diminish in numbers. It is a story to be read and remembered - when there was no array of electronic weapons and nuclear energy to draw upon to destroy an enemy; rather it was skill, patience, persistance and a willingness to endure that saw a successful outcome from a combat between corvette and submarine. Sometimes the corvette won and sometimes the submarine won. Many times it was a draw.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the war at sea during World War II. It should be in every naval officer's personal library regardless of nationality. Once read, it should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a very realistic, semi-documentary account of British convoys in the Atlantic during WW II. We see the men as frightened, lonely, and, above all, dedicated. Jack Hawkins is the captain of the Compass Rose, a ship that gets blown up by a German sub, and from which he and some of his men just barely survive on a raft. He is given another command and we feel most acutely his torment over risking the lives of his men while getting revenge on another German sub. The movie is intelligent and honest, thanks mainly to Eric Ambler's script and top-notch dialogue. Produced in the Ealing Studios and a gem of a movie. Definitely worth a watch."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I have just read the book, and as a WW2 merchantman I just realized how lucky I was to have been sailing in the Pacific where all I had to put up with was an occasional Kamikazi, and &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, because the Japs didn't understand the true use of the subs like their allies, the Germans did.I have just ordered the movie, and if it gets across the fear that I felt when I had to go below deck to the engine room when I was under attack as well as the book does, it will deserve a five star rating."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I first read the expurgated version of this book when I was at Senior school in 1952. I always thought that it was because of the language, not so.I have seen the Movie many times and I always come away from the viewing with an overwhelming sense of meloncholly. Would I as a young man have had the courage of these brave sailers who fought a brutal, murderous enemy that was matched only by the equally and souless brutality of their secondry adversary, the cruel sea that the Germans, if possible, had made more cruel . Monsarrats insight into the life on board ship in the North Atlantic in a storm are as graphic as they are real. The pounding sea, the noise, the cold, the seasickness that Sub Lt Ferrabby experiences for days on end. His description of the sinking of the Compass Rose, the dying thoughts of the brave crew. As the author puts it \\" they new how to die, how to bury the dead,\\" to help heal the terrible debris of the ghastly war that they were in till the bitter end.

I now know why it was expurgated in 1952, it's the brothel description of Lt Bennett in Liverpool, their home port, happily the book was written in an age where profanity was not de riguer. The essense of this great movie and an even greater Book is that this is a love story,,, the love of comrades at war and how they share the suffering. The love of Lockhart and Ferrabee for this Collossus who is Ericson, the Captain, and he for them, as they struggle to defeat the evil menace of the \\"U\\" Boat. Countered somewhat by probably the most tender loves scenes ever in a war movie as he desribes a wartime love affair between Ft Lt Lockhart and \\"glamour pants\\" Officer Hallam in OPS.

Technically, it's about the officers and crew of a small corvette tasked with escorting numerous merchant vessel convoys across the Atlantic during World War II.

Where Monsarrat really shines is his introspection into the minds and lives of the characters --the men on the corvette \\"Compass Rose\\" and later, the frigate \\"Saltash\\". With vivid prose, the author introduces us to the initial crew of Compass Rose -- a green, barely trained group of mostly civilians devoid of any kind of military discipline -- and allows us to watch as they mature into highly trained professionals and fully developed human beings, warts and all. Along the way, they encounter unimaginable chaos, suffering, death, despair and a whole lot of other adjectives, including love and triumph.

Accurate in the big picture with interesting, surely representative, vignettes of the sailors and their families. But the focus is on the action, what it was like in the violent, stormy Atlantic trying to convoy life-sustaining merchant ships to and from Britain under threat of the stealthy, deadly U-Boat wolf packs.You get put in the shoes of a captain, a subordinate officer or a common sailer as they go about their duties and face up to the fear of a torpedo and a cold, oily sea waiting to gobble them up without hope of rescue.The battle of the Atlantic was a very close run thing. Heavy losses from 1941-1943 threatened to starve Britain out of the war. It was only in late 1943, early 1944, when Allied tactics and technology finally adapted, that the tables were turned and the U-Boats were the ones sent to the bottom.But what makes this book a stand out is the first person descriptions of the fear, drudgery, exhilaration, camaraderie, and tragedy of war at sea during those days. The author could not have written as he did without experiencing it himself and his prose often rises to literary excellence."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I finally got around to reading this familiar sounding title . . . what a wonderful, wonderful sea/war story.I've read many maritime novels over the years and this one is as good or better than any of them, standing easily in company with the Caine Mutiny, Mutiny on the Bounty, the Edward Beach submarine novels, and so on.This one is quite British, and tells its WWII story from the perspective of North Atlantic convoy escort duty. Sounds boring in concept, but a page turner as presented by author Nicolas Monsarrat. This tale follows captain and crew through the war and two commands: a small corvette, and then a frigate.The people studies - the interactions, internal struggles, fears, loves - are as interesting as the seagoing warfare itself. Very well constructed and wholly believable. And this corner of the war was a whole new experience for me, seen from the viewpoint of the escort sailors and officers, battling the German U-boat wolfpacks.Monsarrat gives us boredom and terror, great leaders and tyrants, victory and submission, all well told.

They don't make them like this, anymore.World"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Nicholas Monsarrat's superbly written \\"The Cruel Sea\\" captures in fiction the essence of the Battle of the North Atlantic in a way that a history could not. It describes, at a very human level, the desperate struggle to safely escort convoys across the North Atlantic in the face in incessant Nazi submarine and aircraft attacks. On the success of the these convoys hung the outcome of war; without them, the Allied war effort would have ground to a halt and Britain would have starved.The narrative of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" centers on two men and two ships. George Ericson, a middle-aged commercial sea captain and Royal Navy Reserve officer, is recalled to the fleet in 1939 to lead the newly commissioned corvette HMS Compass Rose. Also central to the narrative is young Lockhart, a very green and newly commissioned Sub-Lieutenant who will grow into a fine naval officer and Ericson's \\"Number One\\" on both the Compass Rose and a follow-on command, the frigate HMS Saltash. \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is populated by an astonishingly rich cast of supporting characters, including ship's company at sea and wives and girlfriends ashore.The story itself, richly informed by the author's own experiences at sea in the Second World War, is that of the convoys. The Compass Rose and the Saltash will spend weeks at sea, sheparding merchant vessels under wartime conditions, enduring the harsh weather of the North Atlantic, and fighting the Nazi onslaught. It is a fight that calls for patience, endurance, skill, and cunning, much of it learned the hard way, on the job. The fight will demand the utmost from the men of the Compass Rose and the Saltash, making heroes of some and breaking others. Monsarrat captures it all in superbly readable, often lyrical prose: the mundane routine, the terror of combat, and the heartbreak of loss.\\"The Cruel Sea\\" does not attempt to glorify war. Monsarrat faithfully describes the huge human cost of war, in the strains on tired and frightened men, the struggle to acquire and keep the hard edge necessary to kill in combat, and in the sometimes unsuccessful effort to have a normal life ashore.This book is very highly recommended to the reader interested in the Battle of the North Atlantic and to the reader looking for a superb novel of the sea."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a wonderful book. I first read it twenty years ago and have re-read it twice since then. Nicholas Monsarrat is a superb writer and he gives an exciting account of what it must have been like to be aboard British corvettes in the North Atlantic during World War 2. The ships were small and the risks were great. Although a work of fiction, it comes out of Monsarrat's first-hand experience. I look forward to reading The Cruel Sea once again and strongly recommend this excellent book."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The unrelenting echo of the sonar punctuates this understated J. Arthur Rank film with a taut atmosphere of suspense. Novelist Eric Ambler's intelligent script remains faithful to Nicholas Monserrat's novel about the last voyage of HMS Compass Rose and all who sailed on her. The splendid performances of Jack Hawkins as her captain and Donald Sinden as his First Mate bring the novel to life, as do the performances of the entire ensemble cast, which includes Denholm Elliott. One of the best aspects of the Rank organization films of this era is the devotion that went into the delineation of even the minor characters.Some viewers (an example being my son) may shun this picture because it was filmed in black and white. This is a shame, because \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is so absorbing that such details as lack of color become totally irrelevant. Simply put, \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is a masterpiece of cinematic art."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a somewhat dry Navy movie about sub hunting during WWII. While Naval combat has changed quite a bit during the last 50 years, the threat of submarines to surface ships has not. The horror of having your ship torpedoed was always on the minds of sailors during the second World War. The fate of the crew and the anguish of a captain who has lost his ship are showcased in this movie.If you're a fan of British naval movies made not too long after the end of the war, this one may be worth checking out. It's always interesting to me to see old movies that are filmed on ships that actually FOUGHT in the war, as opposed to trying to make re-enactments of the ships in today's movies."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Mosarrat shows us that there is no glory in war, but much honor attached to the men and women of the armed forces. The Cruel Sea tells us how to behave during a conflict - be loyal, resilient, and have faith in ourselves and our comradesI re-read this book every few years and each time I am impressed with the characters, settings, and the lessons that Erickson and Lockhart teach us. And each time I feel better about people and their potentials. This book stays in the current section of my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The late Nicholas Monsarrat's The Cruel Sea (originally published in 1951) is a powerful and riveting novel of maritime endurance and daring set in the North Atlantic during World War II. Carefully scripted and written, the reader is drawn into this story of the British ships Compass Rose and Saltash, and their desperate cat-and-mouse game on the high seas with Nazi U-boats. This fine trade paperback edition from Burford Books will introduce a whole new generation of action/adventure enthusiasts to a truly skilled and engaging writer whose ability to involve the reader from first page to last is rarely equaled and never surpassed."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"If I were asked to recommend three great movies about any Allied or Axis army, navy and air force in World War II, they would be &quot;The Desert Fox&quot;, &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; and &quot;Twelve O'Clock High&quot;. All three were made in black and white soon after the war, and all have the unmistakable realism of true accounts.&quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;, based on the famous Nicholas Monsarrat novel of the same title, lend its story beautifully to the stark contrasts and subtle mid-tones of black and white film (you don't get all those mid-tones of grey in color film). The story is grippingly personal, tragic and redeeming, gradually and painfully building the intense bond of camaraderie that seems to be particularly strong among navy people - probably because the sea can be the loneliest and most unforgiving place on earth (hence the title). Recalling the names Compass Rose and Saltash Castle, you'll taste the freezing brine of the North Atlantic, smell the mix of diesel fuel, blood and cordite, and hear the cries of your mates drowning in your wake. The real deal in black and white."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"It's a pity this book's out of print. I read it for the first time in a Dutch translation when I was 17 years old. It made a deep impression on me. When I read the English version, fifteen years on, this impression was even deepened. What the people on board of the cargo-vessels and warships that crossed the North-Atlantic during WW II had to endure is almost beyond description. Monserrat did a terrific job doing this. I was captured from the beginning to the end. I myself being a ship's captain was moved deeply by this story of the sea, the war and the movings of small human beings caught in between. Anything Alistair McLean might have written about this subject is put very much in the shadow by this terriffic book."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Made in the 1950's with the co-operation of the UK Royal Navy the film follows the fate of a small group of seaman, with minimal experience who manned the small escort vessels that fought the Battle of the Atlantic. Though ficticious, the film is set against the true historical context of the battle and incidents portrayed have a basis in historically recorded incidents. The sheer emotion of ordinary men stoically fighting, and often failing, to survive in the hostile world in which they have been thrown by the war is excellently portrayed with crisp editing and effects. An excellent adaption of Nicholas Monserrat's book with some editing of the original text in order to get the film down to a reasonable length. Though by modern standards the continuity is slightly lacking in the seagoing shots, this in no way reduces the sheer impact of the events portrayed.

The Cruel sea was their field of food (fish), their lifeline and protector even as it turned on both the British Lion and its foes. ..... It could (and did) pose titantic moral choices including the necessity to running over fellow englishmen to depth charge the enemy sub which otherwise would live to fight another day, and to allow inhumane \\"officers\\" to mistreat their lessors. ..... Even as it protected the home ports from invasion, it kept its sailors from being at home when aircraft butchered their families, or philanderers trysted with wife orsweetheart. It provides a career opportunity for those otherwise stuck in England's caste system. For all its good points it is heartless in passing along good and evil to friend and foe alike. This is particularly seen when its good protects the island while being a battlefield for cruel battles where losers may sink in 7 minutes with a loss of most hands on board. .....

Its author Nicholas Monsarrat served in the North Atlantic during WWII so it is very much a first-hand account of his experiences.Most of the action is at sea aboard the convoy escort vessels \\"HMS Compass Rose\\" and \\"HMS Saltash\\" during the Battle of the Atlantic.Its focus is the human element of the war - on ordinary people during extraordinary times.It was made into an excellent film in England in 1953."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"With a literate, nuanced script by the gifted Eric Ambler, this taut, tight little war film is distinguished by the stunning work of Hawkins as world-(and war-) weary Ericson, patiently but firmly coalescing an inexperienced, fractionated group of young men into a proficient crew. Hawkins is buoyed by solid support from Baker (thoroughly detestable here), and fine work by actors Sinden and Stratton. Also look for Denholm Elliott, Alec McCowen and a lovely Virginia McKenna in smaller roles."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I consider, \\"The Cruel Sea\\" based on the novel by Nicholas Montserrat to be one of the better and more realistic films on the Second World War to be made in post war Britain. It is understaed and mostly well acted. Jack Hawkins fits easily into the part of captain and he is well supported by Donlad Sinden who had not, at that time, become a caricature of hiself with his ridiculous voice. Stanley Baker is excellent as the boorish former car salesman with his cry of, \\"Snorkers, good oh!\\" referring to the awful tinned sausages and he is counterbalanced beautifully by a young Denholm Elliot who is cuckholded by his theatrical wife. There is a stark realism which brings home the sheer awfulness of the daily risk and drudgery and fear that makes up war."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Excellent black and white british film! Had forgotten \\"old\\" movies were so interesting."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I have worn out several copies of this video. You will see other reviewers who find fault with things the movie did or did not portray, but as a historian I can say it captures the essence of serving on a corvette in the North Atlantic better than anything else available(i.e. Corvette K-225 starring Alan Ladd, etc.) I have had the honor of speaking with vets of the Battle of the North Atlantic who viewed this video and to a man they love this movie. I can think of no higher praise than concurrance of the men who were actually there. Field Marshall Erwin Rommel is supposed to have said that &quot;what is winning the war for the Allies is the two and a half ton truck. I would respectfully disagree with the Field Marshall, for the trucks never would have made it to Europe without the convoys and this is what the movie captures."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this novel some years ago.

The characters are dynamic, and you find yourself, cursing their enemy as if it were your own. I would recommed this book to anyone who enjoys either the sea or stories about men at war. The only comparable book is Jan de Hartog's The Captain, However this book is far better."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is no ordinary blood-and-glory sea story, with a ship full of heroes who can do no wrong. Here is real life - the misery of North Atlantic weather, in a small ship rolling constantly in the tremendous swell. An untried and amateur crew aboard a newly built ship are pitted against an omnipresent and invisible enemy below the waves, who is able to mark ships and sailors for death seemingly at will. In perhaps the most bitter fight of WW II, the crew adapt and learn, making Compass Rose a highly effective weapon against the German U-Boats.Written in 1951, Monsarrat bases his story on his own experience as first officer of a corvette on convoy escort duty. He clearly identifies with his primary character, Lockhart, who joins HMS Compass Rose in 1939 as a very junior Sub Lieutenant. The people and ships are fictional, but this is nevertheless a true and moving story. A brilliant story, totally unforgettable!"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The cold gripping fear, frustration,and agony of the convoy escorts in the North Atlantic during WWII. The physical and emotional sacrafices of the men assigned to escort duty to protect the life blood of Great Britan. Monsarrat is a fantastic story teller, filling the reader with emotions in a way that very few writers will ever master. The realization that Command is really lonely,and the second guessing of descisions is a tough pill for Captain Ericson to swallow. These sailors are not Regular Navy from a Family lineage of Naval service, rather the average Joe brought together by the war. Yet they form a strong fighting unit. As as in every war, death is not picky about whom it takes. A great book that will be hard to put down till it is finished. Give it some time and you will read it again."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"&quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; gives an excellent account of the real war at sea, the everyday lives of sailors and the situations they were up against both at sea and at home.

I was in the US Navy and never saw action like this. One comes to actually hate the First Leftenant and his &quot;snorkers, good-oh&quot; and the leading lady she was, well, lovely and graceful and good. Virtue is big in this movie. The drive of its heroes is endless. The black and white gives the mood and the sound of the blaring horns gives the expediency. I have the book but can't seem to &quot;wade&quot; my way through it. This movie is thrilling and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is an excellent account of the Battle of the Atlantic and Baltic Run to supply the Soviets during WWII.

It alsogives you a great insight into what happened during in the Norht Atlantic during the first years of the war."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I had seen the movie many years ago and thought it was very good. The book is of course a much more detailed account of the impact on the lives of participants and the horrors of the war at sea. The book is written in a style that is very easy to read."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This utterly unflinching, realistic look at the physical and pyschological consequences of war is a harrowing experience even seen some 60 years on. Jack Hawkins is superb as the commander who has to plough through survivors of a U boat attack because he can't afford to let the U boat escape to kill more men. How shocking and unexpected it must have been for 1950s audiences to see the burly Hawkins drunk, in tears and tortured because of his actions. The scene is haunting and lingers in the mind long after the film is over. There are no simple minded heroics here - the emphasis is on gritty reality and the horror experienced by men in conflict. Many of the characters we come to know and love meet unpleasant ends.Donald Sinden, best known now for his light-hearted performances in such films as Doctor In The House, gives an equally fine portrayal of Hawkins' No 1, initially on a temporary promotion following the departure of the original (Stanley Baker), later rising magnificently to the occasion, keeping up morale in the lifeboat - \\"Sing, you lazy bastards!\\" One scene towards the end has him comment to Hawkins that the German survivors of their attack on a U boat aren't very different to them, really. That sums it up perfectly.I don't think The Cruel Sea is an anti-war film per se, but it certainly refuses to glamorise armed conflict. Without editorialising, it simply tells an unpalatable truth. Perhaps that's why it says so much so well and remains so powerful even in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"After having read this book over 20 years ago and a refresher about 10 years ago, I Found that it was just as enjoyable in the third reading and not at all stale. I did remember some events, here and there, but still enjoyed them, or was moved by them. The characters were just as vibrant this time around.D.W.W."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Over the years I have worn out several copies of this film on VHS I have watched it so many times.I am so happy it is coming out on DVD.[I almost bought the box set but at release it was $80.00 plus]This film is so well written and acted and imagined that after watching it you almost feel that you have been through the war as part of a convoy escort....and yet this is not your typical war action film.There is action yet it is muted behind the story of the Captain and the men he commands and the price they have to pay to win the war.Don't buy this expecting a \\"Hollywood\\" sea adventure with cliche story lines and a typical ending.Get this film for the moving moments and drama that is war.There are several scenes that really pull at your heart..the men in the water awaiting rescue..yet it is not to be..and the cost on all involved.I would love to discuss scene by scene yet I would give away to much of the story...get this film and you will understand why it is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"One of two brilliant wartime naval films, the other being \\"In Which We Serve\\" starring Noel Coward. Jack Hawkins gives one of his finest performances as the Captain of the Compass Rose, a merchant seaman who finds himself captaining a ship with a crew with little or no naval experience, having to battle not only German U-Boats, but the sea itself. Fine performances also by Donald Sinden and the late Denholm Elliott. Terrific film."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This magnificent film does for the British as what the awesome &quot;Das Boot&quot; does for the Germans. Yet in many ways, this movie is as much a &quot;polar opposite&quot; to the great German film. &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; is about two ships, her captain, the wardroom of Officers, selected enlisted men and spans the length of the war (39-45), &quot;Das Boot&quot; is about a single U-boat, her crew and one patrol in 1941. Yet each complements the other. Jack Hawkins is simply superb as Ericson, the reluctant warrior and the rest of the cast is top notch. Fans of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies will recognize a young Denholm Elliot as a young ensign. For me, one of the most gripping scenes is when the &quot;Compass Rose&quot; detects a U-boat lurking beneath some survivors floating. Ericson agonizingly orders the attack. As the depth charges explode beneath (killing the survivors, but manages to drive the enemy submarine off), one of his crew yells, &quot;Bloody murderer!&quot; and we can see the toll this takes on Ericson. Later that night Lt. Lockhart, the ships executive officer, tries to console the anguished and drunken Ericson who simply says, &quot;it was the war that killed them...The bloody war,&quot; this is simply fantastic drama and I think, one of Hawkins' greatest scenes. The film's writer, Eric Ambler (himself a great novelist) captures Nicholas Monserrat's great novel perfectly and while certain scenes from the novel had to be excised, he maintains the story's drive and superb characterizations.See this film.When will it come out on DVD?"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This war time drama reflects the desperate struggle of one man, his crew and their ship. HMS Compass Rose, a corvette carrying out her duty in protecting the vulnerable convoys from hunting packs of U-boats in the North Atlantic.All the experiences of war at sea are portrayed here, as if etched on the faces of the men. We see the effects on HMS Compass's crew having to live with the arduous conditions at sea and the horrors of war, rescuing poor wretched survivors from the sea, choking and covered in oil while all the time in fear of the unseen threat of a U-boat attack.However, the most memorable scene, and one of which must surely be equal to any other in the history of this type of war film genre, has to be when Captain Ericson (Jack Hawkins) is forced to decide whether or not to attack a U-boat or save a group of survivors in the water directly above his intended target.Historically after 1942 this dilemma was turned into a blunt order when the Admiralty instructed anti-submarine vessels to make every attempt to destroy a U-boat regardless of survivors in the water and thus carrying out its priority to protect the ships in the convoy. In the book by Herbert Gordon Male 'In All Respects Ready For Sea,' there is a true story of such an attack and the author gives his own account of how he and other survivors came under depth charge attack from a Royal Naval corvette.My late father served on a anti-submarrine armed trawler during the war and his experiences were of special interest to the films main star, Jack Hawkins whom my father met and became friends.. My father always felt that this film was an important one in that it told a more factual story. More importantly, such personal experiences of the war at sea were often eclipsed by more heroic tales of the Battle of the Atlantic.Today it is as honest a film as it was then. It shows the effects of war on the ordinary sailor who fought in the longest conflict during the Second World War, The Battle of The Atlantic.'Cruel Sea' is one of those few films that really show the personal side of war instead of concentrating on the expected pyrotechnics and thrilling action normally associated with the big screen."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is absolutely one of my favourite books, and I'm reading it for the 5th or 6th time right now.Based on his real wartime experinces, the author creates a fascinating story of &quot;one ocean, two ships, and some 150 men&quot;. Living from day to day through the horrors of naval war in the North Atlantic with the wonderfully-crafted characters, one is only beginning to imagine just how terrible it must have been. You breathe with them, you fight with them, you sleep with them and you live through their good and bad times - finding yourself unwilling to put this book aside.Read this book, and Buchheim's &quot;The Boat&quot;, and you can truly say: &quot;Now I know what it was like!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"37 years ago in high school English class we were challenged to read The Cruel Sea. I have never forgotten the flaming seas, the U-boats hiding under floating survivors, the cruel consequences of war, the noble Captain, the obnoxious crewman with his mouth of insults I had to ask my mother what they meant. A young girl, age 16, never read a war story, loved this book and never forgot it."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I found this book purely by accident, thanks to a recommendation by another book review. I think this is perhaps one of the finest novels about combat, certainly about naval combat, that I have ever read. Every word rings with a sense of authenticity and drama that is all too often missing from modern literature.I'm loathe to give away any plot detail; the story builds slowly like a fine meal. In short, the book concerns itself with two warships during escort duty during the whole of British involvement in WWII. The first ship, a Corvette, is small and perhaps a bit amateurish to begin with. Its history, and the relations of its crew are treated in intricate detail. The second ship, a Frigate, is larger, less personal and much like the war more mechanized and colder; its is more effective, to be true, and a step closer to victory but also represents a loss of humanity.Monsarrat weaves these two stories into a seamless whole - the bood deserves to be called an epic, and at times I almost felt like I was watching an old British war film, like Sink the Bismarck: every word rang true. I had one small complaint, and that involves either a misplaced death near the end of the novel. Again, I don't want to give anything away but it just felt unnecessary.Please, read the book. If you are at interested in Naval history, or just want a good read, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Take it from a retired naval officer, this is one of the best novels ever written about war at sea. Monsarrat explores the savage and relentless nature of the struggle against the U-boat menace in the North Atlantic. The sailors' enemies were not just the lethal German submarines, but miserable weather, bad food, wretched accommodations, physical and mental exhaustion, and emotional havoc. I wonder -- could I have stood the test?"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"&quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; was recommended to me by my mom who read it as a young woman when it was first published. I was skeptical about reading this epic of WW2 battle at sea -- thought I wouldn't want to read about war in great detail -- but I found that the pages turn themselves. It is a GREAT book -- expertly constructed and beautifully written. It is an insight into the human spirit in a time of war, but it also works so well because it does an amazing job of making the ship itself a living, breathing character, in whose destiny one becomes intimately wrapped up. The copy I have is from the 50's and I'm thrilled to see it is still in print, though not surprised. The book is a true testament to the fact that GOOD WRITING, on any subject, is fascinating and stands the test of time."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is, in my view, one of the best movies yet made dealing with naval men at war in WWII. It's the story of the Compass Rose, newly commissioned in 1940 as a convoy escort, and the officers and men who served on her. Her captain (Jack Hawkins) was fresh from the merchant marine; her new officers had seen almost no sea duty. They learned on the job as they protected convoys in the North Atlantic and then in the run to the Mediterranean.What makes this movie so good is its matter-of-factness. There are no heroics, just men learning their jobs and doing their duty, with some who die and some who survive. The scene where Captain Ericson decides to use depth charges to destroy a suspected submarine hiding below a group of struggling survivors from a torpedoed freighter is harrowing. The DVD I saw has a good but by no means first-class image transfer.The novel, The Cruel Sea by Nicholas Monsarrat, is largely forgotten now. It remains one of the most evocative books to come out of WWII. The movie is well worth seeing. The book is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The sea really is cruel as are the life-and-death decisions the captain has to make. It is naval warfare in World War II. Ultimately however, it is about the love between a captain and his second-in-command. That has nothing to do with being \`gay'. It has everything to do with the relationships between men in time of war. The counterpoint is reflected upon when \`number one', played superbly by Donald Sinden (who in later work, focused on comedy), considers the matter with the woman he is falling in love with. The evidence of love between the men is when he is given the chance to captain his own ship. It is a superb British war movie, understated and with Jack Hawkins conveying the trauma of those decisions; good and bad. This is a finely crafted film.Ian Hunter.Author of \`e-Love'."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"British seamen are pitted against the frozen North Atlantic and the silent danger of German U-boats in this compelling WWII novel.This book is of particular significance to me, as my father was a sonarman aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Frigates Mojave and Annapolis during WWII. It was during North Atlantic convoy duty that the sister ship of the Mojave, the Escanaba, was sunk off of Greenland on 5am June 10, 1943. In fact, my father's ship, the Mojave, had changed position with the Escanaba earlier that day. It was only after coming into port at St. Johns Newfoundland that it became apparent to the other seaman that the Escanaba had been lost. There was a Hudson's Bay Company truck that had come to the port to deliver blankets that some of the crew of the Escanaba had ordered. The manager for Hudson's Bay inquired of the officer on duty what had become of the Escanaba. The reply of the officer was \\"I cannot say,\\" which was what was always said when a ship had been lost. The manager then inquired whether seamen from some of the other ships would like to buy the blankets that had been intended for the crew of the Escanaba. My father purchased two of those blankets, which our family still enjoys using.My mother gave my father this book for their first wedding anniversary.

I have shared the DVD with others and have always received postive comments. This is a film which has become a classic."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This audio book is excellently read by Robert Powell who has a wonderful gravity to his voice and does the varied accents and personalities of the crew so well. It represents a high of story telling. This audio book was abridged from the famous 1951 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat who wrote it based on his wartime experience as a corvette commander in the British Navy in W.W.II. As noted by Bernard Edwards in \\"The Cruel Sea Retold: The Truth Behind Monsarrat's Epic Convoy Drama,\\" the novel is based on real events. Undoubtably, it was the best novel Monsarrat ever wrote. It became the basis for the classic war film with John Hawkins with the same name as the novel. Unfortunately, this book still is only available on cassette. Most libraries have long since lost the audio book or it has been broken by one of their patrons. One can only hope that it will be re-released as a CD sometime soon. The genre of wartime experience is a very big one, as of late, most people have been re-discovering memoirs of the Pacific War due to the new HBO Series, \\"The Pacific.\\" Having read many works in this area as well as some non-fiction histories by popular historians like the late Stephen Ambrose or the late Canadian historian, Pierre Berton, I'd have to say that this novel is one of the best. It has well-drawn characters and the intimacy of a very realistically depicted war at sea. There is none of the false bravado and theatrics of the movies. Instead, the war described on this pages is frequently monotonous, and frustrating in the extreme as the corvette attempts to destroy the submarine packs attacking the convoys. There are moments of great intensity and even horror as they fail to stop the enemy or are required by their orders to abandon, or even harm shipwrecked sailors who are in between them and enemy subs that they must try to destroy. It is a wonderful story and very well-rendered in this audio-book, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I first read this book nearly 40 years ago and remember then finishing it in a single day - well perhaps two. It has to be the consummate novel of war. It oozes truthfulness, at least by my perception, and therefore stands as a history of a desperate, desperate time. By the second year of the Battle of the Atlantic things looked truly grim and it is a testament to Churchill, I suppose, and to the extraordinary courage of these men, so vividly portrayed, that Great Britain prevailed. I cannot imagine living through such experiences which just seemed to go on and on. The novel's style remains strangely undated.

A Perrry Mason Mystery. The fish of death. Could Della Street be the murderess? Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon. In order to help her seriously ill boyfriend, gorgeous Sally Madison sets out to separate wealthy Harrington Faulkner from some of his money by offering him a cure for his ailing exotic fish, but her plan goes awry when the fish mysteriously vanish and Faulkner turns up dead.Died in the Wool. A woman is found dead in a bale of wool from her own farm. She's also the MP for the district, and there's classified war work going on there (development of a magnetic anti-aircraft fuse; what the hell is that doing on a remote farm in New Zealand?). Alleyn investigates. Of course there are all sorts of personal complications getting in the way--people keeping secrets for reasons having nothing to do with guilt.Pearls Before Swine. In the waning days of World War II Albert Campion has returned from Europe on leave. His intent is a quick stopover in his old London flat and then to take a train into the country to be with his wife Amanda and a child he only knows from letters. Unfortunately, he surprises Lugg and Lady Carados, the mother of his close friend Johnny, carrying a corpse into his rooms. The corpse is that of a woman who apparently had the nerve to crawl into Johnny Carados' bed and take an overdose of sleeping salts. At first, Campion attempts to get things under control, but finally thinks the better of it and sets out for the train. Unexpectedly, he is kidnapped by the cab driver and returns mysteriously to consciousness in a garage. To add insult to injury, the police insist that he stay in London to help with the Carados problem. A much-disgruntled Campion starts digging into a suicide that is looking more and more like murder. In short order the plot thickens. To the murder add a stolen bottle of rare wine, another murder attempt, and finally a series of art thefts. To make matters worse, the primary suspect is Johnny Carados himself, back in town to marry the widow of a war comrade in arms. Carados is motivated more by duty than love and the woman has fallen in love with a U.S. soldier on duty in London."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"Like a lot of people, I've been augmenting my reading lately with many of the scientific popularizations that have been coming out on neuroscience, biology, linguistics and information processing theory. These books generally fall into four camps: good science with bad prose (Edelman, Calvin, Llinas); bad science with good prose (Pinker, Bickerton, Lakoff &amp; Johnson); good science with good prose (Deacon, Damasio's first effort, Tomasello, Ramachandran) and bad science with bad prose (anything to do with &quot;memes&quot; - and this book!)Quite simply: no good argument here is new, and no new argument here is good (to paraphrase Samuel Johnson). For the &quot;math gene&quot; itself turns out to be nothing more than the &quot;math version&quot; of Chomsky's moribund and increasingly untenable &quot;deaux ex machina&quot; - an Innate and Universal Grammar, made even more implausible - if such a thing is possible at this late date - by the addition of Derek Bickerton's &quot;catastrophic adaptation&quot; model of how the &quot;miraculous mutation&quot; that &quot;endowed&quot; us with &quot;syntax&quot; (and thus with Universal Grammar and its &quot;mathematical equivalent&quot;) took place.Far worse from an intellectual standpoint is the uncredited and wholly superficial regurgitation of far more insightful authors' works, in particular Terrance Deacon, whose &quot;Symbolic Species&quot; is all but plagarized in the few coherent chapters of this book.Too, it soon becomes obvious that the author of THE MATH GENE obviously never bothered to read any of the source materials. To give just one of many possible examples, the American philosopher C.S. Pierce posited eleven - not three - levels of interpretation between icon and symbol - but since Terrance Deacon (who is never credited anywhere in this book, not even in the bibliography, despite the many examples and their arguments - communication vs. language, symbol vs. index, the whole discussion of vervet alarm calls, etc. - that have been lifted whole from his work) deliberately limited his own discussion in The Symbolic Species to three, the author of THE MATH GENE dutifully reports that Pierce's orginal formulation was likewise three.Lev Vygotsky similarly gets a perfunctory mention in the last two pages, though at no time throughout this book is any evidence whatsoever offered that would lead on to conclude that the author of THE MATH GENE has ever actually read any of Vygotsky's work (Vygotsky in that sense is becoming today what Freud was fifty years ago).Finally, the author spends an unconscionable amount of time promising, heralding, and foreshadowing the upcoming appearance of his revolutionary explanatory &quot;thesis&quot; that - hold onto your hats for a mind-blowing challenge to 2500 years of received wisdom here - human beings are good at math beacuse the species has evolved a talent for &quot;what I call 'off-line' thinking.&quot;307 poorly written pages for that!In short, I've read undergraduate students' term papers that had more original and well-argued thought.And they cite their sources."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"As an avid teacher and student of Mathematics, I was excited by the title of this book. It seemed like it would demonstrate why all humans have an aptitude for Math, and maybe how those who are 'innumerate' could tap into this inborn potential.Unfortunately, this is not at all what the book delivered. It was basically a description of the evolution of the Human brain, specifically with regard to language acquisition.With about 30 pages left in the book, he finally launches into his Thesis, which is that we are natrually good gossips, and that Math, to real Mathematicians, is very much like gossip. Mathematicians know numbers like they are people, and know their properties and relationships deeply.That was it. No clue as to how people who have struggled with Math can use this gossip ability to help them learn and appreciate Math at any level.Really a disappointing book. Don't waste your time, as I did mine."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"The book concerns itself with (educated) speculation on how the human brain acquired the ability to do Maths.Devlin makes a distinction between Mathematics and Arithmetic. According to him the former has more to do with study of patterns in nature and abstracting these, rather than manipulation of numbers that Arithmetic is concerned with. He says many good mathematicians are quite weak in arithmetic!He speculates that mathematics emanated from an unlikely ability that early man acquired as he organized into cooperative groups -- the ability to indulge in, and enjoy gossip!He talks of the complicated pattern of relationships among the characters of typical TV soaps. How any human being can so easily internalise the complex web of relationships in these serials without effort. This, according to him, is because of our innate ability to do maths.Of course when we replace the characters with symbols like A, B, C and relationships (such as \\"father of\\", \\"friend of\\", \\"rival of\\") with suitable operators, only academic mathematicians are able to handle the resulting abstraction. He claims that \\"good\\" (or conventional) mathematicians regard symbols and operators (such as Pi and Sigma) as people and their relationships, and so are able to handle (and even enjoy) the abstraction using the ability we originally acquired for indulging in gossip.The survival advantage of gossip is that we tend to \\"empathize\\" with others whom we \\"know\\" about. Which is why we feel terrible when bad things happen to non-existing characters in TV serials. Which is why trained terrorists often avoid \\"getting to know\\" their kidnap victims -- or else they will find it terribly difficult to kill them later if required. Thus we are more likely to cooperate with other (genetically distant) members of the group when we are able to gossip about them."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"\\"THE MATH GENE\\" poses an interesting thesis and contains a wide range of interesting examples. I was immediately drawn into the book with it's discussion of grammar school arithmetic, interesting math \\"geniuses\\" and correlations to language development. Unfortunately however, beyond these introductory chapters the discussion becomes both abstract and difficult to follow. Mid-way, the author delves into the dangerous territory of group theory. Given my background in chemistry, I've had the opportunity to study rudimentary group theory as it relates to molecules and stereochemistry. I won't deny that Dr. Devlin explains the premise of groups in a very eloquent and concise manner (I think even my cat could follow his analogies.) Notwithstanding, the average reader may find themselves wondering, \\"why the heck did I pick this book up anyway?\\" after a few dozen pages of group theory. Following group theory, he goes into a bit of a tangent on language development and basic linguistic theory (the \\"Fundamental Language Tree\\".) In fact, this discussion begins to wander so far off the beaten path that it concludes in an appendix at the back of the book. Following the linguistic hurdle, Devlin jumps into anthropological and evolutionary evidence for brain development and language acquisition. This is where he finally lost me. At this point I was so lost from the original intent of the discussion that I surrendered and began to skim the remaining chapter in search of his lost thesis. \\"Why are numbers like gossip?!?\\" I'm not entirely certain that question was ever answered, however, there are some pretty interesting ideas here which are certainly worth your time.

It is also true that such teachers are rare to come across.Maths is one such subject.

Afterall, as somebody said \\"music and math are the only true inventions of the human mind\\".Devlin's approach to presenting Math as a Language is very refreshing and breaks the defunct mental models of math. He provides theories of how we developed ablity to do math and why everybody has the same baseline ability.The book is wonderful and it creates an interst to read more about the subject."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"The book's first 6 chapters are a marvelous exposition of what math is and sheads important insights on this unique human ability to be mathematical. It may surprise the reader that math is not computational ability. Any human is wired to do math but it does take hard work. Devlin is the best popularizer on mathematics I know. However, I must add that I was dissapointed by his evolutionary speculation as dogma in the concluding chapters. He does state that his theories are the best he can come up with but I feel they do diservice to the marvelous mathematical abilities we have. It is evident that a mystery in this design is recognized and articulated by the author but his explanation that huge amount of monkey-time leading to abstract abilities was a let down for me. Devlin will show you that math is beautiful, orderly and a subject worth tacking by anyone. I regard Devlin as the best writer in demonstrating the awe of the nature of math. This is a good read except for the evolutionary speculation that we will never clearly sort out anyway. If you like math or hate math I recommend his other basic works--they will fill you with wonder and respect for our mathematical world and mind."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"I was expecting a book more on certain people's ability to do mathematics better than others, but instead I got a very interesting thesis on how everyone has this ability. I actually found this to be a rather inspiring read as I am also thinking about tackling a degree in applied mathematics. Instead this book goes into an in depth study on the development of language and finally ends with his conclusion based on his evidence.Devlin makes a very convincing argument about how mathematics is like gossip and he has definitely convinced me to agree with him on this subject. However, the only thing I think would make his argument stronger is if he didn't dismiss some language experts' studies as being wrong. Don't get me wrong, the studies and their relations could be wrong and Devlin could be right, but Devlin could also be wrong. Personally I thought his argument about interpersonal relationships and the vast amount of data we can remember about these things was the best he made. Basically doing mathematics is removing the \\"real\\" world people and assigning agreed upon variables to a wholly different society of mathematics. I'm not entirely sure how much of a fulcrum the development of language is for his point about gossip or his thesis overall, given that analogy. However, by the end, given some very important points, I happened to agree with him quite a bit.One thing we happened to disagree upon was his opinion on how mathematics education should be conducted. I should say, I agree with him to a point, without flat out disagreeing. He suggested that we reform the current mathematics education to remove all the repetitive memorization exercises (please note arithmetic and mathematics are separate and we are not talking about arithmetic reform). This way the class can focus more upon the principles and what the subject is about rather than the absolute practice of the subject. Theoretically students should understand what is studied in that topic and won't feel the strain of having to actually put it into practice on a rigorous level. While this sounds like a novel idea, all I have to ask is what if a High School student wants to become a mathematician? Isn't just learning the \\"concepts\\" of a subject like Trigonometry, rather than practicing them, more of a detriment to this student. You can even make this same case for an engineer or any other major with a heavy mathematics background. Sure this will favor your non-mathematics majors greatly, but it will hurt the others, in my opinion. Also, I seriously think that in today's society students, at the bare minimum, should understand how to solve algebraic problems. Unfortunately Devlin doesn't really delve into any aspects to truly back up his point or answer my questions. This wasn't the purpose of this book, but they were some important questions I came up with when he was going over his opinion on this topic.Naturally there's no such thing as a math \\"gene\\" that genetically predisposes one person over another to be better at math, so don't pick this up thinking this will explain anything on a genetic level. Instead if you're at all curious about how language and society's development could likely enable humans to do complex mathematics, then this book provides a very convincing theory to explain that."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"I am a psychologist and picked up this book to understand learning difficulties in mathematics as my I am planning my post-doctoral research in that area.

Based on the last 30 years of research on the acquisition of numerical thought, I think there are good reasons to believe that math and language are intimately related. Having enjoyed parts of Devlin's \\"The Language of Mathematics\\", I had high hopes when I picked up this book. The first few chapters were promising. For example, I completely agree with Devlin that, contrary to what is implicitly assumed in the field, the Number Sense has little to do with mathematical thought. Being a complete math neophyte, I also enjoyed his chapter on the nature of mathematical thinking. Unfortunately, for the rest, I was quite disappointed to find many interesting theses, but little in the way of articulate reasons for believing that they may be correct. Rather, I found much to disagree with.The main theses of this book are:1) Mathematical thought is a type of linguistic thought.2) The math gene is the genetic endowment for Universal Grammar.3) Universal Grammar specifies the \\"fundamental language tree\\" - i.e., the basic X-bar tree consisting of an XP, which consists of a SPEC and an X-bar, which consists of an X which optionally combines with another XP.4) During the first hundred of thousands, if not millions of years of evolution of the genus \\"homo\\", brain size grew rapidly. Given the cost of growing a bigger brain, it had to be very useful. Growing the brain was useful because it allowed homo to recognize more types (bananas, monkeys, palm trees, etc...)5) Then, sometime around 200,000 thousand years ago full-blown language appears. How? With the emergence of \\"off-line thinking\\": the brain can self-trigger patterns of activity that used to have to be caused by external stimuli.6) off-line thinking requires more than types; it requires representations of structural relations between them (e.g., cause-effect).7) types + structural relations = syntax8) being able to talk about relations between people is the same as being able to talk about mathematical relationsThere are several problems with these theses. First, the author rarely considers alternatives. Take for example the argument that goes: a) the increase in brain size had to be useful to make up for its cost; b) being able to recognize types is useful; c) therefore, the brain grew because brain growth allowed homo to recognize more types.This could be. The problem is that there are many other alternatives. It could be that brain growth allowed homo to have a larger working memory, or to store more mental images of individual objects and events, or to inhibit immediate desires in the interest of delayed gratification, etc...To show that the brain grew to represent more types, Devlin would have to consider some alternatives and show that the alternatives are wrong. However, far too little of that happens. Moreover, there are other sources of evidence that could support Devlin's thesis. For example, if evolution endowed us with the capacity to recognize multiple types, then type recognition should be innate - it should be available to young human babies. Much infant research suggests that indeed human infants do distinguish basic types - e.g., animate-inanimate. However, this is a far cry from the whole inventory of types Devlin seems to have in mind. More importantly, Devlin doesn't present other types of evidence that could support or disconfirm his hypothesis.Unfortunately, this is typical of most other arguments in the book. Devlin presents arguments that are consistent with his theses, but rarely considers alternatives. Moreover, the evidence he considers is usually deplorably thin.The other strain of problems comes from loose and usually erroneous analyses of mental representations. For example, Devlin characterizes syntax as the fundamental language tree, a characterization that finds much support in linguistic theory. But then later on syntax is said to be the same as representations of relations between types (or of the structure of the world). The fundamental language tree does not represent any contentful relations between objects or types. Syntax is pure form, not meaning. So the relation between the fundamental language tree and representations of the structure of the world escapes me. More generally, I don't see why Devlin dedicated a whole chapter to the fundamental language tree (which by itself is quite good) because he never goes back to that idea. Be that as it may, there is another problem with the thesis. Syntax is not a representation of structural relations of the physical or of the social kind. For example, consider these sentences: \\"Joe convinced Bob,\\" \\"Joe kissed Bob,\\" \\"Joe purchased a log\\" and \\"Joe burned a log\\". These sentences have the same syntactic structure: NP VP NP. However, they are about completely different types of relations. The first is about mental causation, the second is about contact, the third is about transfer, and the fourth is about physical causation. Clearly then, syntactic structure is not the same as representation of relations between objects and people.This problem recurs in many the arguments of the second half of the book. For example, if off-line thinking evolved the way Devlin says it evolved (i.e., it is an internally generated simulation of on-line thinking), then the capacity to think about the past or the future does not necessarily follow from off-line thinking. On its own, a simulation of on-line thinking (thinking about what is here now), is no more a representation of the past or future than on-line thinking itself. To think about the past or the future, one needs to represent the structure of time. If no such structure is available in on-line thinking, then it cannot appear in a simulation of on-line thinking. The general problem is that, other than being able to run without an external cause, the simulation cannot have properties that are not in what is being simulated.The latter point also holds for the book's final thesis - i.e., that our capacity for math grew out of our capacity to gossip - to talk about relations between people. Devlin's argument for this seems to be that all relations are equal. So if i can talk about relations between people then, necessarily, I can also talk about relations between geometric transformations or between numbers. But this is not so, at least, not patently. Love, argue with, hide from, embarrass, and flirt with are all social relations. Each of them has a particular content, as seen by the fact that each of them entails particular things (e.g., if A embarrassed B, then it is plausible that B's ego dropped temporarily but if A flirted with B, it is likely that A's ego enjoyed a temporary boost). Likewise, mathematical relations like SUCCESSOR, IDENTICAL, or SIMILAR have their particular content. How the content of any of these relations can be derived from social relations is quite unclear. To argue for his thesis that gossip is the origin of math, Devlin owes us an explanation of how one gets from the content of social relations such as embarass and flirt with, to relations like successor and identical. However, no such explanation is to be found. Therefore, as far as I can tell, there are no reasons to believe Devlin's final thesis. Rather, there are some pretty good ones to doubt it - i.e., that you cannot get representations of mathematical relations out of representations of social relations.What Devlin really needs is evidence for abstract symbols that only capture the most basic logical properties of relations (say whether they are symmetrical or transitive). Here syntactic categories and the fundamental language tree could be part of the answer. But unfortunately Devlin does not make this connection."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"I have never been so intrigued by a book as I am with this one!

I expected something that would build on the fast-growing body of work on mental modules. The idea behind mental modules is that the brain evolved specific capabilities in direct response to specific environmental challenges, and that the interplay among these various mental modules eventually led to human consciousness and reason. I expected this book to fit mathematical thinking into this overall scheme. Sadly, the author seems to be blithely unaware of the entire field of mental modules, nor does he permit his ignorance in this matter to constrain his confident prognostications.Dr. Devlin, a mathematician, views the brain through the prism of mathematics. Done properly, this book could have provided us with an interesting and unconventional point of view, but instead Dr. Devlin is too rooted in his own mathematical thinking to see clearly; his prism distorts the image of the brain beyond all recognition. His readings in biology, neurophysiology, linguistics, and especially human evolution are too thin to give him a strong grasp of the messy complexity of biological systems. He tries to establish his credibility by scattering references to other works and odd tidbits of fact through the book, but it seems to me that his overall grasp of the subject matter is too weak to justify his writing a book on the evolution of mathematical thinking.Lastly, I will fault the book for an almost tautological thesis. If you strip out all the intellectual filigrees and clever digressions, Dr. Devlins thesis can be boiled down to this: &Ograve;Mathematics is the science of patterns and symbol manipulation. Language is the means by which humans developed the ability to manipulate symbols. Therefore, mathematics evolved from language (and is its most perfect expression).&Oacute; Dr. Devlin would no doubt protest that there is much more to his thesis than this simplistic and tautological statement. And while it is true that the book does contain many other claims and factoids, this other material seems to dance around the central thesis without expanding it. I think that my boiled-down version of his thesis is a brutal but fair condensation.There is a need for a book detailing the evolution of mathematical thinking. This book does not fill that need. The best alternative I can suggest is The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero, by Robert Kaplan. This book doesnt address the development of all mathematical thinking; it concerns only the development of a single mathematical concept, the notion of zero. But it does so brilliantly. Unlike Devlin, Kaplan has completely mastered his subject. Unlike Devlin, Kaplan is a brilliant writer; I was flabbergasted by some of his exquisite turns of phrase. Unlike Devlin, Kaplan is blessedly concise.I will close on a positive note: Devlin does seem to have a solid grip on Chomskys work, and that is no mean feat. Devlins quickie exposition on Chomskian deep structure is one of the few clear presentations I have encountered."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"I feel like a fool.

After all, it's a fairly new part of human behavior - having been around maybe 10,000 years - that we all can do, at least a bit, and the rest of the animal kingdom can't, at least as far as we know.Devlin's the first mathematician I know of who's looked deeply into this subject using recent research in the area; he's done a great job fitting the available data to a theory that starts to answer the question, how it is we can do mathematics?First, though, you have to understand what mathematics really is. Devlin's definition is the &quot;science of patterns&quot; and he explains clearly and convincingly why it's the right one.His premise, roughly, is that however we acquired language, and he stays mostly on the sidelines of the heated debates about that, mathematical ability came along for the ride. His reasoning is that &quot;off-line reasoning&quot; is an essentially equivalent to language, as you can't have one without the other, and that this plus some other abilities, such as a number sense and spatial reasoning, give us the ability to do mathematics.He then explains why so many of us find the subject difficult. A simplified version is that we use language mainly to talk about interpersonal relationships. In a word, gossip. Note he's not claiming this to have been the purpose for it's development, just that it's what we mostly do with it now. And we're very good at gossiping. In fact, it's so easy we consider it to be a form of relaxation. To Devlin, you need to have the same kind of relationship with mathematical objects in order to be able to work with them.The book's greatest strength, to my mind, is its gathering of results in cognitive psychology into a coherently developed thesis regarding the origins of mathematical ability. It's a worthy contribution to the discussion, even if the theory proposed is completely wrong, as it may well be. Devlin's open and clear about it being highly speculative.I do have quibbles, but they're just that. Its major weakness, if the book can be said to have any, is that it doesn't make much by the way of predictions based on his theory, which would make it far more convincing. But this is a terrific starting point for other work."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"&quot;The Math Gene&quot; presents a theory of how mathematical ability and language are related, and how they might have evolved. Devlin starts by separating &quot;number sense&quot; from mathematical ability. Many animals as well as humans can estimate the quantity of something; rats can be taught to press a lever about sixteen times to get a reward. The &quot;about&quot; is significant though; it's an estimate, not an exact count, as far as the rats are concerned. So if number sense and mathematical ability are not the same, what else is needed for mathematics? Devlin lists eight other attributes, including algorithmic ability, a sense of cause and effect, and relational reasoning ability.Then there's a fairly long discussion of mathematics from the inside--are mathematician's brains different? What is it mathematicians do?--including a moderately detailed description of the basics of mathematical groups. I think Devlin does this to provide non-mathematicians with a sense of what mathematics is about, to make the rest of the book more plausible. This section is well-written and fluent, but I found myself getting a little impatient for the meat of his argument, which comes in the last half of the book. I suspect any reader with a good mathematics background would react the same way.The next piece of the argument is to demonstrate that language is unlikely to have developed solely as a result of evolutionary pressure towards communication. This is a subtle point I haven't seen made before, but Devlin (who acknowledges his debts to other workers in this area) makes the case quite convincing. In summary: apart from extremely simple messages like &quot;Danger!&quot; and &quot;Mammoth here&quot; you can't communicate what you don't have a mental representation of. The evolution of communication can't have driven representation; it must have always lagged a half-step behind. So mental representation must have evolved first. I am not doing this argument justice here, but Devlin buttresses it well.The inference is that language is simply a natural but lucky result of our ability to represent the world in our minds. Devlin's key point, however, is that since mathematics is essentially the ability to construct and work with increasingly abstract representations, the same mental changes that gave rise to language have also given rise to mathematics. His conclusion is that we all have the ability to do mathematics: there is no &quot;math gene&quot; except in the same way there is a &quot;language gene&quot;: it's universal.As a side note, not critical to his main argument, he points out that the most likely reason for the growth of representational ability in human brains was to foster understanding of other humans in the group; to encourage a sense of group-ness. For a creature that was more effective in group actions (e.g. hunting) there would have been a strong evolutionary advantage to having an emotional investment in the success of the group. Hence much of the early use of this ability would have been to represent others in the group; when language was added, it would have enabled people to talk about each other. In Devlin's words, &quot;Having arisen as a side-effect of off-line thinking, language was immediately hijacked to facilitate gossip.&quot; (Off-line thinking is used to mean representational thinking that doesn't result in or from actions in the immediate environment.)Two particular items in the book are worth mentioning. One is a followup to some famous experiments done by child psychologist Piaget in the 1930's. Piaget thought he'd demonstrated that children don't acquire a fully-developed number sense till around six years old. More recent work has demonstrated that children are much smarter than Piaget realized: there was a subtle and fascinating methodological flaw in Piaget's experiment. The second item is a little test of logical reasoning, presented with four cards on a table. Even mathematicians, who will probably get the test right, may be surprised at the coda to the test, which forms one of the few methods of direct verification of Devlin's claim that everyone can do mathematics.The case is well-argued, but one problem with theories like these is that there *are* so few ways of finding out if they're true. &quot;The Math Gene&quot; is reminiscent of Julian Jaynes' &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; in this way; a fascinating argument that we may never be able to test. However, it's thought-provoking and plausible, and left me, at least, convinced of its likely truth."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"The Math Gene is a wonderful insight into mathematics and how humans may have evolved the ability for mathematical thought. Dr Devlin gives a powerful argument for his theory in three parts. He begins with an explanation of the nature of mathematics, and dispells many misconceptions about math held by people outside of the mathematics community. He then spends the bulk of his text describing the nature and evolution of language and communication in humans and their differences with animals in that respect. He explains what pressures in the environment would be necessary to cause an evolutionary change in language and thought in a way that is understandable by a layperson and plausable to someone with a strong scientific background. He ends his book with a comparison of the mind's mathematical and language processes, why language (particularly gossip) must have preceded mathematical thought, and why mathematical thought is a direct product of any consciousness capable of language.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and have recommended it to friends and colleages alike. I would also recommend another one of Devlin's books, The Language of Mathematics, for a glimpse into the diverse and beautiful world of math any person could understand and appreciate."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"This is a book from a well-known and respected popular science writer and mathematician, Professor Keith Devlin, on a very intriguing question: how and why did people acquire the skill of doing mathematics. Unfortunately, many readers will probably still be looking for more after finishing this one.Devlin starts with our sense for numbers. Not all numbers are the same: we instantly recognize one or two objects; beyond that number, we have to count them. But counting itself is not yet mathematics. So what is mathematics? Devlin fancies the answer that it is a science of patterns, and spends a whole chapter on what he really means by the extended concept of pattern. In order to describe abstract patterns, mathematics has developed a specialized language. So is it possible to learn anything about mathematics from what the linguists have already learned about the generalized structural grammar, underlying every known language? How did the full language - with grammar - evolve at all from the &quot;momma hungry&quot; protolanguage? And why?The above arguments pose a grandiose ouverture for Devlin's thesis, which we are finally ready for in the second-but-last chapter: in order to be able to plan and predict, human ancestors have some 300.000 years ago developed what Devlin calls &quot;off-line&quot; thinking. With off-line thinking came grammar and language. Language is, and always was, used predominantly to build the &quot;team spirit&quot; among humans, or, with other words, for gossip. Mathematicians can avoid one unnecessary level of abstractions if they visualize the entities they are working with. So for them, doing mathematics is like gossiping. Well, sort of.And that is it. The book is actually quite a pleasant read, with lots of interesting stuff. On the other hands, Devlin drags us on and around general linguistics and the evolution of speech and God knows what else before getting to the promised topic. The final thesis comes then rather unculminating. On the plus side, Devlin is fair at citing books and articles he had learned from. I wish I could say the same about some other popular science authors."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"The author presents a carefully crafted theory of how language developed in humans, and links our innate mathematical abilities to this skill with language. Although his position is that everybody has some level of mathematical skill beyond number sense, he never really addresses in detail why some people have an aptitude for math and others don't, other than to mention the mathematician's ability to cope with abstraction.This is the second book by Devlin I've read, and I'm impressed by his boldness in escorting the reader through difficult mental terrain. If you find the topic of language development interesting, and you're willing to exert some mental effort to keep up with his arguments, you'll find this book a thought-provoking read. However if you want to know why high-school algebra gave you such trouble, you'll have to look elsewhere for the answer."},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"In the book The Math Gene, author Keith Devlin stated that math is just a special use of our language faculty and every one should be able to do math.

Chapter 4 is not bad, especially when he cited the research on animal coating, it is really interesting that the coating of a leopard could be generated by solving math equations. Other examples are also very interesting.In chapter 5, the author talked about math thinking. It is abstract thinking. Then he used the house metaphor to compare it with daily life. Make it simple to understand for the readers. He also talked about the high concentration you need in doing math problems, this kind of concentration is very hard for ordinary people who are busy worrying about their daily life. And that&iexcl;s one of major hurdle preventing most people from being good at math. This chapter is quite good.Again chapter 6 and 7 is a bit uninteresting. It talked about what language is.

Most people have trouble with math, and are delighted when they don't have to figure out any more when two trains are going to collide or pass each other. Personally, I always liked problems, so I found math interesting. My friends always thought that was one of my more peculiar characteristics.Dean Keith Devlin deplores the fact that the way math (that which we learn after arithmetic is mastered) is taught obscures access to the most interesting parts of the subject. I agree with him on that. In this book, he tries to take away some of the fog for the reader by showing you thought processes that mathematicians use in some simple situations and problems that most people can grasp. These examples are nicely designed to build on one another, so you get a cumulative learning experience from them of how a mathematician may think. The &quot;nested&quot; design of the examples was impressive to me as an author.This book is for those who think of themselves as nonmathematical and want to understand more about why they experience a weak skill set in that way. Mathematicians will probably find the book much too elementary to be interesting, except as a model of how to explain mathematics to the lay person. Those who study mind development will find the book full of logical proofs, but modest insight.The author also tries to build a plausible scenario for how mathematical ability developed in primitive humans. I applaud his ambition. His speculations are interesting, but certainly did not persuade me. I think his problem was that he did not look far enough into the scientific research on how we learn.Everyone has problems with something where we have no experience. As David Ingvar pointed out, we simply draw a blank until we can create experience in that area or connect to an existing experience. To help people learn, give them experience in the new thing that is structured to be connected to some familiar thing. This point is made indirectly by an example Dean Devlin provides: Children who have trouble doing simple arithmetic can make change perfectly well. The best educational techniques create simulations that encourage this approach focused in relevant experiences. Unfortunately, those who teach math are mostly immune to using this method. Higher math is taught in the way that makes it most difficult to understand -- as abstractions unconnected to other math or ordinary situations and people. You will often &quot;feel&quot; an underlying unity in math, but I never had a teacher who addressed it. The closest I came was in a calculus class where we wrote software programs to solve problems. Putting a virtually infinite set of rectangles together and adding their areas to approach the answer for the area under the curve was fascinating and useful to me.The other problem with his arguments about the origins of mathematical ability is that he concentrates on the &quot;formal proof&quot; parts of this thinking which are conscious. Many people report that math for them is more unconscious and intuitive. I am one of those people. I can see the solution in a nonverbal, nonmathematical form. After I know the answer, then I sit down and painstakingly translate it into formal proofs. But that is merely for communication purposes. It doesn't help me at all. I was not surprised that Dean Devlin sees conscious mathematical thinking as being like language -- because that's the exact same purpose it serves. The more important question of how mathematical insight can be developed is not really addressed, as I understood the book. Dean Devlin alludes to those moments of inspiration, but doesn't tie them into his main themes. I suspect that &quot;knowing&quot; the answer in this unconscious way is much like &quot;knowing&quot; where to throw a rock to hit something, an example that Dean Devlin uses.Reading this book made me realize that there are many disciplines where I do not understand the fundamental thought processes involved. Perhaps that is true of you, too. Since we often rely on other people to help us in these areas, we cannot hope to understand their advice if we do not understand the mental processes for how they arrive at that advice. I suggest that you and I start spending some time over lunch and drinks getting some more understanding of medicine, engineering, pscyhology, and teaching in this same way from professionals in those disciplines. I suspect we will be greatly helped by what we learn.Peer out from the other person's mind from time to time to see more!"},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","review":"In the book The Math Gene, author Keith Devlin stated that math is just a special use of our language faculty and every one should be able to do math.

I'm sure the title was chosen by someone in order to try and sell more copies. The book is really about why humans have the ability to do mathematics when there was no initial evolutionary advantage for a species to be able to do math. The hypothesis of the author is that humans evolved the ability to use language about 100,000 years ago and that a side effect of language is that we developed the ability to interact with a virtual world inside our own minds in addition to interacting with external stimuli as all animal do. By a happy chance, this means that we can interact with a self constructed world of mathematics. The book is quite solid and some people may find this boring or tedious, but a good argument is presented. I believe it might also be possible to read the book cover to cover and miss the main point.Honestly, some people may buy this book based upon the title and not get what they expect.

There are some good computer-generated images which look like photos.Unfortunately his argumentation is lacking and he simply states ideas without argumentation as if they were facts. For instance, he says that the reason arithmetic tables are difficult to learn is that the same numbers recur in different contexts. Inasmuch as arithmetic tables are difficult to learn, the problem lies in the fact that they must be learnt by rote and the quantity of information exceeds that most people can hold in short-term memory. The standard Hitch-Badeley model of memory explains this quite clearly.He does not come to much of a clear answer as to why some people seem unable to learn maths, but it is really very simple. Those of us who can do maths have learnt it by understanding what it means. Those who cannot try to memorise what they are they are being told. This is a self-propelling bad habit since the failure it engenders pushes people to take what appears to be the easiest line of action, i.e. to memorise the material without challenging it. The process of thinking about it is also self-propelling since the more understanding one already has, the easier it is to add more information. The two groups of people (those who can and those who can't do maths) thus become discrete.It is possible to switch from one group to the other, but simply doing more exercises and practice will not serve this purpose. How to do it is another story.Devlin has written an interesting, readable book which unfortunately fails to address the central question.P.s.

This systematic approach is a great way to compare and contrast the clothes, climate, flora, and activities of the seasons, yet it is never boring or repetitive: Anne Rockwell's pictures switch from wide angle to close up perspectives and this adds an unexpected twist.

Part of the reason is because as the title indicates it is about the causes of the American Revolution rather than of the Revolutionary War, not that England was going to let the colonies go their own way. But I also remember studying American history every other year in grade school and never getting beyond the American Revolution. Since I think everybody had a similar educational experience my assumption was that Richard M. Strum's book would be covering ground that is already adequately dealt with in your standard history textbook.Strum begins by introducing his young readers to sixteen Notable Figures, from John and Samuel Adams to George Washington. Included in the list are not only key Founding Fathers such as Benjamin Franklin and Patrick Henry, but also the British commander Thomas Gage and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend. I think the British side could be better represented, but when Strum includes John Dickinson and Isaac Sears in his roster I am impressed that he is clearly getting beyond the really big names. The book's first chapter is devoted to the events of April 19, 1775, namely the clash between British regulars and colonial minutemen on Lexington and Concord. Strum touches on the events that precipitated \\"the shot heard round the world,\\" but that is only a prelude to the rest of the volume.The second chapter looks at Britain's American Colonies in terms of why Englishmen came to the new world, what they found here, and the relationship that was established between the colonies and the crown. Although this begins with the importance of tobacco as a crop, it ends with Franklin's proposal for a \\"Grand Council,\\" which was the first time the idea of the 13 separate colonies working together was advanced. The French and Indian War is the subject of the third chapter, and while it provides a superb and concise account of the war, the only key points that relate to the topic here is that Great Britain and France like to fight each other, and that getting the colonies to pay for this war was pivotal in setting the revolution in motion.Overall the fourth chapter looking at Britain's Parliament vs. the Colonial Legislatures is the key one in the book as Strum looks at the series of acts and responses that went back and forth across the Atlantic, leading to the Growing Tensions detailed in the fifth chapter. This short chapter looks more specifically at the militant clashes between the two sides, whereas the previous chapter was concerned with legislation and political action. After the detailed look at the French and Indian War, Strum's treatment of The American War of Independence is extremely brief, boiling down the conflict to a few paragraphs. What is more important are the last few paragraphs where Strum makes the argument that the split was inevitable and emphasizes how the impact of what happened extended well beyond North America, inspiring directly or indirectly the revolutions that followed and established republican governments throughout the world.\\"Causes of the American Revolution\\" does a good job of detailing the key events that led to this particular war, although I also think that the importance of these chapters to advancing that thesis are somewhat uneven as noted above. It is a great looking book, taking advantage of Independence National Historical Park and the Architect of the Capitol as resources. In the back of the book teachers and young students will find a Chronology of key events from the establishment of Jamestown in 1607 to the Treaty of Paris formally ending the American Revolution in 1783. A two-page Glossary defines key terms from \\"cash crop\\" to \\"tidewater,\\" while the next spread lists books for not only students (e.g., Janis Herbert's \\"The American Revolution for Kids: A History with 21 Activities\\") but also older readers (e.g., Gordon S.

Get it!"},{"Title":"Williams-Sonoma Essentials Of Roasting Recipes and Techniques for Delicious Oven-Cooked Meals","review":"This book I one of about 4 I have ordered in the last week and I just got it today. Some details about roasting, but even better some recipes that are varied and somewhat more simple with ingredients than some of the other books I have ordered. Thats ok too........ I have ordered several books on maybe one particular topic like roasting, some will be more detailed about the equipment and various techniques and some have recipes that are more detailed and maybe slightly complicated because they involve cooking with wines or some ingredients that I don't normally use. Adding this book to the stack makes it perfect. For a beginner cook just starting to learn to roast this is a perfect book and I would highly recommend it. I like the color pictures this book displays. I was really impressed with this book as sometimes Williams Sonoma books can be more for the fancier chefs or professionals where this one fits my style perfect. Recipes using spices that will be an easy find and most don't require a lot of cooking with different types of wines. This is just what I was looking for and can't wait to try some of the recipes out. I can master these and move on to some of the other books about roasting that I have purchased!!!!"},{"Title":"Williams-Sonoma Essentials Of Roasting Recipes and Techniques for Delicious Oven-Cooked Meals","review":"My mom wanted a cookbook for her roasting pan for Christmas and this book has tons of great recipes and looks like it is going to be great. I am excited about giving it to her."},{"Title":"Piggy's Belly Button","review":"I agree with the other two posts so far. I would argue that if one is hoping to use this book as an example of a moral lesson, to seek out other books. The \\"moral\\" of the story (to listen to your mother) does not turn out to be a lesson but rather just a silly notion for smiles, only. I do wonder what my 2.5 year old must make of Piggy pushing his belly button and essentially \\"blowing out\\" his back side... but it's ridiculousness gives readers of all ages a giggle.I would agree that it isn't clear to the reader (by the cover) that one shouldn't push the button straight away. Another parent showed me this book and what was the FIRST thing I wanted to do, but..... PUSH THE BUTTON. (There is something innately funny in that to me, being an &lt;ahem> adult!) I do like that with a little parental guidance (and a child able to grasp the concept of delayed gratification) that through reading this book, a child can learn about the concept of storytelling and the joys of reading."},{"Title":"Piggy's Belly Button","review":"As a child therapist and grandmother, I am always looking for children's books that will attract and maintain the interest of children. This one is a winner. After more readings than I can count, my two-year-old granddaughter stills asks for the \\"piggy book\\" first. Reading this book to a child is a most rewarding experience. The brief story is about a pig who is dying to find out what will happen if he pushes his belly button and the illustrations are delightful. Pictures of the animal characters who answer Piggy's question allow the reader to assume different \\"funny\\" voices. The \\"suspense\\" that builds after each animal speaks, increases the child's enjoyment, and this process becomes a wonderful ritual for child and reader to share. I can delay the final \\"surprise\\" by simply holding my finger over the \\"back\\" of the belly button and the suspense this causes seems to be part of what my granddaughter enjoys most. Games and stories that build suspense have developmental value in teaching children frustration tolerance and object permanence, but I would never recommend a book based on this criterion alone. Piggy's Belly Button is pure fun and I can't imagine not having this book available for toddlers and preschoolers."},{"Title":"Piggy's Belly Button","review":"Don\`t get me wrong, I\`m a fan of both the author and illustrator of \\"the wide-mouthed frog\\"--an excellent book. I still like the illustrations of this book as well, and the author pointing out that some animals have belly buttons and some don\`t (and some are hard to find!) made me chuckle.(Makes you think for a second, there...how many occassions do you have to ponder over the belly button of a chicken--or it\`s lack of one?! Interesting way to introduce the concept of mammals.)The part I thought was disappointing, however, was the way the book was constructed. I could just see a little one from the get-go wanting to push \\"the title character\\" from the very first page. Unless the reader had their hand firmly covering a particular place on the back cover (and be ready for a game of push and shove throughout the read-aloud), the \\"surprise end\\"ing would be revealed from the very beginning. It was if the publisher was trying to save money by keeping pages to a minimum, looking at the way the back cover is laid out and how the \\"pop-out\\" piece appears on it. The novelty of the book is lost that way, I\`m afraid; the surprise is not contained inside the book, or at least camouflaged in some way. The pig barely has a change in reaction to what has happened as well--he seems to be distracted by all the print at the lower corner of the book (which includes the publisher\`s logo and website, safety-testing info., etc.).The author seemed to be going for a definite moral to the story (\\"Listen to what your mommy tells you\\"), but it also left me wondering, \\"Is that it?\\" It\`s more along the lines of \\"If you don\`t do what Mommy tells you, the bogeyman is going to get you\\", which is entertaining, but is an odd \\"lesson\\" to be learned if it\`s supposed to be a parable of sorts. Curiosity can be a good thing, and the same with asking questions, so what has Piggy learned after all? If it\`s \\"Don\`t let your curiosity get the better of you,\\" I think it could have been brought to a stronger conclusion, both in writing and illustration; the story seemed to be cut off a bit abruptly to me, right with the piggy\`s \\"ending\\"."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"David Ferry's translation is simply undeservedly popular and is absolutely NOT the best Horace in English currently in print!I defy anyone to find Ferry's Horace superior to the wonderfully readable translation done recently by Sidney Alexander and published in Princeton University Press's Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation. Richard Howard, translator extraordinaire himself, has written a short Preface for the volume, in which he compares a passage from Alexander's work to other versions of the same passage done by Pound, Michie, and Burton Raffel, and Howard justly judges that Alexander's is the &quot;far superior text.&quot;Ferry's language is too often simply muddled, the syntax unclear. Do yourself a great favor, buy the Sidney Alexander translation, and you'll be rewarded with a vastly more enjoyable reading experience!"},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"I wanted to like this translation after all the nice things that D.S. Carne-Ross said about it in the useful and enjoyable \\"Horace in English.\\" But this is a translation that is made more for image-by-image accuracy than for the ear. Often you read Ferry describing the right word rather than saying it. (Phrases like \\"too unrestrainedly joyful in good fortune\\" read like a dictionary entries.) In the difficult-to-render i.5 he ends up phrasing things like Yoda - \\"Hapless are they enamored of that beauty.\\" Too academic are they who write as this one."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"These new translations of the Odes capture the freshness and ingenuity of the originals. For readers of Latin, they offer a companionable appreciation that recreates the thrill of direct encounter with the originals. For any reader, the translations convey the excitement of penetrating the puzzles of the Latin to discover the edginess of Rome's predominant lyric innovator.Horace invented the short meditative form that dominates twenty-first century poetry. He was also one of the first important figures in the Western literary tradition to speak as a whole person and not merely as a representative of his social group or as a disembodied conduit of human feeling. Kaimowitz's versions fully convey the specificity of Horace's human voice, getting over into English the surprising twists of his thought, and the strength of his view of life.The translations manage to do this by following the inner course of each poem on several levels. No English counterpart can faithfully recreate the sentence structure of the originals. The highly inflected nature of the Latin language renders the position of a word in a sentence unnecessary in determining its grammatical role. Horace uses the consequent flexibility of his language to multiply the nuances of a sentence, for example, by allowing an adjective to precede by several lines the noun it modifies, or again by withholding the verb of a sentence for a long delayed appearance, leaving the much earlier encountered subject and object of the sentence in suspense.Kaimowitz takes aim at the resulting subtlety and relentlessly follows Horace's underlying message, by imitating the order in which elements of his thought are displayed in the original, and by devising equivalents that stretch the grammatical and structural possibilities of English but nevertheless achieve a rare grace of their own.The inward sense of the originals is also partly conveyed by the fidelity of these translations to the metrical shape of the Latin poems. Horace was himself borrowing meters from the already centuries-old Greek lyric tradition. It is fitting that these translations strive to accomplish a metrical revival like Horace's own. In the process, they take on a compact, burnished look like that of the poems they stand for."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"I bought this at the same time as Michie's translation and prefer the latter. Ferry does a decent job of capturing the simplest level of the poems readably and easily, but the subtlety and deeper levels of the originals seem to be missing.For someone wanting the Latin texts, however, this book might be a good buy, since the poems are attractively presented, each starting on a fresh page, in a pleasant typeface."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"Amazon has clearly mixed up the reviews for two different translations of Horace! I have read the Kaimowitz translation and have heard a reading of the tranlation; it is lovely. The author attempts to make the English translation have the same feeling and tone as the original Latin and succeeds admirably, according to my friends who know the poems in the original Latin. What I admire is the intimacy between the reader and Horace that the author has managed to create. I feel as if the span of centuries has been bridged and I have entered Horace's world, evesdropping on his conversation. Amazon does an injustice to this edition by muddling the ratings and reviews with a less-liked translation by another author."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"No doubt that a command of Greek and Roman mythology adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of Horace's Odes but in many cases the context explains the reference. Horace's commonplace themes are deeply imbedded in our culture and he illuminates them with uncommon insight and poetry: love is cruel, seize the day, greed wants more, death equalizes, happy the one who wants nothing, don't be beguiled by past success, luck changes, accept your place, beauty fades, death comes, money can't buy peace, a friend is our other half. I love Horace the man, the Odes and the Ferry translation which brings a contemporary idiom to the poems without seeming contrived."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"Horace's odes are particularly difficult to translate because the poet modulates his tone, the emotional registers of his voice, and the speed of his verse suddenly and dramatically. Ferry's translations above all capture these swift changes in Horace's voice, providing the English versions that best reproduce the remarkable range of Horace's style."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"This is one of the worst translations of any book in any language I've ever come across. You'll never understand the harmony, grace, and beauty of Horace from Ferry's translation. He often just makes up entire phrases and throws in unnecessary filler, or he'll eliminate poetically necessary words and phrases that might help you understand Horace's artistic intent. Even worse, his English is awkward, wordy, unmusical, or just plain meaningless.For example, let's take the first stanza of Ode 1.38 \\"To his Slave.\\"Here's the Latin:Persicos odi, puer, apparatus,displicent nexae philyra coronaemitte sectari rosa quo locorumsera moretur.Here's Ferry's horrible and wildly inaccurate translation:I dislike elaborate show, as, for example,\\"Persian\\" garlands too intricately woven,So don't go looking everywhere for somewhereWhere the last-blooming rose anywhere might be.Here's good crib from Michael Gilleland that I found on his excellent \\"Odes of Horace\\" website. This translation actually captures what Horace is saying:Boy, I dislike Persian finery;garlands sewn with bast displease me;don't try to find out in what spot thelate-blooming rose lingers.Notice the difference? Horace doesn't say, \\"I dislike elaborate show, as, for example, Persian garlands. . .\\". He says, \\"Boy, I dislike Persian finery.\\" Horace doesn't say, \\"garlands too intricately woven,\\" he says, \\"garlands sewn with bast.\\" (The word \\"philyra\\" actually means the inner bark of the Linden tree.)And I think anyone with an ear for English poetry would recoil in horror from Ferry's last two lines. \\"So don't go looking everywhere for somewhere where the last-blooming rose anywhere might be.\\" This is one of the most ungainly and graceless English sentences I've ever encountered, and it's not even within a stone's throw of the Latin. The Latin \\"sera\\" mean \\"late,\\" not \\"last,\\" and nowhere in the Latin will you find \\"everywhere, anywhere, somewhere,\\" all of which are ugly, superfluous, and jarring. Ferry takes a perfectly simple and lovely Latin phrase of seven words and turns it into a complicated, inharmonious paragraph of 15 words that makes you recoil in pain.The last half of this poem is even more poorly written and inaccurate, as are the rest of his translations. If you love Horace or are trying to learn Latin, do not buy this book. If you have it, throw it away. Buy the Loeb Horace--it is infintely better. Better yet, buy \\"Horace Fully Parsed, Word by Word.\\" This is the best book around to really help you understand Horace's intricate beauty and poetic magic. It's on Amazon. Too bad Ferry (whoever he is), didn't use it. He obviously can't read Latin, and he can barely write in English."},{"Title":"The Odes of Horace,","review":"This is another unreadable (and incomprehensible) translation of Horace.

I supposed I shouldn't have been...after all James Bond is certainly as revered a character to the English as Superman is to Americans. That's why I really love Titan books! They have undertaken the daunting task of reprinting all of Bond's comic strip adventures into several volumes, each featuring two or three separate Bond stories. Readers will recognize many of the stories that were eventually adapted into film although there are many more which will no doubt be new to many Bond Fans.Now, the first time I ever went to a drive-in movie was around 1970 when I was eight years old. My parents load me and my older brothers up in the family station wagon and we went to see a bond triple feature of Dr. No, Goldfinger, and From Russia with Love. Bond films probably were not ideal for an eight year old with their complex plots but even at that age I knew this was a character much different than I had ever seen before. Dr. No remains one of my all-time favorite Bond pictures.This volume titled \\"Dr. No\\" features that story, along with \\"Diamonds are Forever\\" and \\"From Russia with Love\\". In the bibliography section I would be somewhat surprised again to see that the chronology of the comic strip adaptations differed quite a bit from the film. While the film version of \\"Diamonds\\" didn't arrive until nine years after Dr. No, it actually appeared before in the comic strip version.In Dr. No, Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of two operatives. The mystery seems to center on the mysterious Chinese Dr. No, who owns Crab Key Island where he has made a fortune selling sea bird guano to be used as fertilizer, but Bond would soon find out that the he has far more sinister goals. Dr. No has developed technology that allows him to divert American missiles fired from a nearby missile base, and sending them to other targets. It's a technology that his Russian customers would love to get their hands on. Bond must find a way to escape No's gauntlet of death and stop the mad man, and rescue Honey Ryder all at the same time.The story has everything that has made Bond so popular over the years: an evil madman, ruthless henchmen, a diabolical plot, and a beautiful yet resourceful damsel. The art of John Mclusky is perfectly suited to these stories as it has a very cinematic feel to them, almost like reading finished storyboards. His art is crisp and his action sequences are deftly handled, not always an easy thing to do within the restrictions of a panel strip. It was just a superb story. This strip originally ran from May 1960 to October 1960.The other stories are wonderful as well; particularly Diamonds are Forever which I've also always liked as a film. Bond is sent to the states to bust up a diamond smuggling ring and ends up in Las Vegas involved with the deadly Spangled Mob.These Bond comic strip collections are just fantastic, especially to those of us who have never read them before and most of this material is being re-printed for the first time in decades. The books also contain a number of well-written articles on Bond history. Kudos to Titan Books for reprinting these classic comic strips!Reviewed By Tim Janson"},{"Title":"James Bond: Dr. No","review":"Please see my reviews of the other Titan Bond collections.

It is a combination of Beaches and the movie, &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;The book kept me wondering what was going to happen next and whether Sunny was going to be able to escape her delusional world, and I was not disappointed. Iris Dart did an excellent job describing the ups and downs of a person living with a mental illness and at the same time bringing her character to life by giving her likable and at times disturbing attributes. Iris Dart painted a realistic picture of the difficulties of living with a mental illness, especially the problems with noncompliance.The only thing that I wish she had added in her book is the real side effects of the drugs that a mentally ill person must cope with, like the symptoms of parkinson's disease, such as the shakes and permanent neurological damage from long-term use of anti-psychotic drugs. Other than that, Iris Dart left a positive impression on the relationships and struggles a person with a mental illness has to cope with on a daily basis.As always, I look forward to reading all of Iris Dart's books over and over and I look forward in anticipation for her next book."},{"Title":"Some Kind of Miracle LP","review":"&quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot; was really good.

It is more a series of one-chapter stories and anecdotes about how Christ has changed the hearts and lives of Korean believers than an integrated story.My only two complaints are that it could use a little more connectedness between incidents, and it could provide a little more biographical information about the author, since he is a participant in several of the events. Otherwise, it is a fine book.The book includes episodes from the period of Japanese occupation through the end of the Korean War. It includes many accounts of pastors who were imprisoned for their faith, martyrs, and others who suffered at the hands of the Japanese and North Korean armies.Readers should understand that the picture of Korea and of the Korean church which Campbell describes in the book is drastically different from the Korea and the Korean church of today. The society and the church have both gone through extensive changes in the last half-century, some positive, some not.Nevertheless, the book provides many inspiring tales of transformed lives which are lived solely for God's glory. It provides plenty of opportunity for the reader to do some soul-searching. And may it inspire other generations of Christians--in both the East and the West--to live for God in such a totally dedicated way.(Note: I used to have this review posted here anonymously, but I recently pulled it and re-posted it as a signed review.)"},{"Title":"Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante","review":"Ben Sem, Ben Sem--We are, We are Beatrice. Not knowing or understanding much of Dante, I can nevertheless not forget what Charles Williams wrote about him, as about the above quotation from The Divine Comedy. Dante's heaven-sent guide announces \\"we are,\\" not \\"I am Beatrice,\\" speaking in unity with the Cloud of Witnesses, the testimony of the saints and out of the relationship of the divine life which is realized in heaven.But Williams could almost say \\"We are Charles Williams,\\" because he somehow seems to be such a kindred soul with Dante, and so attuned to the poet's thought that the effect of hearing or reading him on Dante was and is magnetic--so much so that Dorothy L. Sayers taught herself Italian and translated Dante's Divine Comedy in three volumes for Penguin Books (the Paradiso was completed by her student, Barbara Reynolds). Sayers dedicated her translations to \\"Charles Williams, The Master of the Ways.\\" The Ways referred to are the way of rejection and the way of affirmation, two sorts of spiritual paths explained in this, and many other Williams volumes.But she was not the only one to so lionize CW. C.S.Lewis wrote similarly in his Preface to Paradise Lost that Williams had revolutionized Milton criticism. Apparently the door was unlocked all the time, Lewis wryly notes, but only you (CW) thought of trying the handle. Who else did this supposedly obscure and unremarkable British writer influence? How about Canadian poet and singer Bruce Cockburn in his albums Dancing in the Dragon Jaws and Humans (the latter often considered one of his best albums)?If Charles Williams did have a fault as a writer, it was that he tended to write too telegraphically, almost in a kind of shorthand, assuming his readers were with him when some of them, at least, would be lost. This happens in The Forgiveness of Sins, which assumes a good grasp of Shakespeare, and He Came Down From Heaven, which assumes a good grasp on everything else. Some of his essays do this also, particularly his book reviews, which assume that in reading the review one has also read the book. His reviews of some writers, however, such as D.H. Lawrence, and for that matter, St. Augustine, are so lively and unforgettable that they have long outlived their time. Of his nonfiction works, The Descent of the Dove (subtitled a History of the Holy Spirit in the Church) and The Figure of Beatrice flow the best and assume the least. Oddly enough, you can read the latter knowing nothing about Dante and the former knowing nothing about the Holy Spirit and learn a lot about both. Better yet, you learn a lot about Williams. Once one has met him, his trademark style is unmistakeable and for readers like me who have fallen under his spell, greatly compelling. There is no other writer like Charles WIlliams and no better place to meet him than in The Figure of Beatrice."},{"Title":"Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante","review":"This is a classic study of Dante's _Divine Comedy_, by Charles Williams, who was, among other things, a close friend and colleague of J.R.R.

If one wants a solid critical interpretation of Dante's masterpiece from the neo-Romantic (and commitedly Christian) perspective of mid-century Oxford medievalist scholars, there is no better book. It's clearly written by a fellow who knows his stuff-- and it has been a major influence on how others (especially other Oxfordian Christians) have viewed the Commedia. (Those folks familiar with Dorothy Sayers' translations of Dante know that all of her notes and comments are pretty much cribbed wholesale from Williams...) Still, this book was written a half-century ago, and many of its assumptions, approaches, and insights seem a bit old-fashioned-- and there are a lot of new perspectives and questions in Dante scholarship that it just doesn't discuss at all. Nevertheless, it remains an insightful study that offers astute insight into Dante's art, and though dated in some ways, it is by no means outdated."},{"Title":"Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante","review":"Ben Sem, Ben Sem--We are, We are Beatrice. Not knowing or understanding much of Dante, I can nevertheless not forget what Charles Williams wrote about him, as about the above quotation from The Divine Comedy. Dante's heaven-sent guide announces &quot;we are,&quot; not &quot;I am Beatrice,&quot; speaking in unity with the Cloud of Witnesses, the testimony of the saints and out of the relationship of the divine life which is realized in heaven.But Williams could almost say &quot;We are Charles Williams,&quot; because he somehow seems to be such a kindred soul with Dante, and so attuned to the poet's thought that the effect of hearing or reading him on Dante was and is magnetic--so much so that Dorothy L. Sayers taught herself Italian and translated Dante's Divine Comedy in three volumes for Penguin Books (the Paradiso was completed by her student, Barbara Reynolds). Sayers dedicated her translations to &quot;Charles Williams, The Master of the Ways.&quot; The Ways referred to are the way of rejection and the way of affirmation, two sorts of spiritual paths explained in this, and many other Williams volumes.But she was not the only one to so lionize CW. C.S.Lewis wrote similarly in his Preface to Paradise Lost that Williams had revolutionized Milton criticism. Apparently the door was unlocked all the time, Lewis wryly notes, but only you (CW) thought of trying the handle. Who else did this supposedly obscure and unremarkable British writer influence? How about Canadian poet and singer Bruce Cockburn in his albums Dancing in the Dragon Jaws and Humans (the latter often considered one of his best albums)?If Charles Williams did have a fault as a writer, it was that he tended to write too telegraphically, almost in a kind of shorthand, assuming his readers were with him when some of them, at least, would be lost. This happens in The Forgiveness of Sins, which assumes a good grasp of Shakespeare, and He Came Down From Heaven, which assumes a good grasp on everything else. Some of his essays do this also, particularly his book reviews, which assume that in reading the review one has also read the book. His reviews of some writers, however, such as D.H. Lawrence, and for that matter, St. Augustine, are so lively and unforgettable that they have long outlived their time. Of his nonfiction works, The Descent of the Dove (subtitled a History of the Holy Spirit in the Church) and The Figure of Beatrice flow the best and assume the least. Oddly enough, you can read the latter knowing nothing about Dante and the former knowing nothing about the Holy Spirit and learn a lot about both. Better yet, you learn a lot about Williams. Once one has met him, his trademark style is unmistakeable and for readers like me who have fallen under his spell, greatly compelling. There is no other writer like Charles WIlliams and no better place to meet him than in The Figure of Beatrice."},{"Title":"Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante","review":"In The Figure of Beatrice, Charles Williams does two things. First, he provides the reader with an overview of Dante's major poetic works: The Vita Nuova, the Convivio and the Divine Comedy. For anyone who has not read Dante before, Williams provides an excellent introduction. Readers already familiar with Dante will find Williams's book full of insights for further reflection. Second, Williams takes Dante's use of the figure of Beatrice to illustrate how the affirmation of images can help us think about God. Athough Williams argues that both the affirmation and negation of images have valid roles in theology, he is clearly more drawn to the affirmative approach. This book is indispensable for any serious reader of Dante."},{"Title":"Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante","review":"There would have been no Dante without Beatrice. No Jesus without Mary.

But the reasons behind this idea were never sufficiently compelling to get the idea of vouchers taken seriously.That has begun to change and Viteritti's book is the most thorough and eloquent enunciation of the new raison d'etre behind school choice.Viteritti casts the question in terms of equality. Why should poor and minority children be so often forced to attend schools that perpetually fail to provide a good education?It's hard to answer that question. The best one can do is to complain that these schools can't do better because they are underfunded.But Viteritti and others show that the connection between funding and high achievement is conditional- unless the money is spent wisely, it will do no good. There are numerous examples of inner-city schools where per pupil funding is as high as it is in the suburbs. Yet, achievement remains very low.In light of this, it only seems reasonable to give those children who want to go elsewhere the opportunity to do so. There aren't enough seats in public schools, so private schools must become the outlets.It's a well written book and it makes a lot of sense. If you put the kids first instead of the schools and those employed there, you are liekly to come to the same conclusion as Viteritti."},{"Title":"Choosing Equality: School Choice, the Constitution, and Civil Society","review":"I support vouchers, but if I did not this book would not convince me to do so. It provides some interesting accounts of the history of school financing and of recent conflicts over vouchers, but it is difficult to have confidence in the accuracy of these accounts, because of the author's transparent bias. Studies and arguments that support Viteritti's conclusions are generally accepted at face value, while those counter to his conclusions are criticized at length or simply dismissed out of hand. The \\"good guys - bad guys\\" tenor of the writing if off-putting. Beyond this, the reasoning from empirical assumptions is often flawed. For example, he notes a decline in test scores among public school students over the years, and concludes from this that public schools are doing a worse job of educating students, ignoring alternative explanations -- for instance, that public school students increasingly come from home environments that impede their learning, as the number of children living in poverty and in single-parent homes has dramatically increased. But the largest problem with the book, in my view, is that while the author initially, and commendably, claims to have the welfare of poor children as his principal objective, for most of the book his primary concern is actually with the religious freedom of parents, and with not offending any parents by suggesting some might not be expert at choosing schools for their children. There is a good case to be made for state funding of private schooling, but I do not think this is it."},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs","review":"Simply put, this book is a must have for any Oracle DBA. Many new and advanced features within Oracle are implemented using PL/SQL. As an Oracle DBA, you must have a firm grasp of this powerful language and how to take advantage of features in Oracle10g that include:*) Security*) Auditing*) Encryption*) Optimizing Performance*) Automating Tasks*) SchedulingTo start, Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs provides a solid foundation of the PL/SQL language including syntax, data types, cursors, control logic, exception handling, abstract data types, procedures, functions, and packages. The introduction is well written and packed with many explanations and examples. The book continues further to describe in great detail the use of cursors and table functions in chapters 2 and 3.At this point, the Oracle DBA should have a firm understanding of the language and move on to more DBA-specific features that involve the use of PL/SQL. Chapter 4 explorers the fundamentals of encryption and how to implement advanced encryption techniques within Oracle. The chapter focuses on the use of the PL/SQL packages DBMS_CRYPTO (Oracle10g R1 and higher) and DBMS_OBFUSCATION_TOOLKIT (earlier releases prior to Oracle10g R1). Algorithms like DES and Triple DES along with other encryption fundamentals like hashing and key management are explained in easy to understand terms and illustrations.Chapter 5 is dedicated to Row-Level Security. The authors do a fantastic job of explaining policies and how they work. Once again, the extensive amount of accurate examples is what makes this chapter easy to understand and implement. Special attention is paid to the use of the PL/SQL package DBMS_RLS and using it to create policies and control user access. A special section is provided on troubleshooting common errors with row-level security along with how to interpret and resolve them.Chapter 6 explains the use of Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA). Like previous chapters, the authors lay the foundation for why, how, and when to use this powerful feature along with specifics to how it works with different Oracle releases. The DBA will learn just what is captured with FGA and how to customize it to their environment. FGA makes use of the PL/SQL procedure DBMS_FGA. Detailed examples are provided for creating and editing policies along with methods for administrating FGA.Chapter 7 deals with generating random numbers and how to take advantage of DBMS_RANDOM. Here you will find great explanations of how to check for randomness and following statistical patterns. Again, all of this is put together with accurate examples.Chapter 8 was my favorite - Scheduling. This chapter focuses on DBMS_SCHEDULER - Oracle10g's replacement for DBMS_JOB. Sections are also provided on how to prioritize jobs with the use of Database Resource Manager (DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER).I enjoyed this book from front to back. Very well thought out explanations, real world examples and illustrations."},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs","review":"I'm a working DBA but my exposure to PL/SQL has been light.

I was looking for a book on how to use PL/SQL to build tools and monitor my database. Instead this is another book on learning to write PL/SQL code. I guess you have to learn to write the code in order to build any tools, but the book just leaves off with learning the basics of writing the code."},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs","review":"It's no surprise that learning Oracle is one of the most challenging things to do for any person that works in the IT field. This massive database application has a long and storied history, becoming one of the de facto standards for storing database on massive scales. A huge chunk of the web is stored on Oracle systems, and it's a system that keeps growing and expanding over time.With the complexity involved, it's nice that a book like this has been written so that DBAs can quickly get their feet wet with Oracle and learn the ins and outs in an efficient manner. At a size of 400+ pages, this is a nice guide to learn the basics of becoming an experienced Oracle DBA. Containing 8 chapters that cover the basics, this book covers Oracle up to Database 10g Release 2. It's up to date, written well, and a perfect companion resource on any DBAs desk.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs","review":"While I'm still in the rather lenghty 1st chapter, I can state this book is just what I needed.

The basic plot of this novel is a private detective on the poverty line who has just got his suspended licence back is approached by a woman to find her father Charles Bradford. She has a clipping from a newspaper story with a photo of him living as a hobo amongst other homeless men who travel the freight trains for work. The case seems pretty simple but once at the train yards it becomes apparent that violence and murder may make finding Charles a lot harder and that secrets from the past will put a whole new spin on things.This is an excellent short fast and simple read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bindlestiff: A \\"Nameless Detective\\" Mystery","review":"In 1971, author Bill Pronzini was only 27 when he wrote The Snatch, building on a shorter and different version of the story that appeared in the May 1969 issue of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine under the same title. With the publication of this book, one of detective fiction's great characters was born with full fledged power and authenticity. If you have not yet read the Nameless Detective novels by Mr. Pronzini, you have a major treat ahead of you. Many of these are now out-of-print, so be sure to check your library for holdings in near-by cities.The Nameless Detective is referred to that way because Mr. Pronzini never supplies a name until Twospot, several books prior in the series, when police lieutenant Frank Hastings tells what his poker playing friends call Nameless, employing a first name. But it's never acknowledged by Nameless that this is his name . . . so it's probably a nickname. That name is not then used again until much later in the series in Nightshades. You can learn about why Nameless has no name in an author's note in Case File, which precedes Bindlestiff in the series.Mr. Pronzini presents a world in which people take evil actions to further selfish interests, and many innocents struggle because of that selfishness. The police and private investigators suffer along with the victims, for evil-doing has painful consequences for everyone. Mr. Pronzini's plots are complex, yet he provides plenty of clues to help you identify the evil-doer on your own. Despite the transparency of many of the early plots, he successfully uses plot complications to keep the action interesting and fresh. Beginning with Labyrinth, the plots become less simple.But the reason to read the books is because of the character development for the Nameless Detective. Nameless is a former police officer in San Francisco who collects pulp fiction about tough private detectives. Overcome by the evil he sees as a police officer and drawn to the complex imagery of the strong, silent hero who rights wrongs, Nameless tries to live that role as a private detective. But he has trouble getting clients, and operating as a one-man shop causes him to lead a lonely existence. In his personal life, his career keeps women at a distance. Beginning with Hoodwink, he has a love interest, Kerry Wade, who is the daughter of two ex-pulp authors. Like a medieval knight errant, he sticks to his vows and pursues doing the right thing . . . even when it doesn't pay. At the same time, he's very aware of art, culture and popular trends. And he doesn't like much of what he sees. He's also skeptical about technology, and doesn't want to become a snooper using electronic gadgets. He's a proud Italian in his 50's, could stand to lose some weight, and is really messy. So there's an element of Don Quixote here, too.The books are also written in a more sophisticated version of the pulp fiction style, employing a better writing style and greater range through language and plot. The whole experience is like looking at an image in a series of mirrors that reflect into infinity.These books are a must for those who love the noir style and the modern fans of tough detectives with a heart of gold like Spenser . . . and can live without the wise cracks and repartee. Beginning with Scattershot though, the books increasingly contain witty references to early mysteries and their characters.In Bindlestiff, Nameless begins to recover from the problems that were introduced in Scattershot. He has recovered his license, which was suspended in Dragonfire. He has also started to recover from his wound in Dragonfire. His friend Eberhardt has resigned from the police department, and wants to join up with Nameless . . . which Nameless is reluctant to do. He's afraid they'll both starve.An unlikely client, and an even more unlikely case, arrive as Nameless goes back to work. Proper Miss Arlene Bradford has seen a newspaper photograph of her missing father, whom she doesn't like and doesn't miss in the least, and wants Nameless to find him so he can collect an inheritance. Her sister, Hannah, tries to talk Nameless out of taking the case. Self-interest could be the reason. If Bradford cannot be found, the sisters split his portion of the inheritance. The only complication is . . . Charles Bradford travels the rails as a hobo, a bindlestiff. The trail leads Nameless into the hobo camps that accompany railroads and into a mystery connected to a railway museum.Each outing in the Nameless series takes us to new parts of the West, and introduces us to unexpected parts of society. When those we meet are the downtrodden, the books come to life in a special way.Bindlestiff has some fine action sequences in it that make the book much more exciting to read than most Nameless books. The mystery isn't that tough to penetrate, but the challenges for Nameless are daunting.This book will especially appeal to those who are railroad fans.As I finished the book, I thought of King Lear. Be careful of your relationships with your daughters. If you stay in your role as a father, you're fine. If you loosen that tie too soon, bad things can happen to you."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Switzerland (2nd ed)","review":"I spent the summer interning in Geneva, and used this guide to help me figure out where to travel on the weekends throughout the entire country.

Amazingly enough it seems there is no such thing available on Amazon so I went with this larger book, which deals with all of Switzerland--in fact, nearly all of Western culture in one fell swoop.The authors of LONELY PLANET SWITZERLAND have convinced me for the present at any rate that Switzerland (Helvetia) is the most important country on planet earth, not that they suggest we rank countries by importance or anything. It is a handy guide in the sense that physically, the book is constructed so that you could rip out, as I did, the section on Basel and Aargau, and throw the rest of the book away, and the pages you need form a complete little fascicle, due to an amazing new wonder glue that holds different little chapbooksized sections together until you don't need them together any more. Thus armed with my guide, I went to Basel. The authors share not only hotels, restaurants, and train stations, they go all out to make you feel like you can do it too. I learned how to use the phone, where to shop for lampshades, how to buy a single stamp, where the best (and worst) Swiss-Indian cafes are, and what famous medieval scholar is buried in the tombs inside Munster cathedral. Why Erasmus of course!They have cute sidebars like Basel's most famous guy, Albert Hoffman, still alive at age 102 or something like that--the man who invented LSD.Later, I met a pair of Basellienne poets, one American born, one educated in the USA, who showed me their Basel, a charming tour of tombs, elevators, shops and bridges, culminating in a magical ferry boat ride across the Rhine from Big Basel to small.

The new 4th edition of the Switzerland guide proved a big disappointment, though, on our recent trip. For some reason this is an unusually slim LP volume, so the depth of coverage for which LP is famous is lacking. We went to numerous delightful towns, villages, and museums that didn't rate so much as a mention. The city maps are also poor; many of the streets are unnamed, which makes the maps difficult to use for navigation. Finally, some of the authors' choices seem almost bizarre. The first boxed &quot;Highlight&quot; listed for the beautiful international city of Geneva, for example, is a particle physics laboratory(!) with the world's largest machine. It's probably fascinating (we didn't visit), but does it really rank with the historic European headquarters of the UN, which didn't make the Highlights box at all, or the superb International Red Cross Museum?

We are not experts but have certain requirements and preferences. It helps if one can get a feel for the area in advance of a trip, and generally that is helped by good maps and color photos. So those guides do better in our review. We like to make reservations by internet and telephone and just use the Guide as a \\"guide\\".Generally it costs more to publish a book with color photos so when all else is reasonably equal, one feels that they get better value with a guide with photos. Also we wanted to see if the ambiance at certain hotels and resorts was accurately portrayed in the text based on our knowledge. So those aspects of the guides determine our ranking. Incidentally all the books are excellent.

I used both guides to aid me in deciding which cities I would visit during my two week vacation.Since I've used other Lonely Planet guides (Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium and Luxembourg), I found myself relying more on the Lonely Planet Switzerland book than the Green Guide when planning my trip in advance. In fact, it was based on the Lonely Planet's great section on Lausanne that I opted to include that beautiful city as part of my holiday. All of my actual hotel decisions were made using on-line reviews, but both guide books gave me a reasonable feel for how far it would be for me to walk from the train station to my hotel.I ended up bringing both books (they are small and light weight) on my trip, and found that I did not need either book during the day. In Switzerland most cities have a tourist information office located in the main train station. These offices provide free stadtplans (city maps) that point out major points of interest, and I found these maps were easy to fold into my back pocket and enabled me to \\"be bold\\" and head off in places that were only vaguely described in the guide books.Comparison of the Two Books:The Green Guide really seems to focus more on tourism where you have access to a car. All of the points of interest are linked to colorful major road maps, but the Green Guide is lacking in providing the foot/train traveler in good directions to and from the train stations. Lonely Planet guides tend to be made with this type of traveler in mind, and though the Lonely Planet does a great job in describing self guided walking tours through major Swiss cities it too would sometimes talk about interesting castles, glaciers, or ice caves without providing specific foot or public transit directions (I ended up just asking the locals for directions ... and the Swiss are very friendly and easy to talk to).The Lonely Planet is much better if you won't be traveling in a car and if this is your first trip to Europe! However, in describing where I went and actually reading about the people and land itself, the Green Guide is a much more complete book. When I return to Switzerland I'll be carrying the Green Guide and not the Lonely Planet. The maps are really much better in the Green Guide, and the first 75 pages of the book offer a very detailed and comprehensive primer on what makes Switzerland unique and worth traveling to!If you can afford both books, I would read the Green Guide first and focusing on the first 75 pages. Then I start reading the Lonely Planet and to help narrow down which cities you'll visit. Thought he Lonely Planet has some history information (~60 pages), it also mixes in general travel advice in the introduction to Switzerland section that really waters down the fun of reading about a new place![NOTE: This review is slightly different than what I posted for the Green Guide Switzerland.]"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Switzerland (2nd ed)","review":"I liked the reference sections of this book holding useful tips for travel, history, culture common phrases, etc. The few sections I read on the larger cities appeared to have good detail as well. However, I recently traveled to the Valais region (SW of Switzerland) and found really very little in the way of useful information from this book.As an example, on of the smaller, rural valleys in the region called Val d'Herens had a single paragraph including a sentence that said the valley was not to be missed, but nothing on why or what to see. The valley was filled with charming towns like Evolene and beautiful villages (personally, I recommend the village of Arolla at the head of the valley for beautiful hiking).I did not visit any major areas besides Zermatt that were well covered by the book, but perhaps if your trip revolves around cities of good size, this is the right book for you.

Like most Lonely Planet guides, this one is well-written, entertaining, and generally accurate and up-to-date.Things I found helpful:- The suggested walking tours of cities are great for a quick orientation of the place.- Brief context and history about locations gives you about the same information as your average tourist brochure, but more concise and convenient.- Hiking routes are briefly mentioned with sufficient detail, but for any extended hiking, I would highly recommendLonely Planet Walking in Switzerland.- Information on the best value in train passes and train routes makes eco-friendly travel easy.- The section on Liechtenstein is a nice addition since many treat it as a day trip from Switzerland.Considering that Lonely Planet typically caters to budget travelers, I was surprised to see how many upscale hotels it includes for some locations.

In writing it, Fred Abraham drew on the 4-volume series on visual mathematical books on Dynamics, by Fred's brother Ralph Abraham (a pioneer in chaos theory) and Christopher Shaw. As such, it not only applied non-linear dynamical concepts like Attractors, State Spaces, and Bifurcations to psychology, it actually showed what such mathematical concepts looked like. Though chaos theory has been most useful for psychology as metaphor, the metaphor is immeasurably enriched by understanding - and visualizing - the actual under-pinnings of dynamic change. A difficult to find book at present, but well worth it for anyone interested in how non-linear dynamics is important for not only psychology but any of the so-called \\"soft\\" sciences."},{"Title":"A visual introduction to dynamical systems theory for psychology (The Science frontier express series)","review":"This is Fred Abraham's classic visual introduction to chaos theory for psychology.

He writes of beauty as &quot;ultimate concern&quot; to use Tillich's term, and tells of how his own discovery--or really, rediscovery--of beauty literally saved his life from the devouring jaws of depression. This is the most personally revealing of May's many books, including some of his perceptive sketches and watercolors. Despite the somewhat fragmented, discontinuous quality of the chapters, this book is fascinating and its effect on me was profound: shortly after finishing it, I found myself more highly attuned to and appreciative of the beauty all around us everyday, sustaining beauty we tend to lose sight of in our busy lives. Thank you, Rollo May, for the priceless reminder."},{"Title":"My Quest for Beauty","review":"This is a fascinating book of no fixed category -- psychology? essay? memoir? artistic critique?Well, it's a little of all of them. And while it is somewhat meandering, a bit disheveled & ramshackle, that doesn't have to be a bad thing. The effect is that of a curious, searching, eager gaze as it moves across a landscape, stopping every so often at a particularly compelling image or idea & expounding on it.Don't let \\"expounding\\" make you wary, though. Like all of Rollo May's books, it raises & discusses Big Questions in a very readable way. He has the rare gift of being able to convey complex & rich concepts in a direct, easy-to-understand manner without ever dumbing it down. And in these pages, he delves into the nature of & the need for Beauty.I think this idea is all the more pressing these days. Popular culture has never seemed so crass, so materialistic, so geared towards the lowest common denominator ... one that apparently goes lower & lower with each new day. All the more reason to be reminded that Beauty is not only precious, it's vital. And it's not just for some stereotypical elite in an overpriced tower, but for everyone.What makes this especially moving is the personal touch. May discusses his own life, his own attempts at creating Beauty, including samples of his drawings & paintings. Thus he takes the same risks he asks us to take in creating art to nourish the soul. This is no pedantic lecture delivered from on high, uninformed by any experience, but one aspiring artist speaking to others as fellow human beings, all on the same journey.Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Differential Manifolds","review":"Barden & Thomas's \\"Introduction to Differential Manifolds\\" has the broadest coverage of any introductory graduate text in differential topology that I've seen, even more than Lee'sIntroduction to Smooth Manifoldsor Guillemin & Pollack'sDifferential Topology, and in less than 200 pages. Not only does it cover the standard topics found in all such books, i.e., the rank theorem, diffeomorphisms, immersions, embeddings, tangent bundles, Sard's theorem, the Whitney embedding theorem, etc.; more topological topics, such as degree theory, the Poincare-Hopf theorem, Morse theory, and handlebodies; and the usual material with a more analytic or geometric flavor, such as differential forms, tensors, vector bundles, integration, Stokes's theorem, de Rham cohomology, and Lie groups and algebras, but there is also a chapter on fibre bundles (which already is rare for a book of this level) that includes further material on classifications of higher-dimensional manifolds that probably has never appeared in book-form before. Unfortunately, the treatment of many of these topics is rather cursory, with the most interesting material being the least well explained.Except for Chapter 3 and the latter parts of Chapter 7, the book should be accessible for first-year graduate students. The explanations are a little more detailed than those of, say, Broecker & Jaenich'sIntroduction to Differential Topology, although not to the point of the spoon-feeding ones finds in Lee or Guillemin & Pollack, so students with no prior exposure to manifold topology may find that it moves a little too fast (all the material mentioned above fits into the first 165 pages). There's a 20-page refresher appendix on differential analysis, covering the prerequisites for the book, such as metric spaces, Banach spaces, (an unhelpful definition of) tensor products, the inverse function theorem, Sard's theorem, etc., although (1) much of it is too brief to help you if you don't know it already, (2) not all of it is really necessary for this book (e.g., don't worry if you don't know what a Banach space is), and (3) the full proof (modulo some mistakes) of Sard's theorem is given, so you don't need to have learned it elsewhere. There are between 2 and 8 exercises at the end of each chapter (relatively few when compared to other introductory texts), whose level ranges from the routine to the very difficult, but this is because they are \\"intended for students to work at and then discuss with a supervisor.\\" However, \\"for the benefit of readers working independently,\\" a chapter of solutions for the exercises is included, which is big plus.The main problem with the book is that it tries to do too much, as there is no topic here that is not covered better in some other book, even though no other book covers all this material. Some of the chapters are way too brief, with the most egregious examples being that on Lie groups and Lie algebras (12 pages to cover both, including maximal tori and cohomologies of compact Lie groups), de Rham cohomology (it would really help if the reader has some exposure to algebraic topology first), and Morse theory and handle decompositions. One byproduct of squeezing in too many topics is that the proofs start to become rushed in the last couple of chapters, with lots of handwaving and some mistakes, as the care and precision in definitions and notation of the earlier chapters evaporates. Some of the biggest mistakes/weaknesses in this insufficiently copyedited book include: an overly restrictive proof of the Whitney embedding theorem; a mix-up in the proof of Stokes's theorem between equations on the manifold and those in the local coordinate neighborhood; at least 6 mathematical typos in the equations for Lemma 5.5.1; and 6 serious errors in the proof that every manifold admits Morse functions, including omitting the word \\"degenerate\\" in front of \\"critical point\\" and twice stating the exact opposite of what is intended(!). Furthermore, on p. 155 the authors state an important technical result on Lie subgroups and then prove only a special case to avoid dealing with the full technicalities, but implicit in their proof of the special case is actually an unrecognized use of the general case.However, probably the worst mistakes occur on pp. 143-6 in an attempted proof of the Morse homology theorem that includes \\"open\\" sets that are not open, a Mayer-Vietoris cover that fails to cover the manifold in question (and a good thing, too, because if it did the formula would be wrong), and a diagram (Fig. 7.6) that clearly does not match the text. (You will have to learn Morse theory and handle decompositions from a different book, such as Hirsch'sDifferential Topologyor Kosinski'sDifferential Manifolds, although even elementary books such as Gauld'sDifferential Topology: An Introductionor Wallace'sDifferential Topology: First Stepsare better.) As a final example of a botched proof, I mention Sard's theorem, which the authors commendably attempted to state and prove for the minimal differentiability required. Unfortunately, what they ended up doing was stating the theorem properly in the case where the domain and range spaces have equal dimension, but then making a mistake in the estimation of the constants in the proof (cf. de Rham's proof, inVarietes differentiables, which they attempted to imitate, but missed), and misstating the theorem in the case where the dimensions are unequal, but then presenting the correct (except for a tiny mix-up) proof (from Milnor'sTopology from the Differentiable Viewpoint) for the smooth case. See Sternberg'sLectures on Differential Geometryfor a proper proof of the full theorem.On the other hand, a few things are handled particularly well in the book: The various (5) definitions for tangent vectors (although I prefer Broecker & Jaenich's treatment, which these authors cite as an inspiration for this book), the proofs of the Poincare lemma and Mayer-Vietoris theorem in the chapter on cohomology, and degree theory (namely, degrees of maps, indices of vector fields, winding numbers, the Euler characteristic, and the Poincare-Hopf theorem that relates them; similar to treatments in Milnor and Guillemin & Pollack). The most startling feature of this book is the additional topics it covers; in particular, in Chapter 3 on fibre bundles, there's a section on \\"applications\\" that presents Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture (or should I say theorem now?) for 3-dimensional manifolds, along with a motivating analogy from the familiar 2-dimensional situation and a partial explanation of some of the terms involved (such as \\"pseudo-Anosov\\"), although most of this discussion will be way over the readers' heads, and there is understandably no mention of the method of proof. Even more surprising is what follows: A statement of Dennis Barden's own classification theorem for simply connected, closed, smooth 5-manifolds, which to my knowledge has not appeared outside his original papers. Unfortunately, the theorem is only then related to some Brieskorn varieties, about which is given not much more than a definition and an example. This material should really have been reserved for a more advanced text."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Differential Manifolds","review":"This book is quite understandable.

Just as Darwin's theory shows its flaws better to a skeptical critic, so here we are well served by a non-marxist who is nonetheless both sympathetic and well-versed in multiple confusing aspects of the sprawling traditon. Worth the price of the book (and the book would be worth reading even for a rabid Hayekian) is the treatment of the sources of Marx's dialectic, beside Marx's slender reading, actually, of Hegel's texts. The author tracts down the significant importance of the lesser known text, The History of Philosophy (not The Philosophy of History). The confusion over dialectic, and other matters, has gone on ad infinitum, one hopes to reach closure finally on this waste of mental energy that has made a demented muddle of the entire history of the left. This is but one of the many issues thoroughly researched, viz. the question of Marx on markets, and property. But the opening theme invokes one of the subtlest aspects of the Marx corpus, the issue of 'embedded rationality', as this passes via Hegel, with roots in Spinoza, in a gesture toward the historical enigma now filtered out of our understanding by postivitistic Darwinism. The great irony in such a skeptical treatment is the very clarity of this presentation surprisingly shows us something that has endured in Marx, which is, precisely this 'instinct' for the 'embedded rationality' of historical evolution. Such a statement is heresy in the age of Darwin, but the plain fact of the matter is that Marx's version of this Spinozistic theme has been lost to our contemporary understanding, a point unwittingly exposed by the exceptional clear treatment of the subject. We can see why Marx balked at Darwin, but was unable to quite resist the coming tide of Darwinian false thinking. Later Marxism simply lost this component of Marx's insight as it embraced Darwinian thinking, which is entirely antagonistic to themes of this sort, witness the diatribes, and confusion of S.J.Gould. But surely here Marx has a deeper insight, yet even his followers have lost him and are not even make use of their own tradition. Students of Marxshould certainly profit from this fascinating book."},{"Title":"Karl Marx: The Burden of Reason (Why Marx Rejected Politics and the Market)","review":"Since this book was published, almost everything that has ever been produced seems likely to end up in the trash when the electricity is shut off and we don't have money anymore.

A major concern was how much knowledge the public should have if history was to be considered an iron law that could produce the future the government wanted to provide instead of a higher swindle like:My translation: on the theoreticallevel Edgar Bauer is probablyright, but he should not havediscussed the matter publicly. (p. 308, n.77).That is a note for Chapter 2, Why Marx Rejected Politics. A society which is a popularity contest only tells people what they want to hear. Thinkers who would like different results from what everybody thinks can be considered \\"as an ontological individualist generally.\\" (p. 214).For example, unlike somethinkers in his time, he didnot adhere to an organicistview of society: organicmetaphors are extremelyrare in his work. . . .the living organism doesseem to possess aje ne sois quoi (p. 214).We really can't say what is making living things so different, just like:although we can dissectthe family dog, we cannotput all the pieces backtogether again and expectit to get up again and bark.

(p. 195).Thus there is a pathosin Marx, that a philosophical-scientific project articulatedin the interests of greaterfreedom for human beingsshould have unintendedlycontributed to servitude.

I read My Sister's Keeper first and was riveted by her writing. I was hooked after that book. I went on to read Songs of the Humpback whale and found it to be not as much of a page turner as My sister's keeper. Following that I read salem falls, plain truth, harvesting the heart, the pact, 19 minutes and keeping faith. I guess I prefer the beginning shock value, the back and forth way of most of her writing, a good trial and a huge shock at the end that I should have seen coming with small clues thrown in and out. So far I have found My sister's keeper, the pact and 19 minutes to be her best works.I did not enjoy this book. I actually forced myself to finish it. I was surprised at such a (for the less of a better word) wimpy main character - Cassie. How could she NOT see what she was getting herself into. I could not feel bad for her. She should never have married Alex. She knew that. She was too intelligent to fall into the movie star or \\"I can fix him\\" type. It just wasn't believable. The exceptional writing I have come to expect was just not there. I will keep reading the rest of her books, but this one did not keep me thinking after I finished it. It did not bring out an emotion in me about it.I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This was one of my lesser favorite novels by Jodi Picoult. I seem to enjoy her tales when they are told in different voices. This was told by Cassie and Alex but not in the normal manner of Picoult. She even threw in the occasional voice of Will, the half white Lakota Indian.The controversial topic was two fold: white in an Indian society and spousal abuse. I know it sounds like an odd combination but somehow the story was weaved in such a manner that it worked. It was interesting to learn about the Lakota way as I have very little experience or knowledge on the North American Indian. The tougher portion for me was the spousal abuse. I will never understand how someone can stay in such an unhealthy relationship. The one and only time someone laid their hands on me was the one and only time. Police were involved and the relationship was severed completely. That's a story for another time, as it's quite lengthy and could make a story in and of itself. I've only recently learned that it also takes a special kind of strength to stay put and continue to try and eke out a life with the abuser. And even more strength to get up and leave.While this story was interesting, I think it would have been better to have a regular Joe instead of Alex the superstar. I found it less believable because I couldn't relate to him. I know this type of thing happens all the time behind closed doors, and probably more so with the stress of making it big, but the guy next door would/could have been anyone. It may have made me question the average person's relationship, or a couple who seemed to have it all."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"As usual, an enjoyable read.

This book failed to impress in everyway possible!!!In the first third of the book, there are essentially two main characters, Cassie who has amnesia, and Will Flying Horse a police officer who has just arrived in LA to start his new job. Will and Cassie are equally profiled in the first third of the book, but then in the second third it's all about Cassie and her back story. Will, who was so interesting, is completely dropped in the second third of the book. As I was learning about Cassie's history, I wanted to also be finding out the details of Will's life living on the reservation and what made him leave the reservation and everything he knew to move to one of the largest, most hectic of cities. Will is brought back into the book in the last third of the book, but by this time I had gotten so frustrated with the poor writing that I read some reviews to find out if I was the only one. Turns out I wasn't, and when I read the synopsis of where the story ended up going I decided to not even bother reading the rest of the book.The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it was written about 19 years ago, so it had to be an early work before the author had gotten her stride."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"My husband and I do loads of audio books, as we each commute 60+ minutes 2 x day. We listened to and greatly enjoyed Picoult's \\"Second Glance\\" a couple years ago, so we snatched at the opportunity to listen to more of Picoult.What a wretched waste of time \\"Picture Perfect\\" was by contrast with our first experience! I barely have the discipline to take the time to type it. Ridiculous amounts of time describing boring love scenes, like a trashy pulp romance... horrible. Unbelievable characters... made exponentially worse by the voices reading the story. Bruce Reizen's characterization was lukewarm at best, like he was reading an eighth-grade text book... but Sandra Burr was absolutely teeth-grittingly awful! She was supposedly reading the first person words of a female archeologist who ends up in an abusive marriage to a film star... but her voice sounded like a 19 year old, naive Hollywood bimbo.I found myself yelling insults at my car stereo.... no, fellow commuters, that was NOT Road Rage.... that was Terrible Audio Book Rage. Save yourself a lot of aggravation.... there is no joy here, no good story, no mystery, no interesting discoveries. Spend your money on something else, and keep your eyes on the road."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I saw a lot of unhappy reviews before I read this but I went into it open minded and wow I was pleasantly surprised.

I've read a couple of Jodi's other books--The Pact and My Sister's Keeper. I really enjoy her writing, so I didn't hesitate at all to read Picture Perfect.Unlike other readers/reviews, I enjoyed how the story went from one time period to another and back again. I had no trouble following along. I also can say that even though I've never been abused, I really had a visceral response to the characters in this book. All in all, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"After a couple of recommendations to read this author, I randomly picked Picture Perfect. It was so obvious Picoult wanted you to somehow empathize with the pathetic Alex Rivers. I did not feel sorry for him at all, nor for Cassie. What this story was, was a study in such sickly sweet sentimentality about abuse disguised as true love. What sorry people Cassie and Alex were. This book was really disappointing. The last thing this world needs is to glamorous domestic violence and spousal abuse."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Terribly disappointing. I am a Jodi Picoult fan, but this was a waste of time. I am chalking it up to the fact that it is one of her early works. It reads like a romance novel - nothing more."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I think Jodi Picoult is one of the best modern fiction writers with deeply emotional language that makes and immediate connection with the reader. Picture Perfect is no exception. However, I found this book much more of the romance genre than I would have liked. I felt that the book lacked substance and tried to incorporate far too many concepts. That being said, Picoult's writing captured me from the first chapter and I quickly devoured the book. Reminds me of a powdered sugar donut... so tempting and satisyfing on the surface, but while you are eating it your body tells you a steak and salad would have been a better choice. But there's nothing wrong with a powdered sugar donut every once in a while..."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult is a great story teller. Writing about relationships is her strength. I have read all of her novels and have been captivated, time after time, by her characters and engrossing storylines. &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; is not one of Ms. Picoult's best efforts, however. This novel of the relationship between a Hollywood super star and a brilliant and acclaimed anthropologist is too contrived for my taste. She writes about an important and difficult societal issue here, but the complexity and real drama of her story are diminished by the unnecessary glitter of her characters and the addition of a subplot, so tangential, it is superfluous.Cassie Barrett is a physical anthropologist and lecturer at UCLA. She has been assigned to work at one of the university's sites in Tanzania for the semester when she is disturbed by the crew of a film production company in the process of making a movie. Since the film just happens to feature an anthropologist, she is recruited as a consultant and meets super star actor and heartthrob Alex Rivers. In a Cinderella romance with overtones of the &quot;Lifestyles Of The Rich and Famous,&quot; the two fall in love and marry. But gold does not lie beneath the glitter. Alex carries tons of baggage from an abusive childhood. Cassie has baggage of her own. Picoult describes the psychological dynamics of the couple with a sharp and knowing eye. Her characters are finely drawn, realistic and compelling. Characters and a parallel story are introduced that would make an interesting novel in itself, but are so removed from the main plot that their presence is distracting. I was left with a feeling that the author had added apples to oranges and hoped to come up with a logical rational for her character's actions. This is not typical of Ms. Picoult's usual taut plots and tight writing style. Apples and oranges do not mix well in this novel and I was left hungry.JANA"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Another beautiful book from Jodi Picoult. Kept me hooked right through the book.

I think what appeals to me is that Jodi writes this particular novel in such a way that you empathize with the protagonist. You want him to be the perfect man, the perfect lover. You want the main character to have the fairy tale life, and for the first time, I understood why a woman might want to stay with someone who is abusive. Because when the relationship is good, it's very good, and when it's bad, you hope in your mind that the abuse is just this one time, just this one shove, this one slap, and that eventually, love will be enough to triumph over everything. I think many women fall for this myth. You can see how women might live for through the nightmare of abuse hoping to return to the glorious beginnings of the relationship when they were adored. Of course, this never happens, but you understand the psychology behind it, at least I did. If a gorgeous, and accomplished man adoringly fell in love with you, could you so easily walk away if he became abusive? I think we would surprise ourselves at our response if we found ourselves in the same situation."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is not the Jody Picoult I love to read. I'm not sure what happened here, but this book is mediocre. I am used to her tackling controversial issues with more depth and understanding than this book.

Her books all have different subject matter but it's as if she becomes an expert on each subject. This book wasn't my favorite book but I still enjoyed it. All of her books are interesting and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Picture Perfect is an older book (1995) and some of the details that worked then are dated now, Everyone would have a cellphone, for instance, making it much harder to disappear, and the airport scenes would be very different, post 9-11.Nonetheless, the book blew me away. I was not expecting it to be a story about dysfunctional families, true love, and domestic violence (with a bit of native American mythos woven in as well).Cassie Barrett begins the book with amnesia. (Yeah, I know, that premise has only been done about a billion times.) She is found and cared for by a native American LAPD cop, new to the force. As her memory begins to return, it turns out that her loving, doting husband is a big time movie star, who was out of the country on a shoot and didn't even realize she was missing.Her memory begins to return in bits and pieces. We see her childhood, with an alcoholic mother and an enabling father. Her close friendship with Connor, a neighbor boy who might eventually have become a lover and a husband, if he had not been killed in a murder-suicide by his depressed father. We see her struggle to get acknowledgment and tenure as an anthropologist at UCLA, and then fate throws her into the path of movie star Alex Rivers.We watch as Cassie remembers and replays her whirlwind romance with Alex, the deep emotional connection of two wounded souls. We see how much he loves her, how much he depends upon her, and she on him, how very happy they are together. The happiness, the joy, the sense of belonging, of finally finding a kindred spirit, a soulmate, from two somewhat damaged people who have been alone in the world.And then Cassie remembers that he hit her.That it happened not once, not twice, but countless times.The first time it happened, she was in shock, and denial, and Alex was so sorry. And things were better, were great, for a very long time after that.If you have never been in a domestic violence situation - I'm happy for you (and perhaps a tiny bit jealous). But the reality is, many, many people have grown up in dysfunctional homes, so far away from normal we don't even know what normal tastes like.Could you describe a taste to someone who'd never sampled that flavor? Fresh cut strawberries; chocolate gelato, garlic butter sauce? You could put a lot of words together, show pictures and videos of other people eating these foods, but there's really no way someone who has never tasted a strawberry, could understand the flavor without putting one in his/her mouth.Picture Perfect gets the flavor (if, perhaps, not all the details) right. The overwhelming love, soul connection, followed by confusion, betrayal, pain. The difficulty and deep shame of allowing oneself to be abused. The leaving, the coming back, after he has \\"changed\\" and gotten help.For a fictional book, it expresses the truth of the mixed emotions in a way that many more clinical non-fiction books can't quite detail. I highly recommend it if you are trying to understand why you, or anyone, stays with an abuser."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"The book came in great condition, in a timely manner. I thought I was getting the book with the original cover (yellow dress), but got the newer cover instead. Surprised me, but no problems. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I liked this book but I liked other books by Jodie Picoult better. I felt this predictable as far as the outcome. Her other books have more of a surprise ending."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I enjoyed most of the book. Maybe I didn't read the Indian stories well enough, because I don't understand the ending. Please, someone please tell me what the eagle at the end meant. I don't want to read the whole thing over again so I can figure out the ending. If I had understood the ending I would have given it 5 stars, maybe.It made me wonder how many abusers and abused there are around me. Thankfully I don't have personal experience. The setting of Hollywood made it more believable because many of the stars have problems finding who they really are."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Domestic violence is a very serious issue and being on the outside looking in is such a painful and frustrating place to be. That being said, if you want to spend many hours being frustrated and annoyed by completely unlikable characters then this is the book for you. I really wanted to like this book. It was a very quick read and after each chapter I just kept hoping that Piccoult could find some way to reel me in and make me a fan. Sadly this does not happen. It feels as though the book has trouble stringing the characters together or even giving reasons for their existance. There is no payoff for any character, just misery all around. As the book ends, you are supposed to feel proud of Cassie's strength, but you really just continue to feel weakness and pity. It was just too bad."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This story had a beginning that had a lot of potential. A woman is found with a cut on her head, wandering around a cemetary and church. The mystery is set as to what happened to this woman? But the amnesia didn't last long, and soon Cassie remembers everything that happened that lead to her loss of memory. Three years prior Cassie married Hollywood star Alex Rivers. Life was just wonderful except for those wee moments when Alex would beat her. And so the tale that leads Cassie to eventually leave her abusive marriage, but only after doing what every other battered woman does: keeps going back hoping he'd change, getting into therepy, having a baby.I was glad to see that this novel did not involve a court case, as all the other novels by Picoult did. And the author also portrayed domestic violence quite accurately. But for some reason, I was not immediately pulled in, and felt I could predict the next turn."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult came highly recommended to me from a book editor friend and so I ran to the store to pick up \\"Picture Perfect\\". What a waste! The writing was very choppy and non-sensical at times. In addition, I found it very difficult to believe any of the characters. The ending was quick, lame and overall anti-climatic. It left me feeling like, \\"I wasted all this time reading this for what?\\". I'm not sure about the other Jodi Picoult books, but this one makes me not even want to waste any time reading the others."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Cassie Rivers, suffering from amnesia, is found by Will, an officer new to the Los Angeles police force, and he befriends her while she tries to discover who she is. She finds that she is a successful archeologist and starts to uncover clues to her background. When Cassie's husband finally shows up to pick her up at the police station, she is surprised to discover that she is married to one of the most successful, handsome actors in Hollywood. Will feels that something is amiss with their relationship and is reluctant to let her go.As Cassie gradually reacquaints herself with her beautiful homes and life of luxury, the history of her relationship to Alex is retold through flashbacks. He has serious emotional problems and lashes out at her in violent beatings, which have become more and more frequent. In spite of his violence, he is totally dependent on her since he feels she is the only woman who can every truly understand him. And she does understand him, but her compassion traps her in this dangerous marriage.Finally, for fear of losing the unborn child she is carrying, which Alex doesn't know about yet, she runs away from him to the only person she can trust, Will. Will takes her to stay with his grandparents on an Indian reservation in South Dakota. She leads a placid and peaceful life among these simple people while waiting for the baby to be born. Will has fallen in love with her, but she continues to love Alex in spite of what he has done.She returns to Alex a month after the baby is born, since he has promised to undergo psychological counseling for his emotional and physical abuse. All seems fine for a while, but Alex reverts to his old patterns, and Cassie is terrified that he will hurt the baby also. Cassie takes the only way out of this hopeless situation. She exposes Alex to the public, since she knows it's the only way she can spoil his love and dependence on her.Although it dealt with a difficult and frightening subject, the book was rich with detail and emotion as it described the African grasslands where Cassie and Alex met, the austere Indian reservation and the glamorous lifestyle that Cassie and Alex had enjoyed. Another fine effort by Jodi Picoult."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult has created characters so multi-dimensional that, days after finishing the book, I still find myself thinking about the characters and the story. Enough background is given on each character that even Alex, the abusive husband, seems sympathetic and it was easier to understand how Cassie could choose to stay in an abusive marriage. I found myself hoping the relationship would work out and I couldn't wait to see how the book would end."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"If you've read the synopsis of this book on the main page, I'm giving nothing away by saying that is it a book about an abusive marriage. After having read several of Picoult's novels, I've found that she sometimes has a real talent for delving into the psychology of characters in unusual circumstances. I can't say the same about this book.Overall, the book is quite predictable--but, then, abusive relationships in general are predictable. Cassie is abused by her husband, Alex, who then apologizes and promises never to do it again. Everything is wonderful until he loses control and beats her again. Anyone who has ever had the trauma of being in this type or relationship or anyone who has studied them knows that domestic abuse is a cycle. The abuser usually apologizes later, there are usually promises never to abuse again, but, eventually, the abuse reoccurs and the cycle begins again. I think Picoult felt she could spice it up by making the husband a celebrity but studies have shown that affluent couples aren't any less likely to have abusive relationships than less affluent couples, so this plot device really doesn't lend any spice.Cassie, overall, was pretty well done but she was also frustrating. Abused women usually do make excuses for their abusers and usually do justify the abuse but I found her ultimate reaction a bit strange. As is typical with abusive relationships, there is a great deal of co-dependency between Cassie and Alex and she holds onto the belief that he is simply broken and that she'll be able to fix him. Initially she does love him but the question that Picoult never fully addresses here is if she ultimately continues to love him as the years go by and the abuse continues. The line between love and resignation becomes rather blurred after a while in such a relationship and it seemed to me that Cassie's reluctance to leave had less to do with love and more to do with other factors.As for Alex, I felt Picoult tried a little too hard to make him a sympathetic character. His past is pretty horrible but this is neither a reason nor an excuse for him to beat his wife. Abusive relationships are about control and the bottom line is that Alex's real objective was to control his wife. Picoult sometimes portrays this inclination as love but it isn't really love at all. If Alex did really love his wife, he would have gotten himself some serious therapy and overcome his past in order to ensure that his own marriage would be a healthy one. The bottom line is that I really don't find an abusive husband to be a sympathetic character in any way, shape, or form, no matter how traumatic his past.I also felt that the addition of Will was more of a distraction than anything. He's a sort of means to an end for Cassie rather than a character in his own right. His only real purpose in the novel is to swoop in and rescue her and to indirectly help her to find a new spin on the career about which she is passionate. If the novel was really meant to focus on an abusive marriage and its repercussions, Will's addition does nothing to further this plot."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I honestly just never got really captured by this one. The writing was beautiful, just nothing that made me put it down and go \\"now that was good\\"."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Being a Jodi Picoult fan (as in, I devour her books one after another), I bought this book at a used bookstore in my town. After sitting on the shelf for awhile, I thought I'd add it to my summer reading list. I love her writing, but I really think it's developed throughout the years. I have not read all of her books, but can definitely see an improvement and difference between this one and, say, My Sister's Keeper.Just like all her books, this one kept my attention. I like how it wandered back and forth between the past and present. I didn't quite understand Will's role in the book, as he seems to be forgotten throughout the whole second part (\\"1989-1993\\"). I wasn't sure if he would have a police role or more of a savior role, and it turned out to be the latter.It is obvious that she did her research on the celebrity lifestyle and also on anthropology. I like how she gives her women characters highly-esteemed occupations. Even if the book wasn't her best, I am still encouraged by Cassie's profession as a professor of anthropology.It was still a good read and I don't regret spending a few hours in all reading it. But now I will be on to bigger and better things from this beautiful and talented author... The Tenth Circle."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I am a HUGE Jodi Picoult fan, who has happily worked my way through everything she has written. My Sisters Keeper is especially dear to me. Picture Perfect was for me interesting though the subject matter made me uncomfortable I pushed through and read what turned out to be a very believable portrayal of the cycle of domestic violence. It is accurate in the thoughts and ideas that inspire someone to stay in a relationship that isn't healthy, in more ways than one, and I found myself equally disgusted with Alex as I was understanding of his characters flaws. He was someone whose first person account would have aided in the understanding of women everywhere, of the thought process of the person who abuses. Though at points I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at some points that were simply to unbelievable, I walked away understanding the point of view of many women I have heard of and pitied instead of applauding for there strength."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult's novel, &quot;Picture Perfect,&quot; is the story of Cassie Barrett, who holds a doctorate in anthropology and is world famous in her field. On a movie set in Tanzania, where Cassie is serving as a consultant, she meets a gorgeous and desirable film actor named Alex Rivers. Alex sweeps Cassie off her feet with his charm and charisma, and Cassie falls in love with him. They seem to have a &quot;picture perfect&quot; relationship.Unfortunately, Cassie finds out later that Alex is the product of a horribly abusive childhood, similar in many ways to her own very difficult childhood, and he bears indelible scars from his youth. When Alex lashes out at Cassie, she forgives him time and again, since she truly loves him and empathizes with his pain. Alex is the consummate actor. He allows the world to see what he wants them to see. The real Alex is far different from the persona that he projects to his fans. Cassie learns, too late, that she has married a man with deep-rooted psychological problems.Unfortunately, most of &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; is predictable and melodramatic. We have seen the scenario of the &quot;perfect&quot; marriage, which is really far from perfect, so many times before. What saves this book from being just an average melodrama is the clever inclusion of a subplot about the Lakota Sioux of South Dakota. When Cassie suffers from temporary amnesia, she is fortunate enough to meet a man named William Flying Horse, who is a rookie in the Los Angeles Police Department. He helps Cassie in many ways, and through him and his family, we get a wonderful and poignant glimpse of the Lakota Sioux culture.Jodi Picoult's writing style is fairly pedestrian and her characters are too one-dimensional. Still, Cassie's story has some compelling moments, and the subplot about the Sioux is moving and informative. Therefore, I give &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; a marginal recommendation."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is the seventh novel I have read by Jodi Picoult. I really enjoy all her books but this is definitely my favourite. The characters are such enchanting from Cassie Barrett to Will Flying Horse and even Alex Rivers. This novel does not get as much publicity as the others but I recommend it to everyone and anyone. Read it you will not be disappointed. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it. It's so addictive."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"What a great story! Very powerful. The complexity of an abusive relationship is captured in this book."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult does a wonderful job of allowing the reader to see that a person CAN love the one who abuses them. Love the sinner, hate the sin. This is a great book to recommend to anyone going through abuse - as well as for the family and friends of abuse victims. This story forgives the victim for feeling the way she feels - as it SHOULD, and provides a level of understanding to people who have not experienced abuse. It also shows that it is possible to love and still walk away."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"A truly wonderful book. I find myself engrossed in the lives of her characters!

Gets a little confusing at times..."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book recounts the almost fairytale like romance and marriage of anthropologist, Cassie Barrett, and silver screen star, Alex Rivers. All that glitters, however, is not gold, as Cassie will soon discover. It seems that her handsome husband has a dark side to his personality.When Cassie undergoes some form of temporary amnesia, she makes the acquaintance of William Flying Horse, a rookie police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. He is immediately attracted to this lovely, though mysterious, woman. He treats her tenderly and, ultimately, falls in love with her. He does not reveal his feelings, however, as she is eventually claimed by her husband, who has been looking for her.As her memory returns, Cassie recalls what was it that drove her away from Alex. Unfortunately, Alex is the product of an abusive childhood, and the psychological trauma that he sustained growing up rears its ugly head in a way that is not conducive to a happy marriage. Cassie, however, is the great enabler, as she has allowed Alex to continue with this pattern of behavior, rationalizing it to herself.This is a formulaic story that the author tries to augment with some Native American Indian lore that is somewhat interesting but, ultimately, fails to carry the day, as it spirals into the ridiculous. All of the characters, including the Native American ones, are one dimensional and, consequently, the reader ends up caring very little about what happens to any one of them. There is nothing in this book that makes it other than what it is: a mediocre work of fiction not worth reading."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Save your time and skip this one."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I didn't enjoy Picture Perfect as much as I enjoyed Jodi Picoult's other novels. I couldn't identify with the characters and don't find the subject of domestic abuse interesting. I really enjoyed her other novels."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Some popular writers can be relied upon to produce consistently good (or bad) quality fiction, and other cannot. Jodi Picoult falls into the latter category. While most of her novels that I've read have been compelling, topical and intelligent, Salem Falls and Picture Perfect could not be more cliched. Picture Perfect tells of the marriage between an anthropologist and America's most popular matinee idol. The book opens during the immediate aftermath of an unspecified incident that leaves the wife with amnesia (cliche #1). The police officer who rescued her is a Native American struggling to survive in the racist atmosphere of LA. He is inexplicably drawn to this woman, and can't get her out of his mind (cliche #2.) As the plot unfolds, it is instantly apparent that all is not well within the marriage. The worried but narcissistic husband has a penchant for flying off the handle, and we suspect that he is abusive (cliche #3.) The back story centers upon how and why the Native American became a cop, and is fluffed out with several native legends, which are the highlights of the novel. Supporting characters tend toward types, such as macho cops, the bimbo best friend, and the sleazy agent from Brooklyn.The story plays out all too predictably, and is little more than a soap opera, or a romance ala Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel. Which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but it's not a genre that I enjoy."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"i love books by jodi picoult...she keeps me wanting to read 'just one more chapter' she's hard to put down! i have read just about all of her current books..."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"An old problem, no social economic divide, affects us all. Jodi does it again hits the heart and mind."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I have enjoyed reading Jodi Picoult's novels (especially My Sister's Keeper) in the past. Picture Perfect is a novel chosen by my book club so I did not personally choose to read it. If it had not been chosen as a \\"must read\\" I probably would not have finished it. It is not a typical Picoult style of writing and I am wondering if it was written by a ghost writer. She used the terms \\"narrowed her eyes\\" and \\"the palms of her hands\\" countless times.The characters never quite materialize and there are too many that have no real development. Connor and Will seem to be outside looking in for most of the novel and are not necessary to the story. There are way too many unanswered questions such as why her father never looked for her, how did Connor relate to anything in the plot, she had amnesia but remembered things, too. The storyline jumped from spousal abuse to child abuse to Indian folklore to Tanzania to Hollywood and back to Africa and even the Oscars.The only character that is well defined is Alex. I thought Picoult wrote a true character study on his abusive personality and developed his background so that we understood why he turned into an abuser. Will's character bordered on \\"superman\\" and the Indian ritual with the rods through his chest was so unbelievable....for sure, the entire stay at the reservation did not link well with the subject matter.I have not given up on the \\"real\\" Jodi Picoult...just hope she surfaces when I pick up one of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I am a huge Picoult fan, and when I bought this book it actually made it's way through three friends before I got to read it myself. I did not like this book at all. It's an important topic, yes, but it's been done, and in not much different stlye then say, Sleeping with the Enemy, minus the killing, add in the Hollywood scene. It was frightfully long, and I just kept thinking, okay Jodi we get the point he's abusive, he's a tortured soul...don't torture me for it. She could have cut about 100 pages from the book, truly. There was a lot of filler, and unimportant events, and then too many beatings....we get the point already.However, I give Picoult credit for her understanding of a situation a lot of women are in, staying with an abuser, blaming themselves. Picoult is a MASTER at building her characters, and while I didn't appreciate the story much, or find it new, or in intriguing, her characters ALWAYS are."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I have read every one of Jodi's books except MERCY. I enjoyed all of her books except this one and Songs of the Humpback Whale. Both of these were her earliest novels, and her writing and stories have come a long way over the years.This book is confusing & disappointing. The central character, Cassie, is amnesic, yet she does remember some things. It is never clear how the amnesia occurred or how she comes to recover from it. I felt that there was far too much going on in the story: Hollywood life, Indian Mythology, anthropology and then add to that the domestic violence theme. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers (at least me) lost in the middle."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Officer William Flying Horse is new to the Los Angeles Police Department. The job is quite a bit different from his last place of employment, the Indian reservation on which he grew up. As the child of a white mother and Native American father, Will has always had problems fitting in, the white kid on the reservation, the Indian guy to the rest of the world. The night before he starts his new employment, he discovers an amnesiac woman wandering the streets. The two bond immediately, as Will waits with Jane Doe until someone comes forward to claim her - a husband she can't remember, but who ensures her of the fairy tale life they have together. As you might imagine, however, fairy tales are not often as perfect as they seem.Quote: \\"Jane closed her eyes and tried to conjure a face, a gesture, even the pitch of a voice. She shook her head. 'I don't feel married.'\\"I am overall a Jodi Picoult fan, but I have not been impressed by the last couple of hers books I read. The plot twists seemed too obvious, the back-and-forth between characters too stilted. This book reminded me of why I enjoy her work so much. She looks into complex situations, complicated characters, and makes all of them understandable and relatable, the \\"good\\" ones and the \\"bad\\" ones. A great reminder of all things good about Jodi Picoult."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I became a huge Picoult fan after reading My Sister's Keeper years ago. After absolutely devouring several of her books (19 minutes, The Pact, Perfect Match, The Tenth Circle, Harvesting the Heart etc), I had to take a break from her. I absolutely love every topic she has ever tackled, but her books all seemed to follow the same basic outline, and it started making the stories to predictable.I was excited to try another Picoult book, especially since this one appeared to not follow the same formula as her previous books. The lesson to be learned here: be careful what you wish for.I feel awful that I want to give this book such a bad review, but it was a really bad book. Like many other readers, I didnt particularly like any of the main characters - Cassie, Alex or Will. When Alex started abusing Cassie, I got really angry as to how Cassie was portrayed. I understand the mentality of abused women, battered women's syndrome and the typical circle of abuse / love / promises that tends to occur. While its normal for her to blame herself for being abused, Cassie's guilt was overdone and unbelievable.This story was too long and drawn out. There were chapters and chapters about Alex and Cassie's life before the abuse started. I didnt find either character interesting at all and kept asking myself, \\"who cares about any of this?\\" I just wanted it to end.The story finally picks up when Cassie gets away and is staying on the reservation - but this was almost like a seperate book entirely. First, if Cassie is married to such a hot-shot celebrity, how is possible that no one recognized her in the airport, or on the plane when she was escaping to South Dakota? Secondly, I had to skip over the 10 pages describing the traditional Sun ceremony that Will engages in - I couldnt handle the visuals of whatever piercing / skewering Will was doing his body. I dont really understand the Navajo tie in at all. Wasnt Hollywood-Tanzania-Africa enough culture for one book?I can go on and on, but I'll stop here. If you've never read Picoult, definitely dont start with this one. Read My Sister's Keeper, its by far her best.My advice to everyone: Skip this book!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book has been a waste of my time and money. I made it to page 36 (after two attempts) and that's as far as I'm going to go.I've not read any other books by Picoult; I hear good things all the time. I guess I just picked the wrong one to start with, because Picture Perfect is not enjoyable at all.The writing is both dull and overly dramatic. The whole situation is rather soap opera-esque and unbelievable. Very, very slow.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I found myself not liking Cassie at all. Every time Alex hurt her, she said it was \\"her fault\\". For a woman who was so smart and independent before she met Alex, she surely must have taken a Stupid Pill after the wedding."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Read all the other one-star reviews. They say it very well. I trudged through half of this book & skipped to the last two chapters, only mildly curious as to how it would end. No surprise there. They have reissued this book with a picture of a yellow dress with a green field in the background -- similar to cover pictures on her newer books. Don't be fooled. This was copywritten in 1995. Luckily for her fans, and I am one, her later offerings improved immensely."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I am now completely addicted to Jodi Picoult books. I have read 9, and this was one of the best!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Although the novel starts sort of promising, it soon collapses into a long, boring and quite predictable story.If the text was trimmed to half of its actual size, then maybe it would have been an average book.But it is not.There are much better books out there to spend your time on. So don't waste it with \\"Picture Perfect\\"."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult and I absolutely loved it! You can really relate to Cassie, the main character, because she is down to earth and struggles just like the rest of us. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I am glad this isn't the first book I have read by Ms. Picoult. I really enjoy her latest books but this one is from 1995 and her main character is too weak. I will never understand why a woman would stay with a man who beats her and Cassie does just that. Tries to make Alex feel better. oh please. Who cares if he feels miserable and had an awful childhood? Get over it already. It took her almost 300 pages to find the answer. I don't want to give the whole plot away but that is not love."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is the third Picoult Book Ive read including Songs of a Humpback Whale and Harvesting the Heart and I have to say I enjoyed this one the most!It is the story of anthropologist Cassie Barrett and Hollywood leading man Alex Rivers. What starts off as a fairytale romance soon changes when Cassie realises Alex also has a dark side and turns out to be an abusive husband, but strangly enough you sympathise with Alex's Character as his behaviour seems to be because of his own childhood. I found myself wanting the relationship between Cassie and Alex to work out.Really enjoyed this one. Recommended."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I don't want to say Picoult's books aren't good, but I find the style of writing very frustrating. She goes back and forth and takes forever to get to the point. The books are so long that afterwhile, it's hard to maintain interest. I finally just flipped to the ending and ended it all."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"By 'odd,' I don't mean Jodi Picoult is odd, she is my favorite leisure reading author for the past 2 or 3 years and I have read almost all of her books. What I mean is that the voice in this book is a voice that is so different than hers that it almost does not seem like one of her books. I am not complaining about her writing in a different voice; I think her flexibility in voice across her books is generally a positive characteristic of her books, in fact. I just found this voice somewhat distant and the story jumbled, like she had a hard time for whatever reason taking the emotional perspective of her characters in this book. However, as I said, I really enjoy most of her books so do not let this negative review detract from reading her books in general!!!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This novel met all my expectations of the genius offered by Jodi Picoult. The psychology behind always having to be 'picture perfect' is shown with great insights.I'm an avid fan.Irene"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This story begins full of suspense, as Cassie Barrett wakes up in a cemetery with full-blown amnesia. She is picked up by a new to the area cop - William Flying Horse, a half-Sioux, half-white man who is trying to get away from his past. Will helps Cassie find her husband, who happens to be Alex Rivers, A-List movie star, who's always in a role. The story progresses fluidly, flashing from Cassie's memories and situation, as well as intricately laced Native American legends.I have read all of Jodi's books (through her current House Rules, 2010), and I have to say that Picture Perfect is another one of my favorites. Jodi has a way of writing very personal- sometimes painful- situations, and making you want to reach through the pages and hug, slap, or scream, at every character. Her writing is beautiful, powerful, and smooth. This is one psychological drama I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This was not my favorite book by Jodi Picoult. I think I felt annoyance at Cassie. But all in all it is a good book."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I struggled with this book. I just could not get into it. I have read Nineteen Min, Handle with Care, The Pact, Salem Falls, My sisters Keeper.... and this was by far the biggest disappointment. Hard to get into for me..."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I picked this up to see what all the fuss was about Jodi Picoult. The story gripped me from the first page. I couldn't put it down and when I had to, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters and what was happening. I usually read two or three books at a time, but dropped everything else to finish this. A very good story, a very good read."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"It's refreshing to go back and read a Jodi Picoult novel that is one of her first. There isn't a looming courtroom drama unfolding in this book. There isn't depressing jailhouse/prison scenes that make me think that I would die if I ever ended up in prison. This book instead investigates a relationship between a man and a woman, and what happens when love becomes demanding and possessive. I wish Picoult would go back to writing more like this, and she almost did inThe Tenth Circle: A Novel. I guess I'm just so tired of constantly seeing moral dilemmas played out in courtrooms. I would like to see her attack these subjects without someone having to constantly commit a crime and do the time. If you want something else of her's to read that doesn't involve courtroom drama, readHarvesting the Heart: A Novel."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult definitely didn't disappoint me with this book. I love the way an abusive relationship was portrayed... it shows that it's not her fault that she stayed with him, and that you can still love someone who hurts you. But it also shows that things aren't always what they seem, and that things that are \\"Picture Perfect\\" can also have problems. Cassie's marriage to Alex is full of love, but also full of hate. But the hate isn't directed towards each other.I don't know why, but I loved this book. Not as much as My Sister's Keeper or The Pact, but definitely more than The Tenth Circle."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives. A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband? It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research. That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book. I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it. It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"A lot of people didn't like it, but I thought it was a very interesting book. Sure it's a bit predictable, but the journey and Jodi's writing are what make it worth the read!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is my first Jodi Picoult novel and it will be my last. Although more interesting than the ones I read decades ago, this is basically a simple romance novel. Despite the interesting info on anthropology, the film industry and Native Americans, it is the same plot: boy meets girl, boy struggles, boy gets girl in the end. Along the way we are assaulted with filthy language and terribly violent images, not to mention sexual explicity. Why a young woman would want to ruin a nice story (mostly) with nastiness is beyond me. I'm just glad I borrowed this from my local library rather than waste any money."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I only gave this two stars because it kept me reading - but ????? This is not like any other Jodi Picoult book I have read. This is a trashy dime-store romance novel. What a letdown from an author who has written some excellent reads. Do not waste your time. Can I get the hours of my life back that I spent reading this trash?"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I have read two other books from picoult that are absolutely astonishing. I went to a book store looking for a book from her that did not land you in court system because I was getting sick of reading about judges and court. Well i chose this book and wish I did not. I've started it about four times and still am getting so bored and putting it down. I'm going to finish it but I hope non of her other books are like this one."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book was honestly a hard book to read, but not because it was bad. The book was very well written. And hard to put down a bit. Alex Rivers and Cassie Barrett are a Romeo and Juliet pair. Alex Rivers is the handsome sweetheart of Hollywood he meets Cassie on a movie shoot..and its a whirlwind from there. They seem to be the perfect couple, and all goes well. But..there's a secret..Alex beats Cassie, and she takes it, and as many do blames herself. Picture perfect was a good emotional read, and it goes through many things. You will love some characters and want to throttle others. If you are ok with the emotions of it, I do recommend this one."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"With this book, I will have read all of Ms. Picoult's novels..and haven't been disappointed with any of them."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This addresses the battered woman syndrome explaining why some continue to stay in these relationships."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Officer William Flying Horse is new to the Los Angeles Police Department.

However, reading this book really made me realize that I am not the only one experiencing the same stuff as Cassie is undergoing. If I was in Cassie's shoes, I would have done the one thing right ~~ to protect something so precious. It also helps to know that I am not the only one who was fooled by appearances. Not everything that glitters turn out to be gold. Picoult dives right into the scenery and the characters have more life than you would think. It's not as poignant as her later books, but I really enjoyed this one. I couldn't stop turning the pages even though I figure that if Cassie goes back to Alex, it wouldn't stop. Picoult also gives her usual twist at the ending ~~ this time leaving it open for the imagination. Once again, I am not disappointed with Picoult's talent. Too bad all authors aren't as talented and brillant as she is."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I have read several of Jodi Picoult's books and consider myself a devoted fan. However, I didn't even want to finish this book. It wasn't near as compelling or interesting as her others."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I had been waiting to read this book for quite a while. I've read all of Picoult's others and have loved most of them. As this was one of her first books, I didn't know what to expect.The premise intrigued me, but after about 200 pages, I couldn't take any more.The story dragged on and on, and I just got to the point where I couldn't even care about what happened to the characters anymore. While there were some interesting elements to the story, most of it was mundane and formulary.Cassie, a renound archeologist falls for a movie star, Alex Rivers. She always questions how well she can ever trust an actor to ever be genuine, but regardless, she is swept into his spell. Warned against marrying him by a childhood friend who has died, but appears in her dreams, Cassie still goes with her feelings and marries Alex.Of course all is not what it seems, and Alex is not the man Cassie thought he was. Which leads to how the book began, Cassie, wandering around with amnesia. Rescued by a police officer/American Indian, the book has its hero.Not much more than a harlequin romance, this book is not worth the time. Try one of Picoult's others. Most of them are excellent books that will have you spellbound."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book is the literary equivelent of a video game. Although fans of soap operas may enjoy it, this novel is so far fetched it lacks any sort of credibility. All it needs is a swash-buckling, over-muscled pirate clutching a flame-haired, raven eyed damsel (or is it raven haired, flame eyed? I forget...)on the deck of a ship during a violent thunderstorm. Oh, well, maybe on her next novel...."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I love Jodi Picoult. She is one of my favorite authors. I liked this book, but I wanted to like it more. There's nothing wrong with the subject matter. Domestic violence is a serious issue and people need to be aware of it. What got to me was the emotion that oozed from every single scene, the excruciating psychological agony every character experienced, the nonstop telling us how everyone felt. It's as if they were all overacting, and even if it does take place in Hollywood, the author should have resisted the temptation to descend into melodrama. Thr ending left me feeling it was a hopeless cycle, whether Alex and Cassie got back together or found other partners. I mean, go back and check out Will again. He's a lot more similar to Alex than the first read-through makes you think. He's a career police officer who lost one job--why? It's not the best book she wrote but it is by no means bad. I disagree that Strange Fits of Passion was better. In fact, that one was so awful I stopped reading anything by Anita Shreve. Jodi Picoult writes on a far more intellectual level. I'll go on reading her books."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I have really enjoyed all of Jodi Picoult's books so far. However, this one didn't keep my interest.

It was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way. I enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable. I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I expected Very Good Conditon, not got the opposite!

Otherwise, book arrived fine."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I kept reading because Jodi Picult's writing style keeps me reading. The problem is I felt she sainted the battered wife and her abuser too much. He was so sorry and she was such a saint that she would take his beatings because she knew he didn't mean it. It was her fault anyway, right? Sickening. Battered women don't stay with their husbands becuase they are such saints. They stay because they are terrified. I wish she had made him a bit more of a bastard because thats what any man who beats a woman is. Even in the end she makes her ultimate decision \\"For Him\\" Please.

Once I started reading this book I could not stop.I, for the most part, love Jodi Picoult's books and this book was no exception. This book has it all love, drama, angst, and edge of your seat action and suspense. On a personal note my degree is in cultural anthropology and the main character is an anthropologist so maybe I felt a special connection to the main character of the book.For fans of Jodi Picoult's this book is a must read!As a side note this book does contain issues of spousal abuse and domestic violence which for some might be upsetting."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"To sum things up, this book could have been cut in half (at least!) and gotten the same point across.

I felt I couldn't connect, what with the subject matter and it having to deal with a celebrity type romance. I couldn't put it down though. I loved how the story unfurled, slowly, letting the readers get a real inside look at how this happens and how a smart, professional woman could even let this happen. People always think, \\"that would never happen to me\\" or \\"she's foolish for staying.\\" This is a fabulous portrayal of how a woman could indeed get sucked into this sick cycle. It was wound in with excellent and detailed settings, vivid characters, and excellent Lakota Sioux Indian tales woven throughout with surprising character twists.

My Sister's Keeper and Nineteen Minutes are so good, I can't believe this was from the same author. So predictable and boring."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is one of Jodi's older novels and does not have the shock factor of many of her recent controversial books. It was a very character driven plot, focusing on the marriage of anthropologist Cassie Barrett and Hollywood hunk Alex Rivers. While they seem to live the perfect life, Cassie is tormented by Alex's unpredictable moods and abusive behavior. It is a very emotional story, and though many may criticize Cassie for not abandoning this situation, she justifies her forgiveness and love in a way that is very common among abused spouses. It was well written with a great plot and I liked the effect of it being fairytale gone wrong."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi has always been able to bring characters to life and has certainly done so here.

There are numerous excellent reviews that detail the story so I won't add more print. However, I thought the story moved along at a brisk pace and overall it was a wonderful story. I'm not losing faith in Jodi; I'll still purchase her next novel, with a view towards that Picture Perfect being a temporary setback in her storytelling abilities."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"After reading Harvesting the Heart and Plain Truth, I was so impressed with Jodi Picoult's writing I wanted to read everything she's written. Picture Perfect was truly disappointing, though. The author describes over and over again the many times in which Cassie Rivers is beaten, kicked, shoved, bruised and knocked out by her husband Alex. After the second beating, I'd had about enough and just wanted to see how Cassie was going to resolve the situation, hopefully by leaving Alex. However, Jodi Picoult takes us through countless more scenes of domestic abuse before she's convinced that we truly fathom (yes, we get the picture) that it's a tough situation to get untangled from. I almost gave up on the book a few times, but kept reading, hoping it might get better somehow. It didn't happen. I'm just left wondering what happened to the wonderful wisdom and insight Jodi had in her other books."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it lost me in the first few chapters. There wasn't one likable character in the entire book. I thought much of it too far fetched to even be in the realm of believable.

It's difficult for me to explain exactly why I love this author so much - because it's sometimes an inner battle to even read her stories, because the topics are often painful or disturbing. But that's what makes her so good - and although I am admittedly an \\"escapist\\" reader who usually reads just for entertainment - reading this was still pure pleasure. A few other reviewers complained about implausibility in this story; I enjoyed the presentation of characters who were very diverse and accomplished, yet still flawed in such basic ways. I also enjoyed the method she uses in this story, the piecing together of the character's past in flashbacks. Good imagery, interesting characters, a great ending. Definitely worth reading, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"No one knows what goes on behind closed doors as Picoult proves in this story.

I LOVED that book. To this day, it is still my favorite Picoult novel. I soon realized she was the author of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" which had been made into a movie and I decided to give it a try. I found the subject interesting and the book much more appealing that the wishy-washy theatrical rendition. I then read several more of her books among which \\"Salem Falls\\" stood out.Finally I borrowed the audio book \\"Picture Perfect\\". I listened quite a long time, waiting for the usual deeply involved characters, interesting storyline, and ultimately startling ending... Halfway through the book, it finally dawned on me that this was not the Jodi Picoult I had come to like, but rather some imitation of the romance novels I quit reading some 25 years ago. Was I supposed to feel sorry for Alex Rivers or Cassie Barrett? Which one of those two pathetic characters was I supposed to like - or dislike? Because it's hard to feel anything for American movie star Alex Rivers who beats his wife behind closed doors or for Cassie Barrett, anthropologist, a woman in control of her life until she meets said Alex. Why she tolerates his outbursts and violent temper for years before finally leaving the jerk is beyond me. It's not like she had no financial options.This book was incredibly out of character and out of quality. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I didn't like this story at all. I didn't like any of the characters. Cassie in particular irritated me. She ad no endearing features for me. The story development was poor. Themes were introduced throughout the book that went nowhere, or had no real relevance or depth. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book was gripping to the point that I couldn't put it down! The book brought to light about abuse and the hardships of it for all involved. It had me filled with emotions, smiling one minute and tearing up the next minute. This is my favorite Jodi Picoult book thus far."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Keeping Faith, The Pact, and Harvesting the Heart are prime examples of Picoult's remarkable talent. I was enthralled by all three of those books. While Picture Perfect was a good read, it lacked the depth and beauty of the others. Still, it was enjoyable."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"After some of the not so stellar reviews of this book I was a little wary of buying it. All said and done, I do not regret it. It is a cautionary tale of what can happen to even the most \\"perfect\\" couples and the twisted forms that love can take.Cassie's tale will no doubt frustrate many readers and I felt as though the ending did not quite deliver, but I still enjoyed the book and would reccomend it."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Jodi Picoult never fails me. This is the 5th book of her that I've read, and despite the fact that it isn't one of her page-turning courtroom drama types, Picture Perfect ranks right up there with my favorite, Plain Truth.Anthropologist Cassie Barrett wakes up in a cemetary with a cut on her head and wondering how it got there. Will Flying Horse, a Native American police officer for the LAPD, finds Cassie wandering the streets and rescues her. Cassie doesn't know who she is or what she is doing -- a classic case of amnesia. Will aides in finding Cassie's family only to discover that she is none other than famous Hollywood actor Alex Rivers's wife! Slowly Cassie integrates back into Alex's life of fame, fortune, and house help. Until one day, triggered by something she sees, Cassie's memories and the reason for the cut on her head come flooding back to her. Now the only thing left for Cassie to do is escape....I don't know what it is exactly that made me love Picture Perfect so much. The writing, as always, was exceptional, and the style of the writing was very easy flowing. And the story itself was very interesting, honest and believeable. I am an avid fan of Jodi Picoult's and reading Picture Perfect was a solid reminder of why. Kudos to you, Jodi, for another wonderfully rendered portrait of a novel."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Now let's take a look at the real world. Wonderfully written as all of Picoult's books are; this one has a lot of heart, and a whole lot of selfless love or so Cassie thinks. Is her behavior selfless or foolish?Alex Rivers is a mega star in Hollywood and Cassie is the most unlikely of people to grace his arm at a premiere among the Hollywood golden set. She is an anthropologist with her head in the books and her mind on the next dig, happy to be in a bush jacket and jeans as she unearths her latest treasure. Two worlds collide in more ways than one when Alex and Cassie meet and marry.A study in abuse that will touch your heart, and leave you cheering for both sides because of the love the author so eloquently makes you feel for both characters. Ahhhh but just how much can one person take, and is there a way out, is the question that has to be answered. This book had me guessing till the last 25 pages. Picoult has a new book coming out in May titled PERFECT MATCH. I'll be first in line for that one too. This author has never disappointed me.

When her picture is published, her husband comes to pick her up, and to everyone's surprise, he is a famous movie star, Alex Rivers. Gradually Cassie's memory returns, although this is not described or explained well in the book. She begins to remember meeting Alex in Africa where she was asked to serve as a consultant on the set of a movie in which he portrays an archeologist, Cassie's real-life occupation. Alex wines and dines her and eventually asks her to marry him. They feel that they are perfectly suited to one another and are very much in love. However, the perfect picture is marred when Alex begins abusing Cassie, as a reaction to his own abusive childhood. In the typical way of battered wives, Cassie covers for Alex and tells herself that things will get better. Eventually she depends on the half/white, half/Lakota police officer who found her in the cemetery to help rescue her from a bad situation. The mysticism of the Lakota culture is part of the book, but somehow doesn't fit well with the rest of the story. Despite its flaws, the book did hold my attention because of the interesting characters created by author Picoult."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I first read The Pact by Picoult and became addicted to her work. Picture Perfect is another fine piece of work by this author. The only problem I could find with her book was the ugly cover (I think she needs to find a new publisher). Her words kept me glued to the page and I highly reccomend her work to any readers."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This book recounts the almost fairytale like romance and marriage of anthropologist, Cassie Barrett, and silver screen star, Alex Rivers. All that glitters, however, is not gold, as Cassie will soon discover. It seems that her handsome husband has a dark side to his personality.When Cassie undergoes some form of temporary amnesia, she makes the acquaintance of William Flying Horse, a rookie police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. He is immediately attracted to this lovely, though mysterious, woman. He treats her tenderly and, ultimately, falls in love with her. He does not reveal his feelings, however, as she is eventually claimed by her husband, who has been looking for her.As her memory returns, Cassie recalls what was it that drove her away from Alex. Unfortunately, Alex is the product of an abusive childhood, and the psychological trauma that he sustained growing up rears its ugly head in a way that is not conducive to a happy marriage. Cassie, however, is the great enabler, as she has allowed Alex to continue with this pattern of behavior, rationalizing it to herself.This is a formulaic story that the author tries to augment with some Native American Indian lore that is somewhat interesting but, ultimately, fails to carry the day, as it spirals into the ridiculous. All of the characters, including the Native American ones, are one dimensional and, consequently, the reader ends up caring very little about what happens to any one of them. Neither of the readers of this unabridged audio book are talented enough narrators to make this book into something other than what it is: a mediocre work of fiction not worth reading."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I originally picked up this book on the Bargain Books rack and was pleasantly surprised to learn that I had found a great author. I was very taken with the characters in this book and found myself thinking about them even after I had stopped reading for the day. I couldn't wait to finish it. I highly recommend it and look forward to reading another one of hers"},{"Title":"If I Had a Horse: How Different Life Would Be","review":"Quote from the book:\\"One of the earliest religious disappointments in a young girl's life devolves upon her unanswered prayer for a horse\\" (Phyllis Theroux)Indeed.The author doesn't quite capture the essence of life long yearning to be with horses; to always dream of owning your own horse and to have that dream just out of your grasp. The above quote from the book comes close to those feelings - and overall the book comes close, but doesn't quite hit the mark.The title is a bit misleading, or perhaps my expectations got the better of me; the author already lives with horses, has horses of her own, and is in daily contact with horses. Thus, I couldn't quite make the bridge between \\"If I had a horse\\" and \\"how different life would be\\" within the pages of this book. The text and quotes are more zen like in approach and philosophy, rather than describing life-altering changes.Nevertheless, this is a BEAUTIFUL book. The text is honest, thoughtful, spiritual and philosophical. The photographs in this book are equally beautiful, and truly compliment the text superbly. The photographer has done a wonderful job capturing the essence, heart and soul of equus.This is a slim book, less than 1/2\\" thick, and only 128 pages, but printed in hardcover, and bound on heavy semi-gloss paper. Every single page features full-colour photographs of horses, with the author's insightful text and selection of quotes from various sources.My only complaint (and it perhaps is a minor one) is that the stars and inspirati of this book - the horses themselves - go unmentioned. The author goes to the trouble to name her sources for the various quotations used, in a bibliography at the back of the book, but there is no mention of who the horses are, their names, what breed, where they're from, etc.This book also came with a DVD titled \\"The Beauty of Horses\\", featuring a generous 21-' minutes of live film footage of various horse breeds, from Arabians to Gypsy Vanners, Friesians, Appaloosa's and other horses. The music is a little annoying - but not overly so. How much better it would have been to let the horses speak for themselves in this DVD: the galloping of hooves, nostrils flaring and blowing, the clip-clop of hooves along a beach, horses neighing and snorting, tails swishing, etc. Instead the filmmaker opted to overdub with music and voiceover. This is perhaps a minor complaint, as the DVD production values are really well done, and the horses captured are beautiful to look at and inspiring.All in all, this is a wonderful addition to add to anyone's equine library, and I am sure horselover's young and old will enjoy looking at this book.~appaloosa11/03/2006"},{"Title":"If I Had a Horse: How Different Life Would Be","review":"For a horse owner this is an exquisite book and a relaxing insightful read.

The title promises to sympathize with this yearning, and instead progresses like this with the author's tale:\\"I was once like you, wanting a horse. Then I got one! And my life is such much better because of it! Let me tell you how much better!\\"The author/publisher would have been hard-pressed to pick a more misleading title for the book. Perhaps other people are less bitter than I am about being unable to have horses as part of my life, but after receiving this gift from a friend who bought it based on the title, I can't imagine a bigger slap in the face.I actually do agree with the posters above about the beautiful photos and quotes (less so about the prose, which I found vacuous).

My daughter who is 10 could not put it down and talked about it when we were riding our own horse.

I'd already heard about how Lise Meitner and Rosalynd Frankin had been side-lined by history writers, so I thought I'd do a project on the history of women in science. This book is a real eye opener. There are so many areas where women's contributions to science have been ignored or stolen by men that one can get quite agitated reading this book. Buy it, read it, and have your eyes opened. It is not a polemic against \\"bad men keeping good women down\\", for those who may be worried about such things. It is, however, an excellent historical-biographical account of the unsung heroes of science"},{"Title":"An Apprenticeship or the Book of Delights (Texas Pan American Series)","review":"The book of pleasures is a wonderful book where a woman, Dori, learns to have pleasure in life. She is a simple woman that was looking for love when she met Ulysses, a phylosophy teacher. He tells her that she does not know how to have pleasure and therefore she was not ready to be with him. She, then, goes into a very deep travel to inside, finding out love, hate, fear and pleasure. It's a wonderful and sensitive book... Specially made for women, with a feminin view of life."},{"Title":"An Apprenticeship or the Book of Delights (Texas Pan American Series)","review":"This book, written in 1969, five years into the military dictatorship in Brazil and one year after the momentous year of revolutions, is far more than one woman's education. It is that too, but like so much of Lispector's writing, the meaning of the book far exceeds what masquerades as the storyline. I find the didactic behavior of the professor in this book maddening. But when I think about it as a story about a paternalistic social (and military) order (represented by the man), then the education of the woman (in spirituality, in pleasure, in love, etc.) becomes more than one woman's solitary struggle. She comes to stand for another way of expressing all the aspects of life that she discovers. In this sense, it then becomes interesting to watch her struggle and be seduced by the examples or lessons of Ulysses/the dominant knowledge-power system and being true to her own discoveries. Ulysses is an important name though I have not entirely figured out its symbolism beyond the notion of a quest (The Odyssey) and wandering (Joyce's Ulysses) that it evokes. I've always felt, ultimately, that Dori could have gone so much further in her quest if she wasn't in an apprenticeship position in relation to Ulysses, and I'm still undecided as to whether this is in part one of the lessons of the the book itself: find your own way, don't merely rely on the One Who Supposedly Knows.Not my favorite Lispector book, but the themes she explores are pretty consistent through her work and her style is certainly one of the most beautiful."},{"Title":"An Apprenticeship or the Book of Delights (Texas Pan American Series)","review":"Lispector is an incredible writer, the type that causes me to wish I knew a time traveller so I could go back and try my darnedest to seduce her into bed. I say this absurd line because her writing, her style, her heart and her head are unlike any I've ever read or heard, ever. It seems so poignantly to fit the style of thinking that my generation (b. 1982) expresses, when they can express it, and blisteringly articulates in a style like kids my age strive for - when we're at our best, which is to say: longingly ambitious. I safely feel that I'm not projecting. I love Lispector and I hope we can increase the demand for her writing for both its relevance today and its timeless sincere outpouring of this tender Brazilian woman's bottomless heart."},{"Title":"The NinJew","review":"I did not sense the irony of that question until I finished page 84 of Richard Walters' \\"The NinJew\\". It was then that I realized how much I had taken away from this reading experience; how an author's request that I might read and review his practical and humorous memoir would somehow affect me so deeply... To explain this effect, I'll start with what remains vivid in my mind first... the grand finale of the book:\\"DON'T MESS WITH D'JEWS!\\" (pg. 84)This exuberant and emphatic declaration ends the story but begins my review...I enjoyed the twist of the storyline from semi non-fiction to semi-fiction in the last one third of the book. Walters' tale mildly reminded me of the books I have greatly enjoyed by the Christian author, Frank Peretti. For being his first foray into writing a book, especially one that is a hybrid of genres and encapsulates a varied content, Walters does a remarkable job keeping his reader alternately enthralled and on the edge of one's seat! He uses just enough fantastic imagery to lose the reader in a surrealistic atmosphere of the espionage capers of a Jewish warrior and his Jewish sidekick while drawing on the everyday knowledge that we are truely faced with the very real dangers of terrorism, not only here in the United States but abroad as well.Walters engages us with tidbits of his familial history by way of relating stories to his wife Marsha and/or sidekick Buddy as a way of entertaining distraction or encouragement. He creates images of days gone by in Pittsburgh, his hometown; days when his father was growing up in \\"a smoky, dirty, steel mill town\\" and coal was the source used for heating their homes. Days when hearing \\"hucksters\\" call out \\"Apples for Sale!\\" was common and his father watched other boys lose every hard-earned penny they'd made shooting craps. A lesson of \\"gamblers never win\\" was passed down to his son who later learned that Jewish law frowns on gambling. In turn, Walters and his wife made a conscious decision together to learn more about Judaism for the sake of their children. It was this decision that remains evident throughout this story of \\"The NinJew\\". (pg. 55)\\"Because of his [Rabbi Moshe Weingarten] teachings, we were inspired to a new way of life. I AM STILL FAR FROM PERFECT. At least, though, I have a Lighthouse to guide me when I am lost at sea.\\" (pg. 55)Walters' dedication to his Faith plays an innate role in not only his day to day home and spiritual life but also in his calling to share with others the vital importance of clean living and taking proper care of the bodies God has given us. He guides us through the setting and meeting of goals of healthy eating and strength training as he teaches them to his student Barry (who also doubles as Walters' sidekick as the story rolls on).He provides a brief step by step instructional for strength training coupled with his magic formula called \\"Sixty-Thirty-Ten-M-S\\". He outlines how to apply the formula starting on page 21 and does a wonderful job explaining the process complete with examples as well as some philosophical and intellectual support from noted sources.In my own newborn quest to find my way to healthy living and personal fitness, I find \\"The NinJew\\" to be a treasure trove of solid advice and support settled in a practical bed of knowledge. The road to revelation is embellished with bits and pieces of the life and times of a modern day Jewish warrior: Richard Walters by day and \\"The NinJew\\" by night...I'm please to make your acquaintance!~Diane AnjoueAuthor of \\"Collection de Jolie-Laide, wanting to be lost within...\\"www.aclassofasin.com"},{"Title":"The NinJew","review":"The mind-body connection has been explored by writers, philosophers, and doctors. Richard Walters offers a new take on this idea. In his semi-autobiographical book NINJEW, he unites practical health advice with spiritual insight. Ostensibly a book about strength-training, this work is also a musing on man's connection to G-d. In fact, the writing defies traditional categorization by genre as it is at once a memoir, a physical fitness guide, an action-packed novel, and a philosophical search for identity, meaning, truth, and justice. This is the ultimate self-help book, exemplifying one man's attempt to maximize his potential and underscoring \\"the capability of man to rise to nobility.\\" The author's description of life also serves as an apt description of his terse and intense book:\\"In G-d's great Omnimax Theater... life is filled with drama, comedy, violence, adventure, man against man, man against nature, and man against himself. It is my opinion that the last, man against himself, is the most difficult and challenging scene for each of us to face.

The \\"E\\" had been replaced with a Star of David. An interesting package for what was proposed to be an interesting story, half fiction, half biograpy.Richard Walters takes us through his training to become a healthier person, how he finds a side kick, how they learn to eat better and somehow squeeze in time to fight some terrorists that have infiltrated their area.The basis for the plot was an interesting idea, it involved how to stay spiritual within your everyday life; everything from eating, to sleeping to working out in the gym. Mr. Walters even uses his spirituality to take us on his quest to fight terrorism.Richard Walters (the main protagonist) and his sidekick Barry, met at Walters gymnasium when Barry came in to learn. Although Walters is writing about himself in the title role, he just never seems to develop who he is. We are giving snippets of his personal life, but never enough to round out who he is, other than someone who is almost fanatical in his own right, about lifting weights and praying while he does that, looking for guidance. Barry quickly follows in his footsteps. When we finally meet The Big One towards the end of the book, we get a physical description of him, but again never enough to really have a feel for who he is.The biggest detractor in the book was putting the two appendices right after the chapters rather than at the end of the book. This made for some very disjointed reading. I would have rather looked at them in my own time after I had read the book rather than having them forced upon me in the beginning of my reading time. The plot, while a good idea, never really gelled. It seemed to jump from time to time with no real segues or interludes to help you understand that time had passed. For instance, how did Barry go from holding a bow and arrow for the very first time to a page later (written as if it were a day later) using it to send out six arrows in perfect precision? Suspension of disbelief was stretched thin.I think this is a good start for a better story, a longer novel in the future. Perhaps if Mr Walters were to engage a writing coach he would lose the disjointedness, smooth the transitions and flesh out his characters.Teenagers and young adults would enjoy this as a quick evening read.I received a complimentary copy of The NinJew by Richard Walters as a member of theDorrance Publishing Book Review Team.

Author Richard Walters has promoted his book via a campaign of [...] Friend Requests.The workout and nutritional information are well-founded and easy to follow, but there are plenty of easier-to-use books on the market. The adventure is just weird beyond belief, and the text is smattered with references to G-d and his great Omnimax theater.

This book starts out as a fitness and exercise book, withsound exercises and good illustrative photography. Rich also offers a healthydiet regime, a balanced food intake to help us to nourish the new bodies we arebuilding.Unlike most workout books, Rich introduces us to the idea that we shouldhave a good profile towards our spiritual being, and through a combination ofanecdotes and narrative, explains that a healthy mind and spirit complement andenable a healthy body. It is refreshing to entertain the concept that physicaldevelopment goes hand in hand with that of the mind and the spirit.We are then made privy to the fact that the author is a practitioner of themartial arts and skills of the Ninja.In effect this makes Rich Walters the world's first Ninjew. This book nowtransforms into an adventure book in a method akin to a murder mystery cookbookbefore our eyes. Rich and his student are in pursuit of a nasty group ofvillains protected only by their martial skills and the dark night.By the end of the book, you may have a structure for developing bodystrength, muscle tone, and diet.

These themes weigh heavily in the first portion of the book yet are not overpowering, and actually serve to demonstrate well the mindset of a person with suicidal thoughts. In addition, she includes an intriguing insight into religious beliefs, subtly pointing out some of the hypocrycies therein. The second half of the work, a treatise on her neliefs of the role of poetry is also very valuable. She explains the need for emotional content in poetry and the necessity of clear presentation of these ideas.

Not here. I read the entire book, \\"Against Decoration\\" included, in two hours, and then read it again, and again. It's always a good sign when you read anything and your breath changes. Every one of these poems \\"stopped\\" me somehow, and the essay at the end made me grin and also fed the academic nerd in me. Karr mixes dirty and sweet in these beautiful, strong poems.

I was not disappointed. Reflecting on loss in various forms, Karr says what she means, and says it beautifully.No 'decoration' here - the poems prove that the poet's ideas presented in the essay \\"Against Decoration\\" (at the back of this book) work very well.The idea of poetry is a wonderful thing. At some point in childhood I was taught that poetry consists of beautiful words which cut to the core of the matter and which strongly, easily move the reader's emotions in few words. This idea really stuck with me, but I have never found a poet who so completely fulfilled it (few even came close, really) until I read Mary Karr."},{"Title":"Viper Rum","review":"Hooray to Mary Karr! the first reason I bought the bookwas the wisdom of the line&quot; we worship what we want&quot;, which is the foundation for the misdirection of American Spirituality.Then the second part of the book deals the pretenenous of the academic poetry movement in the hoity-toiety magazines and college sponsered quarterlies.References to Isoled and who the hell is tristan make me sick.

One can accuse Karr of neither. Like her prose, Karr's poems are direct and self-depracating, yet brimming with an emotion rendered with crystalline prose and multi-faceted images. Karr is an immensely talented and very important literary voice. I encourage anyone interested in poetry to pick up &quot;Viper Rum&quot;."},{"Title":"Viper Rum","review":"Viper Rum is annoying. I've read the book twice now and it's more so the second time. Most of her poems are what I call \\"merchandising misery.\\" Parents die, lovers leave, controlled or illicit substances do damage, and religion offers more horror than solace. Her language is clear but mostly flat, often \\"decorated\\" weirdly. For example, \\"In a few mornings no man will shave in my mirror/so I lie in misery's bed\\" precedes a graphic description of their last coupling \\"with moonlight on my back\\"; almost every poem has something comparable. Occasionally a striking image appears; she doesn't miss all the time. (Hence the second star in my rating.)But the truly annoying section of this book is her essay \\"Against Decoration,\\" where she expresses her disapproval of rich and skillfully deployed language, as practiced by Amy Clampitt, James Merrill, and others admired by the likes of Helen Vendler. Now, Clampitt's \\"What the Light Was Like\\" is one of my all time favorite poems, and Merrill dazzles me with his mastery of language. I learn from Helen Vendler, a lot. But Mary Karr thinks Clampitt's and Merrill's poetry are wildly over-decorated, and can't imagine why Vendler enjoys being mystified by poems. Karr's essay contains more than a whiff of, well, anti-intellectualism in the bad sense. She thinks \\"poetry's primary purpose is to stir emotion.\\" If annoyance is an emotion, then she has succeeded."},{"Title":"The Friendships of Women Workbook: Harnessing the Power in Our Heartwarming, Heartrending Relationships","review":"Being the oldest of three daughters and having a close relationship with my mom, I always knew that it was important to me to be surrounded by women.

The chapters on matriliny and the Bible are particularly compelling and well- supported as are the very foundations of Old and New Testament editing to support the patriarchial dogma which has prevailed thus far."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"Although it is not without flaws, the book is a landmark.The only thing better is Mary Daly's \\"Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism\\" (1978) which builds on Elizabeth Gould Davis's work."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"Elizabeth Gould Davis' \\"The First Sex\\" was written in 1971 and attempted to argue that women are the natural leaders of society and that humanity is being destroyed by patriarchy. The book is written in a very logical manner starting with what Gould Davis describes as \\"matriarchal queendoms\\" and states that these were culturally advanced and ecologically highly sustainable.She bases her arguments on the science of archaeology and anthropology as they developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She states that the patriarchal Christian and Jewish societies of the last five or six millennia have wanted to destroy remnants of this matriarchal culture because of their desire to suggest society had always been male-dominated, Moreover, Gould Davis constantly states that these religions and their gods and bloodthirsty and demanding sacrifices of animals in contrast to earlier goddesses who demanded only vegetables as sacrifices.The goddess religion, she argues, was a female montheism with priestesses wearing robes like those of male priests today. She argued that matriarchal societies possessed a much more genuine democracy than do modern patriarchal societies because human rights took precedence over property rights and there was no rigid moral conformity as there is in most patriarchal societies.Gould Davis spends the early part of her book on describing the \\"Golden Age\\" of mother-right, based on the idea of a pacifist humanity with a female deity. Before this, she states that all myth is built around the ideal of a \\"golden age\\", including that of the Fall in the Bible. Gould Davis sees the \\"fall\\" of mythology as relating to male gods taking over from the Great Goddess, man becoming carnivorous and mercy and justice being replaced with warlike vengeance. As stated above, she relies on archaeology to find evidence that there was no violence in these ancient matriarchal societies which she said were universal in the early days of humanity.She then moves onto the patriarchal revolution, saying that patriarchy probably first evolved in barbaric societies that relied on nomadic herding in arid climates, but which, with the spread of the Semites, moved into more settled agricultural societies with the coming of the Jews. (However, she says that India was the first civilised country to shift to father-right). She then in a systematic way traces the decline in the status of women from the advent of Christianity, which she saw as producing a huge decline in scholarship and scientific knowledge.Indeed she actually sees it as Christianity's job to submit women and repress their desire for power, and views the vast appeal of Catholicism today as spawning from the devotion to Mary rather than its patriarchal Trinity. As Marina Warner has said, this devotion to Mary is actually opposed to power for women because extreme feminisation (through a female deity) most likely according to contemporary psychology would make a culture have extremely rigid gender roles. Even men taking on the appearance of women is likely to be a preventitive device against masculinisation of women.Her idea that Charistianity was unusually barabric and violent does not agree wiht the research of many other scholars, for although there were wars in the Middle Ages they were not unusually severe. Even the idea that people were driven away from Christian Europe by despotic clergy is uncertain.However, despite the fact that Gould Davis has obviously done much research, her claims about continuing decline in the status of women since the nineteeth century. She does cite such philosophers as Rousseau very well, but she does not consider early feminists like Matilda Joslyn Gage or Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Moreover, recent discoveries in the field of archaeology have laid the gravest doubts concerning the existence of pacifist, matriachal societies in early humanity - Gould Davis may have not done a good job, for no reputable scholar today believes in the matriachates she describes. Even those suspicious of universal patriarchy do not accept matriarchies.Nonetheless, an enthralling read that can show just how far (and how deep) feminists are able to go if they have the brains and talent."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"If I could make everyone on the planet read one book, this would be it. Ms. Davis gives us a new slant on archeology, stripping away layer upon layer of gender bias to find our decidedly feminist roots.Note that the reviews listed below which are critical are written by men. This is the truth they can't handle, and the herstory they've tried so hard to bury. Even if you don't agree with the book's content, looking at history from a new perspective can only enhance ones world view. I disagree that the information has been \\"disproven\\". Rather, the vehemence with which it is attacked tells me that Davis was on to something.Absolutely essential for any woman's library."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"Elizabeth Gould Davis (1910-1974) was an American librarian in Sarasota, Florida, who wrote this pathbreaking book (which was very influential on the growing women's movement) in 1973. She said in the Introduction, \\"This work is the result of the convergence of two streams of thought: the first, that the earliest civilization we know was but a renewal of a then dimly remembered and now utterly forgotten older one; and the second, that the impelling and revivifying agent in what we know as civilization was woman... So long has the myth of feminine inferiority prevailed that women themselves find it hard to believe that their own sex was once and for a very long time the superior and dominant sex... We must repudiate two thousand years of propaganda concerning the inferiority of woman... the time has come to put woman back into the history books, and... to readmit her to the human race. Her contribution to civilization has been greater than man's, and man has overlooked her long enough.\\" (Pg. 15, 18)She uses mythology heavily, observing, \\"myth and tradition credit women with ALL the inventions and discoveries these words connote. And mythology, we repeat, is the memory of real events experienced by the human race.\\" (Pg. 42) She asserts, \\"When man substituted God for the Great Goddess he at the same time substituted authoritarian for humanistic values.\\" (Pg. 115) She suggests, \\"Patriarchal peoples place more emphasis in property rights than in human rights and more emphasis on rigid moral conformity than on concepts of justice and mercy... In the matriarchal view, the very right of society to establish arbitrary mores is questioned...\\" (Pg. 116)She says, \\"In the Old Testament Book of Judges, Deborah is a judge in Israel, and herself proclaims her status as head of the tribe: 'I, Deborah, arose a mother in Israel.' 'The children of Israel came to her for judgment,' says the book of Judges 4:4... Christian Bible commentators, horrified at the idea of a reigning queen in historical Israel, have transferred the judgeship to [her general] Barak and have made Deborah a mere 'prophetess,' subservient to Barak. But that is not the way the Bible tells it. And in this case, at least, the Bible can be trusted to be accurate.\\" (Pg. 129)She suggests, \\"If a mere two hundred odd years of slavery had so deleterious an effect on the character [of Arfican-Americans]... why haven't fifteen hundred years of slavery had the same effect on women? Perhaps woman has avoided complete inner degradation because she has an instinctive knowledge, an intuitive memory, of her original and still basic superiority...\\" (Pg. 314) She adds, \\"Man, not woman, clings to the outmoded patriarchal concept of woman as merely a helpmate to man. Woman looks further back... and she sees herself as nature intended her to be---the primary force in human advancement.\\" (Pg. 334)While some of Davis's rhetoric (from the heady early days of the women's movement) may seem a bit excessive to modern ears, this is a challenging, thought-provoking book that few readers will remain \\"neutral\\" about. I regard it as \\"essential reading\\" for anyone studying the historical and sociological status of woman, as well as the women's movement in this country and elsewhere."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"In short, I'm in love with this book, and now consider it a must-read for any woman. I find it uplifting, inspiring, and informative. It's well-written from start to finish -- clear and compelling and smart. I know that some of the research she draws on has been de-bunked or criticized, but frankly, that doesn't diminish the experience of reading this book, at least not for me."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"This book opened my eyes to a whole new world, one I had always felt existed but never knew anything about. I have sent this book to a couple of my close friends in hopes that they will be able to see our history."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"This is a book that absolutely must be taken with a grain of salt the size of the Hope Diamond, but it should not be discounted entirely. Ms. Davis makes many bold assertions in this book. Some of them are perfectly reasonable, like her claim that many pre-Christian, pre-Judaic cultures were goddess-worshipping cultures, and archaeological evidence demonstrates that these cultures frequently had a very high level of civilization, thus demonstrating that patriarchal culture has no monopoly on civilization, or that women have been treated rather shabbily (to put it mildly) by the Christo-Judean society of the last 3000 years; many are plausible, such as the assertion that some (many? most?) such cultures were matriarchies just as chauvinistic as later culture was in reverse.Others are more dubious, such as the assertion that the Biblical story of Cain and Abel is an attempt by a newly-fledged masculinist society to tell of the conflict between the old matriarchal civilization, which was agricultural (Cain, the elder brother, being the raiser of fruits and vegetables) and the newer, nomadic, meat-eating culture (Abel, the younger brother, being the shepherd), with Cain being cast in the role of the villain. Sounds plausible enough, until you start to wonder why a new culture would claim to have been symbolically &quot;killed&quot; by the old one.Then there are the highly dubious claims (in the old matrilineal societies, violence, even to animals, was unheard of) and the outright speculative (legends of the lost city of Atlantis are true, it was the site of the original prehistoric civilization that all other later civilizations, from Sumer down to Ur, Greece, and Egypt all devolved) and worst, the internally contradictory (on back-to-back pages, she makes the interestingly matched claims that A)women in some South-Pacific Island cultures, still relatively untouched by the masculinist modern society, still practice the age-old ritual of surgically breaking the hymens of their young girls before they reach puberty, thus avoiding an unpleasant first sexual experience, and B) that hymens are a recent evolutionary development, having only evolved since patriarchal culture began selecting for them -- itself an assertion in the &quot;highly dubious&quot; category, but absolutely incompatible with the previous one. Then there is her continuing difficulty in deciding whether to claim that matriarchal societies were peaceful and nonviolent, or that women leaders could, too, be great warrior-queens, fully the equal of any male warrior.Then there are the downright offensive bald-faced assertions, such as the statement casually made that all men hate all women.The problem is, these assertions are all made with identical (read absolute) confidence, spoken as unquestionable truth. Thus it is difficult to tell where the author's evaluation of evidence is accurate, where it is pure speculation, and where it is simply wrong. The temptation, after reading a couple of her more outreageous statements, is to simply assume that everything she says is wrong, and that does a disservice to her legitimate arguments. I will say that the book improved markedly with the beginning of Part III, &quot;Pre-Christian Women in the Celto-Ionian World&quot;. Her denunciations of the treatment of women in Christian culture from the time of Constantine rang true, and were very persuasive. Also, it helps to remember that this book was written in 1971, when women's treatment in our own society was only beginning to improve beyond the appalling stage.I strongly recommend avoiding this book for anyone who is uncertain of their ability to sift through the dubious and the silly without being unfairly influenced against the reasonable; surely, there must be more reasonable, well-written books that discuss her more plausible concepts. Unless, of course, you're a good old-fashioned chauvinist looking for cheap ammo with which to discredit any feminist argument by virtue of guilt by association. I must admit, in that case, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"Elizabeth Gould Davis' book THE FIRST SEX is the author's assertion that prehistory was matriarchal and that women are physical, mentally, and morally superior to men. Her aim is already questionable, for who would want to say one half of the human race is superior to the other, and her manner of carrying out the argument is ineffective.The problems with the book are manifold, and the difficulty in describing them all lies in where to even start. For one, Davis does not appear to have been qualified to write a book based on archeological and historical data, for being a common librarian she had no specialized training in the subjects. With no proficiency with, for example, Latin she has to interpret ancient sources by translations, and in one bizarre passage suggests that only women translators are capable of producing reliable results. While later saying that Christianity was made up entirely, she takes everything written in other ancient sources as dry fact insisting, for example, that the Amazons existed while most experts would now hold that they were a mere fanciful myth.Within the field of biology, her limited knowledge of the field and the outdatedness of her sources results in tired assertions such as that all children regardless of gender begin at conception as female, which modern science has shown to be a misconception based on visual appearance when there is always a clear genetic distinction.Davis makes a number of curious sidetracks into areas for which she simply has a personal distaste, even if they have no relation to her thesis. Christianity and Judaism particularly suffer. Her feelings for Judaism appalingly approach anti-semitism, with Jews being portrayed as distasteful and shifty barbarians whose ideas, introduced to the civilized (i.e. matriachal) world resulted in its downfall. Then with Christianity she does what she can to belittle it, calling it \\"the barbarous religion\\" and reducing all the sundry denominations of the faith into one single doctrine of evil. At times, this results in obvious contradictions, as when she writes that Christians made up stories of persecution and were really treated well in Rome, and then a mere couple of pages later notes that several Roman emperors persecuted Christians to a great degree.Finally, Davis drops a long expected bombshell in her afterword by proclaiming that we are now \\"on the threshold of the new Age of Aquarius\\", reducing what wasn't even a passable academic work to mere new-age claptrap.THE FIRST SEX, in the three decades since its appearance, has been extensively debunked, and thankfully contemporary readers are more likely to approach it through first hearing that it is nonsense. Cynthia Eller's THE MYTH OF MATRIARCHAL PREHISTORY is the most detailed of these critical examinations and essential reading if you intend on perusing Davis' book. Eller's book is admirable in that it shows how these crank ideas, by basing hopes upon an imaginary past, are actually harming the possibility of creating a just and equal society in the future.Davis' is a book of already objectionable premise made terrible by its spiteful tone and disregard for academic standards, and the ease by which it has been debunked. I really cannot recommend THE FIRST SEX; even for those looking for opposing voices in anthropological study there are better, more trustworthy works."},{"Title":"The first sex","review":"Now I know where Maureen Dowd gets her boring and rather idiotic rants that chic pseudo-intellectuals find so amusing while the \\"inbred\\" (in other words, dissenting free thinkers who actually do not just give blind praise to someone because of their gender,race, religion, ethnicity, etc.) hicks think of a reason why we wasted our time of this drivel.This crap has been disproven by many professional men and women time and time again. It is understandable that some women are angry at how they have been treated. However, some of them are becoming what they hate.

But he finds more than he bargained for, including a mad professor, raging grizzly bears, and the torture-loving Apache Indians.I recommend all of Joseph Altsheler's books, although Apache Gold is one of my favorites.

And have fun doing it.With observations running the gamut from &quot;intention deficit disorder&quot; to basketball coach Phil Jackson's attitude toward coaching his championship players, Chandler has a great time gently, relentlessly, humorously reminding us that the success of our relationships--how we deal with people--is all about US.

I found the authors latest book, The Story of You (wonderful!!!) and a previous book of his, Reinventing Yourself (just as wonderful!!!) to be absolutely phenomenal stuff.

Highly recommended! Excellent resource for everyone, especially helpful for someone who is now facing the fact that they will one day pass on from this life to eternity. ...I learned much from this well reasoned, Biblically based, and well researched study. It is a relatively easy read given the topic.In the first volume, Spend Eternity with God, Dr. Lutzer expresses a well reasoned Biblical view that draws on the writings of many others. He quotes people from Martin Luther to Ted Turner and comments on their views. ....In the second volume, One Minute After You Die, the author explains how we are all immortal beings and have an eternal destiny... Dr. Lutzer explains different views of eternity and what the Bible has to say about our eternal state before and after the return of Christ. Gives a Biblical view of what heaven will be like, deals with many related issues including suicide, the death of infants, what hell is like....In volume three, Your Eternal reward, the author details the review of this life...the Lord will walk with us through when we arrive in eternity. His encouraging words explain how sin is forgiven and past but work done for the kingdom of Christ after coming to a saving faith in him is rewarded.

The novel addresses the period in the mid 90's when computer gaming switched from 'nice pleasant' computer games--for example, the King's Quest series by Roberta Williams for Sierra--to first person shooters such as Doom. This sea change affected the companies and the gamers, often in very unexpected ways.McGinnis has been very sharp. There is a great deal of insight into the corporate politics that led to the promotion of better selling shoot 'em ups over games that had a lot more for your brain. His take on gaming is very good. For any gamer, the book is a real hoot to read, with parodies and satires on Sierra and its competitors. I assume he did a lot of research, as the era and situation are fully worked out, and echo with truth.I loved the puns he threw in, whether about games (Dan Destroyem instead of Duke Nukem), our society (the author hates Starbucks and the corporate think it embodies), even ourselves (in Heather, a teenaged gamer, he has created a character which sure sounds a lot like my own daughter!)It is rare to find any novel about gaming. Although important economically and culturally, 'mainstream' writers don't seem to think about it much. Maybe what we do in our daily lives isn't of interest to mainstream writers--but it is of interest, thank goodness, to McGinnis.In the end, the book has many funny and insightful points to make, but it is important to mention it is just not about the polticial or social points--the novel is very entertaining! It is funny and, at turns, very dramatic, even heartbreaking towards the end.This book deserves your attention if you care at all about our society, corporate overload, or computer gaming--or even, all three!"},{"Title":"Game Quest","review":"This isn't just a book about computer games, but a story about innovation and staying true to one's values in the face of money-hungry corporations. As such, I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Game Quest","review":"I hate adventure games.That's not a slight towards Leopold McGinnis' novel. It's a testament to the fact that, despite that opinion, Game Quest is really good.Indie/underground books have a tendency to focus on, shall we say, niche appeal. Like specific subject material. Like a family who develops adventure games in the early-to-mid 90s. Like Game Quest. But a lot of those books, in my experience, use that niche subject matter to cover up their own mediocre writing. Not so with Game Quest. See, adventure games - especially those of the adult variety - are a niche genre. And as such, to make a good adventure game, requires passion on the part of the developers (not unlike the passion of the Roberts family here). Game Quest, with that same niche subject matter, echoes that type of passion.It's plain to see McGinnis' love for the genre here, and the genre's pioneers - Sierra Entertainment, here fictionalized as Madre Entertainment. And that translates to some good writing. Sure, the voice may be a bit dry and dull at points, and it sometimes suffers from a case of \\"too much telling, not enough showing,\\" but to juggle so many characters - a family of four, and multiple Madre workers - takes a lot of skill, and McGinnis handles it well. There's an obvious love here for adventure games, and one the novel's greatest strengths comes from the simutaneous lampooning and celebration of the subject material. There are a lot of characters here - and yeah, inevitably, some of the workers do run together sometimes. But for the most part, characterization is spot-on, managing to be distinct and sympathetic at the same time. A particular highlight is Heather, the teenaged daughter, and it's a solid balance between a teenager who is still naive and 'finding herself,' if I may so use the cliche, but not completely witless either. And it's probably no mistake the company is named Madre, as Kendra is perhaps the most interesting character here. Here is a middle-aged woman, at the height of her career, juggling the responsibilities of work and family, with an interesting little commentary about psychological effects of video games, and too much work in general.It's a lot of fun to spot all the references - Doom, Duke Nukem, Tomb Raider, id Software, etc. They are, for the most part, fun and good-natured; it's when other references come into play that the novel takes a hit. The thinly-veiled attacks on Starbucks/Tim Horton's/big corporations - while serving as a key parallel to overall plot of the book - come too frequently for my own tastes. It's here that the writing comes off as McGinnis lecturing the reader, offering an obvious and uninteresting antagonist, so to speak. Particularly, McGinnis could have made Newman a more sympathetic character, or at least a little more understandable - but instead we're left with a one-sided moral story that comes off as a little preachy.But at 500 pages, Game Quest is a big novel, so that's a minor point. Interesting subject matter, well-drawn characters, and a package that's a wonderful homage to old computer game packaging - read it. Oh, and some awesome 8-bit sprites thrown in for good measure."},{"Title":"Game Quest","review":"This is a great read, and I'm not just saying that because Leopold McGinnis has had kind words about my writing. Game Quest is an engrossing, lengthy read about the swallowing-up of a small computer game company by a larger media corporation. It follows several characters over the two year period or so of the takeover. I found it quite interesting, and I interviewed Leopold about the novel, and I was surprised to find that it was somewhat based on a true story of what happened to Sierra, a computer game company, so those of you that were big computer game fans in the 1980s and 1990s will likely especially enjoy the way Leopold used what happened to Sierra as a springboard for the story he wanted to tell. The other point I'd like to make is that Leopold self-published the book. As a fellow independent author, I know it's very difficult to market a self-published novel. In addition to the usual lack of marketing budget (at least compared with the typical major publishing house), there still remains a lot of bias against self-publishing (despite it being a long tradition in literature). Many newspapers won't review self-published novels (they assume they're vanity press, or that the novel won't be widely distributed enough to merit coverage). Most of these notions are no longer true if they ever were (with the Internet there's really no such thing as limited distribution anymore--look at Amazon's reach--and a book is a book--it's either good or it's not regardless of the amount of money behind it; we can probably all think of numerous examples of bad books published by the big publishers). So if you've never heard of Game Quest before, that's all right. You probably wouldn't have. But it's a very good book, and well-worth reading whether you're interested in the video-game industry or not. And well most of the books that were hyped widely awhile back when Game Quest first came out are now on the bargain books rack shortly before entering the landfill, Game Quest continues to charm one reader at a time, and spread by word of mouth (and now Amazon). Give it a read!"},{"Title":"Game Quest","review":"This book is very good. Once I got into the story I started getting frustrated that I didn't have more time to devote each day to reading it. Then as I got close to the end I just gave up on the other things and plowed through it.The book starts with a bang. Then everything moves quickly and keeps you wanting to read more.I kept expecting the book to get weird and run off into odd computer geeky passages, but McGinnis does a good job of writing a novel, not a gimmick."},{"Title":"Game Quest","review":"Sick of the everyday franchise? How about a story that molds the every day and the fantastic... with video games? McGinnis tells a great story with solid prose and a strong sense of wit. An excellent read if one likes social commentary, video games, or just a good book. No angsting 15 year old farm boys, so there's your incentive right there."},{"Title":"Grown and Sexy","review":"Someone once described their anticipating of the release of a well known author's next book was much like waiting for Christmas Morning. You know it's going to be good and you can't wait until that day rolls around.It was with the same delight that I eagerly awaited Phillip Thomas Duck's second release \\"Grown and Sexy\\". Mr. Duck did not disappoint me. As an author, for me, true sign of a real talent is reading another author's working and thinking: \\"When I grow up, I want to write just like them.\\" I said it when he released \\"Playing with Destiny\\" and I said again when I finished \\"Grown and Sexy\\". Phillip Thomas Duck took me there, flipping the script and creating both characters and a story line that knocked me off my feet. In the world of overblown fiction, Phillip Thomas Duck is one of those rare true potent voices that puts you smack dab in the middle of his story and keeps you there until the very last word.It was a tough subject to tackle--the whole issue of the spirit versus the flesh, and Phillip pulled it off effortless. The journey of LeVar Path is filled with booby traps nearly every step of the way, but I was rooting for him from start to finish. Every now and then an author comes along that understands the true essence of what it means to be human and Phillip is such an author. He does not flinch from the truth, but brings it full force, so much so, you might feel the need to duck and take cover. What I really appreciated about the story was how there were no easy answers here and the characters faced real life ordeals, straight no chaser. I love a story that keeps it real and \\"Grown and Sexy\\" does just that. I've said it before and I will say again, Phillip Thomas Duck is a talent to be reckoned with. I look forward to many more books from this super talent.Margaret Johnson-HodgeAuthor of\\"This Time\\"\\"True Lies\\"\\"Butterscotch Blues\\""},{"Title":"Grown and Sexy","review":"Phillip Thomas Duck takes the readers to prison, church and the seedy sections of New Jersey in his novel Grown and Sexy. While in a North Carolina prison, LeVar Path finds the Lord and becomes a minister. Upon his release, he expects to start a new life with his woman, \\"Milkshake\\". However, his Milkshake has moved on and the word on the street is that the Ruffin brothers are looking for him. Instead of becoming their next victim, a broken-hearted LeVar moves to New Jersey to make amends with his father. While in New Jersey, LeVar has to find a job, so he answers an ad for an assistant pastor of the Fellowship Baptist Church. In a short time, circumstances have him serving as pastor, but is LeVar ready for this type of responsibility?LeVar finds himself attracted to a female member but she is married. This member finds herself a little attracted to the man of God as things at home are not quite right, but instead she introduces him to her sister, Zelda. With Zelda being the next best thing to the forbidden one, LeVar and Zelda plan a life together. However, Zelda has not revealed to LeVar her secrets. Her secrets that can not only destroy their relationship, but the relationship with her sister and Levar's standing in the church. All while he is preaching, romancing and making amends, the Ruffin brothers are still looking for revenge. In an exciting climax, the Ruffins appear and all hell breaks loose. Surprising twist and turns in the story are revealed.This novel, Grown and Sexy is supposed to be the follow up to Duck's debut novel, Playing with Destiny. For those who read the debut novel, perhaps you will remember some of the characters that are revisited, but you do not have to have read the first one to enjoy this offering. I thought the book was entertaining and all current popular themes (down low, urban, sex, and the other woman) covered nicely, although it was a bit too long..JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Grown and Sexy","review":"Freed from a North Carolina prison Leonard Furlow seeks to start anew far from the people he once harmed.

Levar struggles with temptation, but does not want to cause harm to a couple that have exchanged their vows in front of the Lord, but fearing a tragedy of sorts, wonders if he is doing the right thing especially by Bevolyn who seems to need more from him than just a tryst.GROWN AND SEXY is a commanding complex character study that enables the audience to see multiple perspectives on complicated often convoluted (not surprising people are involved) issues. The key cast members seem real as each scuffle with concerns that threatens to destroy their equilibrium. The \\"reborn-again\\" Levar is the center, who propels the solid story line forward.

Now newly released and born again, LeVar is now ready to let God lead him in the right direction. He's going to need all of the inner strength he can muster to deal with the various trials and temptations that will test his faith. LeVar has to flee to New Jersey when a murderous band of brothers hunt for him to get payback for the crime he's already paid for. A New Jersey church is looking for an associate pastor and LeVar applies and gets the job.

Bevolyn introduces LeVar to her available sister Sela. Sela and Levar have a blossoming relationship that tests their sexual restraints. But LeVar and Sela have some devastating secrets that could destroy their relationship.Grown and Sexy is an engaging novel by Phillip Thomas Duck. Duck has a knack for developing multifaceted characters with depth and warmth. LeVar Path's story was an enduring story in itself but the stories of the supporting characters were just as important. You feel the frustration of Russell as he tries to have the intimacy with Bevolyn that married couples need to survive. You'll sympathize with Sela when she has to make the hardest decision of her life. I liked how all of the characters lives were interconnected and the complexity of their relationships.

I've said it before the mark of a good read, is characters you can sink your teeth into and Grown and Sexy is full of them. There were times when I found myself rooting for Levar and times I just wanted to send him back to the slammer. Pretty much the same for all of the main characters.I believe that PTD is one of the best new writers out there and is on his way to becoming a member the AA best sellers club."},{"Title":"The Losers / High Hunt: Two Complete Novels","review":"&quot;The Losers&quot; is a contemporary novel that stars a man named Rapheal.

Shortly after this meeting, Raphael has a severe accident that will forever change his life. Raphael moves away, and thinks nothing of his old life until Damon finds him again.

Dan, who is the younger brother, has just been discharged from the Vietnam war. With nothing to do, Dan looks for his older brother Jack, who he has not seen in years. Dan is quickly taken in by Jack and Jack's friends. However, Jack's friends are not the most &quot;politically correct&quot; friends.

High Hunt was his first published novel, and The Losers was written in the '70s but wasn't published until 1992. I've ended up liking these works more than any of Eddings' other works.They're darker and richer in tone and content than most of his other works, and have none of the things I've come to actively dislike about his other novels; the group that, between them, can do almost anything, God-characters, stupid bad guys who don't even present a challenge to the protagonists, and very little suspense or feelings of danger. Instead, there is actual tragedy, struggle, and soulsearching. The characters actually interact and develop relationships, instead of merely quipping at each other all the time. They even experience pain and uncertainty without the overarching feeling that everything's happening as it should. The endings are ambiguous, with almost a bittersweet feel to them, instead of the overly-sugary endings of Eddings' other works. They are vastly different from what I had come to expect from David Eddings.I've taken more away from reading these two novels than I had with all Eddings' other works combined."},{"Title":"The Losers / High Hunt: Two Complete Novels","review":"Honestly, as far as these books go, they are not David Eddings.

At times hilarious, offensive, but always introspective and thought-provoking, the two novels lead the reader into an ever spiraling path of self-reflection. With witty commentary on the social customs of modern society and their affects on an individual, Eddings creates tales which are a must for those who consider themselves hardcore Eddings fan - allowing exposure to a side of the author that is merely hinted at in his fictional writings."},{"Title":"High tide at noon","review":"This absorbing family saga (the first volume in the Tide Trilogy) follows the life of its central character, Joanna Bennett, from girlhood to adulthood. Although that hardly qualifies as riveting subject matter, the novel is altogether satisfying on two levels.First, the setting is extraordinarily vivid and crucial to the action. Joanne lives on a small island off the coast of Maine, the daughter of a lobsterman and sister to 5 brothers struggling to earn a living in that same increasingly difficult way. The ocean in all its moods, the ever-present wind, the wheeling seagulls--these and other natural elements permeate the story in such a way that I felt I'd actually been living on the island by the time I'd finished reading the book. Most readers would agree it's a remarkable, and very pleasant, experience to have a book transport you so completely to another time and place.\\"High Tide at Noon\\" satisfies on a second level by making the reader care about the characters and what happens to them. Joanna's life as a young girl seems idyllic on the surface, but two men (one of whom she marries) bring plenty of trouble her way in due course. We also get to know the rest of her family, following them, as well, through the ups and downs of their lives--always with the sea and the disappearing lobster catches as background. When the lobster traps keep coming up empty, you care. I count that as an admirable achievement on the author's part....I want to find out what happens next.

His achievement should be celebrated forever. His writing style is not particularly good but the content of the story is unique. All cruising sailors should read this book.

If you pick one book to read about sailing, start here. People will be reading this for a thousand years. Our American Ulyses."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone around the World (Shambhala Library)","review":"The sea and inland waters have given us some great writers. Joseph Conrad was a sea captain, James Fenimore Cooper a naval lieutenant, Mark Twain a Mississippi River pilot, Herman Melville was an able-bodied seaman on whalers and a Naval frigate, Frederick Marryat a midshipman at Trafalgar and a captain when he wrote his first book. Joshua Slocum belongs among them for his writing ability, though he produced only two books, and only one is famous.In 1895 sailing for pleasure on long ocean passages was almost unknown. Such passages were the province of fully-crewed ships. When the owners of the schooner America wanted to race her in England, they crossed by steamer and left to professionals the task of sailing the vessel across the Atlantic. When the owners of the 54-foot sloop Alice, built in New Hampshire in 1866, wanted to cruise her in Europe, they hired Capt. Arthur Clark to sail the boat across, with a crew of three professionals, a steward, and two young amateur yachtsmen. Merchant ships invariably hailed her as a vessel in distress, assuming such a small yacht could only be so far at sea through misadventure.Slocum sailed out of Boston, Mass., April 24, 1895, alone on a 37-foot oyster sloop he had rebuilt from a hulk, with the intention of sailing alone around the world. The enterprise seemed foolish. But Slocum was a life-long mariner, had once owned his own ship, and had been tried for murder after shooting two mutineers who came at him with knives. He'd been shipwrecked on the coast of Brazil with his family, built a sampan with a junk rig, and sailed it back to the U.S. His boat, the Spray, was not ideal for the journey. An oyster boat has to be shallow, and such boats can be capsized. Most mariners prefer a boat that can be knocked down on their beam ends and still recover, but this was the boat Slocum had, so it's the one used. He'd tried to find a ship to command, but he was a sailing-ship skipper, and steam was taking over. He'd rebuilt the Spray and tried to make her pay fishing for cod, but found he'd lost the touch for jigging. So he did what he knew, and set out to sea again.His first wife had died, his second did not care for life at sea, so he sailed alone. He lacked a good chronometer, so celestial navigation was nearly impossible, though at one point he shot a lunar distance sight to confirm his longitude, a feat few modern mariners can do. He had two old alarm clocks he used for dead reckoning (if you reckon wrong, you're dead.)At every port, he was wined and dined, invited to tell the tale of his voyage so far. Sometimes those dinners became tales themselves, as when a head of state corrected him, saying you do not mean you are sailing around the world, you are sailing around in the world, because he thought the world was flat.There was no one with him to confirm his sea stories. He said that in the Mediterranean he was chased by a pirate felucca, which was rapidly overtaking him when a squall hit. He stopped to reef, but the felucca did not, and when the squall had passed the felucca was nowhere to be seen.The tale seems fanciful, but that is largely because of peoples' misconceptions about piracy. Piracy is armed robbery at sea. Most acts of piracy are not committed by career pirates in special pirate vessels. The poet Shelley was killed by pirates, who were in fact fishermen who had decided to kill him and rob him. One of them confessed on his death bed. In 1895, feluccas would have been in common use as commercial and fishing vessels. Slocum would have known something was up when a vessel made all sail to catch him in dangerous conditions.Or maybe he made it up. We don't know, and at some level, we don't care. He was a charming raconteur, and we accept his story on that basis rather than interrogating the work for its factual truth. He tells of becoming ill from eating bad plums, then hallucinating that Magellan's pilot sailed the vessel for him through the straits named after that explorer. Hey, it could have happened, and it's tales like that that got him wined and dined at every port.When he finished his voyage in 1898, the country was at war with Spain, and few paid attention to his arrival. He wrote his book, which was serialized in The Century magazine. The war was over by the time the book was finished, and the country was ready to give him his due. His book was an instant best seller, and is still in print today. His imitators in making long offshore passages in small boats are legion. There is a Joshua Slocum Society devoted to chronicling such voyages, though many people prefer to just go, and not tell the society. People have even raced around the world singlehanded without stopping, which I think misses the point of Slocum's voyage. He wasn't testing himself against the sea. He had a lifetime of sailing behind him. Of course, part of the adventure was the voyage, but a big part was the arrivals in new ports, meeting new people, and being part of each new port in a way no mere passenger on a steamship ever could be.Few people ventured offshore in small boats before Slocum. He showed it could be done, and his account of his adventures made others yearn for the romance of such adventures.At age 65, Slocum set out for one more solo voyage, this time to South America. He was never seen again."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone around the World (Shambhala Library)","review":"To fully enjoy this book you need maps of the voyage and the current &#34;reprint&#34; doesn't have them .

Those were the days when seamen were seamen, resourceful, brave, adventurous, tough. Sure we have very capable modern day seamen and women with those attributes but these days it's GPS, radio, Internet access, satellite phones, satellite based weather reports of upcoming storms...none of that in Slocum's days. No wild natives these days as Slocum encountered in the channels around Cape Horn. He was the first man to sail solo around the world and what a story it is.

The book is certainly good if you are a beginner in risk analysis in banking system. However, if you have some experience with it and you have knowledge of risk analysis then this is certainly not the book you would want. The book is written in a very nice, easy to understand language, but it covers concepts in a very basic manner so it might not be suitable for someone who already knows these things, but it would rather be frustrating because you spend [money] on the book. Definitely for the money paid it is not worth it.If you are indeed a beginner in this field then in general this book could be very useful because it gives many examples for almost every concept explained along with the appropriate figures.

Unfortunately publishers in an England still mourning the death of Queen Victoria thought the public wasn't ready for this new breed of escapist literature. Only after Baroness Orczy turned her novel into a successful stage play, was it eventually printed in 1905.Sir Percy Blakeney is a high living, 18th century action man. He leads the whole of England to think him a brainless fop, whilst in reality he's the mastermind behind the daring rescue of many a French aristocrat (aristo in those days having taken on a new meaning of anyone, regardless of birth, who objects to the revolutionary government)... the first hero with a secret identity.And what of the central character, Marguerite, who dreams about the mysterious hero whilst being contemptuous of her husband? A woman with brains and beauty, who pushed every 18th century boundary as far as a woman could (although you really have to read the rest of the series to get the full picture)... move over Lois Lane!Then there's Chauvelin, the sable clad villain (another first?). Orczy develops him so well over the series that you'll be willing him to win... just once!The Scarlet Pimpernel is the predecessor of Zorro (and in turn Batman), James Bond (and in turn Indiana Jones) and a whole host of other modern fictional heroes. Certainly, if you read this book and then watch the Schwarzenegger movie \\"True Lies\\", you'll never see it as a 007 spoof again. It's pure Scarlet Pimpernel updated!And which characters inspired Orczy to create Sir Percy? My guess would be Dickens' Sidney Carton and Conan-Doyle's Sherlock Holmes... but I could be wrong."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel is set during the French Reign of Terror, when aristocrats and royalists were being beheaded in the name of &quot;liberty, freedom, and brotherhood&quot;. The author creates The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, a band of Englishmen committed to helping aristocrats escape to England, and keep their heads. The head of this band of Englishmen is, of course, called by the code name The Scarlet Pimpernel. His identity is secret to all, even those he helps escape.This sets the scene for a &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; style swashbuckling adventure story. It is fun and exciting, full of suspense that lasts until the very end. There is a nice love story woven quite naturally into the fabric of the plot, that manages to add to the plot without being syrupy. The story also includes some thoughtful moments that excute simply without bogging down the story in the least. Overall, a very enjoyable novel. It treads lightly on the moral/ethical issues surrounding the French Revolution, and deals mostly with an adventuresome story. Those looking for a more 'serious' fictional work of the French Revolution may prefer A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"\\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is a swashbuckling tale of the French Revolution's reign of terror, only without any swords swashing, and open contempt for the revolutionaries.A couragous Englishman and a band of his fellow aristocrats rescue French nobles from death at the hands of unwashed masses who shout \\"Librete, Egalite, Fraternite!\\" and murder and suppress anyone associated with the earlier regime. The Englishmen don't do this out of duty, or opposition to the brutal leaders in France, but for the sport of it, or so they claim to conceal nobler motives. The sinister Chauvelin, an agent of the French Republic is dedicated to rooting out the Scarlet Pimpernel, the leader of the band who makes fools of the Revolution.Short, very readable, with engaging characters who have personal lives, flaws, and issues as well as heroic traits and adventures, this book is pretty darned good. Unlike most stories of late Eighteenth Century Europe, swordplay and violence in general is conspicuous by its absence. The Scarlet Pimpernel uses trickery, cunning, and audacity to outsmart the French authorities who are bent on his destruction as they try to murder the remnants of the French Aristocracy. I liked it a lot, and largely because it wouldn't get good reviews in todays media.\\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" shows the virtues of monarchy, the vices of democracy, the nobility of taking personal risk to life and limb for strangers, the villiany of the will of the masses, the weakness of grim single-minded determination, and above all, the strength of laughter and a light heart.

I am not going to ruin the book by telling you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is, but I would reccomend it to anyone, especially anyone interested in blackmail and spying or historical novels."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first read the Scarlet Pimpernel years ago. The writing style is florid and archaic by modern standards, it takes a bit of patience to get used to, but the Baroness wrote a classic. Using the horrors of the French Revolution as a background, Sir Percy Blakeney is a worthy successor to such dashing heroes as Robin Hood, using his wits, courage and disguises to foil the plots of the evil French Revolutionaries and save the lives of the condemned nobility. Do not expect a balanced view of the actions of the French Revolution, this is a story of adventure, with a dashing hero, and a beautiful heroine.Lord and Lady Blakeney move in the inner circles of English society, friends of His Majesty, the Prince of Wales. But by night, Lord Percy, who seems no more than a fashionable fribble, becomes the dashing and resourceful Scarlet Pimpernel, who with his faithful friends, rescues condemned French nobility from the very jaws of death.Marguerite, Lady Blakeney, a former French actress who was once naive enough to be tricked into helping condemn a French aristocratic family, is blackmailed into helping the villian, Chauvelin, unmask the Scarlet Pimpernel, unaware that he is none other than her lazy, indifferent husband. She and Percy have become man and wife in name only since he discovered her part in condemning the aristocrats. He loves her, but he cannot forgive her for lying to him about her part in such a brutal and pitiless act. All that goes by the wayside when Sir Percy is forced to act to save both his wife, whom he truly loves despite his behavior, and her brother, not to mention his own life, from Chauvelin's trap.This is old-fashioned high adventure, and it does seem silly at times, but the relationship between Marguerite and Percy is touching and romantic. A great read for a lazy afternoon that takes you back to a simpler, easier time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Okay first of all, if you are looking for a swashbuckling sword fighting adventure book you probably won't like this because The Scarlet Pimpernel (SP) does no fighting at all in this book. Later books, yes, but not this one. This is sorta like a Romantic Adventure Comedy. This is the only series of books that I can ever remember that has made me laugh out loud!And no, I'm not going to tell you who the SP is because its just one of those things you can't know before you read the book. The SP and his league are a band of englishmen who save french aristocrats from the guillotine and take them to england where they are safe. Well, the people who started the revoloution aren't happy about that! So they send Ambassador Chauvelin to england to find this SP. Chauvelin (pronounced Show vell lahn I think) Blackmails Marguerite Blakeney, the wife of the rich and foppish Sir Percy Blakeney, to find the SP. So she decides to find the SP for Chauvelin, and Marguerite gets in a whole heap of trouble. But not to worry because everything turns out fine. Really an entertaining book, and after you read this one I suggest you read some other books in the series. After you read the first one and understand everything that is going on is when the other books get sorta funny.

The French Revolution is well under hand; hundreds of aristocrats are being put to death through the guillotine. All in Paris is in terror of the guillotine and many of the aristocrats try to flee but are always caught until a band of brave and noble Englishmen risk their lives to protect the innocent. This group of men are led by a mysterious man known only as 'the Scarlet Pimpernel'. No one knows who he is and the French Revolutionists want to know badly so that they can capture and kill him. One of the leaders, Chauvelin, comes up with a plan to use a former citoyenne of France, Marguerite St. Just, as a spy. Now that she is married to one of the most fashionable and richest Englishmen, Sir Percy of Blackeney, she is the pivot of social London who hears and sees everything. She might find out who the Scarlet Pimpernel is. Though she refuses and says she wants to have nothing to do with the Revolution, Chauvelin blackmails her with a signed letter proving that her brother, Armand St. Just, is in league with the Scarlet Pimpernel. If she does not cooperate with him, Chauvelin will produce the letter to the head of the French council and Armand will be put to death. Marguerite, seeing no choice, agrees reluctantly. She has had many problems of her own. When she married Percy, everyone was gossiping why ever would she marry such a fop and an idiot when she could have chosen to marry anyone. But Marguerite is in love with Percy, because she feels that he is wearing a mask, and that being a fop is just a faade. A terrible thing happens on their wedding day because Percy finds out that Marguerite was involved in the execution of the whole St. Cyr family when she tells the Committee that Marquis de St. Cyr is a spy for the Scarlet Pimpernel. Though she pleads that she is innocent, which is true, Percy does not believe her and is cold towards her. So thus Marguerite has no one to turn to when Chauvelin blackmails her. At the Prince of Wales&#65533;s ball, she finds out that the Scarlet Pimpernel will be waiting for two of his accomplices in the library at the ball. Will Marguerite betray the Scarlet Pimpernel, or will she hand over the life of her dear brother, Armand?I love this book because it has plenty of adventure, action, mystery, suspense, and romance. One of my favorite parts of the book is where Sir Percy recites his poem, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel.&quot;&quot;They seek him here, they seek him there,Those Frenchies seek him everywhere,Is he in heaven or is he in hell,That demmed illusive Pimernel.&quot;Baroness Orczy made me feel for the characters. When Marguerite was scorned by the Comtesse de Tournay, I felt so bad for her and when Chauvelin is about to go into the library to find the Scarlet Pimpernel, I was in such suspense as to whether he would find him or not. This is a book which can be enjoyed by everyone. One of those classics that must, MUST, be read!If you enjoyed the book, I strongly recommend the 1982 version of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. With great actors Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymore, this is one of my favorite films to watch even after watching it so many times. There's also a 1934 version with Leslie Howard though I'm sorry to say I haven't seen it yet. Do want to see it though!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first saw several movie versions of \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" and always wanted to see the Play. With the purchase of a Kindle and text-to-speech I could not afford to pass up the book.I was amazed to see that the book started out like the movies with the telling of the blood lust of the French revolution and how one man for the sport of it saved many from the guillotine thwarting the authorities and tricking the sergeant at the city gate into letting him through.Then I was afraid the story was going to bog down as we took a long time to drudge through a scene in an inn. I did not realize that this was to introduce the major players in the soon to be mystery.The essence of the story was best said in the book:\\"Only between these two hearts there lay a strong, impassable barrier, built up on pride on both sides, which neither of them cared to be the first to demolish.\\"The story really picks up after Marguerite realizes what she has done by giving away the pimpernels identity and disides to make amends.Usually I cannot stand flowery writing or long descriptions of feelings. But for some reason this book was so well written that what would seem like extraneous information actually enhanced the tale. I also noticed it is told mostly from Lady Blakeney's point of view.Once again this is a case of the book being better than the movie. I was surprise to find the Pimpernel poem came from the book:They seek him here they seek him thereThem Frenchies seek him everywhere.Is he in Heaven?Is he in Hell?That damned elusive pimpernel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"About the Book:It is 1792 and the French Revolution is at its height. Hundreds of French aristocrats face the guillotine. However, many are saved by an elusive man known as the scarlet pimpernel. Using wit and disguise, the scarlet pimpernel and his band smuggle French aristos to English shores. Because of this elusive man, Chauvelin, a French republican, travels over to England to gather information. There he runs into Marguerite, a woman who was known for being a French actress and now is the top of England's fashion society. Chauvelin ends up threatening Marguerite with a fearsome either-or. She must gather information for him on the scarlet pimpernel or he will send her brother to the guillotine.Review:Upon hearing Douglas Sills sing int the 1997 Broadway musical, I was instantly in love and knew that I would have to read the book one day. Although I still adore the book, the musical still holds my heart. For one thing, we get to follow our hero more. Now, I completely understand why Orczy didn't follow him so much. It was meant to keep the mystery of the scarlet pimpernel a prolonged secret. Now, I knew who it was going to be from page one, but I have to agree with other reviewers that it was demmed obvious who it was early on.Another complaint I noticed a lot of reviewers made was that the book was very repetitive. Again, I would have to agree. Although it didn't bother me personally, I could see many people having trouble getting through it. Now, I can hear a good portion of you arguing that this was written in the 19th century so it is bound to be more wordy. Yes and I expected this and even a decent amount of repetition. However, I felt that half of this book could have been cut away.The only other issue I had with this book was the characters. The first example I would like to look at is Chauvelin. Now, I first came to know the character through the musical and the 1985 film. In both of these, he seems to show feelings for Marguerite. This did not occur in the book. Perhaps it is shown in one of the many sequels written by Baroness Orczy, but it is not shown in the initial novel. Now, this particular trait did not really bug me. I am fine with or without this love interest. What did bug me about Chauvelin's character was the the fact that he was little more than the villain in the story. He was much more endearing in the musical version where he is more well rounded and you can feel where he is coming from. Again, perhaps we see more of his character in the sequels, but in The Scarlet Pimpernel, he is hardly more than a bloodthirsty fiend.The other character I found myself disliking in the novel was actually Marguerite. I liked her well enough in the other medias I mentioned, and I also liked her early on in the book. However, for being the \\"cleverest woman in all of Europe,\\" she seems quite thick. Also, by the halfway point of the book, I was utterly sick of her for it seemed that she did little more than whine.Now, I can hear you asking, \\"It seems there was a lot you disliked so why the high rating?\\" Well, I usually find there is plenty of good to go with the bad, and even though The Scarlet Pimpernel had its faults, I still found myself enjoying it immensely. Granted, I am a tad bias. Anyone who knows me knows I have a fondness for 18th century fops, but even without that fondness, I found the story compelling and original (especially for its time). I also found a great liking in the fact that the scarlet pimpernel used wit and disguises rather than force and violence. Now, I am not one of those people who are strictly anti-violence, but I have always found my heroes more intriguing when they try to use their mind first.The other factor I was intrigued by was the mixture of both adventure and romance. I would not recommend this classic for a reader looking for mostly adventure however. Yes, the pimpernel's escapades are riveting and influenced heroes such as Zorro, but I'd say that 65-70% of the book related more to the romantic portion of the story. I, myself, was intrigued by it, but it may not be to everyone's liking and thus thought it would be worthy to note. Granted, my favourite parts of the book involved the pimpernel and the adventures that surrounded him, especially near the end when Chauvelin is hot on his trail. I don't want to give away the ending for it was most excellent (even if I did manage to figure the twist out). Even with that factor in play, I was reveled in joy and suspense to see how he would save himself, Marguerite, and the others.So all together, I found The Scarlet Pimpernel to be an excellent read. I may have disliked how some of the characters were portrayed; it could have been less repetitious, and it may be too slow of pace for some, but its story, wit, and adventure made it a wonderful classic that was well loved by this reader."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is a fun, rousing classic, filled with adventures, misconceptions, narrow escapes, and touches of romance, Victorian style (all chaste and clean). The Scarlet Pimpernel, and his gang of men run daring missions, rescuing French aristocrats from the clutches of the guillotine, during the height of the French Revolution, and managing to stay just one step ahead of being captured. I agree with and understand the many comparisons to Dumas and Sabatini. They all contain fast paced adventurous tales with suspense, intrigue and daring dos with dashing heroes, damsels in distress and damsels causing distress, and clearly defined villains that take joy in seeing the good guys squirm. Orczy's novel is not as tightly drawn, nor is it as vast in scope. It is a breezier read, with a smaller, more intimate cast of characters for the reader to focus on, making it great for young readers or as an introduction to this time period or genre, while it still holds much for the seasoned reader.What I didn't expect was how much more substantial Lady Blackeney's role was and the depth and complexity of her character. You are not sure where her loyalties lie, her home country of France, or her new adopted country of England, for or against her husband. We learn that prior to her marriage to Percy, she made a very selfish and foolish decision that had devastating consequences and lingering affects on the present.Written at the turn of the twentieth century, 'Pimpernel' is of its time, melodramatic, romantic with some touches of flowery prose, and lighter on the historical aspects than historical fiction novels of today. Originally, Baroness Orczy could not get her manuscript published; it was only after turning this into a very successful play, that it found its way to a publisher. This made me wonder if the book benefited from it having to be presented on the stage. Were the pacing and visual qualities present before it became a play or enhanced due to the play? Was the reader privy to the Scarlet Pimpernel's identity in the original manuscripts or after? The answers don't really matter, the results are what count and what have made this classic a fun ride of a read for generations. This read is an entertaining 3-1/2 stars!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel is a classic novel, though it is hard to categorize. It is part romance, part adventure, part spy thriller, and part superhero fiction. All of these elements went into the pot and the resulting stew is extremely entertaining.The book follows the adventures of Sir Percy Blakeney as he seeks to help French aristocrats escape the guillotine during the French Revolution. Since official English policy forbids this, Blakeney adopts a masked identity as the Scarlet Pimpernel to remain anonymous. The French, of course, detest this interference in their affairs and set out to trap and kill the Pimpernel at all costs. As part of his effort to deflect suspicion from himself, he plays the fool in every day life and he does it well. His own wife considers him a useless fop... and that's where the story really gets interesting.I won't give away more of the plot, but she ends up following him into danger in an attempt to save him. This allows the most suspenseful section of the book to be told from Mrs. Blakeney's perspective. Her terror for her husband's fate is pure and adds to the tension considerably. If we saw it through the Pimpernel's eyes, it would doubtless be far more composed and nowhere near as suspenseful.In closing, The Scarlet Pimpernel is well worth buying. It's laugh out loud funny, suspenseful, romantic, and generally quite a page-turner."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is a re-read for me, and one that I have to admit doesn't hold up nearly so well as an adult. Part of this is not the fault of the book as much as it is the fault of its many imitators. The foppish irresponsible aristocrat who is actually the super-competent avenger of justice has, in the meantime, been done-- done to death-- done again-- done some more. It lacks the kick that it had when I first read it so very long ago.None of which makes it a bad book, not at all. It is still fun to read. Lots of romantic not-quite betrayal, love and derring-do. I don't think it's really a great book, that's all.Orczy is worth a read simply for the influence that her work has had on other later authors. Don't expect too much, and you should be pleasantly surprised.(Has anyone out there read any of the follow-up books to Pimpernel? Despite having loved this as a kid, I never read any of the other books with Sir Percy as the main character. Are they any good? Leave me a comment and let me know.)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness OrczyThis book is a delightful read. Amazing love story!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"When I first began reading this book,I wasn't quite certain I was going to enjoy it, as the English prose wasn't quite my type. However, after the first few chapters, I became an ardent fan of this spellbinding novel! What an incredible love story it is...and it's not one of those books that you read once, and then put back on the shelf, never to be taken down again, either. It is one which you can read again and again, and each time you do, it is as new as when you FIRST read it. It is one of those few novels that retain innocent romantic dialog, and yet it is intriguingly poetic and beautiful beyond words. Everyone I've recommended this story to, agrees with me that it is well worth reading. The story of Percy and Marguerite, quickly becomes every girl's dream love story!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book was thoroughly enjoyable. It almost seems way ahead of it's time as an 1800s version of the modern thriller novel. This book is a great adventure and a spy thriller set in the time of the bloody French Revolution. It has romance, action, espionage, twists and turns, and fun characters. At times the plot is fairly predictable, but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is a fun and entertaining read if not deep. Definitely recommended as a light summer read and an alternative to much of today's popular novels."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The book is a great read with one of the best heroes ever created in fiction.

Is a good book for those who don't like to read but they have to because of a literary analysis class.... :)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I liked this book very much. I want to compare it's entertainment value to that of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; by R.L. Stevenson. Both, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; by Baroness Orczy and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; are of extreme value to the intermediate reader. Yet SP is a thrilling adventure involving the class struggle behind the French Revolution and, this might be appealing to individuals looking to piece together the jig saw puzzle that makes up Western Civilization. Although, SP doesn't bring out the general attraction as in &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. I felt my interests in the Comedy of Manners, espionange, and most recently, &quot;Les Miserable&quot; by Victor Hugo have been highlighted by this grand little story of an secret order with a ink drawing of a minuscule flower as a calling card. Sounds like Skull and Bones stuff to me. I was excited to read the page turner, SP and never the less, I wanted to save every episode that intwined the mystery of &quot;Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel's illustrious leader.The things that make young reader settle down to a good book are in this book. The last book I recomended to the young readers club at the down town library was &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, but I hadn't read the Scarlet Pimernel yet. A chill ran up my spine each time the Guillotine was mentioned and I was thrilled at the getaways. I am proud to say I am 39 and have read &quot;The Scarlet Pimernel&quot; I recently found out that this book has been used as the source for a Broadway Play. It is playing now. It's fun to fall apon current events and be up beat just by reading my books.

No, I wasn't forced. I disliked of my own free will. Perhaps because it's simply not my genre--there were times when one might call it &quot;thrilling&quot; and I had a soft spot for Chauvelin (villain et revolutionary!) From the very start, however, it was clear where Orkzy stood on the issues. Admitedly, the Revolution was out of control and had lost sight of it's motto: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity! But the first passages, in which Orkzy spits sarcasm at the very IDEA that the aristocracy had problems, are not remotely balanced. Politics ruined the read. Also, on a less subjective note, the Baroness is not a sophisticated writer. Her pros is far above, say, Michael Crighton's, but it lacks the sophistication of other &quot;classics&quot;. Once she fonds an adjective she likes, she sticks to it like a bulldog. When she forgets to call Chauvelin 'fox-like&quot; and &quot;shrewd&quot;, i begin to get insecure. Is he still shrewd?!! Are his lips still thin?!! This, of course, is merely my opinion. I happen to be rather fond of it, but there are many intelligent readers who disagree. Dem them!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The story is historical in setting, romantic and wrought with intrigue, the backdrop being the repercussive period immediately following the French revolution. The story, plotting rescue by The Scarlet Pimpernel of French aristocracy bound for the guillotine, is wonderful and satisfying.

Must read to understand."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book was much more romantic than I thought it would be. The story is told from the point of view of Sir Percy's wife, Maugeritte (or however one spells it), who is disappointingly witless and self-centered, with a sad case of female flutterness (&quot;Oh, what can I do, I'm just a WOMAN!&quot; etc.). However, since this book WAS written before Gloria Steinem, I'm willing to overlook that. Besides Maugeritte, the characters are wonderful, especially Percy, and the novel is very suspenseful. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic suspence novels and is not a member of N.O.W."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I liked this book, however, I did not find the beginning all that entertaining.

I gave this book no chance of surpassing either of those two. It did so easily. Because of the fast plot, surprises turn up at every turn of the page.

Marguerite's attitude to her husband is revolting. She treats him like a piece of meat until she finds out her husband's secret. Then she has a sudden change of personality. Many other characters had personal flaws which I did not like and the fact that the Scarlet Pimpernel escaped without harm and the way he did it is truly deus ex machina. The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernil is obvious very early in the book as well. How did this become a Puffin classic?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I was assigned to read a novel in my Junior year Dual Enrollment English class. For some reason, I chose the Scarlet Pimpernel, mainly because it was about 8 times shorter than Tom Jones or David Copperfield. I couldn't get into the book at all, and in fact, I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I'll try to read it again someday, but I doubt it. My advice? Read something else, like Tom Jones, where there are atleast Cliff Notes or a Movie about it. Maybe because everyone here has given this book 4 and 5 stars, it seems I have no clue what I'm talking about. I tried to give it a chance, but I simply could not follow the reading. If you are willing to give this dull and slow book a fair chance, by all means, go for it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I had to read this in 7th grade for English, and I could barley stay awake for it. It takes the character about 5 pages to do something as simple as pour themselves a glass of milk. We read this book in class and half of the class was asleep while reading it.

The book is written in that dry, stale, matter-of-fact style people were &quot;supposed&quot; to write in back in that day. Instead of describing excitement &amp; espionage, this book is more like an Ed Wood film: the writer talks about exciting things supposedly happening, but no excitement occurs. We're just supposed to assume there's adventure. Aside from the constant boredom, only an idiot wouldn't know who the Scarlet Pimpernel was by about page 20. Since it's so obvious, all the mystery is killed from the outset. From what I understand, the novel was never as popular as the play. I guess people didn't just stand around talking about exciting things happening in the play, but actually showed them taking place. If you're up one night &amp; can't get to sleep, read this book. It'll be lights-out for you in no time....."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"No doubt this was great reading 100 years ago. But to a modern reader, the book's age is apparent on every page. The central mystery of the book (the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel) is obvious well before it is revealed. The dialog is distractingly archaic and upper crust. The thoughts and concerns of the main character (Marguerite) are plain, without nuance or complexity, and by the end I was gritting my teeth every time she was described as &quot;the cleverest woman in Europe.&quot; The book's first sentence is great, and the first chapter is very good, but it's downhill from there. Baroness Orczy may have invented a genre of literature, but it is so familiar to us now that the original appears tired. It gets one star for illuminating historical aspects of the French Revolution."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one. Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once. The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature. The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain. The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment. Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The scarlet pimpernel is a classic novel of suspense and adventure.

However, as in many adventure novels, The Scarlet Pimpernel has a clever and discreet rival, Chauvelin.

Baroness Emmuska Orczy has revealed her talent extraordinarily by combining mystery, love, comedy, adventure, and the decision of betrayal or death to increase the velocity. Although the first few chapters of the book seemed to drag along with the setting of the Revolution, as I continued the story began to unfold and become more interesting and historically fun to read.In this book, the main character Sir Percy Blakeney, also secretly known as the Scarlet Pimpernel, and his Englishmen followers travel to France in disguises to rescue French aristocrats from persecution without getting caught. Meanwhile, Blackeney's wife, Marguerite, is being blackmailed by his relentless foe, Chauvelin, who is being sent by the French Republic to catch and reveal the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel. When Marguerite finds out that the Scarlet Pimpernel is her husband and realizes that she has been helping Chauvelin to kill him, she tries to warn him about Chauvelin's plot to capture and kill him before he walks into the fiendish trap.This original mystery is classic fun, adventurous, and full of romance.

Boy was I wrong! This, hands down, is my favorite book of all time. The characters were human (in terms of their personalities anyway), meaning they have the same flaws as you or me. And it wasn't just action and suspense....there was romance too. The relationship between Percy and Marguerite is beautifully orchestrated...there's one particular part in the book that shows the longing the two of them have for eachother. I wont describe it, but it had me in tears.

Well, I found it, and I love it! It's a classic, it got me intrigued, and now I'm hopefully going to read the other Pimpernel books one of these days. It has it's hilarious moments, it has moments where you want to read over and over again. It has spellbinding intrigue and moments where the plot and action is so tender you just want to bawl your eyes out. This book is said to be the perfect adventure.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Too many of my amazon friends have given up or strongly hinted at the ending to this classic tale. This reviewer will try to avoid that trap. Set in England at the time of the French Revolution, \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" features a brave Englishman who rescues French nobility from a certain date with the guillotine. Back home, the Brit is not taken seriously, usually described as \\"foppish\\". Across the Channel in France, he is the bravest guy around, carrying out daring rescues in a variety of disguises. Oh, those disguises! And that is all this reviewer will divulge! Those whose curiosity is whetted will just have to buy SP and read it. Though a bit florid, SP is fast reading, exciting and thoroughly enjoyable! A word on the movie version(s) seems required: The standard is the 1934 release with Leslie Howard as the SP, Merle Oberon as his wife, Lady Blakeley, and (in the \\"Prisoner of Zenda\\" tradition), Raymond Massey as the French agent, Chauvelin. There is a bad guy if ever there was one! The 1934 movie does NOT closely follow the book. Marguerite, Lady B, is vastly more prominent in print. That settled, enjoy SP in print or video. As is usually the case, the book wins but both are excellent entertainment in their own right. Isn't it poetic that Mr. Howard met his tragic real life demise as a British secret agent in WW2? Wouldn't Melanie have been proud of him?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book was wonderful. I'm 16 and I tell you, all teenagers out there read this book.

As a Zorro fan, I've often wondered if THE MARK OF ZORRO author, Johnston McCulley, drew on her work as inspiration for his own. I think he must have. If I'm right, then THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL was the start of a whole genre--that of the masked hero. Because Zorro became the inspiration for Batman, the Lone Ranger, and other such heroes. The similarities between THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL and THE MARK OF ZORRO lead me to believe it must be true. First of all, Sir Percy Blakeney and Don Diego Vega are both wealthy aristocrats. Both pretend to be lifeless fops, while leading double lives as dashing, daring heroes. Both rescue innocent people from evil government: the Scarlet Pimpernel rescues aristocrats from the French Revolution's guillotine, and El Zorro rescues innocent people from a wicked governor. Both leave their marks: The Scarlet Pimpernel leaves behind a small red flower--a pimpernel--and Zorro leaves behind a carved Z. Both lead bands of men, the Scarlet Pimpernel from the first, and Zorro late in the novel. And both are relentlessly pursued by evil governments determined to stop them from saving their victims. The list of similarities are, too me, too many and too striking to be coincidence. Johnston may have drawn on real-life bandidos from California history for the man he created, but I believe he drew on THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL for the plot."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I've read this book many, many times, always enjoying it.

It blended historical evidence with the elements of a legend.. if there was one thing i would change, that would have been the ending.. the end was just a little bit dissapointing because it was so systematic like a fairy tale.

If you are looking for a book that will charm and enthrall you, look no further. The Scarlet Pimpernel is it!

I couldn't peel my eyes off the pages as tension and suspicion mounted. The story will keep you riveted."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This review is directed primarily to ladies.This is a great book, girls! It starts out real gory, but hang in there (no pun intended), it will turn into an incredible romance.About 20 years ago, a college friend urged me to read the Scarlet Pimpernel. I read the first few pages and was so horrified by the bloodshed that I did not read further. That was a big mistake.After I graduated, I spotted the unabridged book in a CHILDREN's section of a library. What!? I checked it out and after I read past the first chapter or two, the story was so wonderful that I've been recommending it ever since.The first few gory pages set the scene. After you get through that the story develops into an amazing romance with lots of adventure.Warning: if you expect this book to end like the movie with Jane Seymour in it, it doesn't. The movie ending is actually the ending of one of the Scarlet Pimpernel sequels.This book has an OK ending, but if you want to read the dramatic ending that the movie has, you will also have to read one of the sequels, too--only I don't remember exactly which one it was.From what I remember the Baroness's husband helped her write the story and you can see his hand in it, I think, which really makes a great story. There are elements in it that are really action-packed and then there are the tender scenes. All nicely done, not too syrupy.This is a great book. Go for it. Read it, then the sequels. Also, I liked both versions of the movie. The old black and white with Leslie Howard and then the more modern version with Jane Seymore."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Torn between love for her brother and her husband, Lake Blakeney is tortured by doubt and guilt during the autumn of 1792--a turbulent year for France and her English sympathizers. Members of the hated French nobility (sacres aristos!) are ruthlessly hunted down, incarcerated, then executed to the jeers of the abused masses--grisly fodder for Madame Guillotine. Regardless of the justice or injustice of their fate, readers are treated to a gripping tale of vicious schemes, clever counterplots, and international intrigue. A band of 19 English aristocrats pledge life and loyalty to their audacious and ingenious leader, known cryptically by his signature flower: the Scarlet Pimpernel. This band of disguised heroes undertakes to rescue the doomed French nobility from the insatiable jaws of the Reign of Terror.Hounded by foxlike Chauvelin, the merciless agent for the bloodthirsty Republic, the Scarlet Pimpernel is walking into a fiendish trap--unwittingly set in motion by his own, unsuspecting wife, who does not realize his true personoa behind his foppish mask. The distraught woman, a former actress at the Comedie Francaise, is forced to make intolerable choices by her implacable foe who stalks her happiness, tirelessly pursuing theshadowy trail of the daring Pimpernel. How much emotional torture can a woman endure in such a short time? Once she tumbles onto the truth about her sham marriage, she realizes that the heart she scorned is truly a prize worth earning--even dying for! Romance, lust for political power, and duels of wit mark this fast-paced novel of intrigue set in the French Revolution on both shores of the Channel. This is a spy swashbuckler without the usual swordplay; instead, readers enjoy a lightning exchange of rapier wits, while two hearts struggle to deny their true passion."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Baroness Orzcy has written an amazing book of bravery, faith, and secrecy of the elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.

I loved it sooo much! I would recommend this book to anyone!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is probably the first spy thriller stories ever. The story is good enough, but it devolves (?) into a romance in the later chapters.The time is that of the French revolution during the Reign of Terror. An Englishman has been helping aristocrats escape/ He is beiong sought by the French authorities not only because he is helping those who the authorities consider traitors or enemies of France, but also because he taunts them with little notes left to be found after the deed is done and each with athe picture of a scarlet pimpernel, a flower from England. The story is of one more escapade that the Scarlet Pimpernel dares, only this time his wife is mixed up in it.As an American, I am not partial to aristocrats, but I am also not partial to killing people for little of no reason, so this story gets me to thinking of what the situation entailed and how to resolve it without killing and without sucking up to aristocrats. In the heat of the moment, the French people had no concern but for revenge or animosity for the aristocrats. This was well borne out by Margaret Blakely, the heroine, whose brother was beaten by lackeys of an aristocrat. Yet she later regretted the action because she abhorred the killing that ensued.I listened to this from a recording my Librevox. The recording was really well done. There were very good, if not professional, actors speaking the parts of the characters, laughing and chortling, etc., as called upon in the story. This separation of narrator and characters got a bit strange because when the quotes are broken into two parts by a 'she said' or some such, the narrator interrupted the dialog with those words. Usually the reader, doing all the parts, makes it a seamless translation between spoken and written. It is weird to listen to this, becoming more of a radio play crossed with a book reading."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The book itself is one of the very best classics out there, but there have been enough reviews and analysis written about the story, the writer, the sequels, and the characters.

I hope everyone will read and enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book is a great adventure story, but I found it very dry and overly-Romantic.The characters are less than two-dimensional. Marguerite is stunningly beautiful, talented, and rich. She's also named the cleverest woman in Europe. She thinks her husband a foolish imbecile whom she ridicules in front of others. On finding out his identity, all of a sudden she's madly in love. I couldn't help but dislike her. You'll get really tired by the hundredth time Orczy refers to Marguerite's 'womanly instinct', her 'woman's heart', or her 'woman's wits'! It's so stereotypical. Chauvelin is a silly, evil little scary-looking man. Sir Percy is most tolerable of these, I suppose.Although you can guess 'who wins', the plot itself is unpredictible. The climax was quite a surprise, I think, entirely unexpected. But it all comes to what you knew it would from page 1. It's just fun to read, nothing more. The events will keep you hooked and interested. The best thing about the book is the historical and political background, the mixed political views, providing much tension and intrigue in the story.The language is unimpressive. I know it's just an adventure-romance, but I've read other books of that genre with much more literary merit and character depth. If you like sophisticated classics don't read this book. If you're just looking for something fun and suspenseful, I highly recommend reading it. It's enjoyable, and I suppose we must give Orczy some credit for writing the first masked-hero adventure."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Well I'm in the middle of reading this book for a second time. Oh my gosh... if you haven't read this yet then there is not much that i can say because i'll end up telling you the whole story and then ruining the ending for you.

I picked it up but couldn't stomach the first few chapters. I put it down. When I was studying for my master's degree, I picked it back up and loved it once I got past that stuff in the beginning.Also, if you saw the movie first (any version), you won't find the movie ending in the book. The movie ending comes from a SP sequel.I catorgize this book as a romance. Yes, there is adventure, but the conflict is that the Scarlet Pimpernel married the love of his life only to lose trust in her on their wedding day when he discovers that she was responsible for a dasterdly deed that cost a French family their lives. His secret life must be hid from his wife as well as the rest of England and France.

Constant danger, wit, romance, and adventure befall the reader at every turn.I've noticed in other reviews that people complain about the book starting out slow or gruesome or whatever. I don't remember noticing this myself, but I think any book worth reading can take a little patience in parts. Just let yourself absorb the story and give the author a chance.

Orczy's dramatic writing fully captures the drama and the tragedy of the French Revolution. This novel has something for everyone: political intrigue, adventure and romance. I particularly appreciate the development of her three main characters. They live lives that require superhuman intellect and courage. All of them find themselves searching for something: whether it be love, power or heroic fulfillment. Orczy has a true talent for writing. She envelopes her plot with dramatic dressing. One can see this by reading the novel's first sentence: &quot;The seething, surging, mumuring crowd of people, human only in name...&quot; If you enjoy this book, I recommend you read her other titles in the series. Most are not in print, but usually libraries have some or most of the hard to get titles. My other favorite novel in the series is The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel.

It is brimming with action, suspense, romance and it is all crammed into a 200-page book. In the beginning, it may seem like a difficult read because the author is developing the characters and describing the setting, but once the plot begins in earnest, it is hard to put down.The story revolves around the elusive character, the Scarlet Pimpernel. Although his true identity is unknown, he is said to have rescued many French aristocrats from blade of the guillotine in France, to a safe haven in England. A French revolutionary official known as Chauvelin has been searching for the Scarlet Pimpernel for many years. He knows that the Scarlet Pimpernel is in the England, so he seeks the help of a prominent figure in England's society named Marguerite. Chauvelin claims to have the evidence to send her brother, Armand, to the guillotine, unless she finds the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel.

The work follows the emotional journey of Lady Marguerite Blakeney--from tolerating her foppish husband, Sir Percy, to pitying his faults to finally falling in love with him all over again.When Marguerite realizes that she has unwittingly betrayed Percy, she journies to France so that she may warn him or at least share in his horrible fate.One of the themes in the book is &quot;abandonment.&quot; As a child, Sir Percy was abandoned by his mother through &quot;losing her wits&quot; and her eventual death. Percy's father abandoned him through neglect. Marguerite literally abandoned Percy in the beginning of their marriage by briefly returning to her brother's house after making a shocking confession. After being abandoned so many times, it seems logical that Percy would be the one to play the role of hero--risking all for those in need.Most of all, this work is well known for Sir Percy's bon mot: We seek him here, We seek him there/Those Frenchies seek him everywhere..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Spoiler WarningsThis book is a delightful read. In contrast to the sorrow and heaviness of other books on the French Revolution (including Marie Antoinette The Journey by Antonia Fraser), this book is a very different take on the tragedy. Sir Percy vies with his wife Marguerite, a brilliant French actress, in terms of acting ability. He has mastered the role of a brainless dandy to such an extent that he is the last person anyone would suspect as having the wits and wherewithal to be the Scarlet Pimpernel. Aristocrats are spared the guillotine time after time thanks to this man's ingenuity.Shortly after Marguerite and Sir Percy marry, Marguerite tells Sir Percy of her involvement in the arrest of a certain marquis who had humiliated her brother. Marguerite does not tell her husband the whole story, including that she had no idea her words would be taken out of context and used against the marquis and that she had done everything within her influence to try to prevent the marquis's death at the guillotine. Sir Percy's attitude towards Marguerite changes: he is still the gallant he always was, but a certain coldness and reservation mark his manner. Marguerite had hoped that her husband would not need a full explanation, and that his worshipful devotion towards her would continue unabated. She is hurt by his changed opinion of her and retaliates with pointed sallies at Sir Percy's expense. She is considered one of the cleverest women in all of Europe, and she sharpens her wits by making fun of her husband, whom she wrongfully assumes is too unintelligent to take offense.It is not until Marguerite partially confides in her husband when her brother's life is threatened that Sir Percy learns the truth of Marguerite's (unintentional) involvement in the marquis's death. Sir Percy repents his false impressions of his wife and vows that he will do everything within his ability to save Marguerite's brother. As Marguerite makes her way up the staircase after this intense communication, Sir Percy actually kisses the stairs where Marguerite had just walked! His worshipful attitude towards her is renewed, and Marguerite for her own part recognizes how much she has loved her husband all along. But is it too late for the lovers? Marguerite was forced by circumstance to reveal information about the Scarlet Pimpernel to an unrelenting French commissioner (an obsessive, Javert-like character) before realizing that the same man is her own husband.The rest of the book is a clever game of cat and mouse, replete with a happily-ever-after ending (or rather, a happy-for-the-time-being ending, as there are more books in the Scarlet Pimpernel series).I had seen the movie with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour several years ago. Both the book and movie are equally wonderful, though the movie's storyline is a bit different. Anthony Andrews (whom I had a crush on as a young girl after seeing him in a TV miniseries) was beyond perfection in the title role, and of course, Jane Seymour was wonderful as Marguerite."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Before there was Batman, Superman, and Spiderman, there was the Scarlet Pimpernel, the greatest of all masked heroes, a man who uses his great intelligence and bravery to save French aristocrats from certain death at the guillotine.

I didn't think The Scarlet Pimpernel was all that good. The book is a light and easy read. It's even pretty fun. But I found it repetitive, predictable, and laughably melodramatic-even for the period in which it was written.I acknowledge that Pimpernel inspired Johnston McCulley's Zorro (which I really liked) and the whole \\"hero with a dual identity\\" genre. But when the old Stan Lee Spiderman comics I read to my kids have better plots and character development than this novel, I have to wonder why so many other reviewers gush over it.If you enjoy adventure novels, and want to get back to their origins, then Scarlet Pimpernel is certainly worth a read. It clearly influenced the genre. But for overall quality, it doesn't hold a candle to Alexandre Dumas, who wrote gripping adventure novels 50 years earlier and much better.Note: The book's flagrant anti-Semitism may offend some readers. Normally, this sort of thing doesn't phase me (old books reflect the attitudes of their time, and attitudes change, thank goodness), but even I raised an eyebrow more than once. So if you are easily offended, be forewarned."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first read this book because it was there in front of me,and I really had nothing else to do, it was sort of a let's read the back of the cereal box reaction to some gloom in having Winter vacation almost over. Eh hem, so I picked it up and loved the first chapter. I rushed on into the second, I started to get bored with it, and was somewhat disappointed. I was ready to put it down, until things started to pick up once more with the 3rd chapter, and from then on it was smooth going and wickedly easy to pay attention.First off...A PIMPERNEL IS A HUMBLE WAYSIDE ENGLISH FLOWER. SUCH AS A ROSE OR A DAISY OR A PANSY. In the book it's used as a communication symbol. Understand? Good.The plot? Well nowadays it isn't anything brand new, but for its time it was. This was the first &quot;masked hero&quot; kind of a story, which is pretty impressive considering we wouldn't have dear old Superman or Batman or Zorro or anybody if it weren't for that good old Scarlet Pimpernel. The Pimpernel rescues &quot;aristos&quot; and anyone else who needs the help, from the Reign of Terror in France. It's actually a very refreshing and fun book. I liked it a lot and think that its a true classic, which it is.The characters? Hehe, ok there's Percy Blakeney, that fool, that fop, that ridiculously annoying &quot;demmed idiot.&quot; There's his charming wife, Marguerite, who is considered the &quot;cleverest woman in all Europe&quot;. Her &quot;cleverness&quot; doesn't really show all too much, but after you look back at the end of the book you realize that your lasting impression is that she is definitely pretty darned clever. And heck, she is. There's Chauvelin. Ok he's the bad guy. He's nasty, and wicked, and despicable, and it's easy to hate him, yet I love him. Ok so now there's the Scarlet Pimpernel, who actually is --------, but no one but his best friends know that it's him. His friends are part of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and help rescue the &quot;innocent&quot; ( or maybe not so innocent) from the claws of the guillotine.The Scarlet Pimpernel has some extremely interesting escapes and I think that is where Orczy's imagination sets in. It is like Sherlock Holmes without the feeling of &quot;I have to figure this out.&quot; and more of &quot;I shall see how it plays out and relax a bit.&quot; The book is sometimes funny, in an odd way, but look to it more for some good romantic scenes and some great excitement. Good vs. Evil. Masked Hero. Brave lady. Happy Ending. It's one of those, feel good, refreshing, suspenseful, two hanky books.Heck it's only 3 bucks! Why don't ya just buy it? You shan't regret it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I picked up a bargain copy of this book from my local bookstore ... and fell in love with the Scarlet Pimpernel! I couldn't put it down. Sadly, the book ended too soon for my liking!I've since read most of the rest of the series, and have re-purchased the original book, and as many of the others, in library binding. They are a permanent addition to my home library.Note to a previous reviewer: Never read the introductions before the story! Inevitably there will always be spoilers. But the secret identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel is soon enough discovered in the 1st book anyway. The books may be enjoyed more for the simplicity and intrigue of adventure, than for a Zorro-like mystery of discovering the hero's identity."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"this book was great, the story was incredible. I remembered reading it years ago, and reread it when my friend wrote a take off of it. I'm currently taking a modern European History class, and what i remember of the book has it very factual, even if the pimpernel did not actually exist."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pipernel is like Zorro but more realistic. The new ruling class is subjecting the old ruling class to state terror during French Revelution. How do you get out of the hell, that Paris has now become? It is difficult there are check-points at every exit from Paris. But the Scarlet Pimpernel an English aristocrat is too smart and deceptive for the blood thirsty French revelutionaries. He makes them look like fools. He gets alot of people out with their heads still attached. Good old story and I now see the French Revolution in a different light"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I am a huge fan of the classics and this book is definitely a classic. This is a gripping tale of terror during the French Revolution and how one man, the Scarlet Pimpernel, and his followers decide to take a stand by helping people out of France. Meanwhile the brother of one of England's most important people, Lady Marguerite Blakeney (who is originally from France), married to Sir Percy Blakeney, returns to France on business. Soon after Percy also goes off to France on business. Then the French agent Chauvelin comes to Lady Blakeney with stunning evidence of her brother's treason against France and blackmails her into helping him find and apprehend the Scarlet Pimpernel, whom she admires from afar.

It's a little hard to get in to at first, but stick with it!!! It's well worth it in the end!!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is a superb adventure story. It's enjoyable reading and even more enjoyable re-reading. How often do you read a book that's so good that it makes you want to track down all of the sequels, even if they are now out of print? &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; is just such a book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"You can read a true review from the others----but in this case, the story is honestly, mostly about the marriage between a man and a woman, Lord and Lady Percy Blakeney. The conflict between them and the conflict of the French Republic. There is a lot on feelings and emotions---skip over that whole lot and you've got a darned skinny book. But the characters are good, its too bad there not fleshed out enough; however, they are intriguing. Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel? I'm sure we all know, but reading the true story makes it all the more wonderful to discover again."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"the Scarlett Pimpernel is an amazing book with great characters and plot. It imediately takes you into a world you cannot put down until you are done. Percy and Margarite are a magnificent couple and you really feel the love that is truely between them, especially at the end. Baroness Orczy was an amazing writer I am really sorry I didn't read this book before I did. I am glad to say their are 18 SCarlett pimpernel books which you can enjoy over and over-if you now were &quot;to seek them everywhere&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The book, \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is set in the 1700s and is about a man who rescues people from being sent to the guillotine. This Englishman is known to the world by his alias, the Scarlet Pimpernel, since he signs his letters with a small red flower, a pimpernel. Whenever he rescues a person from being put to death, he sends a letter to the Committee of Public Safety to tell them that he has succeeded again. A reward of five thousand francs is on his head.My favorite part of the book is at the very end when the Scarlet Pimpernel, disguised a certain Benjamin Rosenbaum, utters a \`good, solid, absolutely British \\"Damn!\\"' It is funny because the author, Orczy, writes the book in such a way so that you know that Benjamin is the Scarlet Pimpernel but you still don't expect him to flat out have a British accent when he is in France.My least favorite part is at the very beginning when it takes about five chapters to understand what is happening and who the characters were. But, it makes it even more exciting when you finally realize what is happening.I would recommend this book to no one younger than twelve years of age because it has many interesting words that maybe even some adults might not understand. The book was written in 1905 so one should expect it to have some strange language. If the reader enjoys historical fiction, then the reader will love the Scarlet Pimpernel. It has lots of action/rescue scenes but it is ultimately about a woman's love for her husband."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Orczy has an overheated prose style, and her characters are made of cardboard, but she managed to strike gold in this book. It's hard to tell if it was an accident or not. The sequels aren't as good - but then, they wouldn't be, would they?The Scarlet Pimpernel is an archetype. He feels as much a fictional god as Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes. The ending (by which I mean, the last third of the book) is nail-biting. Orczy doesn't over-bake, and certainly doesn't under-bake, the suspense: for once, her natural writing style is perfect, given the structure of the plot. This is a book you'll find yourself reading in one hit; and almost before you realise what has happened to you, you'll find that you've read one or two of the sequels as well. That is probably a mistake, but what the hell."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I am defiantly going to read the rest of them! This is the first of many Pimpernel stories, and it is very good. It has lovable character, wonderful twists, and a heartbreaking Love story. My mother and I both read it and Loved it!! I totally recommend it for anyone of any age I was 15 when I read it a year ago, and My mother is in her 40's, and We both loved it!!NOW THERE IS ONE THING I SHOULD WARN YOU ABOUT... The first few chapters are a little slow and you may be tempted to stop reading, but KEEP WITH IT!!!! It is so worth it!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I must agree with the South Carolina reviewer below, the good Baroness has a monarchy fixation. &quot;The CURS! How DARE they revolt against the good and wonderful French monarchy! Let them eat cake! ARRGGHHH!&quot;And her prose is a bitty bitty bit over the top. SIR PERCY IS GREAT AND CHAUVELIN IS EVIL AS WELL AS UGLY AS WELL AS STUPID! Did I mention Sir Percy is the best?Well, that said, this book has two things going for it:1- the compelling character of Sir Percy (NOT Percival like they say in all the movies, JUST Percy) He's marvelous, demmed marvelous. He is just so absolutely fun, you can forget about everything else.2- The ending. I won't give it away but it is SO cool!Here's an interesting theory that I must reveal to the world. Told from a different point of view, Citizen Chauvelin would be the good guy. Think about it. The ci-devant aristos who are responsible for starving the peasants, raping the women, enslaving the populace and growing fat off the land are escaping with the help of a shadowing foreign spy. It's up to Chauveln, brilliant investigator to catch him.Bottom line, if the Baroness had only allowed her characters to stand on their own merits, there would have been a great duel of wills but she is not satisfied at this, she has to force Sir Percy to win when it would have been more interesting if he had struggled for it.Worth the read if you like that sort of thing"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I loved this book when I was a teenager. Back then I still believed in honor, love, and marriage. I still believed that I'd make a mark upon the world. Though Baroness Orczy's THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL still stands the time of almost 40 years since I last read the book; I have changed. I no longer believe in love nor will I leave my mark upon the world -save my son and two young grandchildren. I am almost too old to have adventures, now that I am in the autumn of my life. I leave the 5 star rating to the young, and keep the 4 star rating for the hope my youthful memories give me. Yet, that pleases me. I abhor regret.Originally published for the stage in 1930, the Baroness takes the reader back to the French Revolution when Marie Antoinette presumably said, \\"Let them eat.\\" Madame Guillotine is feeding ravishingly on entire French families, and one man is determined to stop the bloodshed. His calling card is known to his followers and those men, women, and children now living in England: the five petal red flower. The Scarlet Pimpernel is a good choice. The mysterious man, known by that name, secrets these innocent French subjects from imminent bloodshed to the blossom of a new life in England. But the ruthless French Agent Chauvelin relentlessly pursues the enigmatic Pimpernel.Enter the beautiful, but feckless, Lady Blakeney. Marguerite has already helped Chauvelin dispose of the marquis and his aristocratic family, much to the disdain of Lord Blakeney. Even colder towards his wife, he and her brother are more determined to complete their work in France. Realizing, the danger she has put the two men in, Marguerite follows them to France. Her actions after all have had unintended consequences and she must find Percy and her brother before two men become Madame Guillotine's next meal. The cat and mouse chase is on and Marguerite loves again the man she has sharpened her wit upon. There is so much more to Lord Blakeney than meets the eye."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I normally write long reviews, but I think I already said everything I need to say. This is a great story, and it will stick with you. I still smile when I think about it. I'm smiling right now, actually.The problem with the book is that it takes very long to get into. My mother gave up, and she can normally make it past these things. I was determined to read it, and once the plot actually started, I didn't want to put it down. The book's not that long, which makes it easier to manage than some classics.I DO recommend the book. I couldn't give it 5 stars, but it is honestly exciting. Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel? I would be cruel if I told you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The 1999 Audio Book produced by Brilliance Corporation and read by Michael Page truly does justice to Baroness Orczy's classic adventure / romance.Note: this version does require use of a stereo cassette player with full balance control (or a special adaptor for a personal stereo player with headphones) The total length is approximately 8 hours, however, due to the recording method, only 3 cassette tapes are used.Michael Page does a masterful job of reading and bringing the characters to life. The voice of each character is unique and identifiable. His accents and pronunciations are authentic enough to add to the story rather than to detract. His narrative voice is very pleasant and listenable.The details of this nearly 100 year old story are well covered in other reviews, and the story is thoroughly enjoyable to read. However, for those who prefer or require audio books, this is a highly recommended version of this enduring classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"It is most unfortunate that I must disagree with the vast majority of the reviewers of this book, as I had high hopes for it after hearing it compared to the work of Dumas. I was rather disappointed with The Scarlet Pimpernel, however, as I found it to be of rather mediocre quality. It was rather unpolished compared to Dumas, which is surprising considering the haste with which Dumas penned his numerous volumes. The Scarlet Pimpernel is simply not nearly as fun and exciting as either Dumas, Stevenson, Shellabarger, or Sabatini (the other swashbuckling authors). What I found most unappealing about it was Orczy's apparent underestimation of the reader. The first three quarters of the book is obviously supossed to leave the reader guessing as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it was rather easy to guess who it was early on in the book, and by the half-way point it was so blatantly obvious that no one could conceivably be surprised by the much-hyped discovery of the hero towards the end of the book. Add to this the over-the-top melodrama and frequently cheesy dialogue and you have the makings of an average adventure novel.Some may think that I have been harsh with this book. That may be so, but if it is it is because I am so shocked that others dare favorably compare this to the masterpieces of Dumas, or to the great Zorro writings of McCulley. Orczy is not a terrible writer, but it is rather outrageous to compare her to the great swashbuckler authors. She is almost entirely missing the raw spirit of adventure present in others, and this spirit is at the very heart of the adventures of those like Dumas. For me there was no point in this book where I was entheusiastically turning the pages, eager to find out what would happen to the main character, following with glee each turn of events. This is not at all because the main character is female. It is because the main character is not the hero, and is not even adventuresome. To be quite frank, she is rather boring until toward the very end of the book, and even then she does not endear herself to the reader in the manner of a D'Artagnan or an Edmond Dantes. There are no supporting characters worthy of comparison to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Even the villains are rather boring (not to mention wooden), leaving us with little to really care about in this book. I think author's intended \\"hook\\" was supossed to be the mystery about who the Scarlet Pimpernel is, but this was entirely lost by the half-way point, so I found the last half of the book rather unremarkable.The most redeeming merit of this book is not its enjoyability, but its historical significance. The dual persona of the hero was the inspiration for further variations on the theme, beginning with McCulley's Zorro in the early 20th century and subsequent rise of superheros. It is hard to imagine that such a motif is so recent, but we really do have Orczy to thank for that, and I am truly grateful, for The Mark of Zorro is one of my favorite books. Beyond that, however, my advice is to stick to Dumas, Stevenson, Shellabarger, and Sabatini. They are all far better than this.Overall grade: C+"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I have loved this book since i was 12 when i first read it - it gives you a close look at the French revolution - sure it is a bit sappy in parts but all in all a very good read !!!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Having read this book roughly 4 times now,I can fully back the review of 5 stars. It is by far the best tale of Revolutionary France that I've ever read. Sir Percy's foppish tendencies keep the reader entertained while Chauvelin chases after him,adding much suspense. Percy's love, Marguerite, is who every girl would like to be. She is famed, beautiful,and wife to the swashbuckley and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel. Of course,one cannot forget the abundance of run-ins with Madame la Guillotine! I highly recommend reading this book, no matter what your usual preference of literature may be. It's amazing! &quot;They seek him here,they seek him there. Those Frenchies seek him everywhere. Is he in heaven? or is he in hell? That demmed elusive Pimpernel.&quot; ~*"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I read a great abridged edition of Ivanhoe sometime around the sixth grade, and I've been absolutely hooked on swashbucklers ever since. I've pretty well read them all--from the classics by Scott, Dumas, Forster, Stevenson, and Sabatini to the more obscure (but great) works by Costain and Shellaburger to more contemporary novels like those by Perez-Reverte. Two of them, though, have always stood above the rest. One is Hope'sThe Prisoner of Zenda (Penguin Red Classics). The other, of course, is Baroness Orczy's The Scarlet Pimpernel.This is the story of Sir Percy, an English aristocrat who's known in public life as a fool, who secretly works to save French aristocrats. The story is told by his wife Marguerite, from whom he has been somewhat estranged, and who is gradually learning the truth of who she's married and who is learning to fall in love with her husband.There are many things to love about the novel. There's the mystery, as you gradually discover who the Scarlet Pimpernel is and how he carries out his rescues. There's the adventure, as Marguerite finds herself caught up in a perilous, and surprisingly suspenseful, rescue herself. Most of all, there's the romance, of a kind that's approached in a different direction from most swashbucklers (after all, they're already married at the beginning of the story, just not in love). The narration, told from Marguerite's perspective, is quite affecting.I'll admit, as have many reviewers, that the novel can be slow to get going. But it takes off soon enough, and the rest of the story is well worth the beginning thirty pages or so. The Scarlet Pimpernel is, in the end, one of the great swashbucklers ever written."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This was such a great book that it has found itself on my re-reads for the October,the finest month.

Although at some parts, not many at all, there was too little action, and very shappy love parts, not enough to destory the plot as so happens in many books.

It's got everything I like in a good adventure book or movie; suspense, action, a good love story, and a scene-stealing villain who's so cool you almost want him to win.

In The Scarlet Pimpernel, Baroness Orczy displays an incredible flair for the dramatic. Her book contains all the elements of a good play. For example, the plot's conflicts are clear from the first scene, and these conflicts heighten as the action moves along. The characters are very specifically drawn, and they develop as the conflicts heighten. The climax finds readers biting their nails, and the finale leaves them smiling in relief. As a senior interpretative speech major at Bob Jones University, I have chosen to perform The Scarlet Pimpernel as my Performance Recital. Baroness Orczy has made the task of performing this story a joy because of the dramatic elements she has skillfully woven into the fabric of her plot. This fabric forms a tapestry of romance, intrigue, and adventure--a tapestry that performers and readers alike cannot help but stand and admire."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"A very enjoyable book but very perdictable....I loved the history on the French culture and revolution....I do beleieve I will read the other books in the series just to see what happens next."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is one of the best books I've read.

All of this can be found in the Scarlet Pimpernel. A mysterious English hero and his band of cavaliers rescue French aristocrats from the clutches of the bloodthirsty revolutionists and their Madam Guillotine. Meanwhile a young French actress in England is forced to decide between saving her brother or the elusive Pimpernel, both whom she loves dearly. This is one of my favorite novels, but it is by no means difficult to read. Orczy can sometimes be repetitive, and sometimes she gives no proof to backup some the claims she makes. Example-Marguerite is the cleverest woman in all of Europe. This makes me think that this novel was written with a young audience in mind, but it does not make the novel any less exciting to read for anyone. The genius in the writing is not in these fine technical points, but in the extremely vivid and thrilling images pointed in your mind. Harry Potter fans will enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Ok. I was assigned to read this book by my teacher.

This is one of my all time favorite stories, but even my partiality to this story wasn't ebough to sustain my interest in these extremely dragging tapes."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I'd read this book and its numerous sequels as a young teenager, and I remember loving them. The dash, the adventure, the romance, the period charm ... These books seem to me to be the proto-type of dashing historical fiction (as perfected by Dorothy Dunnett). Recently, having suffered the clumsiness of the Broadway musical of the same name, I decided to go back to the source to rediscover the magic. But alas, it was not to be! I was surprised by how much it now grates against my adult sensibilities. The characters are two-dimensional and stereotypical (and irritatingly slow on the up-take), the dialogue unnatural (far too much repetition for instance of affected exclamations), the plot corny and the writing lacking in finesse. And of course, it is incredibly political incorrect in the dewy-eyed and over-romanticised view it takes of the (oh so wronged) noble nobility (I write sarcastically, of course). Truly great juvenile fiction can be well appreciated by the adult mind (See Diana Wynne Jones); unfortunately this one just doesn't cut it for me.Nonetheless, this really is a classic of its genre, so I would still recommend this to any young person, or anyone who is prepared to switch off his critical faculties and just enjoy an indulgent story."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This was an excellent page turning fluff novel. Or so it seemed, having just read a 600 pagebook on Napoleon's invasion of Russia...The author unfolded the story well and demonstrated a knack forsuspense and metaphor. Though some of the events were contrived and the story washistorically inaccurate a couple of times, the writing flowed and was gripping at times.This was an entertaining read. For French Rev fans, this novel did not get into the details of the French Revolution.In fact, the historical setting could have been almost any with no change to the basic plot.Again, this was an entertaining read and would be a great book for the beach or a flight overseas."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I've just finished this book, and I've definately enjoyed it. It's a great mix of romance and excitement and moves along at a fast pace after the first few chapters. Of course, I did figure out who the Scarlet Pimpernel was by the fourth chapter, and forsaw some of the other plot developments (the minute the Jew appeared, for example, I realized who he was), but once I settled in to enjoy the ride it didn't detract from the fun of the story. The writing shows talent, but I found myself wishing over and over that the author had had a good editor to point out all the times she overuses certain phrases. That one little thing would have improved the book lots. I probably would have liked it a lot more when I was little (about seven to nine) and read books like it obsessively. The hero is apropriately appealing (the way he talks reminds me of Lord Peter, what?), the heroine sympathetic in her numerous ethical struggles, and the descriptions of some of the scenes conjure up extremely vivid mental images.Overall, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; is fun and exciting, for the young and young at heart, as long as you sit back and don't let the repitions irritate you. I'd give it a try on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I hate, really hate giving a poor rating to a book that so many others have loved, but it must be done. Reading the reviews of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one expects Erol Flynn in print, with clever banter exchanged during swordfights, daring escapes, diabolical plotting by the villains. In the event, we get maybe one out of three.It's not that the novel is terribly written; there are some comlaints to be had there, but ultimately the book is too short for the complaints to matter. In fact, the novel starts out beautifully, with a French official bragging about how the Scarlet Pimpernel will never get past *him*, only to be duped himself. But after that first chapter it's Dullsville, with only an occasional spark of excitement. It's hard to get excited about a rich nobleman saving other rich noblemen, for one thing. For another, the gallant adventure promised is simply missing completely. If you want daring and dashing adventure, read The Three Musketeers - it's incredibly long, but you'll get much more satisfaction per page than you will here."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I am a fan of classic literature and find this story a littledull. The most annoying thing is the fact that Orczy repeats thingsover and over. It is so very irritating when you find the same thing out more than twenty times.I also feel that this book isn't geared toward an audience. The novice reader may like the repetitive nature so he or she can catch what is going on; but they will not endure the dragging plot. The advanced reader will become bored from hearing the same description over and over (i.e. the fact that \\"the net is closing around the \`aristos'\\" at the end) and barely finish the book because of its unappealing style. Furthermore, I think that the characters in the book rely on capricious events and call it &quot;wit.&quot; The fact that Marguerite is the smartest woman in all of Europe is never actually \\"shown\\" in the story. It is stated an innumerable amount of times; while she herself only makes a few clever comments in dialogue.As far as capricious events go, if you have read the book, think back at the chances of the happenings in the last chapters actually taking place ...In the end, I do not think The Scarlet Pimpernel is a good book. It has qualities that are ok but lack the development necessary to be great. I rate the book 3 stars because of its originality and the fact that some parts were ok. I feel that it is still so popular because of the &quot;superhero&quot; qualities that the Pimpernel has.If you want a real book, read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo. In my opinion it is the best novel ever written."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"We seek him here, we seek him there,Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.Is he in heaven? -Is he in hell?That demmed, elusive Pimpernel.The Scarlet Pimpernel takes place during the dark days of the French Revolution. When everyday a new aristocrat lost their heads beneath the platform of Madame la Guillotine. Until, however, when one Scarlet Pimpernel came to their rescue. The English Pimpernel and his many followers help save the lives of the French Aristos. With cunning and artful strategies, the Pimpernel is successful in tricking his many enemies, such as Bibot, which makes it easier for him to save many lives. The story also circles around Madame la Comtesse and her children, who were rescued by the Pimpernel, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lady Blakeney, Sir Percy, Lord Antony, Jellyband, Sally, Mr. Hempseed, and many others who are all connected someway with the Scarlet Pimpernel.The book was exciting at certain parts, while boring during the others. Though, it's one of the best historical-fiction books I've read. My favorite part happened in the beginning when Bibot was fooled by the elusive Pimpernel. I liked this part because Bibot let the Scarlet Pimpernel escape right after he finished criticizing those, like him, who let the Englishman escape. It was funny to me especially since it was him who kept on babbling about how he would never let the &quot;hero&quot; get past him, and how those who let him escape should be sent to the guillotine. I also liked this part because it showed how smart and keen the Pimpernel's strategies were. For example, I had no idea, what so ever, that the woman with the plague-stricken son was part of his plan to save Madame la Comtesse and her children.The parts discussing the rescues made by the Scarlet Pimpernel were exciting and kept me hooked. Though, there were only a few. Other than those few passages, the book was full of dialogue. Even though there was some action during the many pages dialogue, like when Lady Blackeney and Madame la Comtesse reunited, I still struggled while reading the book. However, what made me continue reading the book was the fact that after almost every boring part in the book, the author always made up for it, either by having people argue, fight, or discuss the ways of the daring Scarlet Pimpernel."},{"Title":"The Burden of Brown: Thirty Years of School Desegregation","review":"The Burden of Brown is a great book for anyone wanting to study the problems of integration. A book like this is hard to find. Author Raymond Walters covers the history of integration beginning with a few years prior to the Brown desegregation ruling. This book is not exactly a polemic against integration; I consider it objective, but so many downsides to forced integration are presented that the reader will not come away with a positive outlook on all of the changes of the last half century regarding integration.Prior to the 1954 desegregation ruling, blacks had inferior schools due to their inability to raise as much money for their schools because they had less valuable property to tax than whites and did not create as much wealth. This lead to inequalities in how much funding was provided for black and white schools. Before Brown, some state governments decided to spend more on black schools to equalize them financially with the white schools, so they could avoid integration and uphold the separate but equal ruling. The Brown hearing itself involved a black family who did not want to bus their child to an all black school far away when there was a white one close by.The original ruling for desegration was interpreted to mean that a school could not use race as a basis for choosing its students; but there would be no forced busing to forcibly integrate a school to achieve a certain racial balance. But during the sixties, environmental explanations for black's inferior performance in schools came into vogue. It was considered that blacks in segregated schools were in inherently inferior schools because the segregated blacks got the impression that they were too inferior to participate in white society. Psychologist Kenneth Clark brought out his black and white dolls and found out that (gasp!) black children were choosing white dolls over black ones in the segregated south, which obviously meant that blacks were being psychologically warped into thinking they were inferior to whites in segregated schools. (It's silly, I know, but bear with me.)Consequently, the new solution ruled by the courts was to rule that schools had to forcibly integrated to achieve a certain racial balance so that blacks wouldn't feel inferior and that they would learn the values of white middle class society and maybe some of the smarts of one race would rub off on the other. Ability tracking was even done away with in some schools because it was thought that this rubbing-off principle wouldn't work if remedial students weren't sitting around the bright ones. And blacks disproportinately made up remedial classes. Never mind if brighter students were held back by the mediocre pace of a class with integrated intellectual levels.When the schools became forcibly integrated, there was a massive resistance by whites once they found out that in integrated schools crime and foul language were increasing and the standards of education were more geared towards integration and equality rather separation and quality. Even the many blacks were dissatified with forced busing and integrated classrooms that took no account of differing intellectual abilities. One mother complained that her daughter was frustated in the new integrated class because it was above her abilities.Whites began to move out of the inner cities to white suburban schools or, as in one case down south, whites closed the public school, which left the blacks without a school for a time, and created a private white segregated one. Integration worked better in places where there wasn't a high minority population such as in Topeka, but proved disastrous in places like Washington, DC and Wilmington, Delaware in which nearly all the whites eventually moved out as the schools became bad inner city schools.I saw the book as good demonstration of the weaknesses of the environmental theory of why races perform at differing levels. There is a general fear to say that such differences are innate since then the problem of differences can't be rectified by liberal social engineering and many people are loathe to differiate between inferior and superior in a society that believes in egalitarianism so much.Wolters himself comes to fuzzy conclusions near the end. At one moment, he says he supports getting back to local control over schools as opposed to federal control with its forced integration. In another moment, he seems to deplore the increasing segregation of northern schools and declares that more compulsion is needed. But other than that funny little line, Wolters lays down the cold, hard facts about the dire consequences of having integrated schools."},{"Title":"The Burden of Brown: Thirty Years of School Desegregation","review":"Only now are white children of this era coming of age and really looking back many of them, wondering oftentimes at lost lives and a sense that something went wrong with lives and aspirations. What was wrong in those years that made them uninterested in school? Had them being bored or dropping out? How did the politics make them feel? Why did they cease to care more about what had at one time been \\"their country?\\" A country where they could live and learn and were intersted in it? This kind of work can help such people by just showing that it was real, that things were going on in the background of their education that explain things that happened---like other kids taking advantage of them or stealing and no punishment ever being given. All kids in school now should read this and other books--- to understand the system they live in. This book should have been available to young kids--- to understand it wasn't all their imagination, the wrongness of certain things."},{"Title":"The Burden of Brown: Thirty Years of School Desegregation","review":"While I am no fan of political correctness, this is in fact a rather one sided view on the results of integrating American schools. As one who went to intergrated schools in the 1970s, I find some of what Wolters writes about undeniable. Yes there were many riots and yes not all Black kids were the innocent heroes often portayed in TV-movies of this era. But to completely dismiss school integration as a failure is asinine. Those of us who have experienced this era must also admit that in spite of the problems we had during this period, positive results such as lasting frinedship and better understanding among the races DID happen frequently (&quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; anyone?).If Wolters and others would like to go back to the days of seperate and unequal de jure schools and when fear prevented interracial friendships, they are welcome to take a trip on a one-way time machine backward. Meanwhile, many of us enjoy the present and the future just fine."},{"Title":"The Disinherited Mind","review":"Nihilism flickers with its black fire throught out the pages of this book and godlessness attends it as Erich Heller attempts to provide a spiritual physiognomy for the age.Goethe is the major figure of Heller's meditations and Nietzsche who tries to forge a new soul in a world where Goethe's project to head off rationalism and scientism has failed. Heller spends much useful time in explaining the reasons for Goethe's attempt to found an anti-newtonian science. Fittingly, the name of William Blake makes a brief appearance.Goethe saw the inhuman dimensions of the scientific project and where it was going with its inevitable war on poetic language and the construction of humane truths.Rilke and Yeats are also stars of the book, particularly Rilke who creates Nietzschean poetry, poetry that exalts a radical inwardness against a god-free world.I cannot diagram in this review the myriads of ideas and observations that make this book, The Disinherited Mind, so relevant to our own story. Erich Heller was one of the great titan critics of a century full of so many - Ernst Robert Curtius, Erich Auerbach, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and so many more. Heller read literature within a massive scope of historical awareness. His exegis is never dull but always as pertinent and relevant as the details in great adventure fiction."},{"Title":"Studies in the history of the renaissance","review":"Walter Pater was one of the mildest and least adventure seeking people imaginable. He was shy, retiring, and quite bookish. It came as a great surprise to him and to those who knew him well that his STUDIES IN THE HISTORY OF THE RENAISSANCE was trumpeted as a call to indulge in the wildest of sexual and artistic excesses. Oscar Wilde, during his trial for homosexuality, admitted that Pater's works had been a significant influence on him. Pater was the first Victorian writer not to adhere to the credo that one must at all costs hold to a continuation of the painful quest for Truth that had dominated Oxford since the days of Newman. Pater, to the delight of his days' youthful rebels, assured his readers that the quest was pointless. Truth, he claimed, was relative. Instead of echoing Carlyle's call to duty and social responsibility, Pater reminded his readers that life passes all too quickly and that our only duty is to enjoy life right now while they still can. He urged his readers to relish the sensations of art. In this sense, he was a forerunner of Timothy Leary, the later Harvard psychologist who said, \`Tune in, turn on, drop dead.' In the \`Preface', Pater sets forth his initial attempt to define beauty and the goal of the critic who seeks to do so: \`What is important then is not that the critic should possess a correct abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain kind of temperament the power of being deeply moved by the presence of beautiful objects.' It was the conclusion to his book that gave Pater his unwanted notoriety. He described life as a whirlpool with its \`flame more eager and devouring.' Life is a \`group of impressions--color, odor, texture--in the mind of the observer.' He urged his readers \`to burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy.' He concludes with: \`For our one chance in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as possible into the given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense of life, ecstasy, and sorrow of love.' Given that his readers were used to a call to live the straight and narrow life, Pater's call to \`ecstasy' sounded most inviting."},{"Title":"Studies in the history of the renaissance","review":"I bought this book on the basis of a rave mention of it in one of the other books I reviewed, it might have been a year ago. It's been sitting in my airplane pile for a while.At a professional level of erudite literary dissection and amplification, this is clearly both a supreme professional accomplishment and a labor of love. From the note to the bibliography to the chronology, this is one of the best constructed and presented \\"packages\\" I have ever held in my hands.It leaves me cold. I simply do not see, feel, or comprehend the bru-ha-ha over this being a clarion call to flagrant abandon, an ode to homosexuality, a challenge to the ruling class, etcetera.I *do* see the celebration of the senses and the emphasis on appreciation in context, each piece is different for each person, it is the interaction of the person, the piece, and the moment that \\"creates\\" the unique sensory experience.I *do* see the challenge to the Church and traditions (mostly very hypocritical as the prudes in public often turned out to be libertines in private).I *do* learn at aestheticism has been associated with homosexuality in the past, and have to look up the word to learn that its secular meaning is (Merriam Webster Online:1: a doctrine that the principles of beauty are basic to other and especially moral principles2: devotion to or emphasis on beauty or the cultivation of the artsI *do* get that the author (Pater) strives to celebrate both the human intellect and the human body as in \\"sound mind in sound body\\" but I do not see where this makes the book any kind of celebration of manly love.I paid special attention to the conclusion, and found it bland in relation to all the bru-ha-ha.One great quote:QUOTE (119): The service of philosophy, and of religion and culture as well, to the human spirit, is to startle it into a sharp and eager observation. ... Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself is the end.I love to read. I am now working my way throughThe Order of Things, a Catholic appreciation of philosophy, reality, and the cosmic, and I have to say that in relation to that and to Will Durant'sPhilosophy and the Social Problem: The Annotated Edition, I cannot recommend this book for anyone other than a fanatic student of the author, the literature on the literary history of the renaissance (not the same as the history of the renaissance).Seize the day--got it. Love it. That does not make this book, in my view, a manifesto for homosexuality.Instead of this book, I'd recommend the two above books, and these that struck me as much more valuable to the general reader:Mapping the Moral Domain: A Contribution of Women's Thinking to Psychological Theory and EducationPublic Philosophy: Essays on Morality in PoliticsRadical Man"},{"Title":"Mourning Art & Jewelry (Schiffer Art Books)","review":"This is without question the best book ever written on mourning jewelry, mourning customs/history and mourning art.

No one could mourn like the Victorians, that's for sure.This book is an excellent resource that focuses on art & jewelery from the Stuart, Georgian and Victorian eras. Though I think it should be noted there are far more examples of Georgian and Victorian than Stuart.I liked this book because it covered a number of different topics and had some amazing pictures. This is not a book that gives you pages upon pages of information. Often times the chapters are only a few pages long and at times the author does repeat herself. That being said, I haven't come across any other books that explains such a wide variety of mourning mementos.The pictures in this book are great and the author adds her knowledge to each piece explaining why they are unique. There is also a price attributed to each picture, however the prices seem to be out of date. When I look for various items they seem to be higher now. Perhaps more people are taking an interest in mourning mementos? Or maybe antiques are just overpriced in my area?The book is broken down into two sections. One is historical background the other Memorial art and Artifacts. There is also a translation for Latin terms and a glossary of symbols.In the first section we have:Death in the Middle AgesDeath in the Age of EnlightenmentDeath in Colonial AmericaDeath in the Victorian ageMary Todd Lincoln and Queen VictoriaDeath in the American Civil WarDeaths of children in 19 centSection II has:Mourning clothes and ritualMourning jewelryStuartGeorgianVictorianMemorial paintingsMemorial photographyFramed memorialshair workframed memorials of other materialspaintedpaperlithographstokens of remembrancepottery on glassunique objectsmourning art among minoritiesDeath of mourningOverall, I found this book very helpful.

On the contrary, Agar is opposed to this in many specific instances, and he believes that there would be problems even in developing such a technology ethically.However, he puts a case that there is no blanket objection to the technology, if it can, indeed, be developed. His concern is to identify the rights and wrongs of specific circumstances - e.g. he would oppose the technology for the purpose of conformity to a dominant racial image.This kind of nuanced contribution, neither rejecting advanced genetic technologies outright, with a shudder of revulsion, nor embracing them uncritically with libertarian glee, is what the public policy debate needs."},{"Title":"The Unfolding Drama of Redemption","review":"This study Guide to the Bible is perhaps the most complete and comprehensive work of the twentieth century on the Bible as a whole, aside from William Barclay's Daily Study Bible. A pastor who is approaching eighty and who has been preaching for fifty years told me one could use this work by W. Graham Scroggie along with William Barclay's Daily Study bible and have no need of seminary. Scroggie uses a critical method that answers modernist thought and secular criticism prior to 1975. His matrices which consistently compare events of the bible with time and history and intense logical approach makes this work necessary for any serious Christian study of scripture. Scroggie's love of the comprehensiveness of scripture is throughout the work that presents the bible as an outline of a play with the Prologue being Genesis 1:1 through Genesis 11:9, or Creation through the flood. Then Act I becomes Genesis 11:10 to Malachi. There is then an interlude where the author examines Judaism and Heathenism preparing the World for the Advent of the Messiah. Act Two is Matthew through Jude of the New Testament. The Epilogue of the Play or, &quot;Consummation of the Redeeming Purpose,&quot; is, &quot;The Book of Revelation.&quot; Scroggie presents the &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;post-modern&quot; world with an answer to the secular academic notion that the Bible is unapproachable other than as myth. This great work shows that argument as a shallow lie."},{"Title":"The Unfolding Drama of Redemption","review":"This book takes you through the entire Bible showing God's plan of redemption for mankind.

When I started reading the book I could not stop.The author presents the God's Redemption Plan as if it were many acts, like a theater play that culminates with the Christ's incarnation, life, death and resurrection. The plan continues in the life of Jesus' church.The reading is very pleasant and the author is a scholar with a deep knowledge of the Scriptures. The author, for example, offers a interesting view of the Ten Plagues of the Egypt sent by God through Moses, saying that each one was associated with an Egypt divinity ( the Pharaoh himself was viewed as a god in the ancient Egypt).I only regret that the book has not been written in Portuguese yet and I long for the day when it will be available for Spanish and Portuguese native speakers.I recommend the book for all those who want to understand the Scriptures and has a deep desire to make It understandable for others."},{"Title":"The Unfolding Drama of Redemption","review":"Get it and read it.

He does not get off into strange tangents, but provides accurate commentary from an established doctrinal school of thought. The book is written at a level where a layperson with an intermediate knowledge of the Bible can glean a lot from the book.This is a good overview of each book of the Bible.

They \\"strike sparks off each other,\\" as he describes it, and both fall in love with the other. However, neither will let on in any way. He wants her to come to love him on her own, you see. So, he maintains an impersonal relationship with her. A simple \\"I find you interesting and attractive, Julia, and I would very much like to get to know you better\\" would have sorted everything out. But, we wouldn't have this lovely story, now would we?Gerard, a wealthy doctor from Holland who drives a Rolls, and Julia, a young woman struggling to find her place in life, each think the other does not like them- not unbelievable since they got off to a rather rocky start. She has a temper and a tart tongue, at times, and is rather rude to Gerard. Gerard meets Julia as she is cutting up curtains for a new dress (shades of Gone With the Wind!) and then rescues her when her jerk of a date ditches her at a party at a hotel where he is attending an event. Gerard, brilliant in many ways but apparently not in the ways of women, asks her if she makes all her dresses from curtains. That's pretty low and you'd think he would have more sense to not say such a thing, if not simple common courtesy.The story takes place in both England and Holland, and there's the usual cast of extras: loving family, faithful retainers, dogs, cat, and a cad of a boyfriend. There is the prerequisite visit to Holland, but we aren't treated to much as a 'tourist.' That is, there's not a great deal of descriptions and Julia doesn't wander about the city checking out the famous places. He is a doctor, but since Julia is not a nurse, there isn't any talk of operations, instruments, or medical terms. And, there's no other woman/plotting socialite clinging to his arm!Despite the story being formulaic, it is one of my favorite Neels books and I've enjoyed rereading it. Julia is, well, independent, and she sets goals and then works to achieve them. She doesn't whine about her problems. Gerard, not an alpha-male hero, is nice (despite his unfortunate remarks about her curtain dress) and is neither high-handed nor controlling. He loves her and is content (too content, IMO) to sit back and wait for her to come to love him. Meanwhile, he is there for her, always seeming to show up or somehow be involved in her life when she needs help.So, I liked this one very much. There's excitement, cozy moments, and good characterizations. I like that we get to see what is going on in the minds of not only Julia, but also Gerard. Frankly, I rarely enjoy books where the hero is totally silent as to what is going on in his heart or head. And, the story skims along quite nicely, with a variety of action, problems, and locations. My only complaint is that the ending is quite abrupt. Otherwise, it is an enjoyable, sweet romance definitely worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"An Independent Woman","review":"Upon losing her poor-paying job and with both her sisters getting married and moving away, Julia is in financial troubled waters.

The utterly amateurish cover and inside typography detracts a great deal from the enjoyment of the book, which collects 15 of the roughly 34 Inspector Chafik stories published in Colliers, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, and John Bull between 1947 and 1969. Set in post-WWII Iraq, the stories feature a cunning Baghdad police inspector. Drawing on his wartime experience in Iraq, Child created a kind of stereotypical genius inspector who's smarter than everyone else and has those abstract leaps of intuition that are the mark of the brilliant fictional detective. Fortunately, he's not infallible, and in several stories must be rescued by his faithful assistant or his adopted son. In each, there is an initial murder which Chafik tackles, although sometimes he metes out his own form of justice rather than proceeding strictly according to law. The stories need to be read slowly over time, otherwise they tend to blur into each other as the author's style and construction is unvaried throughout. As a portrait of Baghdad, it's occasionally insightful. For example, in the stories Chafik deals with Armenians, Greeks, Sunnis, Shi'ites, city folks, villagers, rich, and poor. In that sense it does a good job of showing the diversity that exists in may Arab cities, but otherwise it's a fairly static and romanticized picture of Baghdad just before rapid modernization hits. Altogether, a moderately diverting collection of old-fashioned stories in an unusual setting."},{"Title":"The Sleuth of Baghdad","review":"Crippen landru continue their LOST CLASSICS series with a great adition, the Child stories.

Overberg, a professor of theology at Xavier University, presents the third edition of this book, which first appeared in 1991 and was updated in 1998. Throughout, he stresses the difficult work that goes into making honest ethical decisions and the potential for our choices to \\"build up or destroy our personal communal humanity.\\" The first three chapters address foundations of contemporary Catholic morality, the process of making moral decisions, and the question of infallibility. The final three chapters are devoted to sexual, medical, and social ethics.Each topic, from homosexuality to globalization, is considered in light of Church teaching, current debate, and legal considerations. The section on medical ethics covers stem cell research, cloning, HIV/Aids, and end-of-life issues. Overberg's treatment of \\"extraordinary\\" measures for preserving life, an issue likely to touch many of us, demonstrates the complexity of making moral choices in the face of conflicting information and confusing vocabulary.Time and again, Fr. Overberg emphasizes the complications involved in an honest search for truth, stressing that ethical decisions are rarely black or white and \\"Law and authority play significant roles, but do not necessarily ease the complexity of contemporary morality.\\" Though no easy answers are provided, each chapter ends with questions that encourage us to take seriously our obligation to exercise the three dimensions of conscience: desiring to do the right thing, diligently searching a variety of sources for wisdom and guidance, and making a specific judgment."},{"Title":"Conscience in Conflict: How to Make Moral Choices","review":"Author Kenneth Overberg sets forth his primary assumptions very early in this book by stating, 'Deeply rooted in the Catholic tradition is the conviction that morality is based on reality. Reality is God, human being and the rest of creation--all in relationship. Every moral dilemma presents a small but real slice of this totality.' Overberg draws heavily on the publication in the 1990s of the official Catechism of the Catholic Church and encyclicals such as The Splendor of Truth and The Gospel of Life in this third edition.While this book is written primarily with a Roman Catholic readership in mind (particularly for RCIA classes and other parish-based study groups), it can be used beneficially by Christians of any denomination. Indeed, it might well be suited for Anglican via-media Christians, given Overberg's emphasis of a discernment method that 'rejects the extremes of blind obedience and relativism.'The book is essentially broken into two parts. The first part develops the tools of the trade--asking the right questions in the right way, understanding who we are in the first place, and understanding our context as individuals who live in community are key issues. Overberg seeks a process that works when the answers are not binary options, but rather allow for middle ground. He also replaces the word 'should' with the word 'ought,' symbolic of authentic obligation rather than a socially-expected requirement. Of course, all of this working is contingent on the kind of people we are and see ourselves as being, which requires an understanding of the meaning of human life.The second part then uses these tools to look at three broad categories of issues: topics related to sexual morality (contraception, abortion, homosexuality all get tied together); medical topics (stem-cell research, euthanasia and life-support cessation issues, AIDS, the availability or lack thereof of medical treatment); and social ethics (globalism, war, economic justice). Overberg does not suggest definitive answers, and often not even tentative answers of his own, but rather in each instance repeats the official church teaching, the history of that teaching, where others within and outside the church have disagreed, and what the salient issues and genuine areas of honest disagreement may be. 'Merely repeating a teaching that has been seriously and respectfully questioned does not lead to the same kind of confidence,' Overberg states, as the kind of conversation and analysis that might lead to a fuller understanding, which might 'lead to change or to reaffirmation.' He applies the criteria from the first section specifically to the issues in the second.Overberg does not have an agenda to push, other than to prompt people to be more deliberate in their approach to moral decisions. In my seminary, one of the primary tasks of the introductory theology class was to distinguish between embedded theology and deliberative theology--that kind of theology that comes to us through various unconscious ways that we develop without being aware of it, and the kind that we understand and develop for ourselves. Students were often suspicious that we were trying to change their minds or their theologies, but in fact a deliberative approach can in fact strengthen what one already believes. Overberg's process of discussion of the different moral questions reminded me of that deliberative process, where it can in fact lead to a reaffirmation of one's beliefs as much as it might lead to a reappraisal.With its questions for discussion, this is a useful book for discussion groups, as well as for preparation by discussion group leaders. It is also a good text for individual readers to help clarify processes by which they come to moral decisions."},{"Title":"Conscience in Conflict: How to Make Moral Choices","review":"Ken Overberg, the collarless Jesuit theologian from Cincinnati's Xavier University, is one of the last people any conscientious Christian should consult to make moral choices.His modus operandi is to introduce confusion to settled Catholic doctrines, e.g., homosexuality, contraception, abortion, etc., usually by citing the opinions of other heterodox theologians, and then use that invented confusion as the baseline for decisionmaking.Take the example of homosexuality. While the Church urges compassion and understanding for homosexuals, it has condemned homosexual acts as always wrong in every circumstance for 2,000 years. Yet in the pages of the Catholic Telegraph, the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Fr. Overberg asked \\"whether it is right to require celibacy of all homosexuals\\" and suggested that such relationships ought to \\"be considered love-giving and life giving.\\"Readers should also know that Fr. Overberg's politics frequently colors his judgment. His immediate reaction to the September 11 atrocities was to place the responsibility at the feet of the United States, stating that it was up to the America to \\"end the root causes of violence.\\""},{"Title":"Conscience in Conflict: How to Make Moral Choices","review":"Please avoid this book if you are seriously trying to form your conscience. Fr Overberg has a way of presenting the magesterial teaching in the context of an argument that waters it down until it is barely recognizable. It would appear he only presents it so that he won't be disciplined by the Church. He can point to it and say that he teaches it. When in fact he undermines it in a most cunning way. This is what is so disturbing about this book. How ironic is that? A book written deceptively about conscience.In Fr Overberg's book he \\"quotes\\" liberally but selectively from Vatican II documents in a fashion that would make any \\"spin-doctor\\" proud. As one example: In the section where he discusses the authority of the magesterium he uses elipses (...)when quoting from Lumen Gentium 25 to skip over the essential phrases in the paragraph that were they included would make his writing incongruent and non-sensicle. If you insist on buying and reading this book I urge readers to have a copy of the original documents handy and look for this kind of thing. Fr. changes key words like \\"judge\\" to \\"interpret\\"... which changes the meaning.There are many other good books on conscience...What \\"we ought to do\\" is avoid this book.Update 4/5/2010I believe this book is nothing more than an attempt to assuage the guilty feelings of those who know they are violating the precepts of the church. It provides for them a weak justification for violating their own conscience. That is the ultimate irony here.It has been 3 1/2 years since I wrote the review above.Since then I have read \\"Veritatis Splendor\\" and was shocked to see that John Paul II had some of the same problems that I had. Right down to Fr Overberg's avoidance of the word \\"judge\\".This book is practically mentioned by name in that encyclical as having an approach to conscience that is problematic.Don't take my word for it read it for your self in sections 55 and 56.[...]lI quote:\\"In their desire to emphasize the \\"creative\\" character of conscience, certain authors no longer call its actions \\"judgments\\" but \\"decisions\\" : only by making these decisions \\"autonomously\\" would man be able to attain moral maturity. Some even hold that this process of maturing is inhibited by the excessively categorical position adopted by the Church's Magisterium in many moral questions; for them, the Church's interventions are the cause of unnecessary conflicts of conscience.56. In order to justify these positions, some authors have proposed a kind of double status of moral truth. Beyond the doctrinal and abstract level, one would have to acknowledge the priority of a certain more concrete existential consideration. The latter, by taking account of circumstances and the situation, could legitimately be the basis of certain exceptions to the general rule and thus permit one to do in practice and in good conscience what is qualified as intrinsically evil by the moral law. A separation, or even an opposition, is thus established in some cases between the teaching of the precept, which is valid in general, and the norm of the individual conscience, which would in fact make the final decision about what is good and what is evil. On this basis, an attempt is made to legitimize so-called \\"pastoral\\" solutions contrary to the teaching of the Magisterium, and to justify a \\"creative\\" hermeneutic according to which the moral conscience is in no way obliged, in every case, by a particular negative precept.No one can fail to realize that these approaches pose a challenge to the very identity of the moral conscience in relation to human freedom and God's law. Only the clarification made earlier with regard to the relationship, based on truth, between freedom and law makes possible a discernment concerning this \\"creative\\" understanding of conscience.\\"nuff' said!For a solid teaching on conscience I recommend Bishop Donald Wuerl's \\"The Catholic Way\\"The Catholic Way: Faith for Living Today"},{"Title":"Conscience in Conflict: How to Make Moral Choices","review":"This excellent overview of Moral Theology and the modern world was written by a Jesuit Priest (who should therefore be addressed by Catholics by his proper title) who has a Doctoral Degree in Moral Theology, and must therefore by recognized as PhD.The Copyright page reveals this important, insightful and illuminating study has received both the Catholic hierarchy's Nihil Obstat and Imprimaturs, etc., and are thus free from any doctrinal errors against the Catholic Church, but is full orthodox and unquestionably Catholic.

The book also seeks to raise a number of questions about the biggest sacred cow of all, the big bang.\\"\\"Masters of Time\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read, appealing to both scientists and non-scientists alike, that succeeds on three separate levels. First, it is a well written history of the development of modern cosmological theory in the 20th century, replete with amusing anecdotes, heroes, villains and goats, false leads and both successful and dead end research. Second, it is a quality primer for the non-scientist on virtually any topic one could name in the field of cosmology - microwave radiation, quasars, pulsars, black holes, cosmic strings, inflation, the great attractor, baryonic matter, lumpy galactic super clusters - the list just goes on and on. Finally, it is a cautionary tale that, in the spirit of Kuhn's discussion of paradigm shifts, suggests the big bang as a theory just may be in a world of trouble - too many unexplained glitches and too many theories that are simply unobservable, untestable or unreproducible. As a specific example, Boslough criticizes Guth's model of inflation in the early universe:\\"The reason for this apparent accuracy in explanatory power was of course simple: The inflationary theories had been created to do exactly this, explain the origin and evolution of the universe in terms that could stand up to observed detail. In the most simple terms, the theories had been constructed in such a way that they could not be disproved.\\"The problem with many of these models is that, while they explain observations with impeccable precision, they make no independent predictions that can be tested by further observation. We may or may not be in for the major paradigm shift that Kuhn predicts is on the way but I certainly agree with Boslough - skepticism and ongoing scrutiny of existing science is healthy. \\"Masters of Time\\" is a great read.

I greatly admired Cassidy's biography of Heisenberg in which he displayed great sensitivity for his subject, his work, and his times, not an easy task for the complex world of early quantum physics held against the backdrop of Germany's self-destruction. I therefore approached Oppenheimer and the American Century with gusto. Unfortunately, Cassidy has a \`problem with Oppenheimer which he did not have with Heisenberg; he detests the man. Consequently, his book contains a disoncerting assortment of irritated criticism and faint praise.Cassidy takes Oppenehimer to task on a number of points: That he was a snob, that he was fickle, that he was aloof, that he was cowardly, and that he failed to realize his potential as a physicist, to name a few. In fact, Oppenheimer only succeeds after he has been skewered at the hands of the Gray committee. He then enters- and only just- Cassidy's hagiography. Moreover, Cassidy holds Oppenheimer to modern academic standards which include a healthy disdain for government in all its manifold guises. For example, while it may be fair to criticize Oppenheimer for not having been more vociferously opposed to the H-bomb, can Cassidy really fault him for having run the Mnahattan project at a time when Hitlerism threatened to engulf the world? Is it fair to assume that the war against Japan could have been won without the A bombs and still have avoided staggering losses?Cassidy also minimizes the fear generated by Stalin's usurpation of all eastern European governments save Yugoslavia. He has ostensibly forgotten that Stalin was a bona fide madman who had eliminated at least 20 million of his own people. Casidy suggests instead that there was an equation of sorts between the USSR and USA. I am not interested in apologizing for the lunatic extremes of McCarthyism, but I do think that one ought to look at the whole picture and not just those parts one wants to see.All in all this is a lackluster performance strewn here and there with occasional discussion about Oppenheimer's science and very little more about the man. Cassidy wants to berate Oppenheimer more than comprehend him. Oppenheimer may not have become all that he might have and he may have been riddled with flaws. All the more reason to grasp the essence of the man."},{"Title":"J. Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century","review":"The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of great mystery and fascination. His role in the development of the atomic bomb and his subsequent role in shaping America's nuclear policy, as well as his rise and fall during McCarthy has been the subject of countless books. David Cassidy, Hofstra University professor, has written an excellent account of Oppenheimer's life and the development of theoretical physics in America during the early part of the 20th century. The parallelism between the life of Oppenheimer and the rise of American science is an intriguing tale that is captured in this book.This biography is a detailed and beautifully written work. Cassidy expands beyond the traditional scope of a biography and expertly explores the surrounding environment that shaped Oppenheimer's life. He draws upon previously untapped primary documents, and shows the importance and character of Oppenheimer's early education on the rest of his life. Cassidy examines the conflicts between Oppenheimer's liberal education from the Ethical Culture School and the culture that he found at Harvard. Oppenheimer's time in Europe is also recounted.The book does not become overly focused on the Manhattan Project, but covers the time on \\"The Hill\\" in enough detail to keep the story in context. He instead offers insights to the periods before the war, when Oppenheimer taught at Berkeley and Cal Tech. Oppenheimer's genius and ability to inspire his students is shown, allowing us to gain insight into the man before the events that would be the foundation of his legacy.The 1954 Atomic Energy Commission security review that disgraced Oppenheimer, and stripped him of his security clearance for alleged \\"red ties,\\" are explored with the same thoughtful insight. Recent documents and information regarding those events are thoroughly and conclusively discussed.Oppenheimer: and the American Century is a welcome addition to the history of science. (by atomicarchive.com)"},{"Title":"J. Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century","review":"In 'J. Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century', acclaimed biographer and writer David C. Cassidy (Author of the highly readable 'Uncertainty: The life and science of Werner Heisenberg') spins a riveting and extremely interesting tale which puts this great man in context, in the middle of a century that witnessed great upheavals. In these, he was the observer as well as the participant. The most striking general scientific paradigm of the century, apart from the revolutions that were breathing new life into the fabric of the cosmos and of life, was the beginning of 'big science'. It was also the beginning of the 'American century' as we know it, spurred on by the advent of science and technology, and the fortuitous happenstances that the unfortunate act of war brought upon this country. People like Oppenheimer were right in the middle of this prophetic change. Although this particular subject with specific reference to Oppenheimer has been tackled in a disconnected way in many of his other biographies and books, Cassidy is probably the first one to weave the man and his times together into a coherent and insightful whole. In many ways, Oppenheimer defines the scientific and moral personality at the heart of those times. In a way, 'Science' and 'Morality', both in a general way provide a good description of the time that was the twentieth century.Growing up in New York, Robert attended the Ethical Culture School, a school whose strikingly moral looking philosophy believed in the inherent importance of ethics and the noble constraints of morality aimed at the betterment of mankind, independent of creed and religion. However, this institution was torn between the dictums of morality and the callings of practicality when war broke out in Europe. It had to reconcile itself with the Wilsonian Ideal of 'the morality of the victors'. Cassidy lucidly depicts this institution, and the changes which forced it to revisit its professed philosophy, something which has been rarely seen in detail elsewhere. Young Robert was also affected by this philosophy, and later on, coupled with the austere messages from the Bhagavad Gita which he read, it turned his personality into a strange and at many times, tortous, conglomerate of right and wrong.In the 1920s, Oppenheimer was most fortunate, and well poised to participate in perhaps the greatest revolution that science had seen, the twin package of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. In those days, the focus of scientific excellence was in Europe, with Copenhagen, Cambridge and Gottingen being the greatest centers of learning in the world. There, people like Niels Bohr, Ernest Rutherford, Arnold Sommerfeld and Max Born were training an entire generation of outstanding physicists and chemists, and Oppenheimer was fortunate to be one of them. However, war leaves its deep and far reaching scars, and as the shadow of totalitarianism extended across this magnificent continent, the reins of science became free to be harnessed by men and women who were causing ripples in the scientific world. The practical mindedness and 'can-do' spirit of the American psyche first became apparent in those times. A country that was struggling with depression slowly but surely rose to the cause. The foresight and action that has always characterised American science and business first emerged during those times. Foundations like the Rockefeller foundation started sending promising young men to Europe to quarry in the exquisite knowledge that was being created there. These men and women came back to their country, with a determination to make it second to none in science. Universities forged alliances with industry, unheard of amounts of money started to be donated by wealthy philanthropists for scientific research. The University became the archetypal epitome of discovery and scientific freedom. Men like Oppenheimer and his colleague, Ernest Lawrence, were among the initiators of this wave of technological excellence that can be seen today. Everything suddenly became big; 'big science', 'big machines', like Lawrence's magnificent cyclotron, 'big money', and big America. Cassidy profiles this period of unprecedented progress very well.Then came war. First and foremost, it brought the United States a windfall of the most brilliant scientists of the time; Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, John Von Neumann, Edward Teller, and the biggest fish of them all, the austere sage Albert Einstein. As someone said, 'The Pope of Physics has moved'. His home became the new Vatican of physics. All of these great men and women came to their adopted country to escape the ravages of racial discrimination and fanatic nationalism initiated by Hitler and Mussolini. Europe, as they knew it, was on the wane. Their beloved continent was never to be what it was before. On the other hand, they had arrived in the new land of opportunity. American science would start booming, and American leaders of science would be ecstatic. A whole group of 'scientific managers' (another creed that would be the legacy of big science) took the administrative responsibility of steering their country's scientific resources, in their hands. Among these were Robert Millikan and Arthur Compton, both Nobel Laureates, Vannevar Bush, a close confidant of Roosevelt, and James Bryant Conant, president of Harvard. They made sure that research was well-funded and scholarships were doled out to bright young people without reservations. Promising American men and women of science would no longer have to leave their nation in order to become scientific apprentices at the meccas of learning. They could now rely on their own leaders, extraordinary men who were poised for breakthroughs in science and technology. Undoubtedly leading this remarkable generation, at least in physics, was Robert Oppenheimer. Under his tutelage and guidance at the University of California, Berkeley, America's best physicists now had a home of their own, and a father figure whom they idolized. Almost every theoretical physicist of the time who later went on to high deeds, sometime trained under Oppenheimer.Then came war, and ironically, it brought the United States good tidings, at least in the beginning. More brilliant emigres. And more money to fuel the great machine of technological progress. War production suddenly galvanized into action all that work force that had laid dormant during Depression times. The United States had become the most resource rich and advanced nation in the world. All that 'big science' that had begun could now be put to good use. As if being called to such a cause, an event came to the notice of scientists, one that would change America and the world forever. Fission, and then Pearl Harbour gave an impulsive and unforseen impetus to the nation's scientific and political establishment. The rest is history. Oppenheimer became the head of the world's most top secret laboratory. The war amassed the American work force and capital power as never before. The most expensive project in history produced the most destructive weapon the world had ever seen, obliterating entire generations in a heartbeat. Although it ended the war, it stirred up many more problems and questions than it had solved or answered. Politics had finally become inextricably enmeshed with science, another legacy of the American century. America was a superpower now, although the threat of communism would always be a thorn, in no measure small, in her side. The state of the times was also driven home when Oppenheimer had his security clearance taken away by men from the Government having a perverse sense of patriotism, another instance of the unfortunate but permanent amalgamation of politics and science.Cassidy's book portrays this century well. It WAS an American century, there is no doubt about that. It changed many things forever. Scientific research would no longer be the same, requiring and engendering intense competition between giant institutions for unheard of funds, a trend that is all too obvious today. It also produced technology that we have yet to psychologically come to terms with, and maybe never will. And it raised eternal and tortous questions of morality that continue to be harrowing. Robert Oppenheimer, in a way, epitomized all of this, many times as an initiator. He and his avuncular predecessor Niels Bohr, both struggled to cope with the paradoxical nature of the most destructive weapon that would possibly end all wars. It did not turn out to be that simple, though, as the years showed, and we permanently became mortals walking a devious precipice. Oppenheimer's brilliance, versatility, and moral persona put him in a position where he could influence the world around him, and he did. But he raised many many questions that he would grapple with till the end, regarding the complex and deep repurcussions which his science had produced in the form of a terrible weapon. Because of his unusual intelligence and foresight, he was in a unique position to be a part and a questioner of those important times. The American century, inspiring as it is, is also sobering. Oppenheimer's life is a telling representative of the problems that we have solved in our quest for scientific as well as moral truth, and the many more new problems that we have created. Most importantly, Cassidy's book and Oppenheimer's life both tell us that whatever else happens, we must never cease to explore."},{"Title":"J.

Robert Oppenheimer was, by all measures-as a scientist, scholar, teacher, and administrator-a fascinating and enigmatic individual who had a profound effect on the process of science in this country. His is a story worth telling, and David Cassidy tells it well. He has produced a readable and comprehensive biography that does kind justice to his remarkable subject.\\"--Lawrence Krauss, Ambrose Swasey Professor, Case Western Reserve University, author of Atom: An Odyssey from the Big Bang to Life on Earth and Beyond (2001), and Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions, forthcoming"},{"Title":"J. Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century","review":"Poor Oppenheimer gets lost in this clumsy political screed. While all good biographies are rich in background, this one often strays far beyond any meaningful relevance to its subject. Why should a book about a man who died in 1967 repeatedly refer to 9-11 and George W. Bush? The leftwing worldview of the author is on display here with all the sublety of, well, an atomic blast."},{"Title":"J. Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century","review":"Oppenheimer was born to a wealthy family in NYC. The family owned a fabulous estate and yacht on Long Island. He wrote poetry prior to later in life achieving greatness in physics.He went to Harvard and later received his doctorate in theoretical physics overseas. He taught at Cal Tech and Berkeley prior to joining the Manhattan Project during World War II.The biography then covers the period during the 1940s when Oppenheimer was a principal in the development of the atomic bomb and the dropping of 2 atomic bombs on Japan.Following the war the USA entered the cold war era. Overnight, nuclear physicists became heros. They had won the war. He was a top scientist on the leading government scientific committees in Washington.Next, Oppenheimer and other scientists were opposed to building the Super, the hydrogen bomb. However, about a month later on the advice of Teller and others President Truman ordered that the hydrogen bomb be built.This biography explains how later in life Oppenheimer was denied his security clearance due to his opposition to the building of the hydrogen bomb."},{"Title":"J. Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century","review":"I was disappointed to find nothing in this work I hadn't already read in several other Oppenheimer biographies. Dr. Cassidy seems to have taken upon himself the mantle of chief apologist for Dr. Oppenheimer, dismissing any and all evidence for his leftist connections while consistently leveling equally specious charges against his accusers. In short, if you want fresh insights into this complex personality you will be disappointed. If, however, you share Dr. Cassidy and Dr. Oppenheimer's political bent, you should find this a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Battle for Stalingrad","review":"You have Erickson for the Russian view of the operation, and Ziekme/Bauer for the German side. Craig gives you the personal accounts from both sides, but the story is incomplete until you read the memoirs of the commanding generals. Unfortunately, we will never have Paulus' view of the events, but we do have Chuikov's. In this book, you will find the type of information that is unavailable from any other source. Chuikov is perhaps the only Soviet memoir to fully stand the test of western scrutiny and to gain respect of western historians."},{"Title":"Battle for Stalingrad","review":"Chuikov was the general on the scene at Stalingrad. His writing is not the most elegant, but it works; it's an informative book, and is so heavily Communist in tone it made me chuckle at times. I read this when I was 16, and have been interested in Stalingrad ever since. The stories he tells of specific companies and units performing individual acts of heroism and bravery are some of the best and riveting I've read. Again, the writing may not be pretty, but it conveys the story and the battle of Stalingrad quite well."},{"Title":"Battle for Stalingrad","review":"For the most part this is a very crisp military account of a horrible battle. I found the commuist rhetoric offensive, but it was probably thrust upon the author-General. I was looking for less military info and more accounts of the human aspect, and information on what was happening in the War in broader terms and politics, economics, etc. I'm interested in the subject, because my brother fought in this battle, but was never able to talk about it."},{"Title":"A Short Course in Teaching Reading Skills","review":"I got this book for a grad class in teaching reading and writing (to esl students). This book was fantastic for explaining the theories and concepts behind teaching reading as well as giving sample exercises for every single concept. The exercises could easily be adapted for use in any reading classroom, and they take the guesswork out of lesson planning. It's very nice to have academic support behind the activities that you're using! Although we used it for ESL reading, the introduction at the beginning of the book states that it can be used in a multitude of reading settings, including adult basic literacy and elementary literacy, which makes it even more useful. I very much recommend this book, and I know I will be returning to it for as long as I'm teaching."},{"Title":"A Little Bit Married","review":"Overall, A LITLE BIT MARRIED is an engaging family drama that is more reflective than eventful. The writer displays sharp insight into human psychology and the dynamics of marriage and family. A lot of her humor is aimed at poking fun at the trappings of suburban life. Unfortunately, the plot unfolds at a sluggish pace. The premise-- that a woman gave up a promising acting career to raise a family in the suburbs, and in the midst of a marital crisis, has the chance to start over at age 38-is, by now familiar. Each member of the family is in the throes of a major life crisis, and the story is reminiscent of a number of recent tales of family dysfunction: AMERICAN BEAUTY being the most notable."},{"Title":"A Little Bit Married","review":"My older sister gave me this book to read when I was about 12 now that I think about it I was way to young for it!!It was the first romance novel I ever read I loved it then and I still love it now!!"},{"Title":"A Little Bit Married","review":"I read it years ago but decided to look it up tonight for old times sake lol .It has stuck with me ...I like the way it was written . It was funny and sad ."},{"Title":"A Little Bit Married","review":"I'm a big fan of this author and recently purchased whatever paperbacks I didn't already have. They were not available via Kindle. The book has some humor, but not the typical character development that is usually so realistic in the author's books.There were interesting parts, but mostly it was hum-drum reading. I enjoyed the \\"asides\\" but even those started to become predictable. I purchased this paperback on Amazon."},{"Title":"A Little Bit Married","review":"Gail Parent is a fantastic writer. She always makes me laugh and my girlfriends and I fly through her books. There are several pages in the book you'll want to 'mark' to re-read to your friends/husband/boyfriend. Very good read!"},{"Title":"War Movie Posters: Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters","review":"This is arguably the finest entry in the Bruce Hershenson published series of film genre graphics books. Though all of his volumes are impeccable in style and presentation, this book approaches film advertising illustration not only as art, but as world history. Instead of compiling war film posters in order of their release year, they are here presented chronologically by the time of the actual war itself, adding profound depths of sociological and psychological perspective to the long sad history of hell on Earth. I write this review not for all the film buffs out there or poster collectors or illustrators, but to historians, to all teachers and students of the human journey. Here, from flag waving to burning, are the images of war as hope, promise, necessity, waste and despair. More than the films themselves with all their shooting and shouting, these posters silently command and provoke our senses all the way to the last shreds of wonder."},{"Title":"War Movie Posters: Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters","review":"This is the eighth book of Movie Posters that I have purchased from Bruce Hershenson and each time I remark on the extremely high quality of the reproductions. This is obviously a job done from the heart but the visual aspects of the book strikes something in the sub-conscious and suddenly you are back in some cinema watching that movie again. More than just a coffee-table book but a reference source and one to take to work and get a discussion going as an alternative to football. A great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"War Movie Posters: Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters","review":"Bruce has done it again. In one book he has included the best and most graphically appealing posters from the greatest WAR movies of all times. Not only does he have the U.S. posters but many times he has selected the foreign poster that has better graphics. When you view this book you will be &quot;transported&quot; back to the films that you loved. I had forgotten about many of the great WWII films that I saw as a kid until seeing Bruce's book. How will he top this??"},{"Title":"Her Last Temptation (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Cat Sheehan is stunned that Temptations, the bar owned by her family is closing. She wants to save the place, but feels helpless knowing she has no options. At the same time, Cat ponders cleaning up her act by finding a nice guy rather than the bad boys she always has dated.Her resolve ends when musician Dylan Spencer enters Temptations as he has bad boy and temptation written all. Dylan and Cat begin seeing one another in what is a heated affair. However, Dylan fears the relationship will end once he reveals the truth about himself. Dylan is a nerdy software engineer who has loved Cat since high school, but she never knew he existed back then as he was too clean and straight for her to enter his circle and she does not know him today as she knows the bad boy musician.This is a fitting title to the last novel in what has been a two decade terrific imprint. HER LAST TEMPTATION is a fine heated contemporary romance that fans will appreciate due to two delightful lead characters with a fabulous premise of wild girl seeks good boy, but falls in love with bad boy who is actually a good boy in disguise. Leslie Kelly insures that the Temptation line goes out with quite a bang as the audience will treasure the final act.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Her Last Temptation (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Wild child bartender, Cat Sheehan is about to have a life altering change when the bar she's part owner in, Temptation, must close down for good.

She just can't resist him.No woman could.But Dylan has a secret, not the least of which is what the G in his band's name the Four G's stands for. Dylan is not a bad boy nor is he a stranger to Cat Sheehan.HER LAST TEMPTATION is a very sexy, very funny, and alas final entry in the Harlequin Temptation line. It is also a huge Must Read by Leslie Kelly.HER LAST TEMPTATION is a Collector's Edition and one of the best Leslie Kelly books I've ever read...and I've read them all.Don't miss HER LAST TEMPTATION."},{"Title":"Her Last Temptation (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"This is one of my favorite Leslie Kelly books. The love story between Cat and Dylan is soooo beautiful. I have read this book twice. It is very heart warming. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves romance"},{"Title":"Her Last Temptation (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Cat Sheehan, a wild child that has a soft spot for romance novels and bad boys is the part owner of the family bar that bared the name of the small town of Temptation. With progress closing the doors to the bar and only job Cat knew, she felt defeated and alone. Her family has moved forward, leaving her to handle the final arrangements to close the bar once and for all. With hopes of doing some things that would at least keep the patrons coming in until the final day before demolition, she hires a band that came with high ratings to give some live music to grace the walls for the last time. She hires a band called The Four G's, a rock band as the first set of entertainment in the final weeks.Dylan Spencer, the epitome of bad boy rocker, is the bass player for The Four G's. Strong and very good looking, he matches wits with the beautiful Cat Sheehan. The flirting comes fast and furious. Cat, trying to avoid hooking up with another bad boy because she feels it is time to grow up and find someone stable to have a relationship with (which she fears will be completely boring, but necessary), is rendered speechless and apt to make a bumbling fool in front of the attractive Dylan. The only thing Cat does not realize is that Dylan has a secret.... He has been in love with Cat since high school and she never knew he existed.Upon meeting, the lies and secrets take center stage... literally. Dylan, offering his name as only Spencer to Cat, was the beginning of a lie that could possibly destroy his chances of getting the girl that stole his heart so many years ago. In addition to the bad boy rocker persona that Cat, while being drawn to is trying to avoid, Dylan is more good boy than bad. He is a computer programmer with a nice car and house with a hobby of being a rock star... the total opposite of what Cat believes he happens to be.With Dylan's lie and Cat's battle to fall for yet another bad boy, they have a very steamy affair. Both fearing it will not last causes for some tension that they both try to control. With both falling in love with one another, the truth is needed to be said. Of course, this happens not when they wanted it to, but love prevails in the end.This quick read was interesting and flowed well. The attraction was felt and the reader knows that the ending will be a happily ever after... It is what you expect from reading this. Digging deeper, while this is noted as the last HQN Temptation novel, there is something to the story.... Love, while thought of as infatuation, can withstand the test of time and that there is more to what is seen on the outside of a person. Dylan was a geek, Cat was the popular girl, and regardless of the stereotypes people get in our youth.... Love is deeper than the surface when you get to know a person. It actually instilled a little hope that in real life for those that carry a torch for so long for a person that never knew they existed once you have the courage to let it be known.I'll admit, I was never into romance stories that happen as soon as the first chapter is read, but I did enjoy this one. Kudos to Ms. Kelly for writing a fast paced love story that did not feel so rushed."},{"Title":"Clinical Pharmacology Made Incredibly Easy! (Incredibly Easy! Series)","review":"I love this book. It breaks down pharmacologic drugs by system (ie. drugs used on the GI system, abx, etc.) and explains them in very simple terms while still being entertaining. This book does not read like a text book. However, at the end of each chapter, there is a little 3-7 question quiz. The only down side about this book is that it does not give the common names of drugs (ie. Colace is referred to as ducosate sodium). This book has really helped me in clinical and my practice NCLEX scores have dramatically improved.

The pictures are terrific, the recipes I've tried are excellent, and most not too complicated to try for the first time on a weeknight. It's a great book if you like to READ cook books.

Not only media, but cyberspace, has somehow escaped going under the social-anthropological microscope.While this text does so, in some cases, quite well, in other pieces, the work is obviously exploratory, experiemental and possibly of questionable value.The essay on the electronic venacular is, of course, already dated, but it is a detailed examination of the Internet from a user's perspective. The author looks at specific programs and how users employ them to express themselves. But it seems like a drop in a very large bucket of work that needs to be done on the growing globe of Internet users.The essays A Torn Page, Framed and A Tale of an Internet are too abstract and experimental to be effective, but Computing for Tibet and Shades of Twilight were excellent pieces. Both grounded in specific communicators and communications and both exploring how the media are interacting with people politically, emotionally, personally. Dorine Kondo, who wrote Shades of Twilight, has done great scholarship in previous publications, so it's not surprise that her work her is excellent. She explores a new form of drama as a new form of communication. If I could rate the various essays separately from the whole book, I'd give her essay a solid 5 on the Amazon scale.Also, scoring a 5 would be Rewriting New York City. The author examines graffiti as a form of expression. It's a new area and it's interesting to compare ideas of banning graffit as loss of freedom of speech and the autoBots on MSN chat room that give chatters the boot for typing the word, &quot;piss&quot; into a phrase in the chat room dialog. How much freedom of expression does the culture REALLY allow?Good scholarship, new roads into new territories."},{"Title":"American Passages: A History of the American People","review":"American Passages was the textbook used for one of my American History courses. As my instructor said, it was a much tougher book than the previous one that had been used for the course, and I can understand why. The chapters are very long, sometimes inordinately so, and even though I was interested in the material and a good reader, they often took an hour or more to read through. However, the material _was_ interesting, the pictures, maps, graphs, and additional information well done, and it was well written. It does not go into full coverage of some topics, but I found it to be well-rounded, exploring many of the diverse issues that influenced our history and culture. It's an awe-inspiring journey to look through the past of our nation and see how it has impacted the present!The book covers history from pre-Columbian days all the way through Clinton's presidency and the various scandals. Not many books can claim to be that current!

You can read my review of that book for more details. In short, the response to the discussion group was unbelievable. The \\"Tough Questions Series\\" does just that - it ask plain, tough questions. The kind that we think in our head but typically aren't comfortable with putting out there on the table. He isn't scared to challenge the traditional Christian beliefs because he knows that those beliefs can be backed up with scripture. He also used logic and sound reasoning to make his points, all the while not shoving anything down anyone's throat. The kids, who spanned a rather large range of religious beliefs, appreciated the ability to voice their opinions in a safe environment and the there was NOT a shortage of opinion or discussion! Garry Poole has done an incredible job with his \\"Tough Question Series\\". The kids didn't want the discussion group to end; unfortunately summer was over and they had to go back to college. They are wanting to do another of the books at Christmas and also next summer. If that isn't a huge recommendation, I don't know what is. The amount of work required to lead a discussion group like this is surprisingly little. In fact, the main job of the facilitator is to know when to keep quiet, even when you don't agree with what is being said at the time, and knowing when to speak up. Mr. Poole's book, \\"Seeker Small Groups\\" is an invaluable book to read to help prepare you to do a good job as a leader of these discussion groups."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy for Art Students (The New Art Library)","review":"more text than pictures, and even the pictures or in bad order,with not much comprehension as to the different anatomy groups,all pics are isolated and there are close to no real life photographs.very small drawings, so no descriptive view of the various muscles(manyof which are left out) there are plenty of cheap books to purchase, leavethis one on the screen, Recommends:if you want a cheap, great anatomy bookget ART STUDENTS' ANATOMY EDMOND J FARRIS."},{"Title":"Beans on the Roof","review":"I have read the book called &quot;Baen's on the Roof&quot;.

Mr. Alcalay writes informatively and with tasteful purpose. Even the essays of a more personal nature I found moving, but the books he has read and recommends are the diamonds that too often remain beneath the rubble. I cannot say there is anywhere else I would have found some of these authors recommended or reviewed. Mr. Alcalay writes with enthusiasm about authors whose literatures will never make the weekend book page. These authors are diverse in approach (poets, novelists, essayists, historians) and smart. They provide more immediate accounts of other places and states, some of the light and the heavy. This book fills a need by providing the names necessary for readers to get better acquainted with writers in the Middle East and some chosen Eastern European regions. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Memories of Our Future: Selected Essays 1982-1999","review":"Memories Of Our Future is an outstanding anthology of essays surveying the complexities of Mediterranean cultures; the diverse, changing space of the Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa -- areas of diasporas, dislocations, and genocidal exterminations provoked nationalism and religious fanaticism. As a Sephardic-Croatian Jew, Ammiel Alcalay confronts the deep resistance to change of any kind in this region, and describes his personal intellectual, cultural, spiritual, and political endeavor to help break down barriers between peoples, nations, and languages. Of special interest is his observations and analysis of the Israeli/Palestinian confrontation, Arab/Jewish poetics, and Jewish identity in America. Memories Of Our Future is seriously recommended reading for students of Balkan, Middle Eastern, and North African studies."},{"Title":"Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt (American Lives)","review":"This journey to the Detroit of the 1930s and 40s also takes the reader on a ride through the first years of a young African American girl's life--her relationships with family, church, and community, her growth toward an understanding of her own potential. Marvin Arnett's story is bright with both humor and poignancy as she clearly draws her characters and their struggles in a pre-Civil Rights American city. Her voice is clear and plain-spoken, and she creates an intimacy for the reader with person and place that will stay in the mind indefinitely.Read this book for its history, but read it also for its humanity. Marvin Arnett believes in humankind. The book is a testament to that hope."},{"Title":"Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt (American Lives)","review":"Marvin V. Arnett has spun a delightful coming of age saga that starts in 1928 when there wasn't much to be delighted about in the United States. The Great Depression was about to strike, World War II was on its way, there were family tragedies and riots would hit the nation's large cities. In addition, the church sanctioned certain segments of the population making them pariahs. Marvin Sprague's family, although poor with her father working as a cook at a downtown Detroit hotel, managed to share what they did have with neighbors who were less fortunate in spite of the church's disapproval. Her father gave leftover food and her mother, with her magic sewing machine, turned out clothes for children who had only rags.In what was, indeed, a time of segregation, poverty and grimness, throughout the story Arnett's wonderful sense of humor lightens the heavy burden. She tells of the time when she was ten and had read all the children's books in the library. The librarian took pity on her and gave her a restricted adult card. Marvin promptly checked out a steamy adult book causing her father to roar and her to blame the librarian. He chastised the librarian and from that point on Marvin's visits to the library were not as pleasant as they had been; she stopped her regular visits until she was old enough to visit the main branch by herself.The book gives a social history of a time period that many Americans know little about. It has the personal touch that brings the Depression and the Detroit Riot of 1943 alive with characters the reader can readily relate to and empathize with. While each chapter could certainly stand alone, Arnett ties the whole together in a wonderful story that can be enjoyed by everyone.Reviewed by Alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt (American Lives)","review":"There once was a time when the elemental Afro American family consisted not only of father/mother/offspring, but also included grandparents, the church and the neighborhood. This was a time when it was common place for three or sometimes four generations to live together in one home. The love, care and warmth of the family did not end when one walked out of one's house to go to work, school or play. Back then,\\"the hood\\", was in fact a true \\"neighborhood\\". \\"Pieces From Life's Crazy Quilt\\" recalls the golden days of Afro American social existence and life in Detroit during the 1930s - 1940s. What the author, Marvin Arnett has done is create a literal time machine that transports us back to those times in a very descriptive and emotional manner. This work is a intimate and insighful look into the life and influences of a child growing up admist colorful, warm and sometimes ominus character arrays. That Arnett includes stories and lessons from the bright and the dark side of her experiences speaks volumes for her knack at providing and maintaining balance in her descriptions of characters and environments. This is a work that will remind Arnett's peers that there once was a time where the neighbor hood was a nuturing and loving place. The younger reader who is looking for a better way of life and a better way of living it will be transfixed to discover what used to be and what may be possible to recreate. They need to know that there really USED to be a time when the black community in Detroit had empathy and mutual respect as foundations for behavior instead of the current impersonal co-existence. I look for this work to one day be transformed into a movie or musical play. The imagery is powerful. Kudows to the author for inventing a work that is entertaining, educational and most of all, practical. \\"Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt\\" is a detailed and imagery loaded work that is also a warm, honest and some times dark snap shot of yesterday. ...and if we relly take to heart the lessons that Arnett teaches us, it can also serve as a potential road map for finding our way back home."},{"Title":"Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt (American Lives)","review":"This endearing memoir reminds me so much of stories my great grandmother used to share. The only difference here is Marvin's account has been preserved.In a delicate voice, almost too soothing at first, before I knew it, it had swept me inside a community of mores that today is but a shell of a distant memory.There were the beverage of terms and terminologies to court. The camaraderie (and sometimes open acrimony) between (new) neighbors was stirring, as were the church and its followings. A female pastor in that time, I must admit, surprised me. And I truly was impressed by the way Marvin drew out the events surrounding little Ronnie and the resulting closure. Absolutely beautiful. There were many favorite spots to stop and muse on, but one that comes right to mind was the \`chicken leg fracas', as I so applauded Mr. Sprague's viewpoints throughout! There is so much in here to appreciate that all of this and more surpasses priceless information, and assuredly is far from \`crazy' quilting. Far, far, from it.Upon reaching the epilogue (bottom paragraphs), had me asking (along with the title) if the author, or editor, were aware of the numerous historical writings where chunks of time about cultures/peoples are omitted, simply stated as \\"not much is known because records weren't kept or written.\\"What I am saying here is I am a true believer. I believe this work is priceless, one to serve history of a such a time. I'm quite pleased to have come across one more in print. An inspiringly beautiful memoir!"},{"Title":"Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt (American Lives)","review":"A length of velvet from an old bathrobe, a scrap from a forgotten apron worn in a kitchen who-knows-where, a touch of white satin from a lost child's baby bonnet--Grace Melissa Sprague treasured these discards and crafted them into art. Now her daughter has followed her mother's calling. But rather than transforming patches of precious fabric into glowing crazy quilts, in Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt, Marvin V. Arnett has transformed her Detroit childhood memories into stories that are just as comforting and colorful.Detroit in the 1930s was a tough place to live, particularly for a black family. Arnett recalls that the hard times of the Great Depression hit the city early, before the stock market crash of 1929. When the last Model T car ran off the assembly line at the Ford plant, things turned down and stayed down. It was the year of Arnett's birth.In this memoir, she recounts her hard growing-up years unflinchingly. The good times--the church as a beacon of hope, her mother's \\"lighter-than-air\\" angel food cake, and her own enduring friendship with school chum Beatrice--and the bad--the death of a beloved sister, the ache following the racist remark of a respected teacher.Each of the thirty chapters takes a sliver of the family's life and weaves a separate story that can stand alone. But together, these patchwork stories portray life in the Green house on Herbert Street as a glory to remember and to inspire.Just as a quilt has a backing, so did the family--the strong father, William Sprague. The well-traveled man of sophistication, wisdom and some mystery supported his family as a chef; although, as an African-American he had to accept a lesser title. Later, as the Depression deepened, circumstance forced him into less savory jobs, including being a numbers runner for the Detroit Police Department. The support William gave his family was more than financial. He was always there, not only for them but also for their neighbors and community. He helped elderly Mrs. Eubanks gather the strength and nerve to vote for her hero, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and once took on the Detroit school system when the home economics teacher required the African-American girls to scrub and clean windows while exempting the other students. He won.While William backed the family, it was Grace Melissa who stitched the love in place. She took that old bathrobe and converted it into an elegant frock for young Marvin. She shepherded her children to the Church of the True Believers, and she practiced what they preached.Of the many delightful pieces in the book, \\"The Great Feet Washings\\" is particularly true and telling. Grace Melissa also befriended the isolated Miss Lila and came out like a tiger when a neighborhood clergyman made an inappropriate advance toward her child. The man left town that night.While Arnett's stories of her girlhood are charming, revealing and intriguing, the story of her book is equally riveting. A federal employee for over twenty-five years (former vice president of the National Organization of Blacks in Government), Arnett wrote her memories and then sought a publisher. Finding none, she published the book herself and sold it when and where she could, including from the back of her car. An instructor in a writing seminar who was entranced by the stories became her champion and brought the book to the attention of writer Tobias Wolff, editor of the prestigious \\"American Lives\\" series published by the University of Nebraska Press. This book is now a part of that series.by Patricia Nordyke Pandofor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"Caesar","review":"The mistake I made was to read Massie's &quot;Caesar&quot; just after I read Colleen McCullough's book of the same title. The contrast is pretty big - Massie evidently enjoys confirming every rumour, and generally having as much sex and scandal in this book as possible. To be honest, Massie turns great historical figures into a joke. Decimus Brutus, the narrator of the story, has a love affair with Cleopatra, Clodia and Octavian (the young Augustus) There is nothing at all in any ancient sources to back this up. Massie's own opinion doesn't really come into anything - if there has been a scandal mentioned as a possibility somewhere in the sources, Massie confirms it and also exaggerates it wildly. On top of this, his detail is patchy and inaccurate. He puts Octavian forwards as Caesar's nephew, not great nephew, he does not mention politics or military force, and his characters are all developed through sexual relations with one another.The book is OK, however, it is reasonably well written and worth reading for those who know the characters of ancient Rome. For those who don't, I'd reccomend just picking up a Jackie Collins - all the sex and no politics! That seems to be what Massie is aiming for in the first place."},{"Title":"Caesar","review":"Few historical figures have been written about as much as Gaius Julius Caesar. In addition to straight history, there are innumerable works of fiction, not the least of which is William Shakespeare's play.Allan Massie seems to be keenly aware that he is on heavily trodden ground, and struggles to find something new or fresh to add. He studiously avoids all the dramatic moments (most major events happen off-stage) and the result is a very slow-paced, uninvolving book. Despite the addition of much fanciful gossip about the sex lives of the famous characters, it was a struggle for me to keep reading. Fortunately, the book is short enough and Massie's writing is literate, so I did read on to the end.However, after Massie's earlier Augustus and Tiberius, which I enjoyed very much, this one falls flat and was a major disappointment."},{"Title":"Caesar","review":"Couldn't decide whether to rate this one as 3 stars or 4 - probably 3.5. Anyway, reading the story of Caesar from the view of Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of his closest friends and advisers and one of the assassins, was fascinating. The author demonstrates how Caesar may have alienated himself from those who supported and advanced his career throughout his life. Or, was the assassination just the result of jealousy? As the story evolves it appears, according to Massie, that the only opinion that may be important to Caesar is his own. How can anyone doubt Caesar and his decisions yet those who campaigned or served in politics with him well know he is just a man albeit a brilliant one. I was at first put off by the abrupt approach that Massie used to begin the story and it took me a bit to get into the character. And, at times the story seemed to be to drag as Decimus dwells on his own life and problems. How much is rumor and how much is historical fact? We all know that historical accounts are often projected to provide positive or biased views by the writer. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the tale and the premise that Massie puts forward. Quite a different approach but a most interesting one."},{"Title":"Witchcraft in France and Switzerland: the Borderlands During the Reformation","review":"This book is phenominal! In a catagory of study where there is so much false information circulating, Monter stays close to the facts. The Jura Region discussed by Monter, is the area between modern day France and Switzerland. This area is also one of the earliest (not to mention most heated) areas of witch trial concentration. Monter gives a very localized and thorough discription of the trials in this area, as well as a very well supported argument on the reasons why this area is so fertile for witchcraft accusations. A must have for anyone who is interested in witch trials."},{"Title":"Witchcraft in France and Switzerland: the Borderlands During the Reformation","review":"Wonderful and informative book for a paper on witchcraft in the 16th century.

Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"My husband and I looked through several potty books when our daughter became intersted in using the potty. Most of what we saw provided TOO much detail for a child her age. This book covers the basics. In addition to receiving our stamp of approval, our daughter loved it - the various situations in which a potty training toddler and her/his parents find themselves, to pictures, and especially the page set aside for her own photo. Our 26 month old son now finds it to be quite a page turner as he learns to use the potty. It keeps him in one place long enough to actually get down to business."},{"Title":"Uh Oh! Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"Between this book, one tape, some star stickers, and a potty, my daughter was (happily) trained by 24 1/2 months. The book is a lot of fun for toddlers and it's cute enough (without being too cute...or gross) that you won't get sick of reading it while you're child is on the potty."},{"Title":"Uh Oh! Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"This book essentially has a one-liner on each page showing a toddler and a potty-oriented thing -- usually comments that children make, or a line explaining the picture. E.g., &quot;mark tries all the potties before picking the one he likes best&quot;, &quot;laura teaches the bear how to use the potty&quot;, etc. There is no story; each picture and usage is different although several overlap. In my experience, this book was good for a few days but my child did not stay interested. Once upon a Potty, What do you do with a Potty, and The Princess and the Potty have kept her interest and she continues to read them regularly."},{"Title":"Uh Oh! Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"I was so dissappointed when I received this book and had read the reviews that it was terrific. There is no a story line and it's basically a small book with pictures of children using their toilet for a drum...and getting &quot;rave reviews&quot;, what does that mean? If you are looking for a book to have your child relate to a character and learn the steps of potty training this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Uh Oh! Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. There wasn't a story and my son didn't really pay much attention to the book. He understands and enjoys books better when there is a storyline that he can follow.

Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"I have used this book through training 3 children. We read it while the child sat on the potty and there was so much discussion from each page, each child lingered a little longer on the potty with many successes. There is a page using the potty as a drum, and I would ask, &quot;Do we do that?&quot;, a page singing - &quot;Can you sing a song while sitting?&quot; Make the book INTERACTIVE! It does not have to be a story of 1 character. The book certainly does go through steps: purchasing a potty, teaching animals (demonstration), visting with your potty, wearing underwear. I immediately put the photo in the back with my first child but being a baby photo - every child since - insists it is their own, and waits in expectation of that page! Don't pass over this book!"},{"Title":"Uh Oh! Gotta Go!: Potty Tales From Toddlers","review":"This is a really nice book to add to your &quot;potty&quot; collection. The strength of the book lies in the large number and variety of illustrations.

Leafing through various potty books, this one caught my eye as having something for everyone. The children are of many races with neat ethnic names, and there's probably at least one page that each reader can relate to. Ours was the one with the big sister sitting on a toilet across from her little sister on a training potty. We've promised our daughter that once she's potty-trained, we'll put her picture in the back cover (there's a special place). Great incentive and lots of fun."},{"Title":"Uh Oh!

His chillingly accurate portrayal of life on the potty from the perspective of 27 very different people will keep you riveted till the last page. Coupled with the gritty realism of Shelley Dieterichs' illustrations, this should be on the top of everyone's Must Read List. A story that particularly struck me was that of little Jacob Malloy, a boy who discovers the potty's magical ability to &quot;flush the bad stuff away.&quot; His initial offerings to the potty are innocent enough, such as candy wrappers and plastic cowboys, but things take a turn for the macabre when his little sister eats his half of a candy bar that Daddy told them to share.

I also happen to enjoy astronomy, physics, geology, and other hard sciences.So imagine my surprise and skepticism, when I read that a supposed \\"Elohim\\" (a divine being of the Hebrew Bible), took possession of author Tashira Tachi-ren's body, to instruct us mortals on such delightfully delusional gems, as:\\"This planet is in Ascension. It's frequency is vibrating at a very high rate, and it is losing density.\\"\\"There are seven to eight million Lightworkers on the planet at this point--what some have called a 'Planetary Transition Team'.\\"This \\"Elohim\\", \\"Archangel Ariel\\", while being channeled through the body of \\"Tashira Tachi-ren\\" (A Caucasian woman from Oregon), weighs in on several other pressing Lightworker issues.On 'Ascension': \\"officially in March 1988...what we call 'activation of the first-level Lightbody' occurred for most Lightworkers. That was like a little bell going off in your DNA...it began the process of mutation..\\"On dimensions: \\"The sixth dimension holds the templates for the DNA patterns of all types of species' creation, including humankind.\\"On our physical bodies: \\"Axiotonal lines are the equivalent of acupuncture meridians that can connect with the Oversoul and resonant star systems.\\"On chakras: \\"Until recently, the Alpha and Omega \\"chakras\\" have been vestigial..\\" \\"Even though Alpha and Omega chakras are energy centers, they have completely different type of blueprint and function than that of the other chakaras. They are finely tuned energy regulators for electric, magnetic and gravitational waves..\\"On biochemistry: \\"We measure Lightbody levels (there are twelve) by the ability of your cells to metabolize Light. The marker for this new cellular activity is the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in your cells.\\"On DNA: \\"...human DNA holds bits of genetic material from every species on Earth, plus genetic material holographically encoded with the collective experience of all humanity...as well as bits of genetic encoding from the sentient species of 383 ascending planets across five local universes!\\"On the Fifth Level Lightbody: \\"It's like manic depression.\\"On the Sixth Level Lightbody, and people mysteriously vanishing: \\"A lot of people leave the planet in sixth (level) lightbody, because it's extremely uncomfortable for them.\\"On the Eighth Level Lightbody: \\"You get Alzheimers....and Audio Dyslexia...\\"On mutation: \\"At the Eighth Level of Lightbody, the pituitary and the pineal gland...begin to grow and change shape. As they grow, sometimes you will feel pressure in your head. Your brain gets bigger.\\"On lumpy craniums: \\"...getting lumps and bumps and pressure in your skull, your brain is probably growing. Reach up and pull the cranial plates apart...\\"On treatment-resistant, Lightbody-induced mutational headaches: \\"Say, \\"Please release endorphins.\\"\\", \\"Buy dioptase (green crystal you can find in New Age shops).\\",\\"Buy one of my potions.\\"Tachi-ren alleges that her money potion can aid you in gaining \\"Quantum Wealth\\". She also alleges that her \\"Subatomic Tonic\\" is for \\"molecular integration of The Spirit.\\" She has many other potions for sale for use during your Ascension...Tachi-ren maintains a website called \\"Alchemical Mage\\" (of course!) where she offers \\"Astral Parasite Cleansing\\", and teaches \\"Merlin's Spin Field Exercise\\". In addition, she hosts microscope images of distilled water (which she also sells on her site), along with her money potion.This book was written in 1989. According to Archangel Ariel, the Earth has been losing density since 1988. That was twenty-five years ago, and not a single scientist anywhere on the planet, seems to have taken notice. In reality, Earth is constantly being bombarded by meteors, most of them rather small. Some survive the atmosphere to smack into the ground and I believe, very slightly, perhaps immeasurably, but continuously, add to the planet's density.Ariel is no longer around to consult with on these matters, though. Apparently, she walked out of Tachi-ren's body, and a new divinity calling itself, \\"Aliyah Ziondra\\" has taken over. You can see Tachi-ren's supposed channeling of this being, on youtube, by searching for \\"Aliyah Ziondra - The Embrace of the Infinite\\".If there is a sin in spirituality, it is misidentification of self. To spend one's life channeling supposed entities whom dish out the worst of the New Age gobblygook, seems an egregious waste of one's incarnation to me.Altogether, an astounding mash-up of elements of New Age Thought that make absolutely no sense. That is, unless you are willing to suspend all critical thinking capability, accept that a Jewish angel channeled this information through a woman calling herself, \\"Tachi-ren\\" and have no actual knowledge about Traditional Chinese Medicine, yoga, astronomy, physics, chemistry and anatomy.\\"What Is Lightbody\\" is a book about adult make-believe, written by a LARPer.

After the plentiful number of forwards, new introductions and revisions, there might have been something important to read, but by then it was almost too late.I would have liked to read more about the levels of consciousness and spiritual infusion. Those few pages were the meat of the book.Unfortunately it was written so poorly, the real message became lost in translation and instead, it sits in realm of past-time (pas say?) and the ego. Something that could have been sweetly compelling, informative and interesting, is not.The exercises and potions which take up about one half of the total number pages, are nothing new and in fact, they are really rather boring and long. The essential oil potions that supposedly aid in ascension seem to be more like a sales command or promotion for the business that created the book.Honestly, I tried to like this little manual for ascension, yet couldn't. It just wasn't present or grounded enough, and it just didn't help me help myself.I would have liked to learn more about the idea of descension--calling the higher vibrations into our bodies as they are, as opposed to the potential of somehow flying off the planet into some other dimension, or how the planet itself was to fly into another dimensional space.This is key in these times: self-healing, self-help, self-actualization and expression.\\"What is Lightbody?\\" did nothing like that for me."},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"This book is a must for anybody on the ascension path.It clearly illustratates all the levels of lightbody encountered wilst raising one's vibration, but the real gems of this book are the many tools that are offered for the lightworker living through this fantatsic and challenging time of fast track evolution.

I felt a sense of peace. I finally found reasons that made sense and answers to the questions I did not even know how to ask. I know a book is for me when I find myself highlighting so many relevant and meaningful passages that I don't have time to cap the marker! This is such a book. How the purity and truth of the information is transmitted and maintained from Archangel Ariel through Tashira Tachi-ren to the words in the book, to me, is a mystery, but I do feel it. The descriptions of the different levels of Light Body, or statements like \\"The planet is requiring that people absolutely drop their enemy patterning\\" or \\"we ask that you ground up rather than down into the planet\\" are followed by examples of why, what that looks like or feels like to you and others, and what to expect on an individual and planetary level. This is a great book to use in an ascension practice or support group."},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"What is Lightbody is the most comprehensive guide to what is happening to planet earth and her inhabitants. Supplying the reader with tools, techniques, and invocations to breeze thru the process. Information is provided on mutational symptoms, the twelve levels of lightbody, the higher dimensions, the axiotonal system and much more. What is Lightbody is wonderful. A book you can't live without. Before reading this book, I thought I was crazy. Now I know I am a vast multidimensional master living HEAVEN. What is Lightbody is pure joy.Enjoy this book.Blessing and Live Heaven,Victoria Witkowsky"},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"This is a small, yet quite comprehensive book on understanding and working with Lightbody. It helps to understand one's multidimensional nature. It explores 12 levels of lightbody, followed by numerous invocations. And it also explains different psychophysiological changes that the person may likely experience in the process. Highly recommended together with An Ascension Handbook."},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"I have read and reread this book over and over with highlighting certain parts. It has helped with my transformation process and the symptoms to expect for each level. At first I thought this was all science fiction mumbo-jumbo crazy stuff (I as a male who grew up in a small midwest town with a christian religion) but as my own mystical experiences started to happen, (pushing feeling between my eyes for a year... then looking at the clock every day at exactly 11:11 then 1:11 then 2:22 then 3:33 and so on was the beginning) I referred back to this information again and again. IT RESONATES! As the levels progress this information makes more and more sense in a far out yet practicle way. It has also been very grounding when starting to question my own sanity (and at some levels, YOU WILL question your sanity). I've also read various other books from channels and a lot of this information LINES UP! This is about TRANSFORMATION EVOLUTION! It's personal and it's PLANETARY too. We are all connected through multidimensions of light. This information helps know what to expect might happen physically/mentally... HOW TO HELP DEAL with these changes. FANTASTIC! I found some of the info to be difficult to understand until I had approached that level... then found it MADE SOME SENSE. I also suggest that for anyone new to this, start to learn the chakra system. There are many great books on the chakras. Peace and Light to all of you. 2012 BRING IT ON!!!"},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"This book is great for beginners and advanced. It has a lot of reference on the different dimensions and their aspects as well as the different stages of light body.

I highly recommend this book to all people interested in the study of light body."},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"Clearly explains the different levels of lightbody and dimensions.

This book really started to expand my outlook on earthbound healers and lightworkers and what they are here to do. I still refer to this book a couple times a year and get a new piece of information from it. Always learning and growing."},{"Title":"What is Lightbody?","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this thin volume. The first 30 or so pages get bogged down in introductory material, including a dedication, acknowledgments, a forward, an 'onward', a preface, a parable, a 'clarion call', another preface, and an introduction. However, once the book actually starts, things take off. Despite the subject, which is difficult to capture in words, the book actually contains effective and practical tools for attuning to your true core and to the universe itself. Unfortunately, one of the main tools is potions and elixirs available only at a website. However, I found the many 'invocations' to be quite effective as affirmations. This shouldn't be your only or even your main source on your life journey, but I consider this a nice addition to my library."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: Beginnings and endings with Lifetimes in Between","review":"This book is a simple, beautifully stated, well illustrated teaching about the life cycle for very young (3-6 years old) children.

If you're a calendar buff like me, the layout of this book is very good, especially when you are making notes or planning your week. I also use a Palm PDA, and will make notes on the calendar first then when I am updating my Palm info, use the calendar as a reference. The biggest bonus is that it is HELLO KITTY!I can't wait for the 2003 edition! ..."},{"Title":"Treasures in Cross-Stitch","review":"This book has great projects, especially if you enjoy samplers! I loved the design for a firescreen, the Victorian era designs, and the Navajo tree of life. There are great ideas for using cross stitch to frame photos, to make a clock, make a footstool, etc. My favorite designs were those framed and hung as pictures. There are a number of samplers- from motif to alphabet. Something for every skill level - simple bookmarks to Hardanger. If you or someone you know likes to work samplers or enjoys antique needlework, this book is quite good. I bought this for a friend who is a huge fan of Jane Greenoff and then wanted the book for myself! Tastes vary, but if you like traditional patterns, you will probably enjoy this. There isn't anything &quot;cute&quot; (ie, teddy bears....) here, but rather designs that are inspired by antique needlework, tapestries, or art work. Little bit of background given for each project and lots of good tips!"},{"Title":"Treasures in Cross-Stitch","review":"If you own other titles by this author and are looking for totally fresh motifs, perhaps you'd better not buy this one: several motifs in this book by Jane Greenoff are no novelty to me, since I already have them in other books by her - such as \\"The Cross Stitchers' Bible\\" and \\"The Cross Stitchers' Bible Project Book\\". Anyway, I do not regret having bought this one, because the way she treats the motifs is different enough. And having some motifs appear in more than one book can be a way to learn how to adapt patterns to attain different results! Here everything smells of the past. The photographs are gorgeous, very inspirational. And she adds to the past aura by sharing very interesting historical information, like the origin of motifs and life style at the time. The quality of the charts is great as normal in her books - large, well explained color charts. Overall, a very beautiful book that should be owned by everyone who likes needlework - and who likes to go beyond the superficial to find the roots and to really get involved in a project."},{"Title":"Treasures in Cross-Stitch","review":"This amazing treasury of crossstitch designs has kept me inspired for months! The designs are in colour and are a great size to work from. The colours chosen for each pattern are excellent. My favourite is the Crazy Patchwork design with the freedom to add your own touches in the finishing stages. Each design is shown with a coloured photograph of the finished work, as well as information on stiching. Different skill levels are included so that you can work to your own level of experience. Stunning designs and great information. My favourite cross stitch book so far!"},{"Title":"The Darvas system for over-the-counter profits","review":"I am a huge fan of the author of this book, Nicolas Darvas. I have used his system during bull markets with much success, returning $4000 profit per trade and $10,000 profit in one month trading an account under six figures. While he gives excellent insight in this book about some of his trading methods like finding the small companies that will benefit from a large companies new technology through suppling components, his previous books are much better. In this book (Written in 1970) the author predicts the coming boom in the over the counter market which is now known as the Nasdaq. He gives advice on coming hot industries and lays down some very good trading principles, but sadly most of his material is out dated. Buy this book to get a look at the way a master trader's mind works, but you really need his other books \\"How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market\\" and \\"Wall Street the other Las Vegas\\" to fully learn his amazing stock trading system that could make you wealthy during a bull market."},{"Title":"The Darvas system for over-the-counter profits","review":"Best book you'll ever read on investing, if you believe that stocks should only be bought if they are going to go up. The author tells how he finally learned, through trial and error (mostly error), what distinguishing characteristics a stock that is going up posesses.Just as important, he shows how to determine if the selection was wrong and expertly discusses the psychological struggles the mind deals with throughout the stock holding period. A MUST READ for anyone determined to consistently make money in the markets. Has helped my own investing tremendously."},{"Title":"The Darvas system for over-the-counter profits","review":"While everyone points to his other books, this one is exactly word for word almost William O'Neil's CANSLIM system.

To be more precise, I would recommend it for those who have studied German in high school or college for a year or more. In 542 pages, it covers all the major areas of German grammar in considerable depth. Extensive examples and exceptions are provided. The organization of the book is logical and understandable, and the table of contents helps one to find what one is seeking. My main qualm is with the index. It is split into three parts: a German word index, an English word index, and a topic index. The German word index is for finding notes and examples on the use of specific German words. The English word index is for finding ways to express English concepts in German. The topic index is supposed to be much like a conventional index as you would find in any reference book. The problem is that the indices are poorly organized and not particularly useful. I almost never find myself using the word indices, as they usually don't point to particularly useful or applicable information. (A much better resource for looking up the usage of specific German words is Langenscheidts DaF Gro&szlig;w&ouml;rterbuch, and any good English-German dictionary, such as Harper Collins College Dictionary, is quite suitable for looking up ways to express English concepts in German.) The topic index is OK, but needs more entries and more depth to be of much use. In a reference book such as this one, indices are quite important, and more attention should be paid to them here. Nonetheless, the book is well worth the list price of 29.95 USD or 41.95 CAD."},{"Title":"Hammer's German Grammar and Usage (HRG) (German Edition)","review":"As as German minor, I figured it would do me a bunch of good to have something on hand that can answer my &quot;quick&quot; German grammer problems. Wow! Was I in for a treat when I got this book. It is absolutely great! Not only does it explain almost any problem that you could ever encounter, but it also gives great examples, so you don't struggle to figure out how to use it correctly based on the definition alone. The index is super! You can look up a word such as &quot;neben&quot; and it gives the exact local of it. I assumed the index would be a bit more ambiguous (I guess that is the appropriate word in this case), but it is so precise that it makes finding any problem easy. Each chapter is labeled and classified, so if you are having problems with pronouns, per say, then you can simply turn to the section and have at it. There are charts throughout, too, which help if you are in a hurry. However, I would definitely NOT depend on this book if I had no idea what I was doing in German to begin with. The grammer problems/solutions are quick and to the point, so if you don't know what you are doing to begin with, then this will just confuse you more. This is definitely a book for those intermediate or advanced in this language. I classify this book as a MUST for any serious learner of German."},{"Title":"Hammer's German Grammar and Usage (HRG) (German Edition)","review":"This isn't for beginners.

Occasionally it may be difficult to locate specific areas, due to the Dewey-decimal-like system used to label sections.What makes this book so useful is that it will cover *every* grammar issue a student could possibly encounter in the classroom during a complete study of the language. I used this book starting in my 3rd year of college, and it has continued to be of tremendous value long thereafter.Excellent examples, exceptions to the rules... all clearly described."},{"Title":"Hammer's German Grammar and Usage (HRG) (German Edition)","review":"A great REFERENCE book containing just about anything an intermediate or advanced student might want to know. Its refreshing for example to read a chapter on \\"Cases\\" that starts off: \\"Case is.....There are 4 cases in German....\\", rather than simply \\"There are 4 cases in German....\\". It also contains clear comments on constructions/words that are typical of particular regional dialects, stating if/when these are considered \\"sub-standard\\" or \\"Hochdeutsch\\". This is very useful considering the significant differences in regional dialects which may even confuse native speakers at times.This is not a book thats easy (or possible!) to sit down and read from cover to cover. Considering the enermous breadth of the contents and fine detail this is understandable. However, the author does not go to great pains to summarise or make the material easy to remember. This is the books only failing, in my opinion, and the reason why it falls a little short of perfect as a reference book."},{"Title":"No dessert until you've finished your mashed potatoes","review":"My father had given this to me in 1966 and I had lost it.

The 2004 calendar slipped a little, and replaced a lot of the amusing quotes with simple gramatical errors that were so tedious, you had to spend 5 minutes figuring out what in the world was wrong with them. The 2005 calendar does away with any of the amusing parts, and strictly deals with minute grammatical slips, or even better yet, quotes with virtually nothing wrong with them at all. In fact, the editor incorporated a small explanation at the bottom of nearly every page, just to keep people from being confused as to why something is funny. If something like that is required to see the humor in something like this, you know that there really is no humor at all.Examples:Tuesday, March 1st\\"We need a engery policy\\"Editors Note: \\"Granted, only one letter off, but still...\\"Wednesday, October 19th\\"There's a lot of Pakistani Americans who are pleased you are here today, sir.\\"Editor's Note: \\"One doesn't even notice after awhile.\\"If you find the previous two passages funny, then perhaps this calendar is for you, since most of the year is just like that.

Translated within roughly 50 years of the original the translator keeps the rhyme scheme of the Italian and in doing sacrifices accuracy of meaning. However, in comparing this work to several more recent translations I actually prefer this on a line by line basis as the more recent translations sacrifice poetics to keep meaning. The real problem with this edition is that it has no footnotes, no introduction, nothing but the translated text itself. If you do not know something about epic poetry, Virgil (who is often referenced or imitated by the poet), Tasso's personal history and the first crusade you will be lost and there is nothing here to help you."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem delivered","review":"Let's be clear on what I am reviewing...I am reviewing Jerusalem Delivered as published in hardcover by IndyPublish. This poem is also available in paperback as published by John Hopkins Univer. Press, and it is that version of the poem that first captured my attention. The John Hopkins paperback is a translation by A.M. Esolen and, in my humble opinion, it is magnificent in almost every way -- good introductory material on the original poet (Tasso) and the poem itself, great translation, good endnotes, nice packaging. The only draw back to the John Hopkins-published book is that it is a paperback, and after reading the poem I had to have a hardcover for my budding library. After months of searching I stumbled across the subject of this review...the IndyPublish hardcover version of Jerusalem Delivered. Where to start...? Firstly, the translation is (I think) that of Edward Fairfax, written in the late 1700s (perhaps...?). I prefer Esolen's, but the Fairfax is good. I get the feeling reading the Fairfax that the translator often tried too hard to force the rhymes, often employing punctuation to emphasize the rhymes and creating a very sing-song and, at times, tiring la-te-la-te-la-te-doe-doe. But, it is for the most part still a good read if you can break the sing-song cycle.Unfortunately, the IndyPublish hardback comes with absolutely no notes, introductory or otherwise. The cast of characters in the poem is very large, the scenes and settings shift, the action ebbs and flows, ...I believe that in order to appreciate the Fairfax as presented by IndyPublish you must have prior and intimate knowledge of the poem (cast, scenes, settings, history, etc) prior to reading. Call me a simpleton (you don't really need to, it's just an expression), but I found the notes and introductory material essential to provide context and full appreciation for Tasso's accomplishment. Without the knowledge and context, a non-scholar like myself might find the Fairfax to be a somewhat interesting but confusing and very long poem written in Elizabethan English about many people mentioned by name with whom the reader is not familiar...the reader may appreciate the art, but would miss much of the fullness of the poem provided by ready access to commentary, etc.Now, a comment about presentation. I am not familiar with IndyPublish but I visited their web page and, if I understand their mission, it might be a neat idea...and I can understand why this edition of Jerusalem Delivered might not as fancy-shmancy (ok, maybe I am a simpleton) as some other books. The outer appearance of the IndyPublish J.D. reminds me of an un-labeled Baptist hymnal...it is bland. But, hey, you don't buy books because of flashy covers (...do you?). What I found very detracting was the formatting of the text itself. For example, in canto 1 each 8-line stanza is center justified, for canto 2 each stanza is left justified, for canto 3 each is right justified, for canto 4 each is centered, and in canto 5 the stanzas alternate between center and left justified and the left-justified stanzas are not centered in the page. Folks, this poem has 20 cantos, each of about 100 to 130 stanzas...switching the formatting from canto to canto, even within some cantos, is extremely distracting...and, in my opinion, results in a product that looks amateurish, like somebody was trying out the new desktop publishing software and wanted to sample all of the justification options again and again and again and again. Keep your Dramamine handy, its a bumpy ride. Also, individual stanzas in some cantos are broken across pages...maybe the first two lines of a stanza on the bottom of one page and the next six lines at the top of the following page. These 8-line stanzas are each singular units, the building blocks of the poem...they should be left whole! Like individual movements in a symphony...didn't you hate flipping the album over when side 1 was done but the music continued no side 2? Or, how about when your 8-track tape faded and changed tracks right in the middle of your favorite song? Freebird was meant to be heard in its full 18-minute glory, can't we give Tasso the same respect?!?!"},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"I came across at the bookstore around the same time my bestfriend was fighting her battle with breast cancer. The synopsis promised a true story of a devoted father's battle to find the cure for his fatally ill children with the Pompe desease, and that was the reason I picked up the book in desperate search of inspiration to keep my terminally ill friend motivated.John Crowley is an inspiration and the strength that both him and Aileen displayed throughout their neverending fight is amazing. I applaud Ms.Anand for wonderfully presenting the chronology of the Crowleys' life in such a captivating way, while carefully keeping the facts and not interrupting the flow of the story.I am a business professional and have especially enjoyed the business side of the story, the fund-raising, Novazyme, Genzyme deal, etc. I wouldn't really call this book an MBA crash course, but this really make an ultimate case study (and I was happy to see that Harvard is now already using it in their course). An business person reading this book would enjoy the storyline and understand why sometimes hard decision had to be made.Just visited the Crowleys's website, and was happy to see that John Jr, Megan and Patrick are there, they're so big now and look great!This book is a page turner, I finished this in 3 sleepless nights."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"The scientist in this book, William Canfield, is my first cousin. When I heard about the book (all I knew previously from family was that he made a drug that would help a disease, founded a company, sold it for millions of dollars, and still works for them), I immediately got it. Then I couldn't put it down, even though my cousin isn't even mentioned until page 82. I stayed up late several nights reading and finished in 4 days. I've often asked myself if it was because my cousin was such a big part of the story, but then thought it was a great story, well-written, and I would have enjoyed it even without the family tie. I found the section about venture capital a little slow, and the heavy description of the various cures was confusing to my non-scientific brain, but it was so worth the effort to finish the book. I also did some internet research and found YouTube videos and lots of information on Novazyme, Genzyme, and Pompe's disease.

His efforts have been truly heroic and groundbreaking, literally saving the lives of his children and improving their health by spearheading the development of drugs to treat Pompe. Their story first came to the attention of the public through a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal by Geeta Anand.The lengthy subtitle of Anand's book, How a Father Raised $100 Million--and Bucked the Medical Establishment--in a Quest to Save His Children, tells most of the story in a nutshell, but doesn't come close to communicating the challeges Crowley, his family, and business associates challenged along the way. Chasing Miracles was heart-breaking as the father tells his story, but The Cure will break your heart, too. Much of it does read like something a WSJ business journalist would write, recounting the business deals and corporate life in meticulous detail, but Anand captures Crowley's emotion and passion as well as she describes the business angle. Besides learning about Pompe disease, the reader will gain insight into the biotech industry and Wall Street dealings.The Cure is well-written and tells an amazing, inspring story. Anand chronicles the events meticulously and compellingly. But I think she fell prey to the common \\"stretch this article into a book\\" syndrome. I appreciated her commitment to detail and skillful crafting of the story, but I couldn't help thinking that I would have been satisfied by the articles themselves. All criticism aside (I realize this criticism only reflects my own shallowness and laziness anyway!), the bottom line is an inspiring story that will make you want to meet this terrific family and join their efforts to treat rare, formerly untreatable diseases."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"I have enjoyed the book thus far and as contiue to read the book I feel encourage that the father will be able to get the trail for his children and verything will work out great."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"The book behind the Hollywood movie \\"Extraordinary Measures\\".

Much of the story is quite heartbreaking, so be sure you have tissues handy if you're prone to tears. Do I plan to see the movie? Yes, but there will need to be more \\"action\\" in it or it will be too dry to be entertaining.

I found myself skipping more pages than I was reading."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"This is a business book and not a scientific book, so I was a little disappointed."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"This wonderful book has a lot of emotional depth and complexity. John Crowley, the young father, is brash, brilliant, arrogant, and ignorant. He makes personal mistakes and business mistakes, yet you remain drawn to his story by empathy for his desperation as he fears that his small children will suffer a slow painful death. It's an honest and interesting portrait of a real human being, not a one-dimensional hero.It's not really a business book and you don't need any familiarity with venture capital financing to understand the text, but John Crowley's business provides the book with a fascinating emotional contrast between his frantic urgency as a parent and the dispassionate PowerPoint analyses expected by his investors. They share a common goal, but the mindset is completely different.It's not really a science book, but the drug development process adds to the story's drama. There's no Eureka! moment when all the problems are solved. Patients are desperate for anything they can get as soon as they can get it, but the science is ambiguous, the bizarre biotechnology manufacturing processes are difficult to operate, and then the clinical trial results are uncertain. An experimental compound might kill a young patient, or bring quick improvements that fade over time, or have different impacts on different patients. And even with these uncertain prospects there's strong competition among parents for the extremely limited number of places in trials.One of the most appealing aspects of the book is the author's light touch. She never puts herself or her opinions into the story. The book ends with an Afterword relating events subsequent to the basic text, but the author doesn't seize pages to tell us what it all means. At the end I found myself wondering, \\"Well, what does it all mean?\\" I looked up Pompe disease information on the internet, wondered what people in the Pompe \\"community\\" thought about the book, and wanted to know how the science has progressed. The book makes you think and it makes you care."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"As a father myself, I was incredibly moved by this book. It's an inspiring story about the things parents will do for their children. The writing is effortless, vivid and sensitive - you go through the Crowley's ups and downs with them from chapter to chapter, and you cannot stop until you have finished the entire book. I never thought reading about biotech firms could be this enoyable either - the author does an excellent job of taking you into world of biotech and venture capital and making it at once interesting, informative and easy to understand.This is simply a great book about a family's incredible, heart-wrenching story. A must read for all, especially for parents (and would be entrepreneurs)."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"Kudos to this story of John Crowley's unbelievably ambitious, frequently frustrated and sometimes ethically reckless effort to find a cure for the fatal disease that afflicts two of his children.This book's perfect pacing and lean, utilitarian prose treats a tale that could have been as saccharine as a Lifetime movie as an unremittingly suspenseful thriller as Crowley has to balance his fiduciary responsibilities as the head of a biotechnology firm with his pressing need to get his children into a clinical drug trial before they die.It's a predicament that makes Sophie's Choice seem like a simple dilemma to resolve, but the author effortlessly weaves the complex world of biotechnology research and venture capital into a family story that any parent could identify with. It reminds me of David Simon's Homicide or Jon Harr's Civil Action.Crowley may now be a rich man, but it's uplifting to read about a CEO driven to succeed -- even if it means bending the rules -- by motives far more moral than the soul-sucking avarice that dominates Wall Street today."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"I also couldn't put this book down. It's not only an incredible story about the lengths this one man went to in order to come up with treatment for his children, it's also a fascinating and rare look inside the biotechnology industry. Geeta Anand has woven into this amazing human story a suspenseful business story, AND a compelling scientific story. I can't think of any other business or scientific tale that is so clear, lucid, and fascinating. Hats off (and when is the sequel coming out?)"},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"Ms. Anand tells a wonderful tale of true love. Love of a husband and wife faced with unexpected challenges so early in their marriage, and how they struggled to keep that love alive under both sad and horrific conditions. Love of children for their parents and each other. Love of family, both immediate and extended. And love for each and every person touched by the fight for the cure. I was swept away by the human drama and just when I thought I knew what was going to happen next, the story look another unforeseen turn. It's amazing to realize that this is a true story. Life and love doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"This book was made into the movie \\"Extraordinary Measures,\\" and I'm glad that the author probably was well-paid for the effort she put into this book. The level of detail here is extraordinary in itself. But at the same time, it is also the book's one weakness: what story is she telling? Is this a human interest story, an inspiring story of the struggles and triumphs of a family with more than its fair share of heartbreak and suffering? Or is it a story about venture capital and the role it plays in the pharmaceutical industry? Actually, it's both, and it pretty much works, since John Crowley is both the father of an extraordinary family and the business executive who tries to find a cure for a terrible disease.But because of this double focus, almost any reader is going to find parts of the story a waste of time, and get the urge to start skimming sections. There is also quite a bit of information about the science side of the story as well, but again, neither the human interest reader nor the business reader is likely to care.The writing is smooth and unobtrusive. The pacing is excellent. The story is heart-breaking and amazing. But the question of audience remains.Also, since the author originally wrote two stories about this family and their situation for the Wall Street Journal, one of the morals she draws in her conclusion is that this book demonstrates \\"the power of the profit motive to speed science into medicine.\\" I think many readers would question whether this story or any story shows \\"the power of the profit motive\\" in such a positive light. The need to put stockholder value first, above the needs of patients with rare diseases, and the extraordinary cost of the medicine, as well as the extraordinary financial rewards that a man like John Crowley receives, all call that conclusion into question in my mind."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"There is an old axiom that \\"God does not give you more than you can handle\\". But imagine living each day with the knowledge that two of your three young children have a rare and deadly disease that could claim their lives at any time......and there was no treatment available. That was the heartbreaking dilemma that John and Aileen Crowley were presented with and somehow had to deal with on a daily basis. Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter Geeta Anand chronicles the amazing story of the Crowley's epic struggle to keep their youngsters alive in \\"The Cure: How A Father Raised $100 Million--and Bucked the Medical Establishment--in a Quest to Save His Children\\". This is a compelling story that will grab your attention in Chapter One and simply never let go.Now as you might have surmised from the rather lengthy title of this book John Crowley was not exactly \\"Joe Sixpack\\". John was a brilliant individual with a wealth of education. Over the years John Crowley had received a degree from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, spent a year and a half at the Naval Academy, scored a law degree from Notre Dame and last but not least earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. John and his wife Aileen looked forward to a healthy and prosperous future. Aileen gave birth to their first child, a bouncing baby girl they named Megan on December 16, 1996. Just 15 months later the Crowley's discovered that Megan was suffering from an extremely rare neuromuscular affliction known as Pompe disease. People with Pompe fail to produce sufficient quantities of a particular enzyme and as a result there is progressive muscular weakness throughout the body. Most young children diagnosed with Pompe at that time did not live past the age of 5. To make matters worse, John and Aileen's third child Patrick, born in March of 1998 was also diagnosed with Pompe. Although several scientists and biotechnology companies were working on the problem there was still no treatment for Pompe. The clock was ticking and the lives of his kids were at stake. John Crowley was bound and determined to spearhead the effort to find a cure for Pompe. He and Aileen would go to extraordinary lengths to achieve their goal. This is what \\"The Cure\\" is all about.Over the next few years John Crowley would dedicate all of his time, talent and treasure in a valiant effort to save Megan and Patrick. He worked tirelessly to raise funds to find a cure for Pompe and founded an organization known as the Children's Pompe Foundation. Ultimately he would become the CEO of a company called Novazyme, a biotech firm dedicated to finding a cure for Pompe and other related diseases. It was exhausting work that required literally every fiber of John's being. The extended battle to save their kids nearly cost John and Aileen their marriage. John's work required him to be away from home much of the time leaving Aileen to take care of three little ones.While Aileen did have nurses to assist her at home every single day was fraught with danger. One wonders how John and Aileen managed to get through it all. When I think about the trivial things I get upset about it makes me feel ashamed.\\"The Cure: How A Father Raised $100 Million--and Bucked the Medical Establishment--in a Quest to Save His Children\\" makes you stop and reflect about what is truly important in life. Despite enormous hardships John and Aileen Crowley proved to be more than up to the challenge. And in working so hard on behalf of Megan and Patrick the Crowleys also impacted other Pompe families around the nation who found themselves in the same boat. \\"The Cure\\" is an inspiring and well-written book. I don't know how the Crowley's found the strength to deal with the hand that they were dealt. I became exhausted just reading about it. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"This is a great book. John Crowley discovers that his two youngest kids are dying from a rare disease - one so rare that nobody has bothered to invest a lot in a cure. Crowley ends up quitting his job, starting a drug company and finding a drug to treat his kids. Only to discover that the FDA considers it a conflict of interest to include his own kids in the trials!It's a great heart-warming story of a family's struggle with a little known disease written by a great writer - Greeta Anand. The book is mostly about the business side (as opposed to the medical side) of the disease. It's a story about the dad's struggle to find a cure for the disease. He's never run a company, never gotten funding, knows little about biology or science, and yet he starts a very successful biotech company and finds a drug that works - all for his kids.I found the conflict of interest part interesting. John Crowley brings in people suffering from Pompe to meet the people in the company. Most of the researchers have never met anyone suffering from the disease they are trying to cure! And get this, it could be considered a conflict of interest to meet the people they are trying to cure! That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. In the computer high tech world we consider it a very good thing to meet your users - you are making the product for them! In Crowley's case the visitors helped motivate and empassion his company."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"Very good book - Interesting story. Highlights are the lengths a family goes through to help their children, and the inspirational message. I think the title is ironic, since there is not actually a \\"cure\\" for Pompe Disease, merely a treatment to help stabilize and possibly restore some muscle function. Also misleading a bit, because while Crowley without a doubt worked very hard on a cure, the actual treatment approved by the fda was not the main one he was involved with researching/funding. Nonetheless, still a very admirable man and good story."},{"Title":"The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children","review":"An inspirational story about every parent's worst fear. John and Aileen Crowley start out as the perfect couple on the path to success in family and career. Their second child becomes sick and tests reveal she has a rare genetic disease called Pompe. Children with this disease usually do not outlive their toddler years and quickly lose all of their muscle movement eventually leading to organ failure. Soon after they test their third child and he has the same condition. As terrible as this sounds their are many families suffering the same. The difference here is that John decides to start his own foundation to help cure the disease but primarily to get his children into a drug trial. This is the only way to have some hope for survival. As he goes down this road he eventually becomes the CEO of a small company developing a potential drug. This company gets sold to another larger company and John leads the program for Pompe. His focus never sways from getting his children into a drug trial but so much gets in the way including the difficulty and challenge of finding a cure and the conflict of interest from his role in the disease cure and his personal circumstances.The book is well written in narrative form and in addition to the emotional family story the reader gets a good dose of the science and business of drug development. The personal story stands out as it is both painful and inspirational. As a parent I could not imagine being in the Crowley's situation. As a business person I could not imagine John's determination and singular pursuit of the goal to get help for his kids. Be prepared for a few lumps in the throat and a few tears as well."},{"Title":"Rand Mcnally 2007 Road Atlas Midsize (Rand Mcnally Road Atlas Midsize)","review":"This atlas has a lot of extraneous pages of info in it which in my opinion should have been left out to make room for the counties.

She's got a good sense of humor, a nice sense of pace and I probably am going to read her \\"sequels\\" to this book. But I have to be honest -- there should have been more room for something like, you know, a plot or more character development or more drama. Too many of the pages were used up describing more and more sex acts.Yes, so I'm a bit of a prude, I admit it. But that's not really what my complaint is about. I've read other authors who are just about as explicit and \\"spicy\\" in their descriptions of lovemaking and I can deal with it if the rest of the story is gripping and engaging. But what made this book different was that so many pages were devoted to descriptions of sex and it seemed to me that the overall plot suffered because of it.Okay, so maybe I overstate it a bit -- there was some plot in there, some conflict in there, sure. But over and over and over again, the same hot sex scenes, just a little different this time. Come on! I'd rather have read something more, you know, dramatic. Something that moved the plot along. Some more *action* of a different kind. But most of the story was set up in this isolated cabin, with these two people bursting at the seams with lust. It kind of got stale after a while, you know?Not to say that I thought it was *that* bad. Like I said, it's obvious that Ms. Jackson is a skilled writer and she fleshed out the characters of Delany's brothers enough so I want to read about what happens to them in her following books. And I'm hoping that the next book I read will have, you know, a little more room for a *story*. That's all."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"Brenda Jackson did it. She broke a color barrier and with as much dithering as the Harlequin/Silhouette book factory has done over the years about the issue I say that it's about time!I only wish that the groundbreaking work where better. Unfortunately, I think that some editor at Silhouette got a hold of this and tried to wipe out the references to black culture. The language tends to be very formal at times and slang terms like \\"da bomb\\" have become \\"the bomb\\". I was a little annoyed that the narrative got hung up on this stuff.I love the five brothers, and I can smell series in air when I see them.

Then there's Delaney who's still a virgin and is appalled by Jamal's beliefs and therefore refused to sleep with him under any circumstances - then BAM - suddenly they're in love and those resolves went unconvincingly out the window - their love did not develop and I was not convinced that it was true. Then there are her brothers - WHAT'S UP WITH THEM??? They come off as stalkers rather than concerned brothers - and why should they be so concerned - she's 25 after all and just became a doctor - it seemed like they had nothing better to do than to constantly stalk their sister like a pack of fools and act stupid when they see her with a man - so unreal - they were acting like lovers not brothers - that was a major turn off - I still read it in 2 days tho so it kept my interest for that long even tho I was rolling my eyes in disbelief most of the time.

Well, have no fear, DELANEY'S DESERT SHEIKH is here! This work marks Brenda Jackson's debut venture with Silhouette Desire. DELANEY'S DESERT SHEIKH is steaming with sexual tension and truly unforgettable love scenes. Jackson brings it all using the plot of strangers falling in lust, mutual respect and then love. So, find that comfortable spot, get a cool drink and let's not forget that fan - because you're going to need it!What happens when you place a liberated, forthright pediatrician and a charismatic, desert prince, with politically incorrect ideas about women in a cabin alone together? You get F-I-R-E-W-O-R-K-S! Delaney Westmoreland and Sheikh Jamal Ari Yassir are due for a much needed vacation from the stresses of their occupations. Delaney just finished medical school and is in desperate want of relaxation and most importantly sleep. She's also seeking to escape her family's devoted attentions with some solitude. When her cousin suggests a cabin of which he is part owner, it's the perfect solution. While Jamal has just finished intense negotiations concerning his country, he's also seizing this time to mentally prepare himself for his upcoming, arranged marriage. With the summit over, Jamal's mind wanders and he's soon missing the affections of his long-time mistress. Likewise, the offer from his friend to have the cabin for his leisure is met with enthusiasm. That is until he meets Delaney.From the moment Jamal sees Delaney, he wants her. At first, it's because he has been on a self-imposed hiatus from intimacy to concentrate on the conference. However, despite their hostile attitude toward each other, an instant chemistry binds them together. Their admirable sparring only hides the passionate feelings that are barely beneath the surface.When two determined individuals are placed in a strange situation, confrontations for superiority are soon to materialize and Delaney and Jamal do not disappoint. Delaney firmly states her desire to keep her virginity until love and marriage comes along. Though Delaney's parents are good role models for a loving relationship, she observes how her charming, but domineering five brothers treat the women in their lives as playthings until that one woman who can challenge them comes along.Despite her wanting no part of that, she remains intensely attracted to Jamal. Jamal is equally unwavering in his obsessive craving to have her for himself. He offers an alliance with \\"no strings,\\" just for the time they remain at the retreat. Of course, Delaney says no, initially, but finds herself ready to relinquish her innocence so that she can experience the power of making love. Delaney becomes a temptress and a willing victim of Jamal's allure. Jamal's magnetism is evident in his inventive kissing technique that leaves Delaney dizzy with wonder and anticipation. What ensues next is a love so filled with caring, ardor and sensuality that even time and distance cannot disrupt the memories or the love from continuing.Kudos to Jackson's engaging attempt at introducing an expansive romance audience to characters who are fresh, intelligent and exciting. Jackson validates African American women as encompassing the same personal concerns and professional tenacity that women of all races do. DELANEY'S DESERT SHEIK is refreshingly void of concentrating on the differences between persons with diverse backgrounds, but celebrates those distinctions instead. DELANEY'S DESERT SHEIKH proves love knows no boundaries and comes when you least expect it - even with a foreign prince!Jackson makes a valiant effort in making the characters come alive. Jamal and Delaney had no insecurities about themselves and they expressed that confidence with the acceptance of the other's social values and religious practices. Though other African American authors paved the way in published mainstream series romance, Brenda Jackson's entrance stands as a great romance read period - not just a great African American romance novel.Also, the format for launching Jamal and Delaney's relationship was well written. We are given an exclusive look at their connection without interference from \\"outside forces.\\" The reader becomes that \\"fly on the wall\\" and is allowed to appreciate this special love. There was good use of secondary characters who will eventually have their own stories. It is those secondary players', especially Jamal's stepmother, whose advice propels Jamal to act on his fate with Delaney. Still, we get an all too brief glimpse of the Westmoreland brothers. But what we do receive is the knowledge their stories will sizzle as well. The forecast is that the Westmoreland family will become just as popular as Jackson's Madaris family series.DELANEY'S DESERT SHEIKH is a quick and thoroughly enjoyable read. Once you begin it, you will not want to put it down! I am anxiously anticipating Delaney's brothers' stories. If they can live up to Jamal's example, let's just say, \\"Keep those fans handy, girls!\\""},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"In Brenda Jackson's Delaney's Desert Sheikh, we are introduced to Delaney Westmoreland and the entire Westmoreland clan. Delaney, a recent medical school graduate, travels from Atlanta to the woods of North Carolina for some rest and relaxation. Upon her arrival she stumbles upon Jamal Ari Yassir, a prince from the Middle Eastern country of Tahran. Both Delaney and Jamal were promised the use of the cabin for one month, each refuse to leave and therein lies the problem.Delaney, the youngest and only female within a family of five brothers, is independent and headstrong and romance is the furthest thing from her mind. Jamal, his father's right-hand man when it comes to deal-making for his country, is arrogant and just as stubborn as Delaney. The only thing on his mind is seducing Delaney if only for one night.Will Delaney ignore her upbringing and succumb to passion? Will Jamal ignore the expectations and obligations placed upon him by his family and countrymen? Brenda Jackson explores two vastly different cultures with a unique realism of their natives' behaviors. Her romantic scenes are explosive but tastefully done and the introduction of the five Westmoreland brothers, Dare, Storm, Thorn, Chase and Stone leaves you anticipating more from this family.Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I want to tell you what a fantastic job you did with Delaney and her Sheikh.I have never purchased the Silouette books before, but once I saw Brenda's name on a book, I knew the book was worth purchasing and the book is worth every coin.What a great story. I have one objection... It wasn't long enough.I know we are greedy, but this is what happens when you feed us great stories.I'm hoping you will do stories on at least two of Delaney's brothers, however we would love to hear about all 5 brothers.I can't wait for the series to continue with the Westmoreland Brothers and the women who tame them.I can wait for Tara to tame Thorn.Anyway, I want compliment you on a job well done.Brenda, you now have two family sagas to continue and I know that this will be a job well done.I can't wait for the Madaris family saga to continue, especially Chrissy's story."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"Well Well Well... Brenda Jackson has gone into the depths of Jamal and Delaney. This handsome sheikh and this beautiful woman with no ideas of love, romance, or anything as they both escape to a cabin that is supposed to be secluded and awaiting their individual solitude. Delaney arrives to find that the cabin is not secluded but being occupied by this handsome, yet arrogant Sheikh. As the both agree that neither is leaving the cabin, they will just have to coexist, which is going to be difficult, since they both are very attracted to one another. Delaney is sassy and stubborn, and Jamal is straightforward and persistent. As they begin their game of determination and also persuasion, this story gets HOT! HOT! HOT!!. This is not like any of Brenda Jacksons other books, you will enjoy and be surprised. Now Jamal has a secret weapon \\"Ares\\" oooohhh la la..... Now the ultimate force has been released and I truelly believe anyone that is given the pleasure of experiencing \\"ARES\\" will never be the same! This is definitely a must read. Brenda you have out done yourself or should I say that Prince Jamal has perfected the technique and won!! Now I also look forward to learning more about Dare, Storm, Thorn, Chase and Stone. Because I have a feeling that the Westmoreland Brothers will be competition for the Madaris Brothers. (can't wait...)"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"AFTER READING SEVERAL REVIEWS ABOUT THE BOOK \\"DELANEY'S DESERT SHEIKH\\", I KNEW I HAD TO ADD THIS BOOK TO MY GROWING ROMANTIC NOVEL COLLECTION. I PURCHASED THE BOOK USED FOR TWICE THE REGULAR PRICE AND IT WAS WORTH IT. THE BOOK WAS TRULY A JOY TO READ. IT WAS ONE BIG ROMANTIC AND SEXUAL COCKTAIL! THE CHARACTERS AND THE STORY WERE SO REALISTIC. BRENDA IS A GIFTED WRITER. SHE KNOWS HOW TO TELL A STORY THAT HOLDS THE READER'S INTEREST. THE TROUBLE WITH READING BRENDA'S BOOKS IS TO STOP. ONCE YOU START, YOU CAN'T STOP. TRY THE BOOK, YOU WILL LIKE IT. I'M NOW ONE OF BRENDA'S MOST DEVOTED FANS!"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"As a graduation present Reggie gives his cousin, Sassy Delaney Westmoreland a month of rest and relaxation at his North Carolina cabin but upon her arrival discovers a trespasser. The sexy-as-sin Prince of Tahran, Jamal Ari Yassir has already set up camp in her cabin! They both refuse to leave and after Delaney integrates him and verifies with Reggie the he is legit, she decides to share the cabin with him and lets him know upfront that there will be no hanky-panky and that she would understand if he began to feel too crowded and decided to leave. Even though she was instantly attracted to him she knows she is stubborn enough to handle him. The sheikh was confused by his attraction to her because he has very little tolerance for western women because in his country women do what they are told. How in the world will they peacefully make it through the month? The hammock scene-that was original, talk about anticipation....Wow!!!!This was my first Brenda Jackson read and I have been on a mad hunt for any and everything by her since. This story is sooo... romantic and Ms. Jackson proves the point that is does not take 400+ pages to write a great romance story.I had no idea that Harlequin was publishing this type of story. I was recommended this book based on my love for inter-racial love stories and though it's less than 200 pages it's definitely a keeper and worth reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I loved this book. Mrs Brenda Jackson has done it again.Please go out and get this book as soon as possible.The Westmorlands are going to be a trip.I think they are going to be five brothers that put you in the mind of Clayton Maderis. I loved the love scenes they are HOT HOT HOT!"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I love Brenda Jackson, she is one of my favorite writers and never fails to come through with her characters and HOT action. Although, it was hard to identify with Jamal because he was not a &quot;true brother&quot; as I would have liked for him to be as sticking with Ms Jackson's past characters, but Delaney and the love scenes more than made up for it. I am looking forward to her next book and especially the Madaris brothers."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"All I can say is \\"WELL NOW\\". The love scenes were too hot to handle. Excellent read. I've read 5 books from this series. I do believe this is the hottest. Delaney did not have a chance against a man that can make her climax with a kiss. Goodness. I have to research that. ;)"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"From the first sentence I knew the Desert Sheikh was going to be scorching!\\"This was the first time he had been between a pair of legs and not gotten what he wanted.\\"And yeah, I was right. The foreplay began at the word One and didn't let up until the final line. Yowza baby! I was digging it, very hot and surprisingly sweet at the same time.I am unfortunately a bit more grounded in reality so the whole five days it took them to fall in love was a bit of a stretch. Not buying it, sorry. This is an erotic romance in the truest sense of the word. If you are looking for some compelling, deep, heart wrenching tale of a love that will never die you are probably going to be disappointed. However if you are looking for something that makes you shift a little closer to your significant other because thing are a rumbling...this is the book for you.Story is solid, but not entrenched. The book is all about the foreplay, the tease, and then the holy mother look out below copulation. Post coital bliss is marked with life changing decisions and finally a sweet reunion. You know what is going to happen, it is cookie cutter and text book but that doesn't mean you don't get the warm fuzzies when you put it down.HOT and Sweet, that is my take. Not on my must read list but not is the slush pile either."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I always like books where there's this somewhat domineering \\"Iget my way all the time\\" prince that meets a head strong woman who refuses to bend to his every wish, and as usual Mrs. Jackson did not disappoint. Every was short and to the point. I read this book almost 4 years ago, so I can;t remember every detail, but I dod remember that I loved it."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I was soooooooooo excited when I heard about this series. A book from brenda jackson is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"More intrique from the Westmorelands. If you are looking for hot and sassy romance you must read Brenda Jackson's 'Delaney's Desert Sheikh' from Harlequin.What happens when a very vocal independent young woman meets a man who demands and expects no back talk and total obedience from his women? New college graduate Delaney Westmoreland heads to her cousins cabin for a month of R&R;, instead she finds an unexpected roommate, love and frustration. To complicate matters the roommate is a handsome charismatic Sheikh. We watch as Delaney and her Sheikh battle with each other, and their own emotions, as sexual tension and true feelings of love come forth in close quarters. The reality of their future together is dismal. Delaney finds that she is expected to be Prince Jamal's mistress, not his wife. Jamal is expected to find a wife in his homeland and run his country as his father has done. Even worse both also have to deal with all of Delaney's brothers who are overly protective of their sister.This is a valentine of a story.

The sex scenes was HOT and SIZZLING. I can't wait to read \\"Thorn and Tara's\\" story.Brenda Jackson's characters have a way of leaping off the pages of her books.I look forward to more stories about the Westmorland brothers."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"Brenda Jackson is a master at celebrating black love which is the reason I almost didn't buy this book .... I'm not big on interracial dating and didn't care to read about it. It was refreshing to read that the characters where people of color but hailed from different ethnic backgrounds. I particularly appreciated how the couples really didn't take too long to succomb to their feelings and let love blossom. In many of Mrs. Jackson's books, the main characters fight with themselves way too long about letting go of past hurt and just love.With that said, I still strongly recommend this book and all others written by Mrs. Jackson !"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"More intrique from the Westmorelands.

For all those who are like me and like to know the characters before they buy a book the Sheik is an Arabian-Berben man and Delaney is an African American woman.

It didn't take thought to keep up with the characters. I know it was a Harlequin, but it was not Brenda's usual. I kept having to look at the front picture to make sure it was a black woman she was talking about. Her other books (the Madaris family) are wonderful and I'm always glad to see which family member she will write about. I really hope she will have Valentine Kiss reissued."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I have always liked Ms Jackson's books published on the Arabesque/BET line.
