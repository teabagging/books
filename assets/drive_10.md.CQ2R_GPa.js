All the people that likes italian kitchen."},{"Title":"Nick stellino's glorious italian cooking","review":"I love Nick Stellino and this is a worthy follow up to his first book, \\"Cucina Amore\\".The recipes are easy to follow and allow the amateur cook to play with the recipes as they like. One of my favorites is \\"Pasta alla Vodka\\". There is no way to mess that recipe up! I've tried canned tomato sauce versus homemade sauce, dried herbs versus fresh herbs, pancetta versus bacon, etc. and it was always delicious (ideally, fresh is best andraises the meal to new heights, but as I said, even with canned ingredients, they still make a great meal)!Another favorite recipe is Pasta Incaciata. That one is worthy of a holiday gathering if not a Sunday dinner! Pasta alla Carbonara (one of serveral versions of this dish to try!), Chicken Paprikash (and the adorable love story that goes with it!), Pollo del Cacciatore, Herbed Pork Chops, Braised Sausages & Polenta, Torta Rustica and Lamb Meatballs with Girgento Suace are among my absolute faves!There are also a few calzone recipes and they came out just fine - and you can bake them instead of frying them. Not to mention recipes for pizza dough to make your own pizzas!I hadn't done many of the desserts from this book since I don't eat them too often, but there's a great cookie recipe known as \\"Cinnamon Sugar Cookies Dipped in Chocolate\\" Even if you don't dip the cookies in the chocolate, they are a great alternative to the same old chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. They'll stand out on a cookie tray. The desserts are for the most part typical of the Sicilian tradition of fruit based desserts and not the heavy desserts Americans have traditionally eaten, but they are no less enjoyable. There are also several recipes for ices which you'll proudly serve during those hot summer nights dining al fresco!And for the less adventurous, you could start off with the side dishes which I'm sure will help perk up your average meatloaf entrees, and some vegetable sides that maybe the kids could actually enjoy eating.As with all of Nick Stellino's books there are anecdotes with every recipe which give a bit of insight into the man and his cooking.It definitely should be part of your cookbook collection!"},{"Title":"Nick stellino's glorious italian cooking","review":"Well done Nick.

I felt the rewiew was so wrong that I wrote the following:Dave Line wrote two great books, \\"The Big Book of Brewing\\" and this book. This book was a recipe book, not a guide. It's great to see how he approached brewing each beer. I have been brewing full mash brewing since 1980. I usually brew bitter and pale ales. This book is a constant reference.Other than the discontinued use of Sodium metabisulphite for sterilization, I'm not sure how \\"Homebrewing has evolved so much since then\\"?His Big Book of Brewing was written in 1974 and the recipe book in 1978. The making great beer has not changed since then. The full mash process has been the same for hundreds of years.Both books are great reference books and should be part of any brewing library."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Brewing","review":"The main problem with this book is that Dave Line died in 1978 and never had the chance to see it adopted as one of the early texts of homebrewing in both the UK and the US, so it has never been updated since its original 1974 release. That's a shame -- the technique is solid, and the brewing information, though somewhat UK-centric, is good.That said, it's only a book for the historically-minded and the extremely patient. Much of the equipment described (polyethylene bulk-wine squares converted to fermenters, Bruheat boilers, and the like) are largely available in the UK only and are unavailable to the average US brewer, and the weights and measures are British Imperial measurements (i.e. 4.5L gallons and 20oz pints), so you'll need to pay very close attention to the conversion tables (unless, of course, [...].That said, the recipes represent what was fashionable in English pubs in the 1970s, and this was one of the first books to seriously approach the matter of full-mash brewing for the homebrewer, as well as issues like cask-conditioning.If you're the sort of person who is into antiquarian recipes, this is a pretty good book to have around. However, if you're interested in Line's less dated work, check out Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy (which you should get anyway); it has the same measurement issues, but it is far less confined to its time than this book."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Brewing","review":"Please do not listen to the critic of the book who calls it \\"A sad Anachronism\\". Although there may be some truth to the title, the content of his critique is silly! Although I do not own one, Bruheat Boilers can indeed be bought!This book is a must for every advanced homebrewer and contains a wealth of information, including things I didn't know and never read in other more modern brew books.However, the book is by no means complete, uses methods and equipment which are out-dated and much more difficult than those used today AND is certainly not for the beginner! For the beginner, the best book I have come across is the Joy of Brewing by Papazian.Granted the edition I recently bought was published in 1982, Dave Line was a true homebrew pioneer who should not be forgotten. This book should be taken from what it is and not followed to the letter (as Americans tend to do!)

However, I decided that I should give the book more of a chance, and attempted to read the next several chapters. The novel only became more painful, both stylistically and with its utter lack of coherent plot.The \\"protaganist\\" is pleased that his betrothed is killed in a horrible accident, so he is free to pursue his \\"higher purpose\\" of being an artist. He also appears to view everything by color, which is described in horrendously bland articulation by Overall.This was absolutley the worst book that I have attempted to read since 'Lucrezia Borgia: A Novel' by John Faunce.

The first is the &quot;topical kind,&quot; providing explanations of the various questions and methods of philosophy and the second is the &quot;historical kind&quot; that introduces the main western philosophers and their ideas. Mr. Adler's book, while leaning to the former, is a clever admixture of the two systems. He provides a clear, though at times, as he admits, limited, critique of post-Rennaissance philosophy (indeed, he expounds on this critique elsewhere). However, what is the most valuable element of this work is the discourse on the nature of the philosophical pursuits which Mr. Adler provides. Indeed, in this book are planted the seeds of a &quot;Structure of Philosophical Revolutions.&quot; To the ever-so-unanswerable question of what the point of philosophy itself is, Mr. Adler presents a passionate defense of his discipline in light of its criticisms from the rest of the world. Albeit Mr. Adler's view on the importance of Aristotle and the blatant errors of modern philosophers are anything but a settled matter amongst any students of philosophy, for anybody curious to get a fresh, no-nonsense and, best of all, readable insight into the nature of philosophical inquiry itself it is a work I highly recommend. To all other less-lofty readers I recommend it highly as well, though with four stars, as the reviewer disagrees with some of Mr. Adler's conclusions on the importance and correctness of Aristotle."},{"Title":"God's living dynamo: The story of Fordyce W.

Firstly, it's exceedingly boring, and secondly, I can't believe for one second that 12 years after the events he has such perfect recall of every small and insignificant remark that everyone around him made.

Her writing is clear as *white glass* in helping those of us struggling to move on after losing a loved one this way.It is close to the anniversary of my mother's death. Yes, she comitted suicide--alcohol and pill overdose. Do you know how hard that is to type? Or say out loud? The guilt, the grief, sets in and replays throughout the years as relentlessly as crashing tides washing debris upon a desolate beach. Debris that must be delt with. Either tossed and forgotten or picked up and treasured. As quoted in &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;--death ends a life, not a relationship.This is a blessing of a book. Collective stories of others, careful research into the subject, ethical debates over the stigmatism of suicide, and even the dealings with the coroner and police--makes this a complete suicide survival guide.

All of this is boiled down to \\"A boy is raised by his mother but eventally has to leave her behind and be raised by his father or else he'll be too feminine,\\" all claimed without a shred of objective evidence. Presumably this will make you a \\"man.\\"The notion that a \\"man\\" might define himself by being honest, hardworking, principled and loving his family and just generally being himself and doing his best - a notion that applies to all situations and times - is largely ignored in favor of drum-beating, pseudo-macho malarkey.The book has no instruction or reflection of any use to a real man (or a woman, for that matter) in terms of BEING a man. It is, however, a somewhat interesting artifact of the 1990s, the almost perfect example of the sort of victim-mentality-...empowerment pop psychology typical of the period. A study of this book in ten or twenty years' time will give the student an interesting insight into the sort of made-up psychoanalytical crises that bedevilled popular culture in the late 80's and 90's."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"When a Jungian begins to contemplate the _Evangelium nach Deutschland_ (Gospel according to St. Germany, as transcribed by the Brothers Grimm), he generally gets misty-headed and soft-eyed, to the point of theorizing based on free association and not seeing anyone else's traditions for the cataracts.Bly's interpretation here is pretty representative. His core narrative might be viable (I'm still analyzing it), and I like his seven archetypes of masculinity (although there are cultures in which one or more of these do not appear to exist, so I'm wondering whether they're really archetypes); but he moves too quickly. He quotes any poet who says what he wants to hear as if the poet in question were the Gospel (and he burdens the reader with his own truly awful poems as well -- now I know how many people feel when reading _The Lord of the Rings_); but he has not a word for anyone who disagrees with him, and does not offer any explanation of how he came by his theory. Nor does he even consider how his theory could be true or false; it just sits there, near enough to the truth to be postulated but not near enough to be debated. (Now I understand why physical scientists feel so much contempt for psychologists.)Fairy tales are not infallible insights into the human psyche, they're fairy tales; they convey as much historical accident as anything else, and \\"Iron John\\" has historical accidents and accretions that almost approach the level of \\"The Juniper Tree.\\" One swallow does not make a summer; one fairy tale does not make an insight into the human psyche. And the theory behind using fairy tales is that they've been anonymized and distorted over time, so that they fit archetypes more or less perfectly; anything with a known author, considered in the form in which he published it, has not been anonymized in this way, so why is Bly quoting William Blake's poems and _Star Wars_?So, I think the book is worth reading for its model, maybe, but you'll have to investigate the truth of the model yourself.(This is without mentioning his historical, mythical and theological howlers (Christian and otherwise: Cuchulain as pure berserker? Shiva as an avatar of heedlessness and impetuosity?), his bat-out-of-1968 model of history in which opposing Communism is a mark of an underdeveloped psyche, his hatred for Augusto Pinochet, and his fondness for quoting Reiner Maria Rilke. On that last offense: as a serious Catholic, I am entitled to say, \\"Ick.\\")"},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I really enjoyed his analysis of the story, and the practical applications he made. Unfortunately, this gets drowned in long winded Joseph Campbellesque tangents (very long winded and tiring at times-like the several pages on hair...ok! we get it!). I used these sections to practice my speed reading.If he would have dwelled more upon the story in question and the direct application, making brief mention of mythological links when really needed, it would have been a much more powerful book.All such soul-searching books should, in my opinion, be read with a grain of salt (hence, the title of this review). A point that may be truly inspiring for one person could be stunting for another. If you want to read it, read it passively and then take away any points that inspire you-otherwise, realize that no poet, historian, mythologist, etc., is the master of your soul."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"most of our contemporary men are getting far from the elders.they think that old men are unaware of thier problems and psycological problems.Robert Bly is a very wise elder that addresses comprehensivly what matters the youngmen of the day.I advice evry young man to read."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"The original story was not by the Brothers Grimm, but is a story for young boys that is taught them by their present and interactive Fathers, Real men, not those existing on a social crutch of alcoholism or drug dependency in the degenerative state of conciousness known as America.The sory is not an attack on women, nor meant for young boys to emulate women, but rather to know that deep inside of yourself as an individual male you have your own identity and that no matter what you do in life, you as the individual are what is important in the final analysis, as taught to me in my native Germany, by my Father."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"my brother gave me this book in the mid ninties, 10 to 12 years ago. i've just rediscovered it. this time hearing what is talked about with an open heart. i wasn't too open before.

Some criticize it for being too liberal and kowtowing to feminists. Others claim it's reactionary and a threat to women everywhere. Still others say that they hate books about mythology and so they hate this one,too (this is really weird - it would be like me giving, say, a romance novel a bad review because I don't like the genre).This leads me to the conclusion that, since the book is obviously evoking massive projection and ad hominem attacks, it really does have some incredibly important things to say. Perhaps those on the right are stirred to anger by Bly's impassioned call to restore male depth of emotions. The academic postmodernist/poststructuralist camp, amazingly (and without ever reading the book, obviously)accuses Bly of oppression simply because he states that men are human and suffer, too. This book is still a target of postmodern wrath in universities, but the criticism never focuses on the text but rather on projections surrounding Bly's persona.The book itself (don't read it if you hate poetry and mythology! )contains a skillful blend of old world folklore and Jungian psychology aimed at restoring male modes of feeling in the world. Men who can descend into their wounds are not so dependent on women for nurturance, and thus are far more eager to see a world of powerful, independent, and connected women and men."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book has been well summarized and reviewed, but here are a few hints to those considering buying it.(1) This is not a work of academic sociology. Do not come to Iron John for suggestions about social policy for your dissertation or articles. He does not regard professors as intellectuals, but rather puts them in the same category as businessmen or others trapped on soulless career tracks. Creative people are driven from academe quite early, in grad school, and Bly knows it. (2) This is a suggestive, exploratory, poetic attempt to use myth as a form of guidance for people in their real lives. That is, Bly seems more interested in throwing out powerful images and myths concerning men and men's lives and trying to make sense of them within our context of media-saturated consciousness than he is in traditional academic argument. It's an alternative to academic approaches, not in competition with them, and that is partly what makes it so wonderful: we're free to grasp at what interests us and leave what doesn't. Swimming in the questions is a beautiful thing. (3) Bly was an old 60s activist. If you can't bear the thought of someone not being conservative then don't read Bly. If, like me, you're conservative but not Republican, you'll be fine. (4) Having spent ten years in academe before running, screaming, in the opposite direction, I can tell you that Bly is no kow-towing feminist and no victimologist. Anyone who thinks Bly is too feminist needs to be stranded in a Women's Studies department for an afternoon. Then you'll come to him begging forgiveness. Bly is too careful of the feminists, I agree, but they're after him every step of the way trying to shut him up. He's despised by gender fascists, who see him as an advocate of violence against women. For them, a man is merely a potential rapist, end of discussion, and any attempt to portray them otherwise is seen as a pure wish to attack all women and bring harm to them. As for victimology, Bly is not seeing men as victims, alone, but as people who don't fit the above feminist profile everywhere and all the time. There are sick, brutal men, of course, but Bly wants to help men to see that they can be happier and more fulfilled if they dispense with both the feminist cliches and mass-media stud cliches and try to get in touch with something deeper, something with a lineage back into the furthest reaches of history, and something profoundly important to all men. He's very conservative in this way, as am I, and wants to restore some of the virtues of a strong, responsible, mature man whose strength is not a danger to women. Is that so evil? (5) Bly has mean things to say about New Age, contrary to what people seem to think would be the case. He treats New Age as what it is: floating, indecisive, maleable, pleasantries that never really provide a basis for anything. Bly wants grounding for men in myths and initiations that are robust and strong, and New Age is anything but that. (6) Read Bly with his poetic vocation in mind: poems do not make point-by-point arguments, but rather engage the mind, the senses, the feelings, and leave an impression. That's Iron John all over, and if that leaves you wanting something else, there are Men'Studies departments in the universities who will provide what you want. This is a book for the imagination as well as the mind, and that is why it is very engaging and beautiful."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"In this book, Bly attempts to use the fairy tale of 'Iron John' as a metaphor for the initiation of a boy into a responsible man. Once the initiation is complete, after a series of symbolic adventures, a responsible man emerges. In each section of the book, Bly reveals a piece of the story as a stage in the boy's development, often accompanying the tale with mythological, social, and cultural themes. This book is about men, for men. Bly feels men are in trouble, and tries to explain why. He also attempts to give a definition of what a real man is. A real man is one who has the courage and conviction to fight, but also has the compassion and tenderness to feel. Men in our society seem to be too much on one side or the other. We have too many wild, violent, brutal men with no feeling. We also have too many submissive, weak, 'Yes Dear' type of men... He tries to give reasons for this 'downfall', using important themes such as: 1) Young men without responsible, older men in their lives, 2) The industrial revolution separating father from son 3) The elimination our link to nature as a result of the Industrial Revolution, and 4) How the feminist movement, while absolutely necessary, has had an adverse effect of creating a culture which portrays men as complete idiots.I found many passages where I felt Bly was right on the money. I had several revelations and epiphanies while reading this book, things I've always known but never realized. Until now. This is great stuff. A very important book, I believe, and could be used for various purposes such as instruction or counseling. Men everywhere could benefit from reading this, in my opinion.."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Robert Bly explores the wild man, the king of the animals, the hairy man, in this expanded exploration of the Grimm's fairy tale of Iron John. Bly makes careful and thoughtful connections between the hairy underwater Iron John and the images of John the Baptist, the wild hairy man of Christiantiy.One especially helpful aspect of Bly's analysis is that it is through a wound that the male is reborn. Connecting this concept to the birth of Dionysus from the thigh of Zeus, he indicates that all men carry a wound from their boyhood and it is by the passing through this wound on to the other side that the man is initiated and becomes whole in his own masculinity and adulthood. Men are often wounded by their fathers during childhood and thus have deep buried feelings of not being good enough to meet the father's expectations or memories of acting foolishly in front of the father. Bly would say that the story of Iron John is that men must find the hidden wild man within them that guides them through the wound into adulthood. The wild man, the hairy man, Iron John, thus becomes a second father and initiates the young man into the world of adult masculinity. In Bly's conception, men must move beyond the wounded state and must explore the wound and move beyond it to be able to experience the full power of masculinity and adulthood. We have all known men who are the sons of smart, wealthy, talented men and the very brilliance, success, and abilities of the father wounds the son. The son is wounded because he will never be as honest, or as giving, or as respected, or as accomplished, or as wealthy, or as famous as their father. Being the son of a successful man is in itself a wounding process. However Bly would say that to be a boy or male adolscent is to experience the wound, all men become wounded, and those that move beyond it experience a new renewed masculine power.Bly would say that in our post-industrial society, men remain wounded into their 40's because there is no initiation that gives them the new wild father and allows them to move beyond the wound. I am not sure I agree with this. In fact, I think that the US military often is the initiator of many young men in our society, that they are attracted to the life of the warrior so that they may heal the wound inside by entering a world of wild warriors, some of whom are senior fighting men who act as the second father.Through the poetic works of Blake and Yeats, Bly connects the reader to the archetypical wild hairy man that is the internal second father and potential adult power. Bly points out the many connections to the wild man, including Hermes, Ulysses, and others.Why is Iron John under water? He is underwater as a clear symbol that he exists in the unconscious of the male mind. We must dive to reach him, we must go into the dark nourishing waters below to find this wild and frightening giant with his power that he can bestoy on any man who is wiling to move beyond childhood and adolscent shame and feelings of inadequacy and to move toward power, energy, and action. When man talks with the wild man, it is about power and strength.In exploring the myth of Iron John, the young man must be able to steal the key to Iron John's cage of underneath his mother's pillow. This task is essential and means that the boy must betray his mother to become a fully powerful masculine man. Like Hermes, the trickster, he must use his wits to steal the key and unlock the cage of Iron John. He must also have the courage to confront face to face the giant hairy powerful inner masculine force of Iron John. In primitive societies the men put on animal skins and kidnap the boys to initiate them. In our society, no such rescuing of young males by older males occurs and so boys become rude and hostile and obnoxious to their mothers in anger that the older male or males have not initiated them into the world of men. Our society has produced remote distant fathers and their sons resent it.This is a thoughtful book for men, integrating the thoughts of Jung and others, so as to present a picture of the male reclaiming his whole masculine power."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book will undoubtedly be my first favorite in the subject of masculine mysteries and understanding. There are many books on the subject, but I chose to read this one first because of its apparent popularity. The author has clearly done his homework and has written about it extensively in such a way that it would seem crystal clear to both men and women alike, without offending anyone, about the nature of men. I might add that this book would certainly appeal to men who have a gentler side to their nature, as the author himself has written this book in a style that suggests he is a gentle man. Or should I say, \\"gentleman\\"? But also, I can add that sometimes even the not-so-gentle men need an understanding mentor to learn from, and the author Robert Bly is one I would recommend. In fact, for me he would be the perfect candidate for the grandfather figure I never had in my life.This book is referenced by many web sites I have visited in search of men's groups and the masculist movement, and I can see why. This author does not attempt to lay blame on anyone but instead describe from a historical perspective what has led to today's fashionable beliefs about human nature and political correctness. It is clear, however, that such fashionable beliefs and political correctness are not always correct despite the good intentions they were designed for. Our biology as men and women really does play a significant role in our behaviors; and this author does an excellent job in describing how to bridge the differences through the understanding of differences between the sexes, and through the understanding of oneself as a man. I believe women would enjoy this book as well.And on a personal note, this author is probably the only one I have ever considered how nice it would be to meet in person. In a way, I have met him, just by reading this book. I will certainly keep this book for future reference."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Ten years ago when I was first told about Iron John, I remember buying the book, scanning a few pages only to put it on the book shelf. I just didn't get it. Nearly 2 years later I picked it up and began reading. Now I couldn't put it down. I suppose my time had come and now everything Bly described was deeply felt.I suspect some young readers-both male and female won't truly understand the gravity of what Robert Bly is saying. But as is the mark of a truly great work, the reader can go back again and again, gleaning a little more understanding with each reading.Robert Bly has a firm grasp of Jungian psychology and uses metaphor throughout the book as large brush strokes on a blank canvas. I will go as far to say this is a &quot;must read&quot; for all men over 35. A &quot;should read&quot; for anyone wanting to better understand the male psyche, the events leading to the appearance of what Bly calls the &quot;50s male&quot; and the following retreat into the &quot;soft male&quot; of the 70s and 80s.The alternitive the author describes can be then a man who has centered himself between these two polar opposites, needing not to act out old macho stereotypes nor carry the wounds of the feminine psyche. I suspect this is a man who has found his own way and a man that women can trust as well."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Truly one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read many.Robert Bly is a Poet and the founder of a Man's Movement. In Iron John he brings both elements to bear in a way that will only truly be understood by men.That's right. I said it. This book requires a man to truly understand it. Women are welcome. I suppose a man can read Cosmo and come away with something too. You may find that sexist. You may find that unfair. Tough. That's the way it is written and for whom it is written. There are some differences between Men and Woman that go beyond nature's plumbing. Society has a tendency to \\"civilize\\" men to keep them \\"safe\\" and \\"productive.\\" There's good reason to do this. What is sad is when men are effectively emasculated and no longer able to commune and rejoice in that \\"Wild Man\\" Archetype from whence we came. The hunter, protector and leader. \\"Iron John\\" to be precise.Now don't get me wrong. This is not a book to walk away from and remake yourself in the image of an unkempt slob who scratches himself in public. This is not a shallow, \\"Be a MAN!\\" kinda read.I found myself profoundly affected in reading this as a man in his mid 30's (the age I was at the time.) I did not have a particularly close relationship with my father. In fact there were very few men to whom I could be said to have had a close friendship let a lone a mentoring relationship.Along comes this book and it presents through beautiful and accessible imagery a book that is about me. I found myself relating and understanding things that I long suspected, but didn't know. Robert Bly as it were put his arm around me and showed me through his imagery and modelling, what was missing in me. My identity and celebration of myself as a man. No woman can give that to me, though I love and respect women. My father didn't give it. I am the target of this book. A man who is drifting unable to connect with something essential.It's not surprising to me that the evaluations of this book are all over the map. If you aren't a male and if you aren't attuned to and needing the message of this book, it probably feels like you are reading someone else's \\"male\\" (pun intended)This book is especially great for men in their so-called \\"mid-life\\" crisis trying to come to terms with who they really are. Any man wanting to \\"find himself\\" can benefit from the work if they are able to assimilate and personalize what is presented here.Iron John has no particularly strong religious overtones. If you want a similar book with Christian context try John Eldridge's \\"Wild at Heart.\\"I recommend Iron John strongly. I've experienced the message it brings and it is sorely needed in our society by men who have lost touch and connection with what it means to be a man."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"The actions and reactions of the men in my life has always been a source of continual amazement to me. I gained some background understanding of why these men fail to be 'manly', and why they seem to be filled with rage and sorrow when I read the book 'Iron John' several years ago. Recently I picked up the audio copy and have found that hearing the author, poet Robert Bly, read the material makes it much more meaningful. Mr. Bly stresses the male need for older men to initiate young men into adult manhood. Since this society does not provide meaningful male initiation, he offers some direction for men to ritually work through the process themselves, based on the old fairy tale of Iron John. This is a practical yet deeply resonant book, and I strongly recommend it in the tape version."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book explained more to me about my husband's behaviors than many counselors. For that matter, it explained TO MY HUSBAND more about his behaviors than many counselors. While it may not provide a solution, it definitely brought us both a greater understanding. The story of Iron John is a great analogy used to support the writer's theories."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"A lot of reviews have already been written about this book. Why add another? Well, right now, I'm reading this book for the third time in two years and that has not happened to me with any other book I've read. Even when you feel, as I did, that Bly's style of writing is at times so suggestive that you start wondering if he can fully understand and grasp the meaning of everything he is writing about himself, and even if you agree that the quoted poetry is a bit out of touch with the rest of the text, this book is a real mind-grabber.Everytime I read it, I am bewitched by its strong images, its powerful, hypnotic rhythm and the beautiful horizon that lies ahead. The book is not very long, but it takes me several weeks to get through it. But that is because as soon as I find myself reading to 'get it over with', I close the book (and my eyes) and put it aside for a while. This &quot;man's stuff&quot; is hard work and you should take your time for it. Take a bath in the book and come out completely refreshed. As I come to think of it, Bly's occasional haziness probably is what makes this book so truly hypnotizing. And if you want to break the spell and get a 'how to' sequel to this book, you can always pick up the beautiful 'King, Warrior, Magician, Lover' by Moore and Gilette. They will put your feet on the ground again - at least until the next time you pick up 'Iron John', that is.And thus, for contributing this book to a field where valid generalizations are hard to make and, consequently, &quot;facts about men&quot; that every man could agree on are rare, and for writing it even though every sentence could cause all-out war between the sexes (or between Christians, schoolteachers, the Society for the Promotion of Harmless Books and the Military, for that matter), this book -and its author- really deserve each of the five stars."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Iron John is a book about the path that many men use to become a man. After reading the book I bought a copy for my brother. This book addresses many of the issues that I have dealt with on my own journey through manhood. Bly uses story and verse to give us examples on how to work through the journey."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Iron John is about taking men back, through myth and legend, to the source of their masculinity, and finding a middle path between the greater awareness of the \\"sensitive new age guy\\" and the power and vitality of the warrior. According to Bly, the wild man has been prepared to examine where it is he hurts; because of this, he is more like a Zen priest or a shaman than a savage. The wild man is masculinity's highest expression, the savage man its lowest. Mythology beckons us to enter fully into life, with all its blood and tears; the way we achieve full realisation of ourselves is to focus on \\"one precious thing\\" (an idea, a person, a quest, a question) and the decision to follow it at any cost is the sign of maturity. When we make a clear choice, the king in us awakens and our power are finally released. If used rightly, the wild energy can become a source of delight to everyone in its refinement. How else can we explain the unconscious admiration for a glorious knight or a man in a starch white uniform and medals? This image represents the civilisation of warrior energy. Appreciation of pain and sorrow, Bly says is as vital to a man's potentiality as is having the ability to soar in the air."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book is about the sacredness of male development. The information herein is directly related to the Columbine shootings, the maryland sharpshooters and Omaha. These men, or boys, lacked a self that could only be expressed in violence. Bly says many times, violence is good. Violence is righteous when expressed in correct ways. The warrior mystique is something lacking in american soldiers who have been turned into murderers thanks to technology.I gave it four stars because segments of the book are filled with psychological mumbo jumbo. There are areas where Bly really stretches to connect the now with the mythology of the past."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I've read some of the reviews here and some are helpful, some are not.

If not then I hope you find what you're seeking somewhere else.I've come to believe not everyone's journey to Self is the same.This book helped me stop me from feeling that I was bad inherently because I was a male, as popular culture seemed to tell me. It told me that there were reasons for many of my deficiencies and that I could; by being aware of it grow into a healthy adult male.

It's a great book that takes apart an old tale and retranslates it for the reader to unlock some essential elements necessary for a young mans step into manhood.

Our society is undoubtedly on the wrong path. Bly has incredible insights into the lack of powerful father figures in families, politics, and religion, who are essential to channel little boys energies and emotions in positive ways. Particularly the assertion that the feared gang members are nothing but fatherless boys who do not understand what it means to be a man, and must prove themselves through aggression in male clans, remained vivid in my mind. Anyone who does not enjoy this book sees too much of himself in &quot;Iron John&quot;, and cannot cope with the sad truth."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Winter. I seat in the rocking chair reading this book. &quot;Didn't you read this book already &quot;? asks my wife. &quot;Yes I did&quot; I say. This is a book which contains rudimentary plot, and no understandable, for me, poetry . Yet this is one of those books that offers broad sketching while you, the reader, fill the details, invent colors and express your own creativity by freely assembling structure in which your own experiences and reflections blend with the text - as in Japanese game of &quot;Go&quot;. One become creator of new personal account. I read one paragraph at a time, and stop. Now I reminisce . I contemplate the ceiling, and create network of associations and rejuvenate emotions from the past. I spent time in rearranging those in multidimensional units. I create book of my own which overlay printed text. I like my composition. Next paragraph : this I underline and mark the page. I will use it , or rethink it in the future - perhaps. .......

He is accepted and nurtured by men. Iron John has wronged the Wild Man and grown from the experience. Iron John is accepted and loved by women. He is allowed by his mother to escape the cyclic shame of motherly upbringing. He is announced to women as an independent based in strength who honors women's role in his life. Iron John is satisfied with himself and treats both men and women with respect because he no longer experiences the fear of inadequacy. Just as the boy tranforms to man by being wounded by older men, mother protector transforms into mother supporter and releases her son to the world. Iron John offers much to both men and women. Bly uses the mythological symbol of the Wild Man to place his readers in a receptive state to his words. Symbolism plays a role in this book such that face value reading will only reveal a muddled stream of poerty and analysis. By seeing and accepting the symbols of the mythology one can understand the deeper meaning of Bly's Iron John - Man's journey is never over because once you become a man then you are obligated to help others to proceed from boy to man. Unfortunately, I got what I needed out of Iron John in the first two chapters. The book struck me as the academics response to get into print: Take a well thoughout thesis and expand it so that no one wants to read all of it. This way the seminar paper can make money as a book. Rating: 8."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Poet Robert Bly takes the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale of the wild man and his foster son and turns it into an extended metaphor for an archetypal initiation into manhood, asserting that modern men are victims of a culture that fails to connect boys with older male mentors. The book is a mix of amateur pop psychology, ecumenical syncretism of the Joseph Campbell variety, and a heavy dose of '80's-era political-correctness. Together with Sam Keen's &quot;A Fire in the Belly&quot; it was one of the bibles of the short-lived 'Men's Movement' of the early '90's.A 'new' male model emerged in the '70's; 'sensitive guys', who painfully discovered that male sensitivity is not valued in this (or indeed any) culture, by either men OR women. The traditional male, confident, dominating and aggressive, continues to be the desired ideal. Why do so many men come down with sensitivity, and what can be done about it?According to Bly, in halcyon days of yore boys were initiated into the true nature of manhood either deliberately by cultural rites or incidentally by working alongside their fathers. He blames the industrial revolution for causing a disconnection (&quot;Iron John&quot; contains a great deal of digressive social criticism and liberal finger-wagging) and asserts that modern men are now raised by women without the necessary immediacy of bonding with older males. The book is full of symbolism and poetry conveying a bleak picture of male emotional wounds.Bly touches on issues many men obviously find important, but he offers no real solutions beyond the vaguely-sketched initiation process that emerges from his discursive interpretation of the title fairy tale. All men are victims in his view, especially those who think they aren't! He is fearful of offending feminists and tries to placate their presumed disapproval by qualifying his call for wildness with obsequious proclamations of allegience to feminist theory. He expends a good deal of blame on traditional conservative targets, and new-agers are also targets for scorn. If you find victimization theory attractive this book may have something to offer, but it's a view not exactly symbolic of strength and empowerment."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Instead of writing my review of Mr. Bly's seminal work in the linear language of prose, I'd like instead to present an epigram-review, in honor of our ancestors, a Jungian epigram-review, in the Jungian vein.On Looking At Bly's &quot;Iron John&quot;: A Confession of SortsThanks to Mr. BlyI now own a small brown cardboard boxFull of little white plastic picnic forks-May 8, 2001"},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I'm not going to make this long.

Sorry, it takes more than sitting around a campfire with the guys and talking about your relationship with your father. Manhood is about growing up and taking responsibility for yourself and others and putting your family's interests above your own; no amount of silly ritual will substitute for that."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"In \\"Iron John,\\" Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness. He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point. He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories. He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying \\"This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned.\\" Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone). Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true. He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen. Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)? Naw, it's gotta be that \\"dreams\\" thing.Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA. Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work. Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger. No, there had to be a \\"real\\" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes. It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what? I could interpret the same passages to mean something else. If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however. It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise. He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea. Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.One gets the impression that \\"Iron John\\" was cynically written to fill a niche. Like all self-help books, \\"Iron John\\" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy. Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements. If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then \\"Iron John\\" is not for you."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"After having just finished Norah Vincent'sSelf-Made Man: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man, I had to revise my review of \\"Iron John.\\" Vincent quotes from \\"Iron John,\\" and the selections she made were spot-on. It's too bad, though, that Bly's entire book couldn't have been as clear and straightforward as these few paragraphs.My favorite phrase in describing the major flaws in \\"Iron John\\" is \\"breathtaking non-sequiturs.\\" Bly writes some things, then comes to conclusions seemingly out of left field. More than once he writes, \\"We all know that...\\", making me cry aloud, \\"No, I don't know that!\\" If he'd \\"shown his work\\" a little more clearly, and not just done the figuring in his head, his assertions might have been more convincing (and not so frustrating).I agree with Bly's premise that modern men tend to founder because we have no ritualistic rites of passage into manhood, but he gets way too New Agey for my taste. I don't doubt that this is an \\"important\\" work in the men's movement (indeed, it started the movement), but as hard as it was to finish without throwing it away disgustedly on more than one occasion, it's hard to fathom HOW. Nevertheless, it remains the place to start."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Well, I remember there was a lot of feminist furor when this book came out, and women feared a backlash on the part of the newly senstive men in their lives. Nothing of the sort happened. It seems like the Men's Movement screeched to a hault some time in the mid-'90s. It was valid, if flawed (like the Women's Movement), but Robert Bly and Sam Keen and all the other Zeus-energy seeking men who had lousy relationships with their fathers should have confined such navel-contemplation to their own lives rather than try to get insecure men into the action and then try to pass it off as some kind of spirituality. You can't send men on visionquests in conference rooms because it's complete bull and you can't expect men to open up about their childhoods and cry until you recondition society to accept this kind of behavior. I'm all for restructuring the patriarchal machine that is society, but you need to do this across the board and not sell this kind of thinking to yuppie men who feel their lives are lacking somehow and then conveniently fail to address men living on the margins of society. In short, Iron John is so half-baked that many men will not admit to picking it up and browsing its pages in stores and fewer will admit to owning it. Robert Bly is a lousy poet and must have thought writing a book about men and mythology would actually bring in some money."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"The poet Robert Bly published what is still the Men's Movement's central text in 1990. It's abstract and discursive, but one can discern a lot of real feeling in Bly's pleas for warm fathering and meaningful male rites of passage.Essentially, Bly uses a Grimm's fairy tale called \\"Iron John\\" and extrapolates from it sentence by sentence. The book was a bestseller, but the Men's Movement it spawned sputtered out in only a few years, resurfacing in Christian form by the mid-1990s as Promise Keepers and then fading almost entirely.Unlike second wave feminism, whose radical ambitions brought about change we're still reeling from 40 years later, the Men's Movement was hampered and compromised by a time of Anglo-American political centrism. \\"Iron John\\" was not the radical text it needed to be to launch a sustained and meaningful social movement.One would not need to read deep in between the lines of the Iron John fairy tale to see it as a man-boy romance, but Bly's beautiful observations seem blind to this subtext. First of all, wilderness is a very erotic symbol in Grimms' stories as in the wolfishly sexual \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" The kidnapping of a boy by a man is a charged event when it's reported on the six o'clock news. We expect to hear the word \\"sodomized\\" in the next sentence.But in Bly's Disneyworld universe the man-boy romance of the \\"Iron John\\" story remains utterly chaste. Even back in 1960 the literary critic Leslie Fiedler complained about the Puritan American tendency to expurgate homosex from its male love stories (such as \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" and \\"On the Road\\").Rather than a radical break from this tradition, Bly writes firmly within it. He doesn't see the wild man's outcast status as a hint at pederasty. His doesn't see the wild man's causing the boy to view his young body parts as golden as the result of admiring or even desiring glances. Even when the lovers run off to the privacy of the wilderness' dark heart, Bly suspects nothing untoward.The Wild Man lavishes his chosen boy with gifts, a commonplace generosity in Greek and samurai pederasty. In fact, many cultures all over the world have linked male rites of passage to man/boy erotic bonds. Police were raiding Michael Jackson's woodsy Neverland compound in the early 1990s as Bly was promoting \\"Iron John.\\" By the year 2001, stories of priestly pedophilia would be splashed all over the media; some of these tales involved adult mentors taking adolescent boys to wilderness locations for bonding which included sex.Through it all, Bly never mentioned the parallels to the story he analyzed in \\"Iron John.\\"Bly's \\"father hunger\\" parallels that of Christ, who imagined a Father in the sky to ease his heartache over failing to find a father here on earth. These are beautiful fantasies. As a poet myself, I love them.But a radical Men's Movement that actually takes off and matters wouldn't dodge the fact that it's up against a powerful taboo called homophobia."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book looked good, perhaps insightful, maybe even fascinating... until I got to the point where the guy started quoting Bruno Bettlehiem. While most people aren't going to be familiar with the name, Bettlehiem was an expert on folklore and mythology who tried to pass himself off as a reputable psychologist. He ruined the lives of millions of people by stating unequivocally, with nothing but a hunch and his collection of fairy-tails to back him up, that autism (a neurobiological condition present in-utero) was actually the result of bad mothering.It was then that I realized that maybe fairy tails, such as the fairy-tale of Iron John, can tell us something... but we shouldn't assume that just because something is old that it's Timeless Wisdom. This is especially true as the fairy tales and myths explored in this book are all the products of patriarchal cultures. Ultimately, although this book is \\"food for thought,\\" I wouldn't consider it a complete meal."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Bly's masturbatory rambling in Iron John is an utter waste of a reader's time. He makes some quasi-valid points about problems with male roles in society, but just when he approaches a solution, he slips into cryptic metaphor that is neither interesting nor useful. And, when glancing at the book's jacket, I wondered what qualifications a man who dresses like a Renaissance-era jester has to tell me how to be a man."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book is the victim of a stuffy psycho-babbling author, and gives no real credit to men in general and even less to woman. And it goes on about bizarre analogies that make no sense to me."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to \\"modern man.\\" The author assumes modern men are \\"broken\\" and therefore must somehow be \\"fixed,\\" and he offers his advice on how to go about being \\"A Real Man.\\" Therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men; the same men who buy Hummers and/or guns and/or beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood (real or perceived).The author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles. While this is true for some boys and men, it is by no means a universal trait. Any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is; he will also find this book insulting and absurd.Mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing; however, a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself. The danger of mentoring is that of the \\"alpha male\\" mentality taking over and running a boy's or young man's life to his detriment: when that occurs, cultist mentality takes over. (A good, and frightening, example of this is Robert Bly himself.) Taken too far, this mentality leads to horrors such as the People's Temple (Jim Jones and his mass murder-suicide), Heaven's Gate, Scientology, and a numberless other dangerous Follow-The-Leader mind-sets.For those boys and men who feel they need such advice, a far superior book is \\"Fire in the Belly\\" by Sam Keen. It does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that \\"Iron John\\" does and it is far better thought-out as well as written."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"So lads! What's going on in Boytown? (I mean that in the utmost back-slappin' hetero sense, you understand.) I've read 'Women Who Run With The Wolves', and this would seem to be the male equivalent. I love the fairy tales examined in both books and am a great devourer of Jung's work, so it's fair to say that I'm enjoying Iron John so far. Additionally, Bly's idea that men are missing fathers rings true. But this isn't anything new. Challenging your pops is all part of the course. (Until you change into him.) Bly's writing needs a bit of interpretation, given that he's a poet, and my little bro' would get through a couple of pages before going 'huh?' What's hard for me to envisage are any of the guys I know going off on an Iron John weekend, but then I live in the UK where men are a lot more uptight. Perhaps IJ trips are filled with guys who enjoyed summer camp, the odd hippy with a gong and nice guys who need to make the peace with their decent but different fathers. Tell you what, if you want male bonding, stick on an AC/DC album. They're probably as old as your dad, and you can drag him along to see them live. And give me a call when you do!"},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Thinking about this book before I bought it was much more satisfying than actually reading it. It ranks right up there with the Celestine Prophesies for muddled thinking and bogus insights. Bly makes huge generalizations and draws assumptions that just don't carry weight. He seems to have reached his conclusions from an as limited group of subjects as Freud did when he based his observations on well to do, hypersensitive women in early 20th century Vienna. In Bly's world all families are dysfunctional, all men have distant, austere fathers, all men have lost touch with their inner Wild Man. Well, the men who show up for his Men's Group seminars may share these characteristics, and presumably they are the ones this book is for, but then he should have subtitled it 'A Book about Men with Complexes.'Joseph Campbell does a much better job of interpreting myths and fairy tales. For example, Bly will take the image of the three-legged nag that the prince is given to ride to war on, and develop a whole theory of how the lame leg is a shamed leg and how all twelve year old boys carry shame around in them. Then he goes on to postulate what a harmonious number four is, bringing in the apostles, the four directions, and who knows what else as examples, in the meantime completely ignoring the fact that three is considered a pretty significant number as well. Arbitrary is the word. The writing is surprisingly (?) muddled for a poet, but the interspersed poetry is even more sloppy: a haphazard generation of images with no real rythm or melody, let alone insight. Pass this one by. Sorry for sounding so vitriolic, but I was driven to it."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Aside from the poetry, which just doesn't do it for me in this context, this book is a classic must read for anyone (male or female) interested in or struggling with manhood or masculinity in general."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I had started and stopped reading Iron John at least half a dozen times. It was recommended to me by a doctor many moons ago, but it wasn't till I started to go through a divorce that I finally put it back into my queue of books to read. I'm so glad that I did. This book is different. It isn't going to hold your hand and tell you what you need to do to become a \\"man\\", but at the same time it is. For me it was almost eerie reading some of the passages. Bly not only explains why you are the way you are, but he also gets into the age you can start seeing some of the impacts of events in your life. At least for me he was spot on. There are so many good reviews on this book already and I honestly doubt my ability to really do the book justice; so let me just say that Iron John is a book that I plan on reading again and again. It really is a different type of book, but it is also a book that will take you on a journey."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Bly recites poetry and makes references without really nailing down his points. When Bly does explain his meaning, it is gold. Someone needs to rewrite this book so that everyone can understand it.Iron John tells a vital story that preserves the western initiation rites of Becoming a Man. Developing boundaries, purpose in life and and other manly shit. Reading this book made me realize how these characteristics are neglected today. A poet would tear through this book. I struggled, but I got there, and I am glad I did. I had many realizations as I read Iron John, it helped me realize where I let people put me down in my life. It helped me realize that I may know my purpose/reason to live/passion in life by the desire to defend it. It helped me realize that if you don't feel free to be spontaneous, you are letting people trample over your boundaries and you are avoiding your purpose.Keep google handy as you read this book, you will need itIf you are attracted to this book because you would like to ascend as a man, read King Warrior Magician Lover by Robert Moore.

This book, Iron John, provides perspective into the historical roles that men have held in society and the journey that must naturally occur in life in order for a man to realize his true power. Today society has diluted strength and the masculine because it has been deemed uncivilized or uncouth. This is a detriment to my husband, father, and future sons.I bought this book for my husband after I enjoyed reading \\"Women Eho Run With The Wolves\\", and even I enjoy reading it and learning about the men in my family and the transitions that must occur organically for them to be truly happy."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

The level of depth here is astounding.This book has something to offer everyone, if they keep and open mind. Men, especially, will benefit from it and women as well.But please, keep your mind open: this is mythological poetry, let it move you and resonate with something that can't be describe by reason or words.Live it and Love it."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Love this book which has been around for quite some time. It changed my thinking about men, masculinity and many things male."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I know this is supposed to be \\"about men\\". I picked it up intended to learn more and understand better the males in my life. I wanted to have a deeper appreciation for what it is to be male, especially for my sons. I have come away with that, but also with a different outlook on myself. Robert Bly has captured the journey of adolescence through initiation and penned it beautifully."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book has inspired me to grieve and to take grieving seriously. To look at the darker side of my personality, my naivete my repressed anger and to take that seriously as well. There have been many critics of this work from the post-modern and post-structural camp when the book intitially came out. I appreciate much of post-modern theory but this controversy for me revealed the real darker side of post-modernism. That is to say Bly writes a work that inspires men from such a diverse background, black, white, hispanic, gay, straight, conservative, liberal, religious, atheist etc. that he is truly a writer who has been able to write both openly and specifically a truely pluralist writer and a complete surprize that he has been able to pull it off. For the most part the post-modern criticism of the work can be summed up as a shallow, cynical, fear of emotion and depth, and fear of men and masculinity. I give the work Five stars, however being I also appreciate post-modern critique offer a different point of view with my praise. Bly's work too has a darkside or rather may have a shadow effect on those that read it when they assume that the archetypal forms are \\"universal\\" when only the energies behind those forms are. The form itself is never. Bly attempts to discriminate \\"between the layers\\" while remaining poetic, but in this case I would have appreciated the work to be equally academic as poetic - because what is at stake is a misunderstanding of Jungian theory and Jung or Von Franz's nuances. That said my only real objection is that not more books have been written that pay equal respect to men's emotional lives while challenging Bly's position. There are sadly very few! And none to my knowledge from the post-modernists or post-structuralists perspective - which gives us a clue that perhaps we today may need to appreciate that a 'grand narrative' is not merely some plot to normalize the masses or have one conform to an ideology, but a conveinent tool to help people share their most private lives with one another, where multiple perspectives are sure to arise. If Iron John doesn't fit a person's life at the moment we have many many more myths, fairytales, stories, and poems to choose from. Deconstructive cynicism or subversion can only go so far, when we realize there are forces that animate our lives other than who we believe our \\"self\\" to be. We inevitably give these vitalities names and want to know what makes them vital. Bly gives \\"it\\" a name or names and has opened a discussion that will last generations. My only hope is Bly's work does not chrystalize into yet another dogma to soon - then another man will have to go out into the dark woods ALONE - perhaps the only way to keep a work like this alive is if WE do so, and do so seriously, earnestly and with a good sense of humor."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book isn't perfect. Occasionally, the author draws far fetched meanings, or he makes generalizations that are too broad, but, in general, the book is gold. It's not really a self help book, nor is it a psychoanalytical interpretation of the central myth which he has built the book around. Instead, it is Robert Bly passing down, in the spirit of an elder, everything that he thinks is most important to becoming a man. He wrote the book around the age of 64, and it reads that way. It's like talking to your grandfather. If you can get through the eccentricities, you end up finding a wealth of wisdom; everything that has allowed the man to reach old age and still be happy.In reading it, I found that he stretched the myth sometimes to fit his purpose. Often, there were times when I would have interpreted it differently, and if he were trying to offer the definitive interpretation of the myth, I might object. However, that's not what he's trying to do. He uses the myth as a vehicle for his own understanding. In that way, he creates a new myth, one which is updated for our modern age. On the way, he also creates a vocabulary which, for myself, has helped to organize my thoughts. In particular, I found the concepts of \\"ashes,\\" \\"copper,\\" and \\"the garden,\\" helpful.In short, I'm ready glad I found this book, and I recommend it to anyone who thinks that masculinity is inherently harmful, outdated, or completely meaningless."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Bly finds in \\"Iron John\\" the universal themes of men and their development. A mans life is usually not pretty or just. He struggles throughout and endures much suffering. It almost appears that the rough trail defines a part of manhood. It seems harder today for men to honestly find a garden that hasn't been spoiled by politically correct thinking or bias. The Universities that once fostered free thinking have had to defend themselves for their openness. I find Adult Ed. courses to be the best, under the radar, classes for cultivating in a walled garden. It's ashame public education has become so out of touch with the needs of boys and young male adolescents. Bly taps into the buried psyche of men with his discussions about descent and grief, the King and the God-Woman. This book helps men understand their wounds better as well as their fathers."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This is a very in depth book, Robert Bly goes into great detail drawing parallels between the Iron John story and mythology. I haven't finished it yet but so far it has made it quite clear why there is such a gap in the male psyche today."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This books rocks and it came fast and in great condition. It is a great book for Men, i must read."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"While I don't share all of Bly's ideas about either masculinity or reconnecting with the Wild Man within, his appropriation of the Iron John tale, or Iron Hans as it's actually called, is a creative reworking that sheds light on the male experience. It's also nice to see men trying to be aware of the damage done by the patriarchy, yet not crossing the line by apologizing for being male."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Back in the radical, heady days of the late 1970s and early 80s, we were told that it was time to redefine what it meant to be a man. Apparantly we had gotten it all wrong, and were doing things like being soldiers, hunting and fishing, grunting, scratching outselves and all sorts of other objectionable behavior. What we should really do was concentrate on being sensitive, caring, nurturing beings who could cry.Now a lot of men were anxious to to do the right thing and so they embraced this idea, and worked hard at becoming the new man. They read books, went to sensitivity sessions and spent a lot of time comparing themselves to Alan Alda. Unfortunately what they transformed themselves into was a sort of drone that had no traditional male qualities and of course no useful female qualities either. Women reacted to the new man by looking around and wondering where all the old men went. What's a guy to do?Along comes Robert Bly to point the way. See, we were busy becoming the wrong kind of new man. Now we're supposed to go off to the woods with a bunch of guys, scratch ourselves, talk about the pain of being men and how our fathers never gave us the love we craved and just have ourselves a good old cry.Of course all this takes a lot of time, and if you're like most men you probably don't have a lot of time to run off to the woods and sit in a circle sharing your pain every night. Plus if you're married your wife isn't much buying that story about going off to the woods every weekend so you can learn to be a New Man. She may not be thrilled with the exiting version but at the same time she may not be ready to swap you for the Bly-endorsed new version.So what's a man to do? Well, surprisingly, men have been figuring out how to be men pretty much on their own for the last 4 or 8 million years, and most of them do a fair good job without ever having held a talking stick or sharing any pain whatsoever. You can do what they do. Just follow your instincts, be nice to people, and look after your family. If you're still puzzled, go rent a copy of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. Watch it a few times, and if you ever find yourself wondering what to do, just ask yourself &quot;What would Gregory Peck do?&quot; You'll do just fine."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I just read this book and didn't over-analyze it but did stick with it. Without really understanding how, it moved me a million times in a million ways. But it is too fruity. And it really strongly assumes that every father is good and just being bashed. Many are. This is true for our times. But he does not even allow for the possibility that a father actually is a crappy father who competes with his son in a bad way."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"If you want to know why certain scenes are written into a movie,read Iron John. For example, remember in Platoon when the lead character was wounded in the end. Do you recall where? It was his groin. Remember in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises that the lead character had a groin injury.Iron John deals with why. Primitive cultures used to require at least one of the victorious war party make the ultimate sacrifice. These techniques where used by their cultures to reintroduce man back into civilization. Iron John deals with these motifs and more importantly why.Any struggling screenwriter would be wise to read this book.

But this - Iron John: A Book About Men - has me totally puzzled. I read it. I don't get it. I really see no connection with what is dealt with in this book and my life as a 'man'. Certainly not in any way that is useful. If I worked really hard, maybe I could see some suggestions of something that would be personally meaningful, but nothing about the book prompts me to work that hard. A friend joked that this was 'Lord of the Flies for Adult Guys,' but I think even that is more cogent than the suggestive message of the book.I will continue to read Bly's poetry, but won't waste my time on any more of this male soul searching stuff."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"In reading this book, I learned some things worth sharing.First, that I'm either woefully undereducated, or my taste in literature is too plain. It's the same feeling I get when I see a work of art or eat a gourmet meal that critics rave about, yet my stomach rejects. Perhaps I'm just too ill-refined for such lofty prose.Second, all conservatives are evil. As a conservative myself, I welcome other points of view, and no doubt Bly has considered his political leanings carefully. But it's odd how he interrupts what would otherwise be a lucid discourse with an out-of-context blurb about Reagan and other Republicans being untrustworthy. His thesis doesn't require it, so why bother (and I can't help but wonder how he would portray Clinton had he written this today)?Yet, Bly does make some important points. The industrial revolution and the information age that ensued have impacted our culture in profound ways. Gender roles and relationships have changed and evolved, and this book offers some interesting insights that are definately worth reading (if you can avoid tossing it in a dumpster long enough to find them)."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Mr. Bly, much maligned but terribly wise, outlines the pitfalls of the young man with expert insight. The most profound point that Mr. Bly makes is that the maturing process is not like puberty: it is not eventual but volitional. As emerging warriors, young men must make decisions that are painful in the short term in order to grow. The decision to recconnect with older men has made all the difference in my life. I have Mr. Bly to thank because I may never have come to it on my own."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"If you don't think this book applies to you, I'd bet dollars to pesos there's a troublesome area in your life that directly relates to it, but that you're too close, or too prideful, to recognize.Again and again, I've dismissed the more unsavory parts of this book (initiation by older men, emnity towards the dark feminine, the importance of discipline, etc.)--only to return the this seminal work and find its direct relevancy to my life.Robert Bly is not out to create a how-to book on being a man; The book is simply a kind of guide. Bly speaks plainly enough about what being a man is, and gives ample explanation as to why it is necessary if not for survival, then for living--to rival any but the most wise and hearty uncles. Today there are few who exemplify the kind of soulful, rich, loving, honest, clever, groundedness that is masculine.Bill Maher comments, and I believe, that our culture has been feminized to an unhealthy extent. If the idea of finally accepting masculinity on its own terms, and not berating yourself with society's contemptuous, feminine view of men--then this is the place to start.This book is also great for relationships. There will always exist a dynamic tension within a healthy male-female relationship, and I think this book clearly explains how these energies are equal but different. As part of a generation of closet misogynists, raised by women, I think this book is long overdue. If you wonder how your father occupies more space in a room than you, then you need this book. If you still don't understand your dad, have a son, or buy this book. The latter is certainly cheaper."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Every man should read this book. While Bly may not be loved by many modern sociological and psychological theorists, what he offers is a persepctive different than those that have failed us in the past. Through the allegory of the Grimm Bros. Iron John, he suggests a more authentic masculinity that avoids both macho grandeur and feminine escapism."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book finds its inspiration in the tale of Iron John, here using a Grimm's version in translation. The story describes a boy's coming of age, and the role that the &quot;wild man&quot; Iron John plays in facilitating this process. In examining this process, Bly meditates on various aspects of manhood, from men's relationships with their fathers to their strength as &quot;warriors&quot;. The patchy references to mythology and anthropology help provide contexts in which to situate these meditations. These references sometimes overly romanticize the &quot;traditional&quot; and past, and sometimes contain mistakes. The book also overlooks American male activities that can be construed as initiation rites, such as academic passages (a mentoring professor) and athletics (a good coach). Nonetheless, the passionate call for men to embrace their masculinity, against any cultural forces counter-acting this trend, can't be ignored. This book is also quite poetic at times, possessing a strong narrative voice that's never lacking in grace or opinion. To men coming of age, this book will have value; as the field of &quot;men's studies&quot; comes of age, this book will remain a classic."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"1. As a Chinese man that grew up in Taiwan but came of age in the States, I can testify that Robert Bly is right-on about both the Old World and the New - his book speaks to me personally, even though it is ostensibly about Western Man.2. Robert Bly is an accomplished poet, and that sets the book apart from the usual glib New-Age self-help spiels. There's no &quot;I'm OK; you're OK&quot; coddling, nor patented 12-step programs to follow. Instead, he recognizes the initiation into manhood as the slow, uncertain, and often dangerous journey that it is. At the same time, he shows us the beauty and grace that is part of it as well, with the poignant poetry he cites along the way (BTW this book is also a great &quot;stealth&quot; introduction to poetry for tone-deaf mortals like myself). However ...3. From its structure and style, it seems that Mr. Bly has consciously hewn this book to the self-help audience. The prose is pop-psych accessible rather than literary or intellectual. Many interesting facts and ideas are included only to support the development of the central story and are not allowed to take on life of their own - the book ends when the story ends. Mr. Bly did not explain the origin of his ideas, or place them in context of the developments in sociology and psychology. In many places the mesh of various material with the narrative feels arbitrary and forced, as if the transitional passages have been excised (e.g. in Chapter 3, why does he choose to characterize the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; archetype with &quot;passivity&quot;, &quot;naivete&quot;, and &quot;numbness&quot; - seemingly opposite traits?) A guide to further reading should have been included (among other things, a systematic investigation of male initiation in major world cultures).It is a pity that these days accessibility are taken to be incompatible with wit and erudition. A topic such as this will be great fodder for an accomplished essayist like Orwell.4. 9-11 seems to have vindicated his vision of firm and compassionate man, although whether things will change decisively in the direction he advocates is still to be seen.In short, this is a &quot;kick-in-the-pants&quot; kinda book - just enough to get you started. For a fuller story, look elsewhere - I suggest James Hillman, Michael Ventura, Erich Fromm (esp. _The Art of Loving_) and of course those wonderful poets in the book."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I was put off at first. The recent edition still carries the tone of the ('90) original, which feels to me like a reaction to the perceived male-bashing of that time. It's also written in a somewhat academic -- but still entertaining -- style.Those issues aside, all the meat is still there. I found it a great exploration of what today's men face, how male initiation has been neglected in Western society, and the costs of that neglect. Stick with it, and take it as a very good intro to these important topics."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Iron John is a blindingly accurate and heartfelt work. There may be some things in the book that a lot of men don't want to read or think about, and that makes it all the more valuable in my eyes. The book admits that all men, and women, are wounded and shamed in some way or another, usually as young children, and that this is the groundwork for our later lives. Further, it examines the almost non-existent role of the mentor in the post-industrial world, and the parallel emptiness and confusion created by this absence. There is something unsettling though about riding on the shoulders of a wild, hairy man, but perhaps that is something I need to explore at a different time. The book is unsettling in many aspects, so read it, then read it again."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Robert Bly is a modern day Carl Sandberg.

I really enjoyed the metaphors and mythology; \\"The lad leaned over and looked into the smooth and reflective pond water and didn't see his own reflection but that of three female wolves looking over his shoulder.\\" The lad lived at home with no father or brothers but with his mother and two sisters and had no identify of his own.Highly recommend anything on or about Robert E.

There is something every man will feel while reading this book, whether he agrees with the author or not. Robert Bly and his vision of man is only one of its kind. Other men may or may not look down on certain masculinities as unevolved nor regard some of the evolved versions that Bly points as worth a second thought. But by and large most men who read it will be bound to agree with much of what the author has to say about men.Men live in a void. Gender pyschology excludes the masculine as a pre-given abstract. Some extreme feminist writings reduce masculinity to a unilateral abstraction -- power-seeking, domination-seeking, subjugating, victimizing etc. That's not however what men understand about men.For a long time there was a need for a masculine articulation of what the masculine is. An articulation that cuts across stereotypes, prejudices, and reactive opinions to do justice to the totality that is man.This book does not exactly reach this totality but comes as near as any book I have known. By allowing men to understand themselves better, this book opens them to realizing what their true self is, way beyond the confusing mass manufactured stereotypes of both 'Man' and 'New Man'.Furthermore, it transforms men by making them aware of their wounds, of unrealistic attempts at escapism and of what can heal them."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I'd thought from the opening pages that this was going to be another trite and superficial book - after all, what would a poet, however existential, know about the holes of the soul. But soon after, the book became fascinating, even difficult to put down. There's certainly a strong strand of personal experience and prisms that color the narrative, but having said that it doesn't take anything away.Definitely a book that can safely be called lyrical. A simple yet powerful writing style makes for a book that plays with your imagination."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Great book.As I approach my 40th I was spiraling straight into a midlife crisis. This book help me understand some of the things that are going on."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"The book is a work of fiction. It describes male life in stages or steps in development or in gaining maturity based on the authors view of teaching or reflection gained in mythology. Such reflection or teaching will not be unfamiliar to any person who has some reference points to systems of shamanism or magic or a good memory of childhood, people will understand such allegories.A critique that for me that causes less satisfaction with the work is that the author uses the allegories, and mythological references very freely, and because of that people who know some aspects he refers to may know or claim that he takes things/concepts out of context, misuses them or misunderstands them. For instance this can apply to how the author refers to Christianity where he seems at total loss in understanding redemption or how something can be purely good. Or when he names Odin of the Nordic mythology as having a complete counterpart in Greek mythology or that \\"a person who discreetly farts in an elevator is not a divine being\\".Because of the work in many ways being a patchwork of ideas; poems of others, myths and concepts in a created perspective of the authors on masculinity and psychological growth it can be a serious turn of if the reader feels that the reference marks, the concepts and myths are used in a superficial way or a way that has not been assimilated by experience or is not known but in a conceptual way that may be off the mark.That is if you are reading the book hoping for \\"historical mythical\\" accuracy of sorts.The same could be stated if you would hope for what is indirectly purposed as a destined order of things for the male psyche or \\"initiatory\\" training as being a workable road map .If you are familiar in truth and not concept with some spiritual practices and or warrior practices. You will know that the training needs to start soon and starts immediately when a child is born by way of the cultural setting. By way of how parents or guardians carry themselves and instill values. How you breath in the presence of a child has a lot to do with that for instance, and that you actually do hold it a lot to develop bounding (at least in some \\"systems\\"). Parents will pray with their children in the evening, they may teach them dances or games that instill martial arts skill. Etc.So from a perspective of training or systems or \\"historical accuracy\\" of mythology the author may be far off in many ways as if being more enamored by concepts and their possible relations. Nevertheless that is also where the book is coming for, the author is crying out for the attention of adults to children and adolescent psyche and explaining to grown men that they need to address themselves if they haven't within and throughout and he sees many of the \\"wrongs of society\\" as manifestation of the lack of men's knowledge and feel for inner realities.The book although long winded is an interesting piece of work. With beautiful parts it evokes thought and points to the lack of community many people know and feel in modern materialistic shopping societies; that seem to be purposefully oblivious.It points to the need of good fatherhood, but with a seeming fear of women, gloominess and self pity almost beyond reason. It also points at initiatory rites as something very wonderful. Personally I think that to view initiatory rites as a solution the way done in the books is to totally put them on pedistal. I am sure that many who have experianced initiatory rituals as the author seems to \\"idealise\\" are not so enthralled with them. Such rituals may often serve a purpose of rutinizing men into accepting authority structures, rather than as such aiming for developing the psyche of the individual for his wellbeing (that could then benefit others as well). ( I.e. Military training for a tribe vs. a nation for instance could be with initiatory rites included, or shamanic training were many of the childeren being trained could die.). There are also numberious examples of totalitarian leaders that have had some sort of initiatory youth programs that most likely many people nowadays would not deem benefitial at all for male psyche or people in general.The book introduces a positive ending, showing a hopeful view of the possibilities of manhood. The book seems to have taken hold almost as a self help book or a manifesto in some circles. It may well be that it is suited as thought fodder, and is an interesting piece of art work showing societal needs that want to be addressed better. I would have given it a higher rating if I had felt the work was more to the point, less repetitive, less gloomy, more realistic and less prone to abusing some concepts and realities. I give a positive rating based on the interesting nature of the work, how it addresses modern audiences and brings them to reflection and perhaps even positive action."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This is a great book about modern society and men. Even through it was written nearly 20 years ago, it is still completely applicable, if not more so. Written in a textual analysis of an ancient story, the author weaves current observations about our society into a discussion of how human societies evolved over thousands of years. This is a great book if you have a young boy, or work with a Boy Scout Troop or school."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Excellent reading for men or women, about men! Some songs Jack Johnson put on his To The Sea CD, came to him after reading this book. Very interesting.Iron John: A Book About Men"},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Again, as he did in \\"The Sibling Society,\\" the poet Robert Bly has written another much needed manifesto on the meaning of adulthood, appealing for a return to the celebration of unambiguous manhood. His reasons are clear: Neither men nor women benefit from blurring the distinctions between the sexes. Healthy male-female relationships per necessity require \\"whole members\\" of the opposite sex, not truncated or psychologically confused and mangled ones.The reason for the differences is not just one of biology but also one in large part due to the way the sexes are socialized in preparation for adulthood. Neither girls nor boys become men and women simply by getting older and by growing body hair and breasts.As it should be, arriving at healthy adulthood is necessarily a different process for men than it is for women. The process should still involve the same rituals that occur in every developing country of the world: Mentorship centered around myths of what it means to become a healthy, well-adjusted and productive adult. Women cannot teach men how to be men any more than men can teach women how to be women. This is not, nor can it be, nor should it be, a uni-sexual affair.Ultimately growth to adulthood is a trek into the unknown in search of personal awareness: It can be a scary trial-and-error \\"random walk\\" to maturity as it is in the post-modern unisexual world, or it can be a guided tour through the world of many mysteries such as is the case in the world of Iron John, or a Carlos Castanada, or Siddhartha, or a Burno Bettelheim, or indeed a Joseph Campbell; or my favorite, Ernest Becker.Why are guides needed on this journey? Because the main undertaking on the route to awareness involves the fear of how to approach the duality within us: Each end of the poles of our personality is frightening to the immature. The parts of ourselves that are most distant are also most unfamiliar and most fearful to the untutored mind.Boys who are not yet men, but who possess the equipment and temperament, are not just scary creatures to everyone else, but most importantly, also to themselves. They are capable of the worse kind of inhumanness at one extreme and of the most sublime kind of gentleness at the other. There are no road maps written down on how we are to navigate these treacherous waters to get in touch with the many scary aspects of ourselves. Yet, to become adults, we must learn to navigate these waters. Indeed we must learn to \\"embrace\\" and \\"own\\" both ends of these poles.But all of life is a struggle between managing the dialects between the different poles of our existence and between the different poles of the world outside our heads. A random walk, or trial and error is not the most efficacious way to embark on this journey, and certainly not the best way to complete it.Bly, through allegory and fantasy shows us how caring societies do it, and have been doing it since time immemorial. He allows us to take the trek on a magic carpet: a ride with a guide. That way, the trip is not nearly as scary as going it alone, or worse, having society tell us \\"who we are not suppose to be,\\" but not who we are.Some things in the life of man never change, nor should they.Ten Stars."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Bly wraps his arms fiercely around his premise that because our society lacks traditional initiation rights which make youths believe they have transcended adolesence, that the line between being a man and being a child has been compromised.

Helps us understand the initiation process which many of Us don't have when we need it, and to understand why a single/divorced/widowed mother will never be a \\"Father-mother\\"."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Bly is sly. He talks about men without isolating women, without excluding the Divine Feminine from the male experience.In a day and age where the alpha male has been replaced by the only rational option, the beta male, Bly offers a third way, the nurturing Father.I really like the way Bly brings in fairy tale, mysticism, some gnosticism, and paganism, and um, even mythicism and also um the kitchen sink to describe the male ego in all of it's complexity.The most telling, for me, is the chapter on the lost King, concerning modern men's relationships to their workaholic distant Fathers, and embracing of their Mothers. The mothers encouraged men to eschew manual labor (vulgar!) for more 'spiritual' work involving intellectualism. And obviously, with the Enlightenment and the dispatch of Kings, the male ego has no really earthly Father to gaze upon as a Spiritual Guide.Bly rightly points out that in aboriginal tribes such as Indian and Australian, male initiation still takes place for boys where today in postmodern Western society, the lack of men intervening in boys' lives makes the process much more drawn out, much more protracted and even postponed. What happens in some aboriginal boys' lives at age thirteen only happens to young 'men' aged forty in Western society.Initiation, for me personally, occurred anonymously and in my late thirties, and lasted much too long. I only now am just coming to grips with the fact it happened and the resultant implications.It is uncanny the path and waypoints the initiation takes as described in Bly's book and how it was meted out in my own experience, pointing to what must be a universal phenomenon that encompasses many cultures.I recommend this book for any man who has ever failed miserably at being a 'man'.The rest already have this stuff down pat, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book had been recommended to me for years. Finally, at the suggestion of my samuri sword teacher, I picked it up and read it in long sittings. What I like first and foremost about Iron John is that it combines memoir, translation, poetry, mythology and journalism all in one book and then delivers powerful messages about men's individuation from mother and journey into manhood. It not only provides a new vision of psychology and archetyping, but does so by dissecting the old, cross-culturally familiar \\"Wild Man.\\" It helped me to better understand men's psychology and their initiation and rituals into manhood. It also provided me with thematic ideas to explore in my own fiction."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book is a must read for any man living in the world today. And for any mother who wants to know what to do with her son, most especially if she is raising him as a single mother. This strikes a real cord with me because I grew up with a single mother - and I lacked a strong male role model for most of my teenager years. And the result? A lot of confusion, a lot of self-doubt and this with a combination of other factors led directly to a nervous breakdown when I hit 25. You could say that I was never prepared to deal with the harsh reality of the adult world or you could say that I was to immature and the pace of my life was so fast I could not acclimatise quickly enough.Yes, I have a father and we have not been close for most of my of my life especially after he remarried. Now his 2nd wide has passed away 8 years ago and my half-brother is almost 21. There is a divide that is deep and sometimes painful. And since I grew up with my mother I have a much closer relationship to her and my 19 year old half-sister. How have I dealt with this in the past? With anger, with frustration for being deprived from growing up in a \\"normal\\" family unit. This led to more self-loathing then anything else so I turned outward to find my own role models, especially masculine, in the great books of history. I studied the classics from the West and the East. And I eventually reached a point where the simplest advice turned out to best for me: accept everything as it is. Thank God I never spent years of therapy trying to figure this out, which in retrospect seems like the kind of common sense my mother always claimed I didn't have when I was a teenager.Anyway Iron John is a mythical story of a boy's journey with the Wild Man and his separation from his mother and his father. The basic element that we find missing in the modern world is that of male initiation. Now living in South Africa I know all about male initiation, especially among the Xhosa people. There has been growing resistance from the government to close down these initiation schools because of the lack of medical expertise where the boys end up suffering injuries. Could it be that more and more of the ancient knowledge or know-how of how to best conduct these rituals have been lost? I think we have reached a critical point, post the feminism revolution, the decline of fatherhood, and the rise of single parent (mother) families, which causes a severe imbalance in the male/female polarity that is needed. When the Yin/Yang balance is distorted to this extent we find that weak men are all that's left.There is so many analogies from this book, which has been brought to my attention via other sources, most notably the seduction community, because is an attempt to restore the balance. How many times have you observed in a Hollywood film, a sitcom, or a cartoon the idiot man with his intelligent wife/girlfriend who point him in the right direction. How many times have you met men, who are unable to articulate themselves, who do not live with a passion or a purpose. They become like zombies living lives of quit desperation. How can the modern man meet the wild man inside him? He can push himself to do something of extraordinary courage and learn from it. Maybe climb Kilimanjaro or run the Comrades or stop denying your father, your masculine, because you need to draw from there the energy that can sustain you through your life. This book is an excellent big picture of the current problem men are facing and for specific help on how to overcome these problems I highly recommendThe Way Of The Superior Man: A Spiritual Guide to Mastering the Challenges of Woman, Work, and Sexual Desire"},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Looking through the lens of myth, poet Robert Bly concludes that the Industrial Revolution pulled families apart. He blames absent fathers who failed to initiate boys into adulthood for many of today's cultural woes, including passivity among men, unhappy marriages and the prevalence of gangs. Bly cites stories from the ancient Greeks through the Brothers Grimm to show that young men's struggle to achieve mature adulthood has remained constant throughout history. The myth of Iron John follows the development of a young prince from his early ties to his mother, to his maturation and entry into the world of his father. Mothers, says Bly, must relinquish their babies to enable their sons to grow up. Bly uses his ramble through literature to explore deep issues that play out in men's personal and work lives. His metaphoric, poetic language may be off-putting to concrete thinkers, but getAbstract recommends Bly's classic to men and women who are looking for insight into modern men's psychic drives and struggles."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"One could argue a lot about the claims in this book. Does Robert over extend some of his claims about experience, myth, history, or any other number of premises and claims? To do that, however edifying it might seem at the time, is to miss the point of the work. Men are so lost that they don't even know that they are. Out of this, the world is just as lost. While women are finding their way (and Robert is excellent in respecting this) men-as-a-whole have lost theirs. Those that think they are preserving it are characturing manhood and those who think they transcend their gender are equally diservicing the world. Iron John is about identifying what makes a man manly in a way that is authentic to what the world needs of men and what we need from ourselves. One of the most important books on gender, ever, at a time that it is possibly need more than ever."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This book performs the very valuable function of providing a critique on the obstacles posed to men's development by our modern society, which Bly feels has gradually become closed towards mythical consciousness since 1000 AD. Actually, similar problems exist for women in our lives and development, when society fails to provide us the myths and stories, and the wise women to guide us, and Jungian authors such as Clarissa Pinkola Estes and Marion WOodman have addressed women's issues this way. Robert Bly is doing the same for men, and I love his book. I consider it a travesty of narrowness that any feminists would oppose the wholeness of men and attack Bly or Iron John because Bly calls for men to integrate their dark, hairy side. Women also need to integrate our dark side! Our social rejection of these shadow qualities is forcing them underground where they will inevitably explode out. We must all, men and women both, resist those powers in the world which would deny us our own soul and our own wholeness. Mythology greatly assists in this task.One of the most important critiques Bly makes is that modern men are growing up without adequate fathering and particularly without any adequate form of initiation into manhood, and that this problem has gotten worse since the Industrial Revolution when fathers stopped working in the fields and in trades, and went away to work in factories, where their sons couldn't see them work and didn't know or sometimes believe that their fathers contributed anything valuable to the world. Thus Industrial & Technological society placed a rift between fathers and sons. It is likewise true, as the whole realm of ecopsychology also suppports, that not just men but women too suffer from the separation from earth and work with the hands.The point Bly makes about young men not being provided proper initiation into manhood is EXTREMELY important, and it's just this issue which we see at work in the phenomenon of urban gangs, where young men are basically trying to intitiate each other into manhood, only in a terribly immature and meaningless \\"Lord of the Flies\\" way, e.g such as by implying that if you commit such and such a crime, you're a man. Public schools in my view fail young men because they are archetypally more mothering than fathering, and without adequate fathering, young men act out, and no suprise, violence in our schools is a huge problem that's only increasing. Bly says that 20 to 30 percent of young men are growing up in homes without fathers. That's devastating for their development, and also for the rest of us, since young men without direction tend to be much more outwardly destructive than young women (young women, as many women, tend more often to turn their destructive tendencies inward, against themselves)To appreciate this book it will be necessary that the reader appreciates mythology and our psyche's need for it. Not all will take this perspective or even understand this view. In this area, reading a book about the importance of mythology, such as Campbell's The Power of Myth or Rollo May's The Cry for Myth, or Larsen's The Mythic Imagination, will help provide an orientation to the basic perspectives of Iron John and Jungian-Archetypal psychology."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"This is an excellent book on becoming a man. Robert Bly is one of the founders of the Modern Mens Movement. In this book, he explains step by step how to become the man we were meant to be.

It's That Important."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I am writing this 1/2 way through the book, but so far I am impressed with Bly's ability to tie the meaning behind ancient fairy tales and traditions which bound men and boys together with the social ills that result today from the lack of these ties. I found the book really struck a resounding chord for me, perhaps moreso because I was raised by my mother and grandmother in a fatherless household until the age of ten. The book helped me understand some things about myself that I had not realized and led to some productive self-reflection."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"Iron John is a good book in the sense that it is willing to say things that might not be popular. I thought that much of the book was reaching a little, but some ideas were right on the money. For example, i couldn't agree more with the parts about a boy having to steal the key to manhood from under his mother's pillow. a mother would prefer her boys stay boys forever. other parts, about having to be in touch with nature for a man to be a man in the old tradition was a little lacking. i think the author loves the outdoors therefor if you want to be a man in his eyes you have to like the outdoors as well. worth reading, but dont think it is going to change your life or anything."},{"Title":"Iron John: A Book About Men","review":"I tried to read Iron John a few years ago and found it much too heavy. However, I picked it up again last month (April 99) and I really enjoyed it. My dad is still alive at 85 and I have a son of almost 16. I had older mentors in my life, my maternal grandfather, a very old uncle and of course my Dad. I am now 47 and have mentored many people in work through the years, and I have been a sunday school teacher, a sports coach, and a youth group leader. I do believe mentoring is such an important part of 'growing up' and feel sad for those of us who have not had mentors in our lives. I can see more clearly now why some of the situations between my son and my wife happen .... I do so hope she reads Iron John. I have recommended Iron John to most of my male friends. Robert Bly makes this a very interesting read.

It wasn't any astounding revelations that were so impressive as much as the common-sense of his presentation (e.g., gangs as fatherless families). And I really liked the fact that he would state again and again, \\"Now this isn't definitive, and it doesn't ALWAYS go like this\\" while explaining the male initiatory process (it isn't, and it doesn't, as any man who's reached fifty-plus will attest). Some readers were put off by his slipping in his own poetry, but that didn't bother me. There was also some jumping around, and more than once I thought he didn't complete a discussion that he had initiated, as if losing his train of thought, but again, the generally true insights were worth the loose ends. The Iron John story is kind of goofy in itself (not one of the better Grimm myths, in my opinion -- could have done the same thing and maybe better, with Jack and the Beanstalk), but he did a more than credible job of interpreting it.

I tried to explain the book to a few people and they never understood it, but I know of at least two other people that thought the book was execllent.

She gave birth to her daughter within days of landing at a covert operations base in England, after the Aubracs had hidden for three months, waiting to escape.Tell that to the female US fighter and bomber crews, who have been flying combat missions since the nineties.Perhaps Robert's most worrying suggestion is that mothers cannot give boys the \\"hardness\\" they need while growing up without sacrificing their femininity, and the idea that a mother's influence can be undermining to a young male's development in the absence of a strong father figure. Yet mythology (Perseus, Parsifal etc.) and real life are full of male figures who became the epitome of virile masculinity, despite being brought up by a single mother or a group of women. One notable modern example being ultra-macho Rocker John Kay of Steppenwolf, who made a daring escape from Communist-held East Germany with his single mother, Elsbeth, in 1948. In his autobiography \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\", Kay is quick to honour her and women in general, precisely because they CAN simultaneously provide nurturing and strength.Robert Bly is not alone in falling into these gender bias traps. Many male (and female) authors do. For this reason, I have always worked with a female editor. However, I would still recommend the book very highly, despite this one blind spot. After all, we don't have Battered Women's Shelters because of men like Robert Bly and Alan Alda."},{"Title":"Be Dynamic (Acts 1-12): Experience the Power of God's People (The BE Series Commentary)","review":"This book has been used for our church small group.

A middle-aged, dowdy matron of the arts invites a group of intellectuals/artists (e.g., a writer, a poet, a sculptor) and assorted other hangers-on for a disastrous (at least for the matron) cruise on an inland waterway in the Deep South. Also on the cruise are the matron's highly independent, idiosyncratic niece and nephew, other friends of the matron, various crew members, and a young couple who were just passing by when the boat was leaving port. The intellectuals spend most of their time drinking heavily and engaging in hard-to-follow intellectual banter, while lusting over the two alluring, attractive, very different young women on board. When the boat breaks down because the nephew steals an important part of the engine in order to complete an invention on which he's working, the beautiful, boy-like, ultra-quirky niece and a handsome steward leave the boat without telling anyone and get lost in the swampy, mosquito-infested, steaming lowlands, trying to make their way to a town that is much farther away than they think. This was the most serious and by far the most compelling subplot in the novel to me, and it runs quite a few pages. Extremely atmospheric and very humorous, the book provided me with an enchanting reading experience, albeit most of the characters were not very admirable people and one may wonder exactly what the point of the exercise was after completing it."},{"Title":"Mosquitoes","review":"This was not a bad not a bad book. I had to say that initially. For some other authors, this book could have been their masterpiece. The problem though, is that this is a Faulkner book. Faulkner reinvented the use of the English language in all the Yoknapatawpha books. The problem is that when you compare something as compicated as a Yoknapatawpha novel to anything else, it has to fall short. The plots of other Faulkner books are so dense and full of sybolism. Mosquitoes is not dense. It has a very mundane story about people on a boat. This, like other Faulkner novels revolves around the nature of human beings and their interactions. This novel is a more dialectical one in comparison to some of he other novels of his. We do not have the dark humor here that there is in a novel such as AsI Lay.... The epilogue redeems the novel with some of the dense writingthat Faulkner is notorious for. Read this after you read several other Faulkner novels."},{"Title":"Mosquitoes","review":"Mosquitoes is not what one would expect of Faulkner, which should not diminish one's enjoyment of the story. It is humorous and satirical. Absent Faulkner's typical familial, historical, and cultural baggage, his characters in Mosquitoes still agonize, which makes them interesting. Let Faulkner surprise you. Enjoy the characters he gives us here and their comedic byplay. Absorb what he has to say about art and writing, in particular. You won't get it anywhere else. Try not to compare Mosquitoes to his other work; it is what it is, a slow boat loaded with pleasure."},{"Title":"Mosquitoes","review":"I know, Faulkner is a bit... boring to read at times, but this book is an exception! Of course, it is his very first and I think by far his best.This novel provided me both catharsis and at the same time joy for being the introvert that I am. It deals with people interacting with other people, as sometimes happens, and it does it well. Not all are alike, some aren't even themselves, but great writing like this here is, well, helps with... understanding some of the goings-on both within and without our bodies. We all have feelings and we all have confliction and we all move about in society so... one could do worse than this book if one is looking for, well, a novel dealing with those things.

Fr. Copleston's book was immensely helpful. His writing style is clear and elegant. He avoids technical philosophical jargon whenever possible and illustrates difficult concepts with everyday, real life examples. He also does a thorough job of comparing and contrasting Aquinas and his major influence, Aristotle. On occasion Copleston remarks on how Aquinas differs from Kant and other more contemporary thinkers; I wish there had been a little more of that as well, but I imagine his multi-volume History of Philosophy covers all that in detail. I think this book is a fantastic place to start for anyone interested in Aquinas and Middle Ages philosophy in general."},{"Title":"Aquinas (Pelican books)","review":"Father Copleston's book is an excellent introduction to the philosophy of St. Thomas.

In fewer than 300 pages of clear, economical prose, F.C. Copleston gives an overview of Aquinas' philosophy: his metaphysics, natural theology, ethics, and theory of the human person. Unfamiliar concepts are explained. As needed, the philosophy it put into historical and biographical context. While Aquinas is interpreted sympathetically, he is not held up as the last word on every issue. Reasonableness abounds.I would recommend \\"Aquinas\\" highly. That said, readers should know that it's a book of philosophy, not theology. Someone looking for theology or spirituality should look elsewhere. Readers should also know that \\"Aquinas\\" is a friendly exposition of Aquinas' philosophy by a Jesuit philosopher. It is not a critical evaluation. Someone hoping for a \\"neutral\\" book that really takes stock of Thomism won't find it here."},{"Title":"Aquinas (Pelican books)","review":"Father Copleston does a good job of elucidating the basics of St. Thomas' thought as well as touching on certain contemporary (e.g. 19th and 20th century) issues for Thomism. In fact, the latter moments were the real gems for me in the book. On the one hand he gives a precise, solid, explication of the major areas Aquinas' philosophy. On the other hand, you can tell he is acutely aware of the situation of Thomist philosophy in its modern context (vis a vis, for example, other philosophies and empirical science) and is quite feisty in defending the integrity and vitality of Thomism by pointing out many of the traps and pitfalls into which it might fall. There is real philosophical wisdom in his insights in this regard.Also, as far as further reading, Etienne Gilson, who is referenced in this book a number of times, is a brilliant and incredibly lucid Thomist. If you are new to the study of St. Thomas, his work (e.g. The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy) would be a great place to go from here."},{"Title":"Aquinas (Pelican books)","review":"This was not a trivial book, a real tour the force trying to sync with Aquinas thought and understand part of the Christian, more specifically Catholic, theology and dogmas.

His four reasons for the existance of God, his reflections about evil, sin and soul were the most interesting to know in my case, although he has opinion on several other issues, like politics and society. All this search for knowlegde is developed on a medieval society, and it is important to be aware of that context in order to appreciate Aquinas thought, as historical or of metaphysical relevance."},{"Title":"Aquinas (Pelican books)","review":"Father Copleston's (1907-1994)book titled AQUINAS was first published by Pelican Books in 1955 and reprinted by Penguin Books in 1991. Copleston's book titled AQUINAS is an excellent introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas' (c. 1225-1274 or 1275)ideas and works. Father Copleston demonstrated his knowledge of philosophy, theology, and Aquinas' work. Copleston handled his materials and understanding of Aquinas' work with ease.Father Copleston had an extended introduction in which he clearly explained that Aquinas' work is NOT dated. Copleston readily admitted that advances in sciences have called Scholastic philosophy/theology into question. Yet, Aquinas was aware that he \\"did not have all of the answers.\\" Aquinas was an innovater and knew the peril of exclusively relying on ancient authorities which could be undermined by later knowledge and make such reliance appear absurd. As Father noted, Aquinas wanted men to think about \\"Ultimate Reality\\" or God. Aquinas knew that physical creation was the first source of awareness and wanted such awareness to lead from creation to God.Another problem that Father Copleston effectively explained was language. The Catholic Scholastics and Aquinas in particular knew that Latin had to be applied to their scholarship. They were also aware that Latin needed neologisms to explain complex philosophy. Copleston noted that the Greek philosophical texts used coined words which had to be rendered into Latin. Yet, some of the Scholastics not only knew Latin, but they also knew the Greek language. Aquinas did not know the Greek language, but he probably understood Aristotle's (384-322 BC) better than his comtemporaires. What Medieval students understood was that the same Latin word could have different meanings. The Medieval Scholastics, including St. Thomas Aquinas, wanted to be clear and had serious concern re language and expression of concepts.One concept that Father Copleston explained was the concept of scientia or what could be called science. For the Medieval Scholastics scientia meant self evident principles rather than current understanding of the word science. As Copleston explained, the same could be said of the term physics. According to the Medieval Scholastics and Aquinas, physics again meant general principles rather than the current study of physics. Aquinas knew that physical appearances could be misleading that reason could correct such misunderstandings.Copleston then explained Aquinas' \\"mission\\" was to have men reflect from the mundane to the sacred. Aquinas knew that men had to understand physical reality, but Aquinas also know that some men were aware of something greater than the physical world or what St. Anselm (1035-1109)called the onotological arguement. Copleston stated that Aquinas thought that God should not just be taken for granted and that men should use \\"their God given ability\\" to think to better understand God and the Catholic Faith.Another concept that Copleston explained was the problem of evil. Aquinas saw sin/evil as an affornt to God as well as a contradiction of reason. Copleston explained the men have free will, and reason dictated that men's actions should lead to God. Yet, as a Catholic preist once explained to the undersigned, no one has completely explained the problem of evil. As Copleston noted, men's actions, good or evil, had subsequent consequences.The moral conflict between good vs. evil helped explain Aquinas' view of political systems. Father Copleston explained that Aquinas saw the state protecting people from evil doers. Yet, the state was also to work with the Church to help improve men and encourage men to pursue God in a rational way. In other words, the state did not just have a negative purpose. Unlike Marcilius of Padua (1275-1342), Aquinas saw the state and Catholic authorities as sharing responsibility whereas Marcilius saw the Church as subordinate to the state and to do the state's bidding.Copleston concluded this book with a section on Thomism. Copleston readily admitted that Aquinas did not want to create a system. Aquinas wanted his work to be expanded upon to more clearly understand the Church, God, and men's ultimate goal-God Himself. As Copleston implied, St. Thomas Aquinas would have made a poor Thomist.While Father Copleston was a learned scholar, his book AQUINAS is readable and concise. Copleston's book can read by \\"the uninitiated\\" as well by learned men who will learn from this well written book. A good companion book is Father Duffy's book titled QUEEN OF SCIENCES which deals with some of the conepts in Father Copleston's book.December 1, 2010James E.Egolf"},{"Title":"Death At the Door","review":"PLOT: During WWII London lawyer Arthur Crook picks a holiday spot by sticking a pin in a map, and, naturally, discovers a body in a run-down church in a remote village. When an elderly woman is accused of the murder Crook steps forward to defend her. He becomes entangled in the mystery which involves a curse on the local Earldom that seems to keep coming true. Crook is more than a match for the uppity Cleveland family, who seem more worried about bad publicity than the chance of an innocent woman -- who once acted as family nurse -- being sent to the gallows for a crime she may not have committed. The family closes ranks even as a young woman engaged to the heir to the title is targeted by the killer who thinks she may know more than she is telling.REVIEW: a typically satisfying English cosy mystery for those who enjoy a puzzle and no blood or gore. Crook is a slightly arrogant and unsympathetic main character, but the writing is well done and the story gives a bit of a peek into English country life during the war.

Unfortunately, you're not going to learn much about him from this book. Though he lived through the upheaval of the Mexican Revolution and contributed to the dynamic transformation of Mexican art, Orozco seems remarkably blas&eacute; about it all. For the most part he reports political and cultural events with the detachment of a disinterested bystander, and says little about himself in the process.Although Orozco writes with a degree of wry, cynical wit that's not without its charms, the reader finds himself wishing for a little more sincerity. When moments of enthusiasm do appear, they are few and far between. One gets some inkling of the exuberance felt by the young Mexican artists as they determined to break with European traditions and form a uniquely Mexican expression. However, after enumerating the founding objectives of the revolutionary Syndicate of Painters and Sculptors, Orozco then goes on to explain how they failed to achieve almost every one of those objectives. Later in New York, Orozco becomes enamored with Dynamic Symmetry, the mathematical analysis of proportions in classical art conceived by Jay Hambidge. Orozco devotes several pages to Dynamic Symmetry, but his description of the theory is difficult to decipher. Perhaps this may be attributed to the translation by Robert C. Stephenson, which overall is way too literal, even going so far as to let the reader know that the \\"Venus de Milo\\" in fact means \\"Venus of Milo\\". A little more syntactical license on the part of the translator would have made for a smoother read.For the most part Orozco defines himself in negative terms. That is to say, he talks a lot about what he doesn't believe in without telling us much about what he does believe in. He's against the traditional academic methods of art instruction, but when modernism comes along and elevates the status of the uneducated artist, he's against that too. He's against the imperialism of European modernism, but doesn't care much for the resurgence of indigenous pride in Mexico either. He doesn't seem to want to commit to any political movement, or even to any nation. He considers himself a citizen of the world, and feels most at home in that most worldly of cities, New York.A certain degree of egotism may be required to write a good autobiography. From this book one might surmise that Orozco had a very small ego indeed. His contemporaries Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros may have been pompous, self-aggrandizing blowhards, but perhaps that's the kind of personality required to pen an interesting and engaging memoir. There may be a good biography of Orozco out there somewhere, but he didn't write it."},{"Title":"LONE CALDER STAR","review":"bought for neighbor wish I had never started answering this page blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah bl;ah"},{"Title":"LONE CALDER STAR","review":"I haven't had the chance to read this book yet, but the condition is great.I don't know what else to say"},{"Title":"LONE CALDER STAR","review":"As always the Janet Daily series are some of the best continuing series books on the market.

The Calder family are irresistable. Throughout the years, she has written any episodes about Jessy, Tara, Laura, Cat (the indominable Calder women), and now Chase and his grandson Quint. He's actually Cat's son with Logan, but that's another story in itself. Most of the family have lived in Montana but had the means to enjoyed forays to Europe and such places. Chase Benteen Calden had been part Indian (Sioux) with the prominent cheekbones (like Bill Ross) and the lovely smooth black silky hair which Quint Echohawk has inherited.In Fort Worth, Texas, the empire, Calder Cattle Company, has expanded to owning the ranch called Cee Bar Ranch, which is where One Calder Star takes place. \\"A lonely star, a Texas sky, A Calder learns that trouble is nigh.\\" Cold and windy in Texas, while the plains of Eastern Montana (big and empty land which has once been the domain of the mighty Sioux tribe) are in the mid-sixties. In this episode, Quint is sent to clear up a problem, not with woman as the good-looking Calder men have their prime choices, but with an ill-natured, rich rancher named Max Rutledge who is bound and determined to buy up all the land around the Cee Bar boundaries.Quint's latest flame, a flirtatious waitress, Dallas Gardner, poses a different kind of problem. Marriage doesn't come first with the Calders, sometimes later if all goes well. For now Quint must keep his interest in young Dallas a secret -- not because he is ashamed of her. On the contrary, he reveled in the way she made him feel. Rutledge is a man with few scruples and would use any means, especially a pretty woman, to have something to hold over him. He was one of the conscienceless, like Joe and Karl, and Dallas (the woman) could be used as a pawn.From Chase to Quinton in this 9th account of the Calders' expanding empire out West, to Trey, the heritage continues back where it started in the lone star state of Texas. \\"A single star, A Texas brand; there's no doubt he's on Calder land.\\" Janet Dailey now lives in Branson, Missouri, the place Deana Martin also calls her new hometown."},{"Title":"LONE CALDER STAR","review":"I thought it was great!!!!!

The story takes us to Texas and the Cee Bar Ranch, home of the first Calder ancestor, Seth. Lawman Clint Echohawk, still mourning the loss of his father, travels from Montana to the ranch in Texas to manage the ranch and investigate the suspicious ongoings there. Sparks fly between Quint and Dallas, a waitress/student who eventually, along with her endearing grandfather Empty, move into the ranch as hired hands. Whether fighting the corrupt schemes of neighbouring rancher Max Rutledge, or feelings for his new love Dallas, Quint Echohawk reminds us why we love the Calder men...they're strength, pride, and tenderness. All in all, this is a very welcome addition to the Calder Saga. No Calders are killed of in this book (thank you Ms. Dailey...I was running out of kleenex) but the plot is nonetheless well-paced and keeps you hooked!

While I don't think the newer books will ever be as good as the first few in the series, I hope Ms. Dailey continues to improve. This book doesn't take place on the Triple C ranch, and I think it could easily be read as a stand-alone book for someone who never read the earlier books. Chase, Cat and Jessy are mentioned, but you don't really need to know any of the Calder history to understand this book. The story focuses on Quint Echohawk, Cat's son with Logan. As with all the Calder men, he is strong and honorable. Jessy sends him to the Cee Bar ranch, the land they own in Texas, to see what's going on there. The last ranch hand on the Cee Bar has up and left without telling anyone or giving a reason. After arriving in Texas, Quint quickly learns that the Rutledges are responsible for scaring off all the employees. They are trying to buy all the land in the area, and they're using any means necessary to do it. The first person Quint gets to know in Texas is Dallas, a waitress/store clerk/student who has some experience of her own with the Rutledges. She and her grandfather, Empty Garner, were forced to sell their ranch to the Rutledges. Quint thinks she's pretty, but he assumes she's younger than she is. He thinks she's in high school. (He later learns she's legal, and then the sparks fly.) I won't tell the story, but Empty and Dallas end up working on the ranch with Quint and they all fight the Rutledges together. Also, I don't know if this is a \\"spoiler\\" or not, but Ms. Dailey has decided NOT to kill off any major characters in this book!

I do agree with one of the reviews that some of the characters were a bit \\"unwritten\\" but I still liked it and not having read any of the other Calder novels, it was still easy to follow.The one thing I liked about it, well sometimes in novels you can just sit there and think, yeah ok, that's never going to happen. I really think that this type of situation exists and she wrote it as it may have happened anywhere. I really enjoyed the way the characters talked. No one really talks like that anymore and I miss it.

I have read all the Calder books and I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"LONE CALDER STAR","review":"Enjoy reading the book, couldn't put it down and had a great time reading the series of books about the family from one generation to the next generations."},{"Title":"The Coming of the Civil War","review":"For anyone interested in the various factors leading to the American Civil War. Not surprisingly the conflict simmered for a number of decades in different forms. Robert Goldston is a thorough, but readable author. This book is written for grades 9-12 and through college.My son read Goldston's \\"The Life and Death of Nazi Germany\\" and found it fascinating. We then looked for other books by the same author."},{"Title":"The Coming of the Civil War","review":"Upon seeing Ken Burns' Civil War documentary series, I was left with some questions as to why the situation deteriorated to war so quickly. This book answered all my questions and more with a concise history of the economic, social, and ideological differences between the regions and their underlying reasons from the revolutionary years through to the eve of war.Excellent reading for anyone who wants to know more about the causes of the American Civil War!"},{"Title":"Star Pitchers of the Major Leagues","review":"great read, clean for all ages, aimed at younger readers but good for all. in this book-tom seaver, juan marichal, dennis mclain, jim maloney, don drysdale, jim bunning, hoyt wilhelm, sam mcdowell, bob gibson"},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"Good read, especially for seasoned readers of detective/crime novels. Original characters and good prose. I especially liked the lead characters imperfections because they were not always &quot;politically correct&quot;. To be honest, the &quot;tough cracking with a heart of gold recovering alcoholic who always does right&quot; detective gets a little old. Only negative is - whats with the VCR'S??????"},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"Billy McGrath has worked for the LAPD for fifteen years as a homicide detective. He is one of the department's top guns as he understands the street, the man, and the system better than just about anyone else. Now forty, Billy is extremely unhappy in his personal life. He still loves the woman who divorced him and would die for his daughter Lucy. Billy is assigned to investigate the murder of Mae Richards, mother of the king of ghetto crack, the legendary Prince of Darkness, Ricky Lee Richards. Ricky wants the culprit to personally avenge the murder of his mother. He bribes Billy with a million dollar deal to provide him with the name and he will do the rest. Billy sees a chance to make a buck while insuring justice is done. Being an ethical cop, can he accept a deal with the devil?There have been a rash of books starring LAPD of late, but this one may be the best of the lot. MURDER BOOK is a fast-paced, morally-driven novel that takes the readers into the mind of its lead character even as it journeys through the entire caste spectrum of the city. It is this multi-racial feel that moves this complex novel a notch above the norm. Richard Rayner, who has deservedly obtained critical acclaim for his previous work (LOS ANGELES WITHOUT A MAP), has written his best book to date. Fans of police procedurals need to peruse this winner.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"I liked this book very much, although I found myself skipping over his family dramas with his ex-wife and daughter, to get to the murder investigation. He's a good anti-hero, a drunk who's too smart for his own good, living in a decrepit city. Well done."},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"I agree with some other reviewers, the main character hates himself way too much...it gets old listening to him whine so much. But the story is compelling and worth a read."},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"Murder Book is narrated by the main character Billy McGrath, a 15 year veteran of the LAPD. There's one unusual thing about Billy. Prior to joining the force, he studied philosophy at the graduate level. That background gives him an interesting introspective voice that is put to good use in relating the book's unfolding narrative.Guilt ridden and depressed over the imminent move of his ex-wife and beloved daughter out of state, Billy is beginning to exhibit behavioral changes. He no longer sleeps very much and he foolishly takes risks, some of which could be interpreted as suicidal.Called upon to investigate the murder of Mae Richards, the mother of one of LA's most notorious drug kingpins, Billy recklessly decides to use his position to pursue agendas at odds with his sworn duty to uphold the law. As a result, some very disasterous consequences develope.With a number of interrelated subplots, including one about a Hollywood celebrity suspected of having killed his wife, Murder Book succeeds in grabbing onto and holding reader interest. Moreover, there are plenty of surprise plot twists and well crafted action sequences that add to the novel's substantial appeal.This is an intelligently written crime novel which dares to feature a protagonist who, though very articulate and insightful, is a seriously flawed human being. A solid 4 stars."},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"I hope Rayner is able to sell this as a movie because it would be even better with a third cut out of it. I thought it was a good story but I doubt there is anyone on the LAPD--or any police force--who is as articulate and introspective as the detective in this story."},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"I must say that this had to probably beone of my favorite murder mysteries that I've ever read. It's about a detective who's wife found out that he slept with another woman. She's going to leave him, but it's difficult for him to let that happen because his daughter from this marriage who he loves so much has to go with her mother. Although he's been recently assigned to a new murder case. But not just any murder case; The dead mother of the biggest druglord in Los Angeles. The detective wants his daughter and his ex-wife to be happy and have plenty of security, and while the detective is questioning the druglord in the precinct house, the druglord offers $500,000 for the name of killer. The detective does some searching and comes up with a name. Desperate to get the $500,000 to give to his ex-wife and daughter, he goes on a hunt for the killer. Can the detective convince the druglord that he knows who the killer is, so that the druglord will give the detective the $500,000? And can the detective really find this ruthless killer, before he himself gets killed?One of the things that I liked most about this book was that there were not really any GOOD characters. They've all done something bad some time or another. It's about time a story didn't have a perfect character who saves the day all of the time.If anyone wants a riveting murder mystery that actually makes some sense, and is surprisingly complex, then I'd say that &quot;Murder Book&quot; would be the best choice."},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"For any lovers of noir, Chandler and tales of decayed cities and souls this is a must read. I have only one question which I hope someone will be able to answer: why did Mae have all those VCR's???"},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"No reader can reasonably complain about the prose and the plot. BUT, I hated the lead character! The other characters are realistic, except for the lead's wife - she is too good to be true. But the quality of the prose and the plot merit the rating."},{"Title":"Murder Book","review":"Philosophy is concerned with finding knowledge. And perhaps vocation needs philosophers like criminology; after all what makes a particular act bad or good. So it is ironic that so few philosophers are cops.Billy McGrath is one of the few. Following years of study in England, he became an LA cop. A black woman has been found murdered in her house; a common crime with an uncommon victim. She is the murder of LA preeminent drug lord Ricky Lee.Ricky offers Billy a million dollars for some information: the perpetrator's name.Struggling to hold onto his conscience, and his deploring personal relationships, Billy must deliver the goods or face the anger of a man intent on executing 'justice'.Murder Book is a generic thriller, inconspicous from the army of less than noteworthy novels. The plot, though nice, barely excites; even the philosopher side of the hero is not utilized: there was no pondering the merits of his despicable actions with Ricky Lee, no guilt over the blood money. What did he really study in England?As lackluster writing, this book is as memorable as drinking bottled water."},{"Title":"Early American Embroidery Designs: An 1815 Manuscript Album with Over 190 Patterns (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"The album containing drawn designs by Elizabeth M. Townshend in 1815 provides a wonderful moment captured in time. The drawings allow the viewer to observe authentic designs drafted by a women during the early nineteenth century. Since there is no background information about the artist, the publisher offers possibilities concerning the uses of the patterns in the book, which helps establish documentation for those readers searching for such. What makes the images so great is knowing they are authentic and unaltered. Many of the designs appear to be for borders on bed linens, petticoats, and waistcoats. The designs are easy to reproduce and appear to be to scale. For those who re-enact the Revolutionary War and look for documentation, you will find what you need in this book."},{"Title":"Early American Embroidery Designs: An 1815 Manuscript Album with Over 190 Patterns (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"This book has a wide variety of borders suitable for linens and hand towels and for use in hand embroidery. There are a good variety of sizes, shapes, motifs, and density to satisfy many needs. Inking in book dense enough to copy on light weight fabrics, but will require retracing for linen weight fabrics. I would highly recommend this book for the hand embroiderer interested in early American and Victorian embroidery."},{"Title":"Early American Embroidery Designs: An 1815 Manuscript Album with Over 190 Patterns (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"All of the designs are either borders or small in size but could work fine if enlarged slightly for crewel embroidery. Not very good for goldwork though."},{"Title":"Early American Embroidery Designs: An 1815 Manuscript Album with Over 190 Patterns (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"I got this book for ideas for machine embroidery. It is an excellent book with designs I can easily translate into a machine embroidery patterns for digitizing. It is a good book with the old fashioned inspiration I needed. Note this book would be great for hand stitches also."},{"Title":"Early American Embroidery Designs: An 1815 Manuscript Album with Over 190 Patterns (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"Came quickly.

Since I've pretty much cycled around this planet I reckon that this is a qualified recommendation. Her text is sprinkled with some evocative poetic descriptions. One that has stuck in my mind was about watching clouds recede down a valley (somewhere in Iceland/Scandinavia) like a ghost shimmering down a hallway. There are lots of these sort of things, this makes the book Very Good. However what made this book Excellent was the thrilling drama in the last few chapters. Not only is the book well written but it is full of interesting stories.My only complaint is that she did not mention meeting a know-all pedestrian on the Post Office steps in Prague, where I seem to remember offering the little mite some advice!Summary: A damn good read between cycle trips."},{"Title":"The Wind in My Wheels: Travel Tales from the Saddle","review":"I hope Josie keeps pedaling and keeps writing. Her narratives were fun and interesting. The author has strong opinions and a lively sense of humor. It makes you want to jump on your bike and go! The miles this woman has put on her bike are amazing. There is enough material in this book to have written two or three books, at least."},{"Title":"The Wind in My Wheels: Travel Tales from the Saddle","review":"I chanced upon this book , many years ago while wondering whether it was safe to embark on a 60km ride outside the city. Josie's lively description of her adventures, in the saddle, in many countries,proved the turning point and I ventured out with a friend.That 60km ride has unfortunately, not been following by many more. However, the book still enchants. I read it every once in a while, to loose myself in the freedom of 'the wind in my wheels'.Recommended highly - if you like cycling, or travel or just have a sense of humour :)"},{"Title":"The Wind in My Wheels: Travel Tales from the Saddle","review":"This book is a collection of travel tales from a young brit bike traveller who has logged an impressive bunch of kilometers on this planet, will maintaining a business as a bike caterer in the off season.In this book she covers her trails in [no particular order] Bulgaria, Morocco, Nepal, Africa, France, Spain, England, Ireland, Romania, India, Iceland, Italy, Gibraltar, Russia [briefly], Belgium, The Netherlands, Scotland, Newfoundland & Nova Scotia, among others I'm sure I forgot. It's dizzying actually, and hard to recall at points which country she is in.So in terms of coverage this is the most complete globetrotting bike travel book I've read, having covered all this land, she goes a little soft in points on the details of certain places for example Newfoundland was not even mentioned in her text other than a picture of Dildo--I guess she skimped on details there.Having looked at but not yet read her other books, they seem to have more focus and less land travelled so I'm sure they'd be better on those details, leaving this as not much of a criticism.It is a fun and light read, Dew is obviously a biker by choice and rather than taking time to search into herself outin the world on a bike, she travels partially for a job and the sake of riding in these places. So if you're looking for a fun read about riding through places, not some grander perspective, this is your deal.In her own words \\"I think it is called 'introspection'. I prefer to reamin 'lost within' and throw any self analysis to the wind\\"In this regard she shows her age and interests, when most of these books are the opposite this caters to a niche. She is funny at times and not at all averse to honest discussion of travel with all it's frozen fingers and poop stains. This is a book about bike touring for the sake of bike touring, and in that it is wonderful and fun.From what I've seen in this book, this is a good series complete with little school scribbler type drawings, and funny maps. [better than the snotty Anne Mustoe]."},{"Title":"The Wind in My Wheels: Travel Tales from the Saddle","review":"If you enjoy reading about travel adventures, Josie Dew will tell you fascinating tales of Europe, Asia, and Africa--on a bicycle! It was fascinating to learn about the people and countries she visited, where she stayed (often by herself in remote places), and what it's like to travel on a bike. Josie shows how her simple way of traveling can bring immense joy. She is a young person full of fun and curiosity. Can't wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"Complete Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning","review":"The works of Ms Browning are beautiful, but don't get this edition. The print type looks like it was reproduced on a bad photocopy machine. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Basic Concepts of Criminal Law","review":"People find Fletcher's general views of criminal law controversial at times because ideas of criminal justice vary from region to region or person to person. However, in &quot;Basic Concepts of Criminal Law,&quot; Professor Fletcher captures the very essence of criminal law by delineating twelve basic concepts of criminal law that serve as a common backdrop for various and diverse understandings of criminal law.As Fletcher analyzes the &quot;deep structure&quot; of criminal law, he not only presents his own expert opinions but also provides readers with a framework of law through which they can contemplate the issues of criminal law. Legal scholars, academic students, and the curious public will find Fletcher's &quot;Basic Concepts of Criminal Law&quot; to be dynamically entertaining and stimulating."},{"Title":"Basic Concepts of Criminal Law","review":"I read it, it made somewhat sense but the problem was that it did not have any cases.

I immediately purchased this book a few days after reading DON'T GO TO THE COSMETICS COUNTER WITHOUT ME, 2003 edition. I wanted to get information on how to deal with my oily, acne proned skin. I've been to several dermatologists who told me I had cystic acne (the worst case) and basically told me I had to use Accutane. Well, being the fact that I am in my childbearing years...the risks overpowered the benefits of using such a powerful drug. Then I used an expensive skin care regime (the only one you see on t.v. informercials 2-3x's per day) which improved my skin about 70-80% , but put a dent in my wallet. I knew there had to be a better and cost effective way to treat my skin condition. Needless to say, I used the information that was suggested in the book and you would never be able to tell that I even had skin problems.I will admit that the makeup tips are rather conservative. However, for women working in a professional & business casual environment there are some helpful tips. You can always make modifications to suit your own personal style.When purchasing this book (which you should definitely have in your library) understand that Ms. Begoun is first a Consumer Advocate. So there is alot of information about what the Industry does not want to you know about type stuff. However, all the information crammed in this book beats a yearly subscription to some advertisement filled fashion magazine.I recommend you buy this book along with DONT GO TO THE COSMETICS COUNTER WITHOUT ME, 2003 edition for a holistic view of Ms. Begoun's suggestions."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"This is the most negative Beauty Guide I've ever read. It attempts to debunk nearly every single product in existence and cast plastic surgery as a gleaming beacon of hope. The writer tries to apologize for her plastic surgery loyalty early in, but her style is boring and self-centered, so it's hard to forgive her. This book doesn't get remotely helpful until about 150 pages in. It stops being helpful again at 250 pages. There is very little instruction, and only one section with any pictures to cite examples. It's like the author wrote a beauty guide that applies directly to her and only her. If you want to have a plastic surgery procedure sold to you, read this book. If you want to get excited and informed about beauty, read something else."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"Information that I already knew but I am a glamour girl. If you are new to skin care and make-up then this might be a good book for you. Too elementary for me."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I got this book coz all the raves my friends have and find it's an ok book. It's very informative but if you're a beauty book addict like me, you may find this book doesn't have \\"really in-depth\\" infomation as you expect. Just like its name, it's a bible so it sum up all the information available at the time and put them together here. For me, it's like a textbook (plus that the layout inside is kind of boring for a book about beauty since it's all text). I am sure that this book will be helpful for beginner or anyone who looking for the overall information on how to take care of yourself."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"There are countless conflicting \\"facts\\" in this book which, had the author done more rigorous research, would be less offensive. The author demonstrates her lack of knowledge on the topics of several health issues but nevertheless presents all of her information as true and credible. For instance on the topic of mineral oil and antioxidants -\\" ...they can keep air off the skin to some extent, but that's what a good antioxidant is supposed to do...\\" and later \\"the word antioxidant means anti-oxygen\\" these two references from pages 79 and 80 illuminate just how little the author knows about a) the processes involved in aging within the body and the skin, and b) the actual derivation of antioxidant. I realize that we don't have the time to check up on the volume of material presented, which makes it an irritating job to go through and point out the inconsistencies and inaccuracies, but consider as you read that all of this needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The author's credentials are questionable, and her work is far from scholarly. She's a businesswoman, not a scientist."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"Her book goes through a lot of trouble to rate various beauty items but I've found this \\"ultimate guide\\" to be hit and miss. At times, I'll buy a product that she rated highly and completely disliked the item and at other times I'll buy products that I love but were rated poorly. Whether you choose to spend the money on this book and the time looking up and reading about each product is up to you but I say you'd be better off taking recommendations from a friend, co-worker, etc. who has had good experiences with a product.Also, I highly recommend that you do NOT purchase from Paula's line of cosmetics and skin care products. I bought a moisturizer from Paula's Choice, thinking that her products must be good since she has critiqued all of these other products and knows what's good and what's bad. However, I broke out into a huge rash all over my face and neck. It took me 2 trips to the doctor's office, lots of potent cream, and months before the redness went away. I would hate for anyone else to have to go through that."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"This book is a horrifying display of techno-chauvinism. Begoun insists that a regimen of chemically engineered and modified acid, petrolatum and mineral oil is the only way to keep skin clean and healthy, she even asserts that petroleum is natural and thereby no different then say olive oil or shea butter (Anyone else disturbed?) As the book progesses the advice becomes more and more caustic.While I wanted to keep this book to show my friends what \\"bad advice\\" truly is, I had to return it. In addition to being cheaply printed and unevenly cut, the book was missing pages 231-269, (the portion dealing with blemishes, which I can only imagine.)Don't waste your money or precious time; The Beauty Bible is a sure way to cosmetic damnation."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"Full of deceptions, outdated research, illogical assertions and heavily opinionated, this book should be kept away from young, impressive minds. The author, obviously with strong industry connections, suggests dish detergent for bubble baths, doubts healh dangers of phthalates, recommends sodium laureth sulfate cleansers, and insists that mineral oil makes the best moisturiser. No wonder Ms. Begoun has such a profound interest in cosmetic surgery! It will take a really deep laser resurfacing to erase the damage done to one's skin by using Ms. Begoun's \\"advice\\".Overall - zero stars. This book doesn't deserve a \\"bible\\" in title, too."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"This book is all fluff and gives very little actual information of products to use or buy.

However, the most helpful sections of this book--eg, instructions for blemish/acne treatment, inside information about product ingredients, etc.--are covered more succinctly and clearly in Begoun's other work, which also includes a ton of useful information on specific skin care and makeup products. I recommend that you first purchase Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me, and if you then require additional information, consider buying this book."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I think this is a very informative book. Paula explains why fashion magazines will never give an honest critique of beauty products - they can't say anything negative and risk angering the cosmetics companies who advertise in their pages - so you will rarely see anything there but glowing reviews. She explains how most moisturizers are the same, and how any claims that they can lift, firm, or tone the skin are a bunch of BS. She explains why so-called &quot;botanicals&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; products have no special benefits for the skin and are only used as a marketing strategy to make products seem more interesting or glamorous. (By the time the &quot;natural&quot; elements are extracted and bottled, there is hardly anything &quot;natural&quot; left in them. Plus they are only added in teeny-tiny amounts, just enough so that the company can say that the product contains natural ingredients.) She explains how toners/astringents and most products that supposedly help acne contain extremely irritating ingredients that can make your pimples worse. She also explains why the terms &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; and &quot;dermatologist tested&quot; are meaningless hype, and how the cosmetic companies can get away with misleading advertizing because cosmetics are not regulated by the FDA.Paula also includes a lot of information on skincare and makeup application. I didn't always agree with her opinions about application, but it's still refreshing to see someone willing to speak out against the downright dishonest claims made by cosmetics companies, and to educate us consumers. Every woman who uses cosmetics or skincare products should read this book, as well as _Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me_. These two books will pay for themselves when they save you time and money. You'll learn to be a smart consumer and see right through the marketing hype and ridiculous claims that the cosmetics companies would have you believe."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"Does this scenario sound familiar to you? You pick up a copy of you favorite magazine, and when you flip through the pages, you find an article on skin care. In it, you are told that if you have oily skin (and just for the sake of this arguement, let's say you do ), you still need to use a moisturizer, because oil is not a moisturizer, really, and you need to protect your skin. They tell you that you need one that is light and oil free, and usually name one or two that they recommend. So, even though you have never used one, you figure that hey, they are the experts so they should know. You go right out to buy one, start to use it, and notice that your skin seems even oiler than before. Before long, you start to break out. The next month, when you once again pick up this magazine, there is another article on skin care by someone else, only this time, they tell you NOT to use a moisturizer if you have oily skin, because oil is the skin's own natural moisturizer, and if you use one, it can cause problems, like breakouts. Now you are mad, confused, and at a total loss. Just what is going on here?As far-fetched as it sounds, this happens all the time. And until I found this great lady, Paula Begoun, I didn't know what to believe. If you are fed up with conflicting advice, then read this book,and be confused no longer.Paula is not a quack who decided one day to write a book. She has been at this for a long time. She does very thorough research, interviewing cosmetic chemists ( the people who formulate cosmetics ), dermatologists, she reads cosmetic industry journals and papers, medical journals and papers, etc., etc. She really is the Ralph Nader of cosmetics. She cuts through the crap that the magazines and cosmetics companies and their salespeople try to tell you. She gives practical, down to earth advice on skin care for all skin types, and she adds new information or corrects old information found to be outdated in each new addition of her books. She keeps up with everything going on in the industry, and lets you in on the latest news.Most importantly, she will tell you what the cosmetic companies wish she wouldn't: the simple truth.If you're tired of being lied to, tired of being confused, read this book. You'll be doing yourself, your pocketbook, and your skin a big favor!"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I just love Paula Begoun. The strides she's made possible for women everywhere is beyond belief. I loved her first edition of this book, and now this one brings so much more.One of the newest strides Paula's brought out in this book is new research on chemical exfoliants to help people with oily skin and those with wrinkles. She reminds us that THERE IS NO WRINKLE CREAM that can erase a single wrinkle. Yet here we are with options to improve the skin we have through AHAs and BHAs, AND she reminds us of how to prevent wrinkles in the future. Sunscreen! Worn daily, under makeup. One simple step to prevent those wrinkles that make us cringe when we look in the mirror.But that's not all. She talks about her newsletter, where people can get the latest info before her next book edition comes out. She talks about advertising hocus-pocus and why there just IS NO WRINKLE CREAM. Sure, they've created creams with the claim of getting rid of wrinkles, but they don't work. So what does that mean? Women everywhere can save their money and forgo such creams!Paula gives us the hope that a wrinkle cream might come out in the future -- anything's possible -- but until she tells us, don't spend money on that.She talks about ingredients in products and what they do and don't do. She describes how smoking affects one's skin and makes a person age prematurely. She describes skin care for every skin type.But she's not done! She talks about cosmetic surgery, the types that are out there and the prices. She even describes personal experiences with different types.She gives a detailed description of how makeup should be applied and why shiny eyeshadows and BLUE should be avoided. Pictures are included of makeup application on a woman. She goes on to describe nail care.Nope, she's still not done. THEN she tells all about men's skin care and suggestions women can give the men in their lives. She talks about baby skin care, and how teens can ease into makeup application without looking like they walk the streets, but more than just \\"a little pink blush and lip gloss.\\" Then she has a problem-solution section.Paula even has a wonderful section on how a woman can feel beautiful while undergoing cancer treatment. Written in very tender terms.She uses humor and kicks the advertising and magazine hype in the...well, you know where!READ this book if you are at all interested in your appearance, as you must be if you got this far in my review. Kudos to you, Ms. Begoun!"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"A must-have for every beauty enthusiast who spends thousands of dollars just to look for the next miracle cream because the last one didn't do what it was claimed to.Written clearly and with a sense of humour The Beauty Bible is literally a bible, explaining with details all the 'You Shalt' and 'You Shalt Not' in cosmetics, including all the hype ingredients, what to do to really have a better skin (it works, I bought her products) and how to prevent future damage.

However, her one-size-fits-all approach to cosmetic colors and textures left me cold. Don't wear anything blue or green. Neutral matte eye colors, colorful cheeks and lips (creamy, not glossy). No color correcting powder (tell that to women with rosacea). No sparkles or luminescence. Pah-leeeeze. Cosmetics, like clothes, are an expression of personality and style.

This book was also very helpful in finding a BHA product. The one I had had was the wrong PH (no wonder it didn't work). I also know ingredients to avoid in anything else I put on my face, and I'm using a sunscreen that blocks UVA and UVB both. I don't wear makeup, so I just skipped that part. I did read some of the parts on cosmetic surgery with a ghoulish fascination. I do have a scar I might want to do something about, though . . .My older daughter is ten, so I will be giving her the chapter on break-outs soon, and then perhaps she can handle them much better than I did. I put alcohol on my skin when I was a teenager. Ouch! This section is wonderful in keeping you from making matters worse by irritating the skin or drying it out too much. It also covers all the options, even the ones you hope you'll never have to consider, like Accutane."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I'm studying beauty therapy, so books like these are of great interest to me. The thing I like about this book is that its unbiased. Sure there are things that are hard to believe, and things that you think ... sure that makes sense ... but ingeneral, Paula tries to be as objective as she can and substantiates everything that she has written in the book. I may not agree with everything she says, but I can respect what she says and the position she takes and I have learnt more than a few things from the book."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"Reading this book and her other book, Don't go to the cosmetics counter without me, has completely changed how I care for my skin. The author's advice is very practical, realistic, and sane. My skin is clearer, looks much nicer, and feels comfortable for the first time since I was under the age of 10. I remember having dermatologists (yes, actual medical doctors) prescibe harsh bar soaps for cleansing, irritating creams and lotions, and not making any mention of sun protection. It's no wonder I couldn't get my face to clear up! I've probably used every product marketed towards combination skin or acne-prone skin, and none of it has helped. By reading this book, I now understand what I was doing wrong and have put together a skin care routine that actually works. It's just amazing.Some reviewers have tried to portray this book as a pro-plastic surgery, pro-chemical products, anti-nature, ill-informed rant, but that really couldn't be further from the truth. Paula Begoun is a consumer advocate and is trying to stop people from swallowing all the marketing nonsense that the cosmetics industry feeds us. She's also trying to help people have realistic expectations for what skin care products can do for you. No cream, toner, or serum can remove wrinkles, so she explains that if you really want to remove wrinkles, plastic surgery may be your only option. It's better to know that than to keep wasting tons and tons of money on supposed \\"miracle\\" products. She also is trying to debunk another myth the cosmetics industry feeds us, that \\"natural\\" equals \\"good\\". Look at products like Origins, Aveda, etc. that claim to be \\"natural\\" solutions -- they contain miniscule amounts of \\"natural\\" extracts and all the same chemicals that all other products have. She's not advocating dousing yourself in chemicals -- she's advocating not buying into the lies these companies use to sell you products.At any rate, I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever had trouble with their skin and has tried everything under the sun to improve it. Granted, not every recommendation she makes will work for you, but the bottom line is that with her advice, you can make much, much smarter choices for yourself."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I am a beauty junky, myself. I own almost every beauty book ever published. I use this one a lot. It delivers exactly what it promises. It's more for shopping purposes than for learning about beauty secrets, makeup techniques, hairstyles, etc.If you're a beauty junky, I do think you'd like BeautyRiot.com. It's free and has answers to just about any beauty question you can think of. Plus they tell you how to copy celebrity hair and makeup and they have a ton of pictures."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"It's funny how her books seem to have so many good reveiws that sound just like a late night infomercial... and yet the ones that sound like real people rather than sales pitches seem to all agree that her books are full of it.This woman has NO credentials, uses outdated or just plain wrong facts, cites only studies that support her own personal beliefes (ignoring all others), is not overseen by a dermatologist, seems determined to trash anything not from a drug store, is written only from her opinions based on her own preferences and skin-type, as well as a host of other problems. She preys on consumers fears of being ripped off, then hawks her own line of sub-par products.An example from another sales pitch, er, \\"review\\"... oily skin absolutly DOES need moisterizer, the reason skin becomes oily is because it overcompensates for dryness. The solution is to eliminate the trigger (dry skin) by using gentle products, keeping the pores open, and the skin moisturized. Talk to any dermatologist and you will learn this.I'm very afraid of the amount of women ready to believe this tripe Paula spoon-feeds them without doing one bit of personal research.Do your own research, trust what the magazines say (do you really think they stay in business by pretending bad products are good? please) because they DO routeinly bash bad products and consult dermatologists before making claims about products, smear on all the shiney blue make-up you want, talk to your dermatologist, sell the book and use the money to buy a nice, new highquality, beautifully colored department store lipstick. You'll be much happier."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"When I first saw this book, along with its companion 'Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me', I was very excited! I thought that I'd finally found a 'Consumer Reports'-type book on makeup. 'Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me' is very much like that priceless magazine, but you sometimes get the feeling Begoun is determined to dislike any high-end name brand simply on principle.Although the information contained in Begoun's 'Bible' is thorough and certainly well-researched, some of her suggestions (especially for skincare) are just plain wrong. Bear in mind that although Begoun does every cosmetics-buying woman a justice with this book, she is NOT a dermatologist.I found the book very informative and very helpful, but as with every other product purchase you will ever make in your life, you must decide what works best for you, never mind someone else's &quot;bible&quot;."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"This book is exactly that, BEAUTY BIBLE.

I had the previous edition of this book too, and the updated information was very helpful. The beauty application techniques are pretty classic and useful. However, I strongly disagree with some of Paula's opinions such as &quot;shimmery eyeshadows&quot; and not using certain colors. This may be just fine for some women, such as middle-aged executives and such, but makeup should be FUN and express your individually. It doesn't always have to look &quot;natural&quot; or intend to be. Though an attractive woman, not everyone wants to look like Paul Begoun! I'm in my early 40s, a long-time cosmetics addict, somewhat amateur makeup artist -- and I wear all sorts of colors and textures and, Paula forbid, even glitter sometimes! I'd take Paula's advice with a grain of salt -- apply what works for you and ditch the rest."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I find it interesting that there are many women (possibly some men) that consider Paula's work to be bogus, harmful, and riddled with lies. Here's one quote from a reviewer \\"Her products REAK of chemicals\\" First, Cosmetics *are* chemicals. Secondly, her products are free of any fragrance (masking or otherwise). Without fragrance, the scent of the chemical compounds in the products come through. I've had whiffs of her products, and (personally) they don't bother me, I'm not always expecting my products to smell amazing. But her products don't smell any worse than some of the products that are pushed by drug store brands (SpectroJel and certain Marcelle toners come to mind).Gentle cleanser? It's going to smell a bit like alcohol (Not grain (rubbing) alcohol, but Cetyl or Stearyl alcohol -aka fatty alcohol, emollients that soften the skin). A toner? It's got a distinct flat smell (Water-binding agents, emulsifiers and light oils produce it). I can assure you that if Chanel, Lancome, or La Prarie put a moisturizer or cleanser out on the market sans fragrance, you'd be smelling something a lot more repulsive. I don't use Paula's products religiously (I have no brand loyalty whatsoever), but I can tell you her products are quite decent. However, I will still say that her website is a bit of a letdown. While it provides information, you have to know where to look for it, and it's mainly laid out as a sales site than a consumer advocate site.A few other reviewers have commented on her credentials. And, while she doesn't have official credentials, she certainly knows far more than any of the reviewers do (myself included).In the end, it's up to you when it comes to what goes on your face. This is not some evangelical movement, nothing is being pushed on anyone (on the flip side, I have to say that I've received more pressure to succumb to someone else's idea of proper skin-care at the department store). She's merely giving us tools to better our knowledge"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"All the questions I had and information I should have known were answered by this book. Very easy to understand and even if you don't think an area applies to you, read it anyway because with all the money we spend on beauty products knowledge can save you a lot of money. I got this at the library & after reading it I bought one to keep at home for a reference guide."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","review":"I don't buy her products, and I don't think the book is perfect. But I am VERY VERY glad that I bought it! I read it cover to cover. This book is just full of useful information about skin care, ingredients, skin irritants, and the beauty industry. I had no idea how ignorant I was about the industry or about the misinformation fed to buyers by the companies selling the products. I treat my sensitive skin so much better after reading this book, and I am no longer even tempted by ads for new miracle products. I finally know better.The drawback -- she is stingy about suggesting which products actually work. Apparently, in order to have her tell you which products out there she would recommend, you have to buy her other book, Don't Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me. I didn't buy her other book, and probably wont. But now I know how to read labels, so I don't need it.

I've been using skin care products since I was 16 and now that I'm 34 I thought for sure I knew everything about them but I was wrong.Paula's book The Beauty Bible is a wonderful resource with practical advice on what your skin needs and what it can live without. I never knew that a product that boosts SPF may NOT actually be protecting your skin from the sun. It must list the the active ingredients of either titanium dioxide, avobenzone or zinc oxide on the label to effectively fight UVA and UVB rays.I never knew that fragrance in products could do more harm than good so now I look for fragrance free or check that fragrance is far down on the label.I never knew that less product for your skin is best.

There is a section on what to do if you have acne, dry, oily etc etc skin types and why something is or isn't good for you. I think she is very knowledgeable and I like the fact that she's impartial to any one brand of skin care.

The new 5th edition is little changed from the 4th, except for 1) the new Natural Brazil section. Most travelers will find this section too dry and uninteresting, while those really interested in nature will find it too superficial 2) $5.00 higher price tag.Useful things, such as info on hotels, restaurants, entertainment, and prices are too often inaccurate. The most annoying aspect of this guide is that all prices are out of whack. LP translated prices (some of which were probably 5 years old) into US dollars when the real was 2.2 per dollar. Now it is about 3.5.All this raises doubts of whether or not the authors actually went to Brazil to update this edition and not just slapped on a new cover and threw in a new useless section. So, if you have the 4th edition, keep using it. If not, look into buying either the Footprints or the Rough guides. The high popularity of LP is another reason to go with something else. When you go to places recommended by LP, you are very likely to run into hordes of other backpackers clutching their LP guides like bibles and afraid to make a step on their own. On a positive note, the LP guide does have useful info about Brazil's history, economy, culture, society, film and literature."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"On a three month research trip to Brazil, my husband and I began a letter to Lonely Planet detailing every mistake, omission, and out-of-date reference we could remember. Sometimes we just couldn't write fast enough! Many of the maps were virtually useless (particularly the one of Salvador, we thought). Prices were vastly different and inaccurate (and not due only to changes in the exchange rate). At the end of three months, our letter was in excess of 7 single spaced typed pages! And we certainly didn't go everywhere."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"I lost count of the number of errors in this book. They printed the wrong dates for Carnaval Samba Parades, the prices are in USD rather than in local currency - all wrong by an average 30%, as well. Hotels and restaurants are listed that closed long before the January 2002 publication date, and it's obvious that they haven't been to Brasilia in years - citing it as \`treeless\` - which I\`m sure it was twenty years ago, but not today.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a better Brazil guide because I don't have any experience with any others, but I enjoyed ceremoniously burning this book when I left Brazil.The most disappointing is that other Lonely Planet Guidebooks (I have used 5 other ones) far exceed the standards that this one set."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"This book is both interesting and informative. I planned a two week trip in Southern Brazil around the towns/pousadas/hotels in this book. Its information is up to date and very exacting. I bought 3 Brazilian travel books. This book is clearly suberb to the others and a &quot;must have&quot; for the Brazilian traveler. I traveled with a Brazilian and she too marveled at the useful information / history / travel tips. I cannot rate this book high enough! Thanx Lonely Planet!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"I never viewed Lonely Planet as one-size answer to all your travels: along with brilliant LP guides to strange and not-so-strange destinations (West Africa and Canary Islands are just two big success stories) there are sad failures (Iceland & Greenland, Bolivia and anything else penned by Deanna Swaney), marred with self-important ideological preaching, poor research and lack of any writing skills.Brazil is somewhere in between. The book does not suffer from excessive ideologization and does not fancy itself as a latter-day Marxist's political history handbook. America-bashing was kept to a minimum. This is refreshing.There is fairly good amount of practical info (some of it is out of date), although nothing has been done to address the chronic ailment of Lonely Planet: shameless recycling of \\"general info\\", which in most cases is either misleading or simply insults your intelligence. The guide, as before, has no idea how most people book ticket these days; and nuggets of deep knowledge and inside advice like \\"your camera can get damaged, lost or stolen\\" (you don't say - how many years of travel experience helped you acquire this rare insight?) makes you wish you could have your money back.However, useless passages are essentially harmless (apart from making the guide thicker than it needs be). More regrettable is the stuff that's MISSING: that is, focus and helpful informed opinion. It seems that, once a traveller got to Brazil, got a place to stay and figured out the cheapest way to get around, he's not entirely sure why he is there in the first place. Descriptions of the places to see are lazy, unenthusiastic and uninspired. The authors seem to have been going through the motions.With abundance of books on Brazil on the market, there is no compelling reason to stick with this one other than brand loyalty."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"I made the mistake of trying to travel in Brazil with this book. The new editions come out every couple of years or so, but really don't get updated much, which becomes obvious if you try to use the book extensively. Hotels are listed which closed years ago. Maps are next to impossible to use as they show only hotels and restuarants, not landmarks. Half a page will get devoted to the Carmen Miranda museum in Rio de Janeiro, which is freqented only by people who have read about it in LP, is next to impossible to find, and contains next to no history about her, and no artifacts apart from a couple of dresses. After a couple weeks of frustration (thankfully rescued with e-mail advice from Brasilian friends) trying to travel round Brasil with this book, a traveller I met gave me the Footprints guide, which is much more helpful."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"An excellent guidebook is intended to guide and not lead. The Lonely Planet Brazil guidebook is a great guide. Its maps are accurate, its plces to stay and eat are reliable, and it offers extensive info on the sights and activities for every town included in the book. But Brazil is a dynamic country, particularly its economy and that has an impact of all prices quoted in the 5th edition (2002). The actual prices in 6/2003 for meals, accommodations and transportation were consistently 15 to 20 percent less. Bus schedules changed, but not their itinerary and frequency. Unfortunately the guidebook does not offer the names of the bus companies which would be of great help, especially when departing from Rio, where there are over a hundred bus companies.The guidebook has 752 fact filled pages including well researched Facts about Brazil, Facts for the Visitor, and Natural Brazil.A few weak areas:The language area should be strengthened by providing more information on pronunciation. The information they give for consonants t, d, and r is incorrect because it is only partially complete.Where and how to exchange money needs to be updated, especially when exchanging cash.Budget and moderately priced accommodations for Rio should be expanded. (Frommers does a better job in this area.)Visa information needs to be updated. A Brazilian visa now costs $100 for US citizens."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"There is no other option than to agree with the other reviewers. the language section is bad (how do you call a waiter? how do you ask for the bill? basics that are not deemed important by the writers). The descriptions are sometimes uninspired..but most importantly...the information on Brazil's most important city, Sao Paulo, The city that is most difficult to find your way in, but that has far more to offer than Rio is limited to just 15 pages!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"I am so happy to have gotten this book! Not only was it in great condition from getting it used, but it has all the information I would need! It is an older addition yet everything seems relevant to current situations. I cant wait to go to places I have read about and utilize tips I was given!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"Some of the other criticisms here seem petty (e.g., the changing cost of visas, changes in costs due to unstable currency, the screed about the Carmen Miranda museum which isn't difficult to find, yammering about the fairly moderate politics). Indeed, some seem typical of the reviews of travel guides one expects from people with unrealistic expectations of a guidebook and limited travel experience. That said, this is definitely one of LP's weaker efforts. I found numerous errors on maps and in descriptions of locations, important enough that one can miss important places (like hotels or laundries--which can be few). There are significant areas of neglect, e.g., the book doesn't mention that Itacare is an international surfing center, although this is evident pretty quickly. People looking for quiet beach town will be disappointed. My guess is that the next revision needs much more care. Unfortunately, the alternative is the \\"Footprints\\" guide which has some gaping holes (e.g., few descriptions of tours and jungle lodging in the Amazon) and the Rough Guide which also has significant weaknesses."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Brazil","review":"Just used this book for a trip in November and was not impressed. LP covers tons of podunk towns and then has very little coverage of tourism hubs, like Salvador. Basically they covered one neighborhood in Salvador. I also found a lot of their information to be out of date (not surprising, since the book came out in 2002, which means the information is probably from 2001) and just plain WRONG. For instance, they made a huge deal about how touristy Porto Seguro is and we saw a total of about 10 tourists there. We almost didn't go because LP made it sound so overrun with tourists. And LP didn't give us any heads up that the beautiful beaches are about 2 hours away from Porto Seguro via ferry and truck, so you should stay near Arrial d'Ajuda or in Trancoso instead. They make it sound like it's super-easy to hop back and forth. Then there was the ridiculous note about the \\"constant noise of tractors\\" in Morro de Sao Paulo, which also made me think twice about going. I'm glad I ignored LP, since M de SP was the highlight of my trip. (And I saw a total of 2 tractors in 3 days, and they did not, as LP claimed \\"disturb the peace considerably.\\") Skip this guidebook. Rough Guide was better (but still didn't have good info on Porto Seguro). Heck, Fodor's was better. But the LP Rio city guide does rock."},{"Title":"Singapore","review":"Pure Drivel. This is possibly the worst guide book I've ever used. The guide has pretty pictures and a good map inserted in the back cover, but the narrative is written at a fifth grade level by a bored Junior League housewife. The book repeats itself, rewriting the same boring descriptions in different sections of the book. There is no understanding of the culture or history, no description of the public transport system and no development of the role of Singapore in Southeast Asian politics. The book thinks that everything in Singapore is just dandy, gives no warning of tourist traps and is best used by Cruise Ship passengers with a need to visit more department stores.I used this guide on a recent visit and had the worst meal (and the most expensive)on my entire asian trip following its suggestions. You'll learn more from ten minute talk with a cab driver."},{"Title":"Singapore","review":"this book is just the guide for people that like to travel to tropical Singapore ,it had all the best feature interest listed with detail of location,map and many more.It also has picture of interest showing places like Sentosa,a beautiful island at the southern part of Singapore,this small island has a fun fill fantasy water park which boast the biggest in South East asia.And also with hotel and resort over looking a long strech of white beach,And also monporail travel around the island at snail pace ,it will take you aound to various attration like the history museum,the under water world ,the musical fountain,a football field size of garden and a lot more.This book is highly recommende if you like to travel to Sinagpore for the first time."},{"Title":"GAUGUINS SKIRT","review":"I read this just before reading Rebecca Solnit's &quot;River of Shadows: Edweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West,&quot; and the parallels were manifold. Like hers, this is more than even expanded biography: it places Gauguin's South Sea quest in a historical and social context, discusses the mythologies of exoticism and primitivism, two cultural phenomena of late nineteenth century Europe, and explores how they contributed to Gauguin's complex and often self-contradictory identity. Eisenman has taken care to become familiar with Tahitian culture and mores, both then and now, and gives us the locals' views of Gauguin into the bargain.As a painter, I was intimate with Gauguin's oeuvre and was familiar enough with his life (though I hadn't read Sweetman's definitive biography), and this both extended my understanding of the man and enhanced my enjoyment of the work.The writer, a polymath with a rather academic style, isn't the compelling writer that Solnit is (hence 4 rather than 5 stars) but his subject is no less fascinating, the challenge of showing his subject simultaneously in the context of fin-de-siecle colonialism and European Modernism no less daunting. A very interesting approach to understanding a unique artist, one who justifies it totally."},{"Title":"GAUGUINS SKIRT","review":"Some look at Paul Gauguin as a portrayer of the Pacific and the essential window maker for the West to that region. Others see Guaguin as a disease-spreading colonist who profited off of Pacific exoticism. Here, the author tries to pave a middle ground in whic Guaguin's relationship to the Pacific is deemed \\"complicated,\\" rather than being given a thumbs up or thumbs down.Of course, Gauguin had European privileges, but the Polynesians didn't just bow to him in an unquestioned mannner, they ridiculed him at times. One blind Tahitian woman put her hands down the artist's pants, rolled her eyes, and said, \\"Hmph! European!\\" Gauguin is famous for his art, but the works were not well-received in Europe originally. Guaguin wasn't some naive neutral figure: he wrote publications blasting many European leaders on the islands.The main area in which ambiguity is brought up is around gender. Paintings to me that clearly depict women are deemed gender-ambiguous by the author. Not only does the author add to burgeoning works about the mahu; he also emphasized that France had its gender- and sexuality-atypical people in that time as well. Some of the issues here almost surprisingly predate Freud. This discussion may be especially interesting in communities of color. The author mentions how mahu were mocked and deemed hypersexual, but at the same time embraced and played important roles in the lives of women and teens. In African America, there is much controversy about \\"the down low,\\" but this work points to how subgroups in a culture can be mocked and celebrated at the same time. The author is very evasive about whether Gauguin kicked it with any of the atypical, and not just females.When I was first learning how to write essays in junior high, we were encouraged to write an intro, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. This book has an intro, 3 body chapters, and a conclusion, so seems unsophisticated in that way. Most of the painting reprinted are in black-and-white and they lose a ton of details this way. Scholarship on art travels a gray area, because anyone can deconstruct a work, but it takes a deep thinker to write pages and pages upon it. This book will be confusing to many, but still may be overly simplistic to some.I'm fasciniated by race, gender, sexuality, colonialism, art, and revisionism.

Presented in both the Yup'ik and English languages side by side, and enhanced with black-and-white photography, Taprarmiuni Kassiyulritt is a treasure that showcases and helps preserve vital elements of Yup'ik culture, daily life and spirituality, from competitive gift-giving to feasting, feats of strength, and especially dance."},{"Title":"Power to the People: An American State at Work","review":"In Power to the People, Wisconsin's longest serving governor describes his role in revamping the Wisconsin economy, reforming welfare, and implementing the nation's first school choice system in Milwaukee. Thompson, a Republican, served as Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001 and currently serves as Health and Human Services Secretary for the Bush administration.Thompson, a native of Elroy, Wisconsin (which has a population of about 1500 and is also the boyhood home of automotive and motorcycle enthusiast and writer Peter Egan) begins the book by quoting a piece of advice he often heard from his father, &quot;You have two ears and one mouth. Use them in that proportion and you'll do just fine&quot;. Throughout the book, Thompson recounts how the common sense he learned growing up in a small midwestern town influenced his handling of three of his main accomplishments as governor: creating a business friendly climate which resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs, replacing welfare with a system that helps able body individuals to go back to work, and the implementation of the Milwaukee school choice program.Thompson's success as governor can be attributed to both his political skills and the fact that he has always been more of a problem solver than an ideologue. Every book written by a politician contains at least some self promotion and this one is no exception. But overall, it is an interesting and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Southern Living: 1997 Annual Recipes (Southern Living Annual Recipes)","review":"I own several of the Southern Living compilation books and this one is my favorite.

This hilarious gem of a recipe book provides incisive tongue-in-cheek insight into Mormon culture in Utah and Idaho, as well as a hidden treasure of recipes by Sister Enid Christensen.From Tuna a la King of Kings and Adam's Barbecued Short Ribs to Legislature Weenies and Suppresso, both Latter Day Saints with a sense of humor and those who have lived among them will delight in this buffet of tasty treats.Savory morsels of history with a dash of theology are artfully blended with wholesome family social structure into a Utah feast. The family tree at the begininng of the chapter on \\"In-Breads\\" explains LDS cosmology, genealogy, history, plural marriage and naming conventions all in one easy diagram.Let the kids make Bologna Angel Wings and try constructing a Sugar Cube Temple (if you happen to have 26,000 sugar cubes on hand) while you sip on Joseph and Emma's Afternoon Delight. One can only wish for a supplement on tapioca salads and home-canned goods."},{"Title":"No Man Knows My Pastries: The Secret Not Sacred Recipes of Sister Enid Christensen","review":"If you live in the northern Utah/southeastern Idaho region, this book is legendary. It's one of those things that seems to be passed back and forth under the table; some people have seen it and others can quote whole passages from it. I was finally \\"gifted\\" a used copy by a gay friend, and I have to admit, this book is the damnedest thing: a humor classic that is also an incisive (but gentle) satire of a regional/religious culture, and above all else, a cookbook.Sister Enid Christensen is the LDS housewife and mother to end them all: a Stake Relief Society Ancestral Recipe Coordinator whose duties coincide with the care and feeding of her husband and their \\"eternal family.\\" Ingredients for the recipes are the stuff of the odds-and-ends cupboard: Ritz Crackers, Jell-O mix, leftover candy; the end results are Sunday horrors such as \\"Jell-O Ribbon Loaf\\" and \\"Franked Corn Things.\\" Accompanying the recipes are photos of Sister Enid and her husband LaMar reveling in the eternal bliss of their kitchen or the hallowed glow of \\"Conference\\" over the living room television.The Christensens are the alter-egos of Roger Salazar and Michael Wightman, two gay men who have brilliantly revealed the regional culture without eviscerating it. The Christensens may be harrowingly moribund in a box store, lock step lifestyle, but they're lovably goofy too, rendering this book a minor masterpiece of humor and pathos.I can quibble about just two things: the \\"Jello-O Belt\\" shown on page 6 actually extends all the way north to Rexburg, Idaho, if not just beyond to St. Anthony. There's also no recipe for the famous \\"Funeral Potatoes\\" (a.k.a. \\"Party Potatoes\\"). But as one of my gay neighbors told me, \\"If you don't know that one already, you haven't lived here long enough.\\""},{"Title":"No Man Knows My Pastries: The Secret Not Sacred Recipes of Sister Enid Christensen","review":"The humor and entertainment value is obvious, but I'm happy to say it's also full of great recipes!

Includes such things as the Jello-Matrix for all occassions."},{"Title":"Green Cathedrals: The Ultimate Celebration of All 271 Major League and Negro League Ballparks Past and Present","review":"It boggles my mind that the author actually did all that research to find out the dimensions, important events, descriptions, and in many cases photos of every major league ballpark ever to host a game. The result is a feeling like I imagine it would be to see a game at Fenway Park: a visit to a temple of baseball. The title could not be more perfectly chosen.Lowry has also promoted a bit of healing. Having recognized what any aficionado of baseball history knows--that the Negro Leagues of old were surely major leagues on a par with the AL and NL, except in recordkeeping--he spurs interest in a too-often forgotten part of baseball's past.This book is absolutely essential to the library of any true lover of baseball history."},{"Title":"Green Cathedrals: The Ultimate Celebration of All 271 Major League and Negro League Ballparks Past and Present","review":"This book was long overdue. Philip J. Lowry certainly did his research to find all these ballparks--even including some that were used briefly at the turn of the century!

Thanks to the great Jack Fellows, War in Pacific Skies is more of an adrenaline rush than any Hollywood movie on the subject. You can stare at a single one of his paintings for practically an hour and feel transported back in time to the event it portrays. The text is also rich with historical detail, but buy this one for the paintings. First rate!"},{"Title":"War in Pacific Skies","review":"A large selection of stunning paintings by Jack Fellows.I like his style, very dynamic and close to Michael Turner's art.Book is well printed and the not-so-often seen photos are a nice bonus."},{"Title":"War in Pacific Skies","review":"The description somewhat misrepresents the contents of the book. It is PRIMARILY a vehicle to present Fellows artwork, wrapped in some uninspired text and often-seen photographs. I could not find anywhere the &quot;personal insights&quot; referenced. If you like Fellows art and buy the book for that ALONE you will like it. The text is boring and rehashes common ground with nothing new or &quot;insightful&quot;."},{"Title":"War in Pacific Skies","review":"Charlie and Ann Cooper provide a comprehensive history of the Pacific air war in this 2010 Zenith Press softcover release. (The hardcover came out in 2003). The book's main selling point is the 100 dramatic and evocative paintings done by master artist Jack Fellows that compliment the text. While the text is informative enough, Fellows' artwork takes the book to a whole different level.After an introductory 'Prelude to War' unit, the Coopers detail the PTO air war in chapters entitled 'Imperial Japan Seizes the Offensive,' 'The End of the Beginning,' 'Moving on Moresby,' 'Cactus Air Force,' 'Pacific Strategy' and so on. The text accurately if rather dispassionately describes the various battles, campaigns and missions flown during the war. Though the cover promised \\"Personal Insights\\" by combat veterans, I didn't see nary a one.Fellows' artwork, though, is simply wonderful. His paintings - whether they portray a P-38 locked in a dogfight, B-25s strafing Japanese airfields at zero feet, a P-47 rolling in on a target, an SBD attacking a Japanese BB or a B-24 going mano-a-mano with an Emily flying boat - knock your socks off. His paintings are as technically accurate as they are dramatic and appealing. I couldn't begin to list my most favorite painting in WAR IN PACIFIC SKIES if I tried. They're just too many top-notch scenes.At $27.99, WAR IN PACIFIC SKIES is a bargain. The text is adequate; the artwork, superb. Air war buffs will want to pick up a copy of this gem.

I am completely satisfied and have learned a lot from it about aspects of this theatre I didn't know concerning the men and aircraft who were there. This is one of my studio books that I don't lend out to anyone. Well edited and represented by several artists and styles of depicting aviation history. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"War in Pacific Skies","review":"I just received my copy of War in Pacific Skies.The first thing that popped out at me was how hard it is to read the descriptions by each picture. The print is small and very light making me have to strain my eyes to read the words. Please remember that the buyers of this book are generally going to be older people with an interest in aviation history. My main interest in reading is the aviation war in the Pacific so I've read a lot of different authors, seen a lot of artists and photographers work and the age of 77 I wear glasses to read. Even with my glasses on the type was hard to decipher. Another problem I found with the book is the use of the glossy paper. The reflection of light made reading harder, making me shift the book around just to see the words easily. Finally, I don't agree with the Forward written by My. Boyne. I didn't find the book full of new material. The book is basic in information, most of which has been published befor in print or on film. I did find the prints made the book worth having for a reference book but the text didn't ad much to any library. I have an extensive library of the aviation war in the Pacific and if I had seen the book befor I bought it I doubt I would have bought it. I served in Naval Aviation during the Korean fiasco, restored a Navy PT13, traveled to many military air shows and museums around the U.S. and Europe so I have a fair knowledge of militay histoy in the air.

Dolgon is original. He has chosen the more challenging path for this work. To be sure, a trashy love letter to New York Society would have found its summer readership. But Dolgon takes the less worn path, getting under the skin of The Hamptons and examining the area through the lens of its people and through multiple generations of social change. The result is a fascinating book and an original take on an area whose depth and meaning is so often overlooked for its pretty face. This is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The End of the Hamptons: Scenes from the Class Struggle in America's Paradise","review":"I recently finished reading The End of the Hamptons. I found it fascinating reading, scholarly yet accessible to the general reader. Dolgon creates a strong sense of place, of history and of the present day class and cultural conflicts that continue to shape the Hamptons.He gets beneath the glitter and the stereotypes to uncover the forces at work. As a Cape Codder concerned about development and the \\"end of Cape Cod\\" as I know it I found the book to have relevance for communities far beyond the Hamptons. The question of whose voices are heard in the continual struggle for land and resources is a central question confronting us all."},{"Title":"The End of the Hamptons: Scenes from the Class Struggle in America's Paradise","review":"As Dolgon writes in the introduction, \\"the [Hamptons] area is emblematic of our nation's most salient historical themes: early European and Native American encounters; rapid changes in economic development and physical environments; the constant and shifting migration of world populations to the United States; the formation of racial, ethnic, regional, and national identities; and the vast divisions between rich and poor on local and global levels.\\" After providing historical background, Dolgon describes recent events: the stuggles and interactions of Native Americans, environmentalists, fishermen, service workers, and the uber-wealthy. Such struggles and interactions are going on all over America, and all over the world. With this in mind, the book is truly worth the time."},{"Title":"The End of the Hamptons: Scenes from the Class Struggle in America's Paradise","review":"The End of the Hamptons is less than meets the eye. The author has done little serious research and conflates gossiip with his superficial and dated Marxism. Indeed, to suggest that the secessionist movement to create Peconic County was Marxist inspired, as he does, borders on the psychotic.Harold Wit and I founded the Group for America's South Fork, yet the author spoke to neither of us. He gives enormous credit to one individual, Hal Ross, who played only a minor role in the environmental movement that arose from a passion to protect the farms. As the author of the Suffolk County Farmland Preservation Act, I find this incredible. There is a real need for a serious study of what happened on the South Fork politically and socially, but this is not it.Ian Marceau, who was the first director of the Group for America's South Fork, and who is lauded as a kind of saviour by the author, told everyone that he would work for the developers if they paid him more than the environmental group did. But don't look for this or any other truth in this slight and useless tract. The author's hatred of the Hamptons has its origins in the politics of resentment, which is utterly tiresome.Richard Cummings, author.

Guy tells the story of the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century conflicts over the definition of champagne and, in part, the definition of Frenchness as something connected to but distinct from the different parts of France.The concept of terroir, something like the soul of the soil, that supposedly gives certain foodstuffs their unique qualities was much up for debate during the period, whereas currently the EU and France in particular give unquestioned legal protection to terms like \\"champagne.\\" Guy points out that, although often understood as a fight between capital and labor, the at-times violent disputes between vine-growers and winemakers in the Champagne region were more complicated than that. Vine-growers in the core areas of the Marne were opposed both to bottlers who wanted to use grapes from other places to make champagne and to fellow vine-growers in those other places who benefited from that practice. Meanwhile, Marne bottlers also argued that the designation champagne should be legally protected, but they wanted to limit the definition to sparkling wine bottled in the area, regardless of the source of grapes.Guy's story thus highlights champagne as an industrial product - not just because it requires a second processing to add the famous bubbles, but also because its production and consumption were profoundly affected by changes in transportation and modern advertising that helped make champagne the beverage of celebration and of Frenchness. The book is marred by repetitions of phrases, as if a series of journal articles had been simply stitched together, though I don't think these chapters were in fact published elsewhere. Nonetheless, I learned a fair amount about the social construction of terroir, a concept that supposedly represents a natural and immutable connection among an area of land, its inhabitants, and the products they produce."},{"Title":"Passionate Witch","review":"Thorne Smith, in his brief but amazing life, established a one-man literary genre. In the years since his death no one has usurped his place as a creator of alcoholic hilarity in the novel form. His faithful public will greet with joy this genuine new Thorne Smith novel, left unfinished at the time of his death and now completed by Norman Matson.This uproarious novel recounts the remarkable consequences of a marriage of a meek and respectible man with a grade-A witch. T. Wallace Wooly, Jr., a wealthy widower who lived a quiet and stuffy life on a diet of vitamins and vegetable juices, did not know what he was getting in for when he rescued a strange woman, entirely nude, from a burning hotel. In fact, Mr. Wooly was a little bewildered a week later to discover that he had taken the lady as his wife. His bride's unconventional antics were eventually to revolutionize Mr. Wooly's life. He who had never in his life drunk anything stronger than carrot juice was to find that steady alcoholic consumption was requisite to peace of mind. There follow some of the finest binges in literature, climaxed by the memorable scene in which Mr. Wooly disguised as an old lady from Perth Amboy, appears at a Turkish bath.Does this sound a lot like Bewitched? It should - Sol Saks, the series creator, based his show on the original idea put forth in this novel."},{"Title":"Passionate Witch","review":"Thorne Smith died while writing this book.

Sometimes the main characters have been of the mischievous type like Squirrel Nutkin, Hunca Munca or Samuel Whiskers. Well, in \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\", the main characters, Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, are two thoroughly disagreeable and unpleasant creatures. Mr. Tod has foxy whiskers and is of a wandering habit. The other animals either cannot bear him or are frightened of him. He has several different houses but is rarely found home. However, his houses are not always empty, for Tommy Brock is prone to moving in without Mr. Tod's permission. Tommy Brock is a fat, waddling badger with a horrible grinning face and a habit of digging things up. One day he pays a call to old Mr. Bouncer, Benjamin Bunny's father. Today he is in charge of looking after the young, while Benjamin and his wife Flopsy are out. Unfortunately after conversing with the badger and smoking a very strong cabbage leaf cigar, the old rabbit falls asleep and Tommy Brock makes off with the rabbit babies. When Benjamin and Flopsy return they find their young gone and Benjamin at once goes out to track down Tommy Brock. Along the way he enlists the help of his brother-in-law, Peter Rabbit. Of course, they are not the only ones after the terrible badger. It seems that yet again he has set up house in one of Mr. Tod's residences and the fox, who is not in the best of moods this day, discovers the badger asleep in his bed... There are not many color pictures in this book, but there are many black and white illustrations in the style of woodcuts. Of course the story is extremely interesting and suspensful. \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\" is a longer story than some of the author's other tales. Also, there is more narration than dialogue and the language is early twentieth century, so this story may be more suitable for older children. Parents and children should not pass up this lesser known tale by a very talented storyteller and illustrator."},{"Title":"The Tale of Mr. Tod","review":"My 7 year old loved this book.

I always thought Nathalie's character was so grown-up for her age, I admired her : calm, reasonable, determined, ambitious, beautiful (not that she cares about that).Nathalie always knew whe was adopted, and on the eve of embarking to college, she spends the summer looking for her birth mother. She tells her parents about her quest, and although they understand, they cannot help but be a bit hurt. The relationships in the family were very real to me. I loved her parents, her extrovert, creative mother, very much unlike Nathalie (think Rory and Lorelei in \\"Gilmore Girls\\") and her serious doctor of a dad.All the questions Nathalie asks herself are questions that will resonate with any adopted child : why did they abandon me? Who was my mother? what if I don't like what I find out?The story reads a bit like a private detective novel. Nathalie starts with the bits her parents are able to provide her with, and from phone calls to visits, she slowly puts the story of her adoption together. (She's in for a surprise or two.)There is a great moment where Nathalie reads her birth mother's diary as a young girl (clearly they could not have been more different). Nathalie's birth mother's \\"voice\\" is made very real, and so as a reader you get to see the other point of view, the one of the mother who let go of her child, and how and why.While there are some poignant moments, this is not a depressing story; it is rather bittersweet.Nathalie finds some answers that help her know who she is, but there is no big drama or life-changing moments.If I had to find fault with this book, it would be that Nathalie's relationship with her boyfriend Paul is the only one that did not quite ring true; they don't seem to really \\"be\\" together, there is no tension, no passion, he seems more like the friendly boy next door. But that's really it.It's a very beautiful book, and it followed me throughout my teenage years to my adult life now."},{"Title":"Find a Stranger, Say Goodbye","review":"I was probably about 9 when I first read this book and I immediately loved it. I have no idea what made me decide to read it, as I had no experience with adoption and it doesn't seem like the type of thing I was reading at the time. Perhaps it was because it was by Lowry and I'd already fallen in love with some of her other books (The Giver, Number the Stars).I was absolutely fascinated by this book. I was constantly borrowing it from the library until my parents bought me my own copy when I was in 8th grade. Honestly, I was convinced that there would be a note in the front confiding that *I* had been adopted, but no.At that young age I would have never imagined that several years later I would be in the position to make the difficult decision of placing my own child for adoption. Funny how things work out.Unlike the story, I am so grateful that my son will always know of his adoption and of the love his birthfather and I have for him. We've thought of him every day for the past 6 years, and we'll be here with open arms if and when he wishes to meet us.It's been 16 years now since I first read this book and it still has a special place on my shelf and in my heart."},{"Title":"Find a Stranger, Say Goodbye","review":"i loved this book it was very good.

Well, I was wrong. I had a math test right after lunch one day and I decided to check out a book from the school library just in case I finished early. I couldn't find any books to read, and so I went to the librarian for any recomendations. She took out a hardcover book by Lois Lowry. I opened it up and didn't think much of it. I then said thank-you, knowing I would NEVER read it. I mean, this book was like, 175 pages, and my 11-year-old brain couldn't possibly seep up all that information.I was wrong.

Natalie has beauty, intelligence, a great boyfriend, and a wonderful family, but her search for her birth mother sends her into a welter of emotions.The main character of this story is Natalie Armstrong, whose mother, father, and sister are Kay, Alden, and Nancy Armstrong. This story takes place in many places because of Natalie's search, but in Maine and New York in about 1969.&lt;u>Find a Stranger, Say Goodbye&lt;/u>'s theme is \\"following your dreams\\" and \\"never giving up.\\" Its genre is a mix between mystery and adventure, and written in third person omniscient.I thought that this book was pretty good. It's a bit strange at places, which I'll not reveal because it might ruin the book. I'd recommend this book to people who like to read about family. It gives you a sort of comfort and understanding about families, and makes you ask natural questions, but not really anything that'll get you confused. &lt;u>Find a Stranger, Say Goodbye&lt;/u> will go by mildly fast, but it'll still be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Find a Stranger, Say Goodbye","review":"This is about a girl named Natalie who is adopted.

Every year, the scientific literature on estrogen's known effects on the brain (and the effects on the brain of estrogen loss), has grown more massive but women have mainly been left out of the loop on it over the last ten years.Anyone with internet access can judge its size for themselves by logging onto the excellent PUBMED site on any search engine - it accesses the full scientific and medical literature in the National Library of Medicine. Anyone can punch in \\"estrogen AND the brain\\" on this site and read actual abstracts (or just titles) of the thousands of articles that now document the effects of estrogen on the brain - predominantly beneficial effects - in humans and in animals. In the year 2000 alone, hundreds of new studies documenting this association have been reported.As a baby boomer, I am aging today and need to know what options I have to weigh until the ideal studies come out over the decades to come.I found Dr. Warga's synthesis of this material a wonderful, clear and easy read and more than fair-minded. I feel she bent over backwards in the book to warn off women, who for personal reasons, shouldn't take estrogen. In the book, she's far from dogmatic in pushing estrogen on everyone for the mind changes she describes. I thought I was going crazy or had early, early Alzheimer's disease before I read about the symptoms of the WHM Syndrome and read what could reverse it.By studying the many effects estrogen has been found to have in the brain, she's been able to offer women who can't or won't take estrogen, rational arguments - and the research evidence - for alternative factors besides estrogen that can help women experiencing memory, speech, and attention changes. I would never have known that estrogen affects glucose metabolism - the fuel of the brain - and that sugar can help memory.Many of us know that women's health research needs have been given short shrift for too long. It's great to know that someone at least cares enough about women to be clueing us in to what does exist and the choices we have open to us.Grateful"},{"Title":"Menopause and the Mind : The Complete Guide to Coping with the Cognitive Effects of Perimenopause and Menopause - Including Memory Loss, Foggy Thinking and Verbal Slips","review":"Wow!

Dr. Warga's is the first book to point out how very, very common this is for women in perimenopause (pre-menopause) and that it doesn't get worse -- in fact, these symptoms usually stop when you've achieved actual menopause (because, as I understand it, it's not the estrogen loss that causes this syndrome, it's the wildly fluctuating estrogen levels of perimenopause that cause it). If you're a pre-menopausal woman who is experiencing mental fog, forgetfulness, word misusage, etc., you HAVE to read this book.

My quality of life changed drastically,I felt like I was just existing. I enjoyed nothing, nor wanted to be sociable anymore.

I am starting to feel feminine, and wanting to be around people. Suffice to say, at the second session with the Psychiatrist,she told me I did not need to return, my whole outlook had changed!

(Random House Children&#8217;s Books) It brings together many of the characters from the previous books, and should not be read before the others.If you&#8217;re having a hard time keeping them straight, the books are grouped into three sagas, The Quint Saga, the Twig saga and the Rook saga. The order as published so far in the USA is:1. Beyond the Deepwoods (Twig saga)2. Stormchaser (Twig saga)3. Midnight Over Santaphrax (Twig saga)4. Curse of the Gloamglozer (Quint saga)5. The Last of the Sky Pirates (Rook saga)6. Vox (Rook saga)7. Freeglader (Rook saga)Amazon.com lists a Book 8, The Winter Knights, but this must be an import, as it isn&#8217;t readily available and the cover artwork is different. The Winter Knights is a part of the Quint saga. There&#8217;s also Clash of the Sky Galleons available in October 2006. This also is from the Quint saga. I understand that there will be ten Edge Chronicle books in all, so this isn&#8217;t the end of the line for Edge fans.Freeglader has the best battle sequences of the series so far, and is made up of several story lines, including the exodus from Undertown, the perilous trek to the Free Glades, the hatching of a new Shryke army, the rebuilding of the Great Library, the ambitious plans of the master of the Foundry Glades, the Goblin armies, the trial of Xanth, and much more. Rook is once again the central character, losing his memory, and then regaining it, and when he is reunited with a family member, everything is explained for us all.One of the most exciting in the series so far, but requires prior knowledge of the characters.Amanda Richards, April 11, 2006"},{"Title":"Freeglader (SIGNED)","review":"There are gnokgoblins, cloddertrogs, woodtrolls, and waifs.

They will face danger at every turn from the horrible conditions and from unmentionable creatures who would harm them.The evil Master of the Foundry Glades, Hemuel Spume views the Free Glades as a source of slaves, Rook Barkwater loses part of his memory in a sepia storm, Xanth must face his past crimes, and a father is disappointed in his son. But it is Rook's life story that we are interested in knowing.... Will we discover it?Stewart and Riddell have created an exciting and complex fantasy world in The Edge Chronicles.

I never really liked Rook Barkwater until this book. Now I do. Freeglader is all about the journey that the Undertowners have to take after the Dark Maelstrom to get to the Freeglades and have peace. Banding together with the sky pirates from the Mire, the fleeing Undertowners must brave attacks from Muglumps, shrykes, goblins, and survive the treacherous Mire and Edgelands.The story was great and exciting, even if it does take a serious turn. Younger readers might be a little more sensitive to some of the gory scenes: the one where the shryke rips out a librarian's heart, for instance, or the one where Amberfuce is boiled alive. This aside, my favorite part of the book was not the actual story, but the epilogue. There is a conversation at the end between Rook and an old sky pirate (won't say who it is!) and Rook learns the secret of his parentage. It's been obvious since the beginning, but it's nice to see it in print and find out the intricacies of marriage in the Deepwoods.This is a must-read for Edge Chronciles fans, especially for those who really like Rook. Don't bother reading it if you havent' read the others; it won't make any sense at all.P.S. did anyone notice in the family tree at the back that ROok is also related to a dear little someone who's last name is Hammelherd?"},{"Title":"Freeglader (SIGNED)","review":"This book is one of the best of the seires.

He also was one of the pioneers of the comic strip &amp; an incisive caricaturist. The English and Americans saw him as one of the worlds great painters. And he created some beautiful sculptures. Ahead of his time, artists from Van Gogh and Picasso to Henry Irving and Cecil B Demille were influenced by him.Yet 100 years later he is all but forgotten - despite the fact that his art is all around us.In Adrift, Dan Malan explores the history of the rise &amp; disappearance of Dore. The approach is both scholarly and relaxed: lots of detail without the customary &quot;art critic&quot; hyperbole. The opponents of Dore are given their voice, but it is difficult for the reader not to be drawn to this fascinating and enigmatic artist.The book is comprehensively illustrated with a wide variety of Dore's works, and includes a very detailed catalogue and bibliography. There is also an invaluable price guide to Dore's major works.Anyone who has read other Dore bios (Gosling, Richardson) will quickly realise how lazy and incomplete these efforts were.And anyone who has bought any of the Dover Dore books will be amazed at how these books are but the tip of the iceberg.Surprisingly, this book has not been published by a major publishing company. ...Highly recommended.

These books are quite funny, and the mystery is pretty good too. But it's the characters that make these stories so appealing. These two sixty-something southern belle sisters are really something, and it's a lot of fun reading about their lives and their antics. Good fun!"},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"I have been in mourning since the loss of Anne George! I can't find another writer I love so much. I feel kind of empty knowing she's not with us. Every single book is so refreshing and the characters are people you would love to run around with. I can't say enough about any of them. For those of you who have never read one of her books, order the entire set, you will never regret it! There are no better people than Mouse and Sister! They lift your spirits and make you laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"It's always such a pleasant evening when reading an Anne George mystery. The sisters are up to their usual bickering in a way that brings a smile to the reader's lips on a regular basis (and out and out laughter on occasion).This episode focuses on geneology after the aunt of the groom, a genologist, dies in a suspicious fall. Could she have been killed for unearthing a branch of a family tree that should have stayed buried? The whole lineage thing is all the funnier for the southern setting where what one's ancestors did in the Civil War really matters to some people.The book loses a fifth star for a disappointing ending. Likewise, once you know the ending some of the actions of the killer don't quite make sense. Still, I certainly enjoyed the read to get there."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"I came to the Southern Sister mysteries by way of a Christmas present, Murder Shoots the Bull. I was hooked! These sisters are so real, and their words ring true. After reading the last one first, I've gone back to begin at the beginning...Just finished Murder Runs in the Family. The quality is wonderfully consistent, reading any of them is a pure treat. I have only one complaint... it's not with the author, but with the editing. Ms. George is poorly served by editing that allows a jacket blurb to state &quot;Mary Alice has spared nothing for her ONLY daughter's wedding...&quot; (emphasis added) when in fact, Mary Alice has two daughters. Such poor editing causes the reader to mentally pause, and disturbes the flow of these marvelous books. That said... BUY THEM ALL, grab Mouse's afghan, and pray for snow."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"Get them, get them all. Genealogy and murder - hmm, who would have thought it, but wait, I know people who seem to care about their ancestors like some of the characters in this book. I can seem some of them at least thinking of murder if their lineage is ridiculed. Again, these sixty something sisters and their kin are a hoot and a half. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"These sisters are so realistic and funny, it is easy to imagine these southern ladies caught up in various mysteries and adventures.

My grandmother would have said we were common as pig's tracks too if we would have worn white after Labor Day."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"This third entry in the series is laugh-out-loud wonderful. I have never actually laughed while reading a book before. Yes, of course I've smiled, teared up, been disturbed etc., but I mean Ms. George can really make you laugh. Patricia Anne is a humorous, yet poignant voice. While signing on to review this book today, I couldn't help notice the AOL news about the latest horrible shooting in Atlanta. This made me think of Patricia Anne's simple true comment about the world &quot;being too much with us.&quot; I found the book most hysterical when Mary Alice gives her fiction telling a try. Escape the world and the heat by spending some time with these sisters."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"&quot;Murder Runs in the Family&quot; is the third book in the eight-book mystery series featuring the &quot;Southern Sisters.&quot; Sadly, Anne George passed away in 2001 and it's a shame that readers will no longer have new, witty dialogues. If you have not read this series - I urge you to order them all and read them in sequence. You will not regret it!In this book, we find the brash, bold, extra-large Mary Alice in preparation for her daughter's first wedding. Deborah is marrying a former student of her Aunt Patricia Anne's who may also be the former father of her twins as he donated sperm to the clinic! It is funny in a good, clean sort of way. It depicts middle-America at its finest.Mary Alice finds a little romance of her own in &quot;Murder Runs in the Family&quot; as does Patricia Anne's widowed daughter - Haley. Fred and Patricia Anne make you believe in &quot;happily ever after&quot; as they celebrate 40 years of marriage.Patricia Anne is constantly amazed at the transformations of her former students. In this book, she amazes herself as she delves into a little geneology.This is a DELIGHTFUL series. I promise you. You will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"This is my first Southern Sisters novel and I thoroughly enjoyed every page. The sisters, Patricia Anne and Mary Alice are hilarious.In this mystery, Mary Alice's daughter gets married and the wedding guests are varied and include Meg March Bryan, a very successful genealogist, and a guest from the groom's side of the family. Patricia Anne and Mary Alice become chummy with Meg and have a luncheon date with her. The luncheon goes well, until their guest hurries away without her two briefcases. Shortly after that the sisters learn that Meg has taken her life by jumping off the 9th floor of the building across the street. The sister detectives get involved with her death which they don't believe was a sucide.What makes this book so charming are the sisters. Patricia Anne, a former English teacher, and married to Fred for over forty years, is a tiny and proper lady. Her sister,Mary Alice is almost her opposite in every way. She's big, beautiful and men seem to love all 250 pounds of her. She describes herself as being 5 foot 12 inches tall and she's looking for a fourth husband. The first three are all lying in the cemetery, side by side. Mary Alice calls Patricia Anne, Mouse and tells people that little Mouse is anorexic. I laughed out loud over the verbal exchanges between the sisters.I read this very quickly, and I can't wait to read more books in this series."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"Anne George is a delight.

She meets the octogenerian man of her dreams, who flies her off on exotic trips. Mouse gets stuck with the strange relative of the groom, left over from the wedding. She is a geneologist named Meg Bryan. The local geneologists, some of them at the wedding seem to hate her. A local judge, really hates her. She goes to visit him anyway only to take a skydive out his window. The judge and everyone else seem to want Meg's laptop. Did she commit suicide or was she murdered? Why?This was a very entertaining mystery. I love the characters and the descriptions. The mystery is very good. I only have two very minor criticisms. If her dog Woofer is so old, why is he outside in every weather. Give him a bath and flea dip and bring him inside. There is entirely too much talk about Vulcan's behind. It might be big, but it's getting boring."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"Anne George has written a wonderful book. Patricia Anne and Mary Alice obviously love each other, but they still argue like other sibling do. They are hilarious. When murder comes up, expect Patricia Anne to put her nose into it and expect Mary Alice to follow after her. With a fast moving plot, this book can easily be read in one day."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"The third installment of the silly Southern sisters is Murder Runs in the Family. Here we find Patricia Anne and Mary Alice at a wedding for Mary Alice's daughter, Debbie. At the wedding we are introduced to the groom's family including genealogist, Meg Bryant, but there is more than meet's the eye. The following day Mary Alice and Patricia Anne go to meet Meg for lunch and shortly thereafter Meg commits suicide. Or is it suicide?I thought the sisters' hijinx were funny and entertaining as usual. I did fell this one predictable but I still enjoyed the cute coziness of it. I was looking for a cozy entertaining read and that's what I found here. I'd give this 3.5 stars because it was predictable but I'm rounding up because I am enjoying the series as a whole! Onto to the next one."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"Mary Alice has pulled out all the stops for her daughter's lavish wedding. ( With three marriages of her own under her belt she is, after all, something of an authority on the subject ). The ceremony goes off without a hitch, but when one of the groom's relatives mysteriously \\"falls\\" from the 9th floor of the courthouse building Mary Alice begins to wonder just what kind of family her daughter has married into!This is the third installment in the series and like its predecessors it is an entertaining read. The most enjoyable parts of the story involve the relationship between Mary Alice (aka \`Sister') and her younger sister, Patricia Anne (Mouse). Their bantering is priceless: well-written dialogue with a kind of understated humor. I found myself smiling through many parts of the book. The \\"mystery\\" is of the classic cozy variety - not particularly plausible and won't keep you awake at night. But the setting and domestic details...nicely done.The sisters are in their 60's, but I think cozy fans of any age will enjoy this. After all, there is just something about that sisterly bond that transcends age, race and economic status. And Ms. George captures it beautifully.The setting is present day Birmingham, Alabama; no sexual content and no strong language"},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"I'm going to stretch my rating for this book from 3 stars up to 4 stars simply because it is another link in the chain for this outstanding series by author Anne George. For my tastes this mystery was not anywhere as good as the previous two novels. This one seemed to have to stretch credibility a little too far to make the mystery work for me but I still really enjoyed the book.This is the third installment in the Southern Sisters mystery series and involves Patricia Anne (the recently retired school teacher)and her sister Mary Alice (a widow three times over) in the world of genealogy. The day after the sumptious wedding of Mary Alice's daughter the two sisters set out to entertain the bridegroom's cousin. They are completely at a loss as to why Meg Bryan would commit suicide (especially after such a lovely lunch!) and in that particular way too. From this point on Paticia Anne becomes more and more involved in the \\"dog-eat-dog\\" world of professional genealogists.I'm afraid that serious mystery solvers will howl with disbelief over how this mystery is constructed. It could, and should, have been over just as soon as it began. That's where my tendency to give a 3 star rating for this book came from. It is not a good mystery. It is not even credible that it could have happened the way it is constructed. Then, to add insult to injury, the author didn't have enough characters in the story so the guilty party and the true situation was always evident. But, and this is the redeeming part which qualified this book for 4 stars from me, the story is just so darn nice that points are added for just plain goodness.I'm glad to say that all of my favorite characters are back from the previous books because these folks have now become \\"family\\". It just wouldn't be right not to include a shopping trip to the Big, Bold and Beautiful Shoppe to see Bonnie Blue. Patricia Anne and Fred's daughter Haley has started dating and seems to be coping better with the death of her husband. And the dialogue between Mary Alice, Patricia Anne and Fred as the wedding ceremony was about to begin is so realistic that I think I've actually been there. The characters are warm, genuine and funny as all getout. Plan to buy all eight of these books because they are completely addictive and how could you ever read just one? I drove through Birmingham last week on the way to visit relatives and almost broke my neck trying to spot familiar places. It's that kind of series, very realistic and personal."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed all her books just wish there had been more.

I loved the main characters and their interactions (they really reminded me of friends/relatives I knew growing up in the South). I will definitely keep reading the series, as other reviews indicate the rest of the series is even better.The mystery itself wasn't fantastic (though not nearly as bad as some I have read). It wrapped up a bit quickly/dully, but overall the book was quite enjoyable and worth a read."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"\\"Murder Runs in the Family\\" by Anne George is the third in the Southern Sisters series by this author. There are a total of eight books in the series and the author passed away in March 2001, so there will be no more to come. I found out about this series through a cozy mystery discussion board here on Amazon and the opinions were unanimous that this was a group of books I needed to try.Set in Birmingham, Alabama, the primary characters are two sisters of a certain age (Patricia Anne and Mary Alice) who are as different as night and day yet manage to get along quite well when not irritating each other to death. They are different temperaments, different sizes, and have taken drastically different paths in their lives. Mary Alice has buried her third, rich husband and is on the lookout for number four. Patrician Anne has been married to Fred for forty years and the marriage is a good one with sparks still flying. The banter between these two is what makes this series stand out and as you get to know the characters throughout the books, you appreciate the humor even more.This installment starts with Mary Alice's daughter, Debbie, getting married to Henry and then taking off on their honeymoon to Gatlinburg. The family/friends that attend the wedding form the foundation of this story as one of them appears to commit suicide right after lunching with the two sisters. A vivacious genealogist who is full of life and interest s doesn't appear to be a prime candidate for taking a dive from the Birmingham courthouse building - especially since she is afraid of heights. Was it suicide? Did someone push her? What reason could their possibly be for someone wanting her dead? Patricia Ann and Mary Alice find themselves caught up in the intrigue as they go about their everyday lives.These are definitely \\"cozies\\" and have so many of the ingredients necessary to fit that genre: strong sense of place, emphasis in character interaction, and the sense of absurdity of two women in their 60s finding themselves involved with another dead body. The murder is a tad weaker this time out, but the humor and laughter generated by these two wacky women more than make up for any lack it. Fun, light, and enjoyable. Start at the beginning and work your way through - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"These books are great.

I laugh so hard I cry (and my husband thinks I've lost it!).I enjoy the reparte between the sisters. They are so much fun!"},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"They say that crab fishing is the most dangerous job on earth and that is probably true. On the other hand one would think that being a professional genealogist would be one of the safest jobs on earth. After all, what could happen to a genealogist? Maybe a paper cut or two and a pair of really strained eyes but real danger would seem to be out of the question. But apparently there are pitfalls that can put the poor genealogist in harms way. Say for example you are doing a family tree for a lady in Birmingham Alabama who is seeking membership in the United Daughters of the Confederacy and you find that she is descended from General Sherman of all people. Did she jump or was she pushed? That is the question that my favorite pair of Southern sisters must answer when a genealogist cousin of Mary Alice's new son-in-law does a swan dive from a tenth floor window of the courthouse. The police call it a suicide but Mouse doesn't think so.Mary Alice (Sister) and Patricia Anne (Mouse) are a pair of sisters who are about as different as different can be and they keep getting sucked into deadly mysteries. There always seems to be a former student of retired teacher Patricia Anne involved in these mysteries and this book makes no exception. Both Mouse's husband Fred and Sister think that Patricia Anne must have taught everybody in Birmingham because no matter where they go a former student shows up. This time the former student shows up later than usual however and the sisters are not drawn into the mystery by the involvement of Mouse's former pupil, as has been the case before. This time the two have just had lunch with the victim before she takes her leap and their curiosity is naturally peaked. Especially when a stripper finds the naked body of the victim's ex-husband with an extra eye socket in his head.As with most mysteries of this type the plot is not overly deep and it takes several detours along the way. The hilarious interaction between the sisters however more than makes up for the wandering plot and the dialogue between the characters is about the most well written and imaginative I have ever come across. Before you have read much at all you will feel like you have known these two Southern ladies all of your life and you will love them like the bickering aunts that you may or may not have had. When one of them gets herself into an extremely dangerous situation near the end of the book your adrenaline will start to pump as you wonder if the other sister will in Mighty Mouse fashion arrive just in time to save the day. This story has a little suspense, a little sibling conflict and two hundred and fifty pound Mary Alice in a hot tub with her ninety-year-old boyfriend. What more could anybody wish for in a nice cozy mystery?"},{"Title":"Murder Runs in the Family: A Southern Sisters Mystery","review":"Another wonderful weekend spent with Sister, Mouse, Fred, and their neighbors and family.

I read all eight books over Christmas break, and I enjoyed every minute of the sassy southern sisters! Granted, I do have a few things in common with Mary Alice and Patricia Ann: I'm a woman, I'm from the south (Biloxi, MS), I have a sister, and I'm a teacher. I think this series can be enjoyed by all women though, don't let the fact that they are in their 60's turn you away like it almost did myself. I \\"lol'd\\" quite a few times and found myself able to relate to these ladies and I'm only 24. I would like to warn readers of a few things. While I'm not positive when the books were written, I know that 9/11 hadn't happened yet, people were still learning how to use email (especially the older people in these books), cell phone we're not common, Delchamps was still a store, an people still had \\"car phones\\" and answering machines.

It is not flashy, and will probably not produce the hype of many trendy books on church life, but it discusses really profound practices and principles. Rather than a one size fits all appraoch, Vennard talks about the general principles that may look very different in different congregations.She talks about the importance of being a safe church so that people can pray together. She also offers a wonderful description of different forms of prayer, and offers very practicle advice about how to do the different forms. She offers some very personal stories about teaching prayer, and with great vulnerability, encourgages others to be vunerable as well."},{"Title":"A Praying Congregation: The Art of Teaching Spiritual Practice","review":"Prayer is often named as an essential spiritual practice, at the heart of religious life in many traditions. Yet many people who participate in religious congregations are uncertain how to pray, except in the ritualized forms of worship services, table grace, and other ways of \\"saying prayers.\\" In this powerful and instructive work, Jane Vennard teaches the reader how prayer can be a basic part of the spiritual practice of individuals and communities.The work begins with chapters which speak to the importance of creating safe environments for prayer, learning to listen to God, each other and ourselves, and examining our beliefs about prayer and our images of God with whom we are in relation. With these in mind, the book continues to discuss the many forms of prayer and offer practical guidance to those with responsibility as teachers of prayer.Vennard's 40 years of teaching experience shines through the very carefully crafted suggested activities found throughout the book. Using them will help readers discover their own ways of prayer and share in shaping the prayer life of their communities.I recommend this work as a very helpful resource, especially for congregational leaders who want to help develop a praying congregation."},{"Title":"A Praying Congregation: The Art of Teaching Spiritual Practice","review":"Want to learn the art of teaching spiritual practice? Jane Vennard has created a book designed to assist leaders in teaching their congregations the art of prayer.A Praying Congregation includes practical tips for group study as well as Vennard's personal journey through prayer.You'll read about how to create a safe environment in which people can talk about prayer: their stereotypes, fears and personal experiences. You'll learn how to listen respectfully even if you don't agree with another opinion.Later in the book, Vennard unpacks different beliefs on prayer and how our image of God skews our prayer times.Finally she dives into the many types of prayer: Intercessory, Body, Musical Centering and more.There was only one area in this book that raised a red flag of worry. Vennard believes in Panentheism. This is where one believes God is with us as well as beyond us, that He empowers us rather than is all powerful. She goes into more detail in the book, but I was left scratching my head as to what I believe about God and His involvement in answering prayer.This book was provided for review by The Alban Institute."},{"Title":"A Praying Congregation: The Art of Teaching Spiritual Practice","review":"this is a good read on how to introduce spiritual practices in your life and congregation"},{"Title":"A Praying Congregation: The Art of Teaching Spiritual Practice","review":"This book is a treasure for those wanting to help others, and themselves understand prayer - truly, from our inmost being. Vennard teaches (and she is a good teacher) how to discover, embrace and release some of our definitions of prayer and experience communion with our Lord in prayer - in the way that works for each of us. We are all created with special relationship with our Creator, and the way we interact will honor our uniqueness.A great tool, a great blessing for those who feel called to lead others in a journey to prayer. Don't let the price stop you - this is a gem in a paperback cover, and you will not regret the investment."},{"Title":"A Praying Congregation: The Art of Teaching Spiritual Practice","review":"Good clear writing.

His presentation is easy to follow and the beginner will find it very manageable. It is a short book that new Christians or Christians approaching apologetics (the rational defence of Christianity) for the first time, will find useful.Little's methodology is good as well. His dispels presuppositions that a priori prevent one from even considering Christianity. Little also has some ability to come up with memorable epigrams (though he is not as good at this as G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis are, in my opinion).Little covers the following questions: Is Christianity Rational? Is There a God? Is Christ God? Did Christ Rise from the Dead? Is the Bible God's Word? Are the Bible Documents Reliable? Does Archaeology Verify Scripture? Are Miracles Possible? Do Science &amp; Scripture Agree? Why Does God Allow Suffering &amp; Evil? Does Christianity Differ from Other World Religions?Is Christian Experience Valid?In a book that is only 171 pages in length (excluding study questions), Little covers each topic quite quickly. Thankfully, he includes a &quot;For Further Reading,&quot; section at the end of every chapter. Little's section on Science &amp; Scripture was good as well (as one might expect, he covers the issue of origins). Little is careful to define terms (i.e. micro-evolution vs. macro-evolution) and I think he wisely notes that science is constantly changing (whereas the Bible is static), so one must be cautious not to absolutely weld contemporary scientific theories to the Bible.The section on Christianity and other religions was mediocre. However, most Christian apologetic materials that read have suffered from the same problem. The standard approaches usually starts with a few thoughts on the nature of truth (especially the logical law of non-contradiction), then assert and prove the deity of Christ and then assume all other religions fall. While I see that this approach definitely works, I think it would helpful to interact with other religions and analyze them at a deep level. Anyway, I am demanding too much from a popular level book here. Little discussed (in 3-5 paragraphs each!) Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam and pointed some of their beliefs and the difficulties associated with them.The nature of Christian experience is not a philosophical issue in the same way that the issue of miracles are, so the question must be approached differently. Little's explanation that Christian experience is based on historical facts (the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ) provides the context for understanding Christian experience.Little ends with a challenge to personally commit oneself to Christianity.The extensive study questions (about 10 per chapter) at the end of the book may be useful if one wanted to use the book as a study tool for a Bible Study group or something similar.I would recommend this book as an introduction to the defence of Christianity or as a short review for old hands. However, the experienced reader may want deeper works to digest. Two good books for more advanced study: Reasonable Faith by William Lane Craig and Scaling the Secular City by J.P. Moreland."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"My wife asked me to read this book to see if it was any good- so I did. Like most reviewers, I enjoyed this book despite its simplicity. It is pretty short, easy to follow, and worth the time spent reading it. I was somewhat familiar with certain sections of the book, but enjoyed the pragmatic way that Paul Little presents the Christian view to the reader.The context for the book is that Paul Little wanted to provide answers to the 12 most common questions he received when discussing Christianity on college campuses. He fulfills his purpose, and provides many references, and additional materials to research if you want to go deeper into any particular subject.You will most likely not be interested in all 12 topics discussed, but it makes sense that most Christians should have some familiarity with these questions, and the basic answers provided in this book. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick introduction to apologetics, or different ways to answer the questions that may arise as you share your faith with others."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"For the Christian who is scared of &quot;apologetics&quot; because he thinks it means he has to &quot;apologize,&quot; here's a book that doesn't get too technical but has plenty of good information about the defense of the faith. So often Christians don't have adequate answers to give to those who ask of them, as 1 Peter 3:15-16 commands, and so a book like this that is so readable and understandable can provide some ammunition the next time the skeptic questions the faith. Included at the end of each chapter are questions that can be used in a group or individual study."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"I think that this book is a must have for any Christian, and also a great book to give to believers and potential believers (everyone else).The book really does a great job preparing a Christian for knowledgably witnessing to people.

The chapters are organised according to questions that unbelievers often ask. The chapters are easy to read and they present the facts in a concise, intelligent, and convincing way. This book helped me realise how little I know, for example about the historical evidence for Jesus, and I found myself wanting to memorize portions of the book. I have been memorizing parts of this book, and I have been reading it over and over. I recommend it to all believers who need an introduction to apologetics."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"Have taught Bible Studies and Sunday School classes from this book 4 times over the course of 20 years. It's always the most popular study. Deepens understanding of the Christian faith tremendously. Enjoyable reading and generates lots of discussion."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"This book was written in simple language, so it's easy to read. It is full of support from Bible verses and outside sources (archaeology, famous quotes, etc.). Paul E. Little is reminiscent of C.S. Lewis because both of them show that you don't have sacrifice science and rationality for Christianity. I've read a couple other apologetics books (The Case for Christ and Basic Christianity), and they don't come close!"},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"Let me begin by saying that Mr. Little's original edition, published in 1967, had a positive influence upon me. I read his book in 1974, and it was the first apologetic book I remember reading. For that, I am thankful.However, I recently (January 2009) purchased a copy, published by Victor, edited by Craig Bubeck, 5th edition, dated 2003. Despite my nostalgia for the old \\"Jesus freak\\" days, I must offer some criticisms of this book.--Chapter 5: \\"Is the Bible God's Word?\\" says,\\"The earliest book (in the bible) was first authored about 1100 BC.\\"If one accepts the chronology given by the bible itself, Moses lived circa 1450 BC. Therefore, Little is off by 350 years.--Chapter 6: \\"Are the Bible Documents Reliable?\\"This book states, \\"The Roman Catholic Church includes the books of the Apocrypha since the Council of Trent in 1546.\\"This is rather disingenuous of the author, since the Catholic Church, along with the Orthodox churches, have always considered the so-called apocryphal books (known formally as \\"Deutero-canonical\\") as part of the received canon, at least since the early 5th Century AD.The following page of the book states, \\"The church Council of Jamnia in AD 90, held informal discussions about the canon.\\"The problem with this, of course, is that the meeting in Jamnia was held by JEWS, not Christians!On the same page, is written, \\"Later on, in Reformation times, the Roman Catholic Church at the Council of Trent elevated the Apocrypha to canonical status.\\"Again, WRONG!The same Catholic Councils at Hippo (north Africa) in 393, at Carthage in 397, and again at Carthage in 419 AD all affirmed the canonical status of both the Old & New Testaments as the Catholic Church has today. These councils submitted their decisions to--guess who!?--the pope, who agreed with their findings. These local councils (they were not ecumenical councils of the Church) settled the question of the canon of scripture for more than 1,000 years, until the Reformation created the need for a final word on the WORD.For a very brief summation on the canon of scripture, please seehttp://www.catholicapologetics.org/apo30700.htmLet me wrap up with 2 particular & glaring errors in the same chapter.The book reads, \\"The twenty-NINE books in the New Testament...\\"I could hardly believe my eyes on this. Dear reader, pick up any New Testament & count for yourself: there are exactly twenty-SEVEN books in the NT.The book then reads, \\"In a letter by Athanasius in AD 367 he distinguishes between works in the canon....In the same year the final canon was fixed by a decision of a church council held at Carthage.\\"This type of error has to be due to a very sloppy editor. Athanasius indeed wrote a Paschal-tide letter to the churches in his bishopric in the year 367 AD. However, the council to which the book refers did NOT occur the same year. It occurred exactly 30 years LATER, in 397 AD.My suggestion is that this book be given a major revision, correct the historical errors, and toss out the false & anti-Catholic statements. It would then be more worthy of the praise given to it by Billy Graham, Josh McDowell & Bill Hybels.If the glaring mistakes are edited out of this book, I will be happy to revise my review from 1 star to 4 stars. The rest of the book was a pleasure to reread.---John Paul, an old \\"Jesus freak\\" in Oklahoma City"},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"\\"Know Why You Believe\\" is a simplistic, fast paced, and easy to follow book that is a great starting point for Christian apologetics. In it, Paul Little discusses several key points of Christianity, such as the rationality of God, and conflicts between science and Scripture. He uses logical and easily followed arguments in his defense of the Christian faith.The book is very well organized and Little does an exceptional job at defending Christianity at its core. He focuses on the most common questions he received while discussing Christianity at college campuses and they shape an excellent argument. Though it is a relatively short and basic book, Little effectively makes his points and includes many references to additional studies of each of the 12 major arguments in the book."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"The book came in a very timely manner. The book came in very good condition, and as the product review stated. I was very pleased with this product and highly advise others to use this seller!!"},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"I really can't rate this item, as it was purchased as a gift (by request of the giftee.) But, it was shipped promptly, packed properly, and received in great condition as promised."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"As Little notes on page 1 - \\"Don't Kiss Your Brains Goodbye\\". I agree, look elsewhere for credible information on Christian theology, science, and rational thought.My disappointment with the quality of this book (2008 edition) was second only to the disappointment in finding that it was being used as an introductory study for Christians. There are many more reputable text, the foremost being scripture itself. If Little's apologetic theology is to be used as introduction material to Christianity it should be done with caution and in the context of broader Christian history, critical thought, and an appreciation for alternative scriptural interpretation.The first clue to the dubiousness of this text is contained at the end of the book's first chapter. Another book by Philip Johnson, considered the father of the anti-evolution's wedge strategy and a key figure at the Discovery Institute, is suggested for further reading on page 28. The uninformed reader may assume Little is endorsing Johnson's book. Unfortunately Little died 20 years before the publication of the recommended book! Acceptance of much of the rest of Little's arguments demands the same level unconventional logic.The begging question is \\"Why after 42 years and decades after Little's death is his book being promoted?\\" A little research revealed why Little's misrepresentations of science continue to be propagated. As it turns out J.P. Moreland (see his opening remarks on the very first page of the book), was a founding member of a group that launched the Intelligent Design (ID) \\"Wedge Strategy\\" at the Discovery Institute, based in Seattle. This concept, as it is currently known today, was put forth during the 1990's with the primary objective of overthrowing \\"materialism and its cultural legacy\\" (i.e. code for evolution theory). The resources, provided below, expose the hypocrisy of ID. It appears that Little's book has been, to at least some degree, co-opted by the proponents of ID since it conforms nicely to the \\"ID Wedge Strategy\\". Again, this is confirmed on page 28 where Philip Johnson's 1995 publication is recommended. Amazingly, Johnson and the \\"ID movement\\" have abandoned its Christian roots and now sit in a no man's land squarely between science and theology with absolutely no value to either - an idol in any sense of the term.Given the advertising on the front cover I was disappointed by the lack of both accuracy and scholarship of \\"Know Why You Believe\\". Other reviews have noted the historical errors in the book, so I won't revisit them here. In a contemporary context, Little's distortions of higher education and the scientific method do a disservice to contemporary Christians grappling with faith issues in an environment of an unprecedented explosion in scientific knowledge and access to information. Instead of providing practical approaches to dealing with such issues this book focuses on attacking science and education in an attempt to validate apologetic theology, driving a wedge between the two and propagating falsehoods such as the following:* Science is inherently anti-religious and atheistic - \\"The scientist has faith in the scientific method...\\" (pg 16) and \\"Scientists avoided the idea that time had a beginning or an end since it suggested divine intervention\\" (pg 38). Neither claim is relevant to the validity or veracity of the scientific method. These claims are made solely to prop up an apologetic position. In a similar way he equates science with atheism. Little's anti-evolution agenda hits its stride around pages 32-36 where he invokes invalid statistical arguments to dismiss evolution. This analysis is just an example of the sloppy thinking promoted by the book. It should be noted that Little had no scientific training nor did he provide adequate references for his positions. There is no basis his conclusions yet this argument is routinely parroted by anti-evolutionists. This is a startling argument given one of the premises of the book, \\"Don't Kiss Your Brains Goodbye !\\". Clearly, Little nor the contemporary advocates of this book understand the theory of evolution or its underlying principles.* Confusing the concept of a hypothesis (a guess formulated to be tested with existing theories) with a scientific theory (a validated working model of the world that continues to undergo validation until it is improved upon). A good example of this misuse is the way Little uses the word interchangeably on pages 64 and 65. He does this again on page 85. This aligns the text with the discredited \\"its only a theory\\" argument against evolution.* Confusing a fact with a scientific theory. Scientific theories are more useful than individual facts because they encompass many facts to provide a model that has predictive value.* Little uses a common, yet irrational, technique for attacking science which is to attribute the non-scientific comments of scientists to \\"science\\" in order to undermine science and place his views on the same rational footing. Clearly scientists make faith statements that are beyond rational scientific proof. There is no basis for asserting that science is a faith.In summary, there are many better choices of books for readers interested in Christian theology, science, and rational thought.A few resources on the contemporary issues raised in Little's book:* Intelligent Design on Trial, PBS NOVA 2 hour special.* The Collapse of Intelligent Design, Dr. Ken Miller, available on Youtube as a 117 min. video.* Creationism's Trojan Horse by Barbara Forrest and Paul Gross (2004)* Monkey Girl: Evolution, Education, Religion, and the Battle for America's Soul by Edward Hume (Pulitzer prize winner).* Tammy Kitzmiller v.

I'ts obvious that his bible interpretation is a literalist,inerrant view most compatible with conservative evangelicism or fundamentalism. As such it repeatedly leaves itself open to attack of the historicity of certain events in the bible.The worst section of the book is clearly the one on science and religion. To imply that the age of the earth is a question still open because of uncertainties in geology is just intellectuallydishonest. There was good evidence through geology about the old nature of the earth long before even the first edition of this book came out.As well there has been evidence found about transitional life forms in fossils (nowhere complete yet I will admit).When you see that he is quoting Michael Behe and Hugh Ross you know well, that just about does the chapter in. Even honest christian scientists dismiss much of the ideas of those two.Bottomline: there's better than this to read out there."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"This is a book I've had in my personal library for 25 years.

There are more recent books on the subject, but this is so \\"readable.\\""},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"'Know Why You Believe' is an excellent survey of Christian apologetics (the defense of the faith).Originally written about 40 years ago by Paul Little, this book has been updated by the author's widow to include several newer scientific and other discoveries that add to the case.This is simple enough for any apologetics novice to grasp, yet it is still full of great information. There is solid scientific and archeological evidence to bolster the case for Christianity.The book focuses on twelve areas of frequently asked questions. Some of those include the following: Is there a God?, Is Christ God?, Did Jesus Rise From the Dead?, Is the Bible reliable?, and Is the Bible God's word? It also explores several other areas of frequent questioning including the possibility of miracles, the problem of evil and suffering, and the comparison of Christianity to other religions. Each of these areas as well as several others are given a solid look.As Christians are commanded to love God 'with all your mind', it is essential for believers to thoroughly examine these areas and learn about the evidence for each.Some other areas that are reviewed include the role of faith (in many facets of everyday life), the limits of scientific proofs in many areas, and the role of presuppositions by everyone on all sides of the issues.There is much more that I could discuss about this volume. Suffice it to say that it is an excellent resource that should be read by all Christians as well as those who are seekers. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"I have become more interested in apologetics and being able to explain why I believe what I do.

It contains great information in an easy-to-read style. Although a bit old, it has relevant information for the believer and the sceptic alike. I particularly enjoyed the chapter dealing with the resurrection. The worst chapter was the one dealing with science. In this chapter, Little doesn't really offer any information as to what the Christian should believe, but rather he only lists the various views of the day. I believe that Little didn't want to scare off the audience by offering only one view of how science and scripture relate, but the end result is a bit weak in my opinion.However, I think this book deserves four stars for some excellent chapters dealing with the Christian faith. I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"Great book. Good information.

It contains an answer to many of the classic questions posed by those who challenge Christianity. For the most part, the book seemed well researched and scholarly.The thing I liked least about it was the anti-Catholic (and Orthodox) bias. The section which discusses the old Testament canon is just plain wrong when it says that the Catholic Church added the deuterocanonical books (&quot;apocrypha&quot;) to the bible in the Council of Trent.Also, at the end when it contrasts Christianity to other religions, it totally neglects the Catholic and Orthodox views of salvation as a process. It takes the view of salvation held by some Protestant sects, the view of eternal security, and presents this view as if it was the view of all Christians.Despite these faults, I would recommend the book for any Christian who is interested in apologetics or for anyone who has doubts about his/her Christian faith."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"The book arrived in great condition.

My criticisms of this book are derived not from an anti-Christian perspective, but from a practical pedagogical perspective. With that said, I am not trying to disprove any of Little's statements on Christian faith that he derives from his readings of the Bible. But I do have some criticisms of this book. My criticisms against this book should assist the prospective reader in selecting (or not selecting this book).-Simplistic style. This is not a college level book, despite what one review states. It is written at the seventh or eighth grade level. If you read at the college level, this is a Dick & Jane book. Sometimes it is like reading a PowerPoint presentation. It is basic and not challenging.-Slow pace. The pace of this book is very slow. Part of what makes this a slow read is the book's repetitious style. Little keeps making his point over and over. After a while, you get the point and no longer have to have it made again.-Errors (or over-simplification). For example, Little refers to a Greek Empire (page 12). There was never one. With that said, it is clear he is referring to the \`Greek' linguistic and cultural hegemony created in the western Mediterranean by Alexander the Great's conquests.-Academic credentials. Little holds an MBA and is not a theologian. He holds no advanced degrees in that field. The method by which Little postulates his arguments resembles those made by Fundamentalist - a lot on what the Bible says and little on historical context or liturgical perspective. In other words, his sources are limited and it shows. And, he tends to make circular arguments.With all of this said, I do consider this to be fine book for a novice to Christianity. The basics are here, without any complications. However, it is not illuminating. So if you are looking for a place to start, this might be it. However, don't stop here - this is way too basic."},{"Title":"Know why you believe","review":"I was very pleased! Received the order before time quoted. Book was in perfect condition.

A major struggle ensues between governments who wish to obtain the Time Ocular and the archeologists who found it. Beginning in the region of the middle east, where the Great Pyramid was built, the story moves to Chicago, Illinois, and then Sedona, Arizona, where it is believed by many that the famous Bell Rock is one of the oldest surviving remnants of another ancient pyramid, built long before civilization as we know it ever thrived.The story is woven around the theory of one of the solar systems most profound and catastrophic events, when Jupiter was struck by a massive comet that ripped a chuck of the great planet from its body and sent it into orbit around the Sun between the Earth and Mercury, forming the newest planet, Venus.It describes the destruction of the surface of Mars as the newly formed planet passed, bombarding Mars with mountain sized pieces of itself and explaining why that planet suddenly died and how some of Mars' survivors managed to escape and make Earth their home.Does that sound anything like what the Home Invaders, a book about a thief, would be about.

In 1975 the book, almost completely unchanged except for a few words and phrases, was published by a relatively new publishing company in Chicago.Subsequently, in 1981 Michael Mann aquired it and produced the film.To this day, credit for the work has not yet been rightfully attributed to Wolfe, and new linguist forensic efforts are currently being applied to compare the writer's unique style.Signature phrases in the plagiarized version, The Home Invaders, were overlooked and remain [even in the film] and prove beyond a shadow of doubt. that Joe Wolfe is the real author."},{"Title":"Help, My Little Girl's Growing Up: Guiding Your Daughter Through Her Physical and Emotional Changes","review":"As a small town family doctor I sometimes get the feeling that 'adolescence' and 'tragedy' are linked words.

My Little Girl's Growing Up by Annette SmithOverall this is a good book with good information for a mother whose daughter is heading into the preteen years. Author Annette Smith gives some good tips on encouraging mothers to let their daughters discover and appreciate their own individuality. Smith warns that this involves mom letting go or holding back certain feelings and opinions--as long as the daughter is safe. Some of these moments include choosing an activity, a hobby, an outfit, and even goals. The interactive suggestions at the end of the chapters can be helpful.However, I found this book a little long on anecdotes (perhaps Smith prefers writing fiction over nonfiction?). Yes, there are many helpful examples; but there were times when I found the stories didn't quite fit. A few stories I felt were left unresolved. Such as the time when Jennifer and Tracy had a fight, Smith does not say what the fight was about, how it was resolved or could have been resolved. In fact she says, \\"If their mothers knew what I know, they would ... leave well enough alone and be thankful for the way it all happened.\\" Really? Couldn't you at least tell us in general terms what the fight was about? How are we supposed to apply this situation to our own lives? Or the time when Jacie turned twelve and her father quit taking her on errands--she still carries the scars but no solution to this problem is offered by the author. A few times, Smith implies that mothers are the experts on their daughter's changes and should explain them to the husbands. I think every daughter grows up differently (different parents, different time period, different circumstances) and there may be times when mom is not the expert and may have no clue. It should not be assumed that fathers are clueless when it comes to raising daughters, especially if he grew up with a good mother and at least one sister.I did like the Christian perspective and I do plan on referring back to the book.

Ishi was the last of his people and he was the last \\"Wild Indian\\" in America. Anthropologists throughout America wanted to learn as much as they could from this wild man and he was soon living and working (as a janitor) at the University of California, Berkeley. Having no immunities to most disease that we are used to, he spent much time in a nearby hospital where Saxton Pope was a teacher. Anyone who has ever learned of the hardships of Ishi's life can't help but remember this fascinating historical figure.This book however, is not about Ishi although his teachings and skill are an important part of what you will read. This book is about what the title says \\"Hunting with the bow and arrow\\". Saxton Pope learned to use a bow from Ishi and carried the love of bow hunting for the rest of his life. This book covers everything from making your first bow to killing your first Grizzly in a pleasant and easy to read style that keeps you reading and wanting more. You can and will learn secrets that you would have never thought of , secrets that before Ishi, had been so completely forgotten that Dr. Pope had to reintroduce the techniques to other Native American Tribes.I am not a hunter, I have never used a bow but I have a great love of the outdoors and I loved every moment of this book. I feel like I have learned enough to supply food for myself and my family if the need arises. Along with the wealth of information I gained by reading Hunting with the bow and arrow, I feel that I have also stood witness to a wonderful adventure and lived through the excitement of the hunt.Even though, once again, there are no diagrams or photos with the Kindle edition, Hunting with the Bow and Arrow will never be removed from my Kindle."},{"Title":"Hunting with the bow and arrow","review":"I found this book to be informative and deeply intresting.

(Alas, I'm not kidding).Bolero is probably the best in the long-running series, and, happily, makes an excellent stand-alone mystery.When a series of horrific murders begins to pick off some of New York's more attractive residents, Ed Noon is called in to track down the 'loony' serial killer. As a result, he's drawn into the seemy underbelly of New York's nightclub scene.As a warning, Bedroom Bolero comes from a more traditional time, and not written for today's enlightened modern readers. Ed Noon is fairly liberal in his views, but, even then, his views on both race relations and homosexuality can be pretty shocking. Similarly, the early 'Goths' don't come out well at all - one of the foils in Bedroom Bolero is an oddly necromantic nightclub performer (an early Elvira type), and she's hilariously awful.Those flaws (hopefully they're just seen as ignorant and amusing) aside, the mystery is actually very good. Despite some good clues (in hindsight, dang it!), the killer managed to surprise me. Fans of serial killer mysteries will also find this a quick and enjoyable read.Noon does some good detective work, and isn't shy about sharing his thought processes with the reader. Plus, as a solid genre novel, there are the typical assortment of wisecracks and curvy young women. Noon isn't the best of the era's detectives, but this undoubtedly his finest hour. -- PORNOKITSCH"},{"Title":"Cold Moon Honor","review":"From the moment the author introduced Tara Bartlett, I felt I knew this character.

While the story is almost 40 years old, most readers should be able to relate to the awkward romance of protagonist Jerry Payne, an 18-year-old introvert, and the free-spirited and eccentric Pookie Adams, an extraordinarily complex, if not lovable character.Jerry fatefully meets Pookie one afternoon at an Oklahoma bus stop, and both eventually embark on a year-long romance during their underclassmen years at neighboring universities in the east. While much of the youthful slang is dated by today's standards, readers will recognize the multiple college roommates, impulsive road trips, sweaty make-out pits and trashed hotel rooms. The early years of college life have been almost perfectly recreated by Nichols, and several situations should immediately strike a chord in most readers who have lived on a college campus.This thoroughly interesting, comic and even sad novel was first brought to my attention after seeing the 1969 film based upon it, \\"The Sterile Cuckoo,\\" starring a very young Liza Minnelli as Pookie. I was pleasantly surprised to see there were several notable differences between the novel and film. Pookie Adams is a far more tragic character in the film, filled with anger, insecurity and despair. Jerry Payne eventually pulls away from Pookie, unable to be her savior or her lifetime companion. There is an ominous, almost tragic tone to the film. Pookie's path is anything but certain.In the novel, the future seems rather bright for Pookie after the end of the relationship in a New York hotel room. The world is absolutely going to be her oyster. For Jerry Payne, his future has far more questions. He's an isolated introvert, who seems to come out of his shell thanks to the persistence of Pookie and, of course, the multiple parties and drinking games which are forced upon him by his colorful hodgepodge of roommates (an added note must be made about the correlation between the alcohol drinking and the disintergration of the romance). In Pookie's eyes, Jerry is slowly becoming one of the masses, much to her frustration, and rather than accept the fate of their doomed romance, she suggests a sucicide pact, perhaps as a way to capture their love and preserve it.It is appropriate that Pookie disappears within the mists of a train station in New York. If there is ever a place where the wildly creative and imaginative Pookie belongs, it's New York. She's probably still there today, in a Greenwich Village apartment, writing wildly enjoyable essays on smokers' rights and pro-abortion stances. The true tragedy, if anything, would have been Pookie and Jerry spending the rest of their lives together. It is apparent as the novel progresses, these two youthful spirits are moving in different directions of maturity, and eventually, what was a warm, intimate love affair, slowly begins to die.The universal and painful memories of first love have been alertly captured by Nichols, in this his debut novel. But his \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" is also a superb document on failed relationships, no matter the age or the time period."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"John Nichols made quite an impression with his first novel about a first life-altering love. Though written in 1965, it proves that even though times change, emotions and some situations don't.Jerry Payne was on his way to college when he meets Pookie Adams in the bus depot. She is a year younger - she's on her way back home to begin her senior year in high school - and her nonstop talking and outlook on life really irks him. They take one bus together to another stop and, sitting next to each other, start talking about everything and nothing at once. Suddenly, before Jerry knows it and not being able to stop it, he finds himself kissing Pookie.By the time his bus pulls away, taking him to college, Pookie realizes she never got his address (or name, for that matter!) and he shouts his information out the window. Jerry didn't think Pookie heard him but 17 letters reach him from September to Valentine's Day. His father asked him if he was running a forwarding service and to please give the woman his college address.While Pookie's letters were coming, Jerry got involved in college life - of the fraternity kind. His roommates were into the frat thing and Jerry at first wanted to show that he could be part of the crowd in a sophisticated way (with his guitar playing) but, in time, he fell into the swing of things like the rest of them. By the time Jerry and Pookie reunited (during her freshmen year of college, he having seen her picture in a college publication in the frat house's library and he and his buddies showing up at her sorority house uninvited and unwelcome), Jerry was the stereotypical frat guy - reeking of beer, plopped in a brother's jalopy (that was affectionately called \\"The Bitch\\"), and failing everything ... fast.It was during his sophomore year in college that he and Pookie really got together - Jerry slowly, and unknowingly at first, falling in love with Pookie through her letters. He would cut classes in the morning to wait for her letters, he couldn't wait to meet her for houseparties and weekend get togethers.When he was in danger of failing school, he begged the academic powers that be for another chance and was granted a stay. He vowed to work through the spring break to pull himself together. During this time, he and Pookie lived together at the frat house and fell even deeper in love.When Jerry, Pookie, and a few friends were partying in the college cemetery in his junior year, they were in the middle of a toast on top of a grave marker when the dead woman's husband - one of the most respected professors of the university - came upon the scene, flowers dropped to his side, and simply walked away (probably too hurt for words). This scene coming after all four of them were lying in the grass and Jerry just sensing that the magic had left his relationship with Pookie.After that incident, things were never quite the same between Jerry and Pookie. They drifted apart, without really knowing it. Towards the very end, they couldn't even agree on a suicide pact - how to do it, who was going to go first, etc. It seemed as though both of them were trying to hold on to the dead relationship for dear life but it got to the point where Pookie said, \\"It's all over, isn't it?\\"The book comes to an ending where you have to fill in the blanks (did Pookie commit suicide or not? Jerry didn't feel a need to know for sure) but it's the sort of ending life deals: You fall in love with someone whom you never thought you'd even remotely like in a million years, you have an intense relationship with them (physically and emotionally), and then, for unknown reasons, the magic disappears (almost overnight). What you found cute and lovable before becomes tiresome. Even so, you try to hold on but you can't. You feel the relationship is over but it's like no one ever gets around to formally ending it.In the end, the person falls into a special place in your heart and mind but you feel as if you'll spoil the memory of that time in your life by getting an update every now and again.Forty years later and love sure doesn't change its tune."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"In my mind, I will always remember Pookie. She has the spark and flare of a great character and Nichols should be commended for sharing her with us.The novel reads quickly; the pace is lively and rarely lags. The adventures of romance in college become a quintessential experience that, even if your own college experience was never quite like theirs (you don't have to be a drop-out pre-adolescent boy to enjoy The Adventures of Huck Finn), it still is a wonderful journey of a story."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"I'd like to recommend \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" for any of you, like me, who enjoy those kinds of coming-of-age/love stories like \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" \\"A Separate Peace,\\" and \\"Goodbye Columbus.\\" I had seen the movie of \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" years and years ago but can't remember anything except Liza Minneli wearing wide-rimmed glasses; I remember the song \\"Come Saturday Morning\\" better. For whatever reason, I thought that \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" could be one of those kinds of books that I look for. The front and back covers give it some great hype, and it really starts out interestingly with quiet, conservative Jerry Payne meeting absolutely loopy Pookie Adams. They fall in love, and the unconventional affair takes its course. Along with the comments on the back cover, I also think that a good part of \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" is \`hilarious and imaginative.' However, I didn't see much of Pookie \`helping Jerry leave behind the fun-seeking, beer-blasted fraternity man he has become as she teaches him to open his heart to her.\\" Because of that, the novel seems to lose something starting at about the halfway mark, but then it picks up at the end. It would have been better had it been about half the length it is. Even so, there's something in \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" that stays after reading it. It has something to do with Pookie Adams. Early in the book, the author writes about Pookie looking out the window on a winter day: \\"...And she felt immensely sorry for herself because she would go through her entire life shedding beautiful crystalline tears that would melt against the warm earth: and she knew that day she would always be unhappy.\\""},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"The Sterile Cuckoo is a real gem...

This is the autobiography of a college romance, and utterly fabulous"},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"I was actually looking for 'The Milagro Beanfield War', when I stumbled upon this little gem.

I felt as though I had LIVED it.John Nichols first book is a wonderful story of a college romance, from its awkward beginnings to its almost tragic end. And what falls in-between bounces between joy and sorrow, mixed with humor. From beer-soaked fraternity parties to sunny picnics in fields, Nichols captures love and the college experience as well as any author.It isn't an outstanding book. It won't go down as a modern classic. But it is very funny, and it is very realistic. Nichols greatest literary skill is his character development and interaction, and that skill is on display in this novel. I felt as though Nichols had been my roomate in college, and that he was writing about my own antics during those wonderful years. The characters seem all too familiar, and the the plot lines seem taken directly from my collegiate years.Just as homecoming trips to alma maters go by in a matter of days, so will this book. All the joys, sorrows and memories of anybody who has ever had a college romance will come back quickly to readers."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"&quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot;, by John Nichols, is a novel that relates the story of Pookie Adams and Jerry Payne, two young people that first met in the Oklahoma bus depot.

Their love affair involves them in an unforgettable journey that helps Jerry to stop being so methodical and shy, while the end of their relationship comes closer. This novel should be read by all those who had been in love, are in love or want to be in love, because &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot; captures the essence of what the first love is about and how sad is its end. Besides, it describes how love can change a person, doing extraordinary things on the person. Though the book mainly describes the love story between Jerry and Pookie, it also describes what being an adolescent means and, the long way we have to walk through life to discover who we really are."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"This book, although short and sweet, says a lot about a young man and his relationship with a free spirited young woman.

While constantly expressing their individuality, their dependency upon one shines through and guides the ill-fated couple towards first love. I related to Jerry and to his thoughts regarding the opposite sex from the beginning of the story, and found it interesting to see how the one person that was meant for him could change his views and leave the reader with a different character from which the novel began. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to re-examine their thoughts and feelings regarding relationships or love, or simply to anyone who wishes to read a wonderfully written story that captures the essence of college romance."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"The Sterile Cuckoo is a wonderful story of a college romance.

Since the book takes its course over the period of a couple of years, we see Jerry Payne, the protagonist, flourish into an outgoing and then mature individual. Furthermore, this novel captures the essence of what being a college student is all about. It is extremely easy to read, and it is great to share with someone. It will make for stimulating conversation and will elicit wonderful feelings that we have felt or may feel for some people in our lives. Many older people have said that this book is the ideal book of the college romance, I would have to agree. All in all, I give the book a 9.5.

It is a story that should be read by people who want to know or remember how college love was including fights, surprises, kissing, making out, parties, alcohol, and sex.

Jerry is characterized for being a changeable person, while Pookie is always obsessed with the love she had for him. I truly recommend \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" to anyone who enjoys romantic/comedy mixed novels. The best thing of this novel is that it contains many different characters , which can make you feel identified with them, especially if you are a college student. Don't think it twice, go ahead and choose this novel, you'll love it."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"I first read this book many years ago when I was in high school and I have to admit, as a romantic teenager (who had not yet come in contact with many of the college experiences portrayed in the book, including drinking binges, wild parties, and one's first red-hot sexual love affair) I didn't really \\"get it\\". Picking up the book again several decades and half a lifetime of experiences later, I \\"get it\\" better now. As this story appears to be set in the late 50s or very early 60s, Pookie Adams could be the mother (or perhaps the grandmother) of the emo, bespectacled \\"Ghost World\\" girls of the 90s and 00's. She ruminates on life and love to an extensive and bizarre degree; she is not conventionally physically beautiful, but with her quirky, forward ways, she still manages to capture the heart of the narrator, a rather ordinary, reserved young man named Jerry. If Pookie was in college today, she'd probably be buying her clothes at thrift stores and listening to indie rock singles while she scribbled her incisive, poetic and sometimes wacky thoughts into a notebook. By the end of the story, when Jerry and Pookie clash based on his obvious pursuit of boring normality - indeed, his lack of intellectualism and staunch pursuit of frat-guy drinking antics seem to make him the Boy Most Likely to Become Babbitt - you're rooting for Pookie all the way and wondering (as she herself does to some extent) what she ever saw in Jerry in the first place. It's clear that falling in love with Pookie was his most creative and outside-the-box action to date and that might be true for his entire life, and that whatever happens, he'll be remembering her for a long, long time.The book ends on a much more positive note than the film, which takes the strong, vibrant Pookie character and turns her into a lovesick, depressed stalker. I liked the book much better since it's very open-ended. You're free to imagine your own fate for Pookie and Jerry. I liked to think she ran off to San Francisco and probably became a professor of creative writing somewhere."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"You can tell Holden Caufield to go home and stop bitching and moaning. I'll take Pookie Adams any day. The book is quite a bit different from the film (which has virtues of its own - notably Liza Minnelli's heartbreaking performance); is it better? What do you think? (Yes, it's better). John Nichols has done a masterful job of drawing two characters just coming into flower - emotionally needy, confused, exhilerated, excited, horny, discovering sex, questioning the sincerity of their feelings for one another; it's truly an amazing piece of writing (especially as it was his debut). If you've never read it you're in for something special, and then pass it on to an adolescent in your life (boy or girl) - maybe they'll discover you don't have to be a vampire to feel \\"different\\" or \\"confused\\" or \\"special.\\""},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"The Sterile Cuckoo is a wonderful story of a college romance.

Over the course of the bus ride, Pookie, a rising high school senior, beguiles the somewhat reserved and quiet Jerry with her vast assortment of disjointed stories and observations--a quirky and low level seduction that culminates in her passionately kissing the surprized and unprepared Jerry. During Freshman year at his small New England college, Jerry's chief joy becomes that of receiving letters from the loquacious Pookie. Jerry's sophomore year begins with Pookie matriculating at a neighboring girl's school, as he settles into the perennial drinking and horsing around that appears to be the focus of life at his fraternity house.With Pookie and Jerry now in close proximity to one another, and with a large choice of venues for unsupervised assignations, ranging from rustic cabins to the frat house itself, a love affair inevitably ensues--and in due time their relationship is sexually consummated. After this first intimate contact, the floodgates are opened to a veritable honeymoon of energetic couplings, rendering Jerry nearly oblivious to his academic obligations. Missing a good many lectures due to the time and energy invested in a relationship infinitely more compelling than his arid college courses, Jerry soon finds himself on the verge of flunking out--a problem that he remedies by retreating to the frat house over the course of Spring break--although accompanied by a live-in Pookie. Despite the temptations of this entertaining cohabitation, Jerry does seem to be able to focus to his studies during the break. The academic year ends with Pookie joining Jerry's circle of frat-guy friends and their associated girlfriends. Jerry and Pookie then spend the summer far removed from one another living in their respective hometowns with their families (with Jerry in the Northeast and Pookie in the Midwest) while working at dull summer jobs. Letters are exchanged between the two over the course of the summer, setting the stage for their next year in college.It is at this point that the author is faced with the dilemma that confronts all writers of fiction: how to wrap up the story once all the pieces have been carefully placed on the chessboard and a few set piece opening gambits have been advanced. The author creates a few events that establish distance between the young lovers, or mark some turning point in their relationship. Being apart for the long summer could certainly have a negative impact on such a relationship. Pookie and Jerry indulge in cavorting with their drunken friends at a local cemetery--only to be discovered by an elderly professor visiting the grave of his beloved wife--the very grave that the sodden students have chosen as the site of their inebriated celebration. As the old man sadly turns away, the joy is seen to drain out of the young people's uncouth celebration--and, it is implied, from Pookie and Jerry's relationship. Other problems ensue. A drunken party at the frat house finds Jerry groping another girl from their entourage--who loudly decries his crude advances in Pookie's presence. Seeking a change of pace, Pookie and Jerry spend a few days in New York City at the end of the academic year. This visit, however, proves to be far from the romantic adventure that the two seek. Instead, they seem out of sorts and disinterested, a disinterest that oddly expresses itself as a transient suicide pact to be executed with a vast quantity of aspirin purchased from a drug store for this purpose. In the end, the two part company at Grand Central Station. Later, Jerry receives a letter from Pookie claiming that she is preparing to off herself using sleeping pills--a claim that Jerry thinks better not to investigate (by obtaining a copy of her hometown paper and seeking out her obituary)--instead, he decides to imagine her future as that as a successful artist, poet, or some other genre of creative individual.I have a different idea from that put forth by the author regarding the reason that Jerry and Pookie go their separate ways. I think that the central problem plaguing their relationship is that they have nothing in common. The reason that they have nothing in common, however, is not because they are so different. Instead, the problem is that neither Jerry nor Pookie are actually interested in anything. At the beginning of the book Jerry talks about his interest in insects and work as an intern under the supervision of adult professionals with some expertise in entomology. This interest soon disappears after entering college, never to be heard of again. As for Pookie, her various ramblings and pronouncements are vapid and lacking in substance. Her greatest passions seem to be the comic strips that her grandfather once mailed to her, and gunning down the crows that disturb her mornings with Jerry at the frat house. Really, even if the two had an interest in their hometown sports teams it would be refreshing, let alone the great philosophical issues of the day. In the end, both Pookie and Jerry are both boring, and bore themselves and one another. Towards the end of the book Pookie writes a poem lamenting \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\" which seems to be a sort of metaphor for their fruitless and meaningless relationship.One last observation that I will put forward is that of the era in which the story is set. The author was born in 1940. He would then have started college in the late 1950's. As I am a little more than ten years younger than the author, the slang used by the characters is somewhat familiar to me--and I recognize it as belonging to the decade preceding my own college days. Although this book was published in 1965, it is clear to me that the events of the novel reflect the world of 1958 or 1959."},{"Title":"THE STERILE CUCKOO.","review":"I found the Sterile Cuckoo very interesting novel where you can see al kinds of characters and maybe you can identify yourself with one of them.

Gives a brief history of Islam, the conduct and requirements of what being a muslim infers, and also how and what is expected in terms of prayers and behavior is required. There is also an brief introduction to Arabic text.This book will not make a convert probably of anyone who already has made up their mind on what they think about Islam. Nor is it a book that looks at too much concerning the controversy surrounding Islam's practical application throughout history. It is sort of a propaganda piece of course, but not one towards trying to convince the listener to become a Muslim. It paints Islam in a good light and makes one or two quips against other religions. But it is done in a rational and practical manner and reveals the practical nature of the religion.What I've learned from the book is that Islam is a religion not only of behavior, but also one of governance. I can see why it can appeal to many people because it addresses the major sins of life - lust, alcohol, social/economic inequity and to a lesser extent on food (which has roots probably in practical concerns with toxins, disease, and parasites). It gives people regiment and a routine and a purpose to their lives, and keeps them busy enough about remind themselves of their spirituality to keep society hopefully as moral and stable as possible. You could say that this system of religion/governance addresses a lot of the major problems in a society. Whether or not one agrees as to whether or not it is the right way of addressing the issues is another discussion entirely."},{"Title":"Introduction to Islam (Series - Centre culturel islamique, Paris)","review":"I strongly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in Islam and seeking for a right source to read.

Caught between her self-involved father and her mother, whom she has learned to disdain, Leah has to find herself outside her relations to her parents in order to finally become an adult. This doesn't sound like much fun, but the writing is so evocative and all the characters, even minor ones, are so real and so memorable that it is like looking into somebody else's life.I especially enjoyed the almost tactile sense of a New York City that is as past and gone is Edith Wharton's. This was an era when someone like Ed Bernstein, a fantastic scheming minor character, could find his family a rent-controlled apartment just by reading the newspaper. The characters are all basically Jewish working-class people whose sense of being New Yorkers is so profound that it is never expressed. This was a different city, perhaps less entertaining but definitely more accessible for the non-rich.It is surprising that the book didn't make more of a splash. Part of the reason is that it was published in 1964, just at the time when the world it described was beginning to change. Still, I would encourage all those interested in other people take a look at this novel."},{"Title":"Leah","review":"I found this book in my old bedroom while engaging in a hankering for fiction. It more than met my expectations, which had been somewhat blunted by a recent diet of newspaper articles and science fiction. The author not only handles words enticingly, in the manner of one who expects literacy of his readers; he adds such dimension to characters that one can no longer countenance the 2D variety that so often passes for adequacy in these times.

Capellanus' work may have been intended as a satirical reworking of Ovid's Ars Amatoria, or it might have been influenced by the Arabic views of love in The Dove's Neck-Ring by Ibn Hazm a Mozarabic writer of the 11th century. Whatever his intent, his work, The Art of Courtly Love, influenced the aristocracy's ideas of social relationships, and the portrayal of male-female roles in romantic literature, well into the Renaissance. In a series of conversational examples between men and women of various classes together with a list of rules of love, Capellanus draws distinctions between the relationship of marriage and the relations between true lovers. Within the context of courtly love the true lover is required to pay homage to and do the bidding of his ladylove above all else. True love according to Capellanus does not exist between husband and wife, but is a state sought by all outside of the marriage bed. He states, attributing the sentiment to \\"M., Countess of Champagne\\", that \\"Love cannot acknowledge any rights of his between husband and wife\\". This attitude is understandable in a society where marriages were contracted for position and fortune.In one of the sets of rules for lovers set forth by Capellanus he states that \\"No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons\\". This would justify romantic relationships of which women were otherwise deprived. Before modern times, love was rarely a factor in choosing a spouse, and yet it is perhaps the strongest force that drives mankind. Capellanus both acknowledges and rationalizes the power love holds over men and women alike. The path to true love is never easy, and the rules of courtly love would have it that where there is love there, too, is suffering. It is by his great distress that the beloved can see how greatly the lover loves. Although love that suffers chastely and from afar is held in esteem, Capellanus also says that kisses and embraces are \\"indications that love is to follow\\" and should not be overdone if the lover is not sincere. This seems to acknowledge the human need for sexual action to follow seduction. Appropriate action with gifts and flattery is described by Capellanus in his dialogs for seducing the beloved. Care must be taken in the choice of gifts, since by the rules of courtly love exchange of valuable objects debases the relationship and lovers may only accept those \\"little gifts\\" \\"useful for the care of the person\\" or \\"pleasing to look at\\" as long as there is no \\"avarice\\" involved. This rule led to the carrying by knights of tokens or \\"favors\\"--gifts of their ladies--in tournaments throughout the Middle Ages. Seduction has four steps according to Capellanus: first should come the offer of service (or if by a lady the giving of hope to the suitor), followed by the granting of kisses and the embrace--in which a couple may even lie down together nude, having no actual sexual congress, with no blame attached. If the final fourth step is taken, yielding to sexual relations, the lover is committed and can not withdraw from the relationship with honor for any less reason than a seriously dishonorable action on the part of his or her partner. These elements of courtly love appear again and again in literature of the Middle Ages from Chaucer's \\"Knight's Tale\\" to Malory's Morte D'Arthur.Perhaps the most interesting influence in Capellanus' life is that of Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen of England and wife to King Henry II. Eleanor was already instrumental in the production of early courtly romances, especially the Arthurian tales. Wace dedicated his \\"Brut\\" to her, Thomas of Britian wrote his \\"Tristram\\" at her instigation and Chretien de Troyes wrote his Lancelot romances from material given him by her daughter Marie. Eleanor's life reads much like one of these romances. Duchess of Aquitaine, she married Louis, the king of France, at a young age, and produced two daughters Marie and Alix. She met Henry II, six years her junior, before he became king of England and then divorced Louis, on a consanguinarity technicality, to marry him. The rumor was that she and Henry, like Lancelot and Guinevere, met secretly while she was still legally married to Louis. When Henry later tired of her she again took up regency of the Aquitaine for her son Richard, and with her daughter Marie held liberal and literary courts where troubadours sang and courtiers waited upon ladies. Together Eleanor and Marie set a standard of chivalrous manners that changed the behavior of all knighthood. As a pastime these highborn ladies held \\"courts of love\\" wherein they tested the behavior of lovers, by the standards set in Capellanus' treatise, vindicating those they found to be \\"true lovers\\" and pronouncing penances for those found lacking. If not for the influence of the strong minded Marie de Champagne and the formidable Eleanor--women who wanted more of love than the usual marriage of convenience--Capellanus might have been relegated to the obscurity of the Church's proscribed text list, and our standards of romance might be very different today."},{"Title":"The Art of Courtly Love (Revised Edition) (Records of Western Civilization Series)","review":"This is the sort of book you look for, not a scholarly book compiled from various sources and presented for a modern reader, but a treatise written at the time that Courtly Love was at its height in France. This book consists of three sections. The first has dialogues between men and women of different classes, which are of a man trying to reason with a woman for her love.In the book there are two nice stories, but the third section was the most suprprising. The first two sections summarize therules of love to a young man the author knows named Walter, but in the third he gives his own opinion about pursuing loveand women to the boy that gave what seemed like a light work the ending of a heavy and controversial commentary.I liked it, and you will especially as preparation to reading books of the era such as King Arthur.

Aside from being the premiere treatise on &quot;courtly love,&quot; there are interesting historical issues raised by this book.For example, in the section &quot;What persons are fit for love,&quot; Capellanus says that &quot;Age is a bar, because after the sixtieth year in a man and the fiftieth in a woman...passion cannot develop into love...&quot; The conventional wisdom holds that most people did not live much past 40 in those days. Evidently Capellanus ran across a few people in their 50s and 60s, in addition to his encounters with nuns. (You will have to read the book to find out more)"},{"Title":"The Art of Courtly Love (Revised Edition) (Records of Western Civilization Series)","review":"A series of dialogues between men and women of various social ranks concerning why love should be accepted or rejected, written during the Middle Ages. There are other bits, such as Courts of Love and long letters written to this or that person, but that's mostly it.I found it an interesting read. You hear a lot about &quot;courtly love&quot;, but nobody really talks about the underpinnings of the tradition. Since the writer was a monk, one truly wonders just what in the world he knows about love, but upon reading the dialogues, one becomes convinced that this isn't about love. It's about social behavior within a certain context, within a very narrow time frame within a very narrow part of Europe, one indulged in by a very narrow group of people. And yet when we think of the Middle Ages, we think of courtly love. There's a reason for that, and reading this book will help the introspective reader see why.The 5 stars were for how it stands as a primary source documenting the period. It is excellent in that regard. It does drag sometimes, and many of the dialogues are, indeed, repetitive-sounding. But that's how medieval documents WERE. They wanted to be sure the point got across, I think. I'm also half-convinced that the writer wasn't being entirely serious in some places. Again, he was a monk, and it's possible it was just an exercise in logic, as the forward to this book explains in good detail.I'm not sure I'd want to read this if I were just a casual reader. It won't give many hints about how to romance someone in OUR time period -- nowadays we like passion, not logic, to be the impetus for beginning a love affair. But it will give the history student something to chew on and I think it's an essential piece of understanding one of the weirder aspects of the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"The Art of Courtly Love (Revised Edition) (Records of Western Civilization Series)","review":"Haven't read it yet.

More than reenactment, unbeknownst to the public, the wounds and causalities are real. When a corporal shouts to the pickup that mike that the wounds are real, remote security personnel drown out his words. The true purpose, however, of Civil Warfields is not the accurate representation of the War Between the States, nor financial; indeed, the true purpose of the park is to test a new devise on humans. A tiny implant nestled in the abdomen emits chemicals to keep the wounded in stasis until regeneration can be triggered.The Confederate Commanding General Calvin Sutton is a megalomaniac, intent upon the South's victory in the reenactment of the Civil War. Recruitment for Civil Warfields was done indirectly. Men who had need of redemption, money, a second chance at life, or who crave dangerous thrills were put through rigorous testing. Then they were given a &quot;pill&quot; that was actually an implant during orientation; this implant can snatch them away from death. He promises tremendous rewards to the men who survive, but doesn't tell them of those men whose implants are beyond recovery range.Carson creates a gristly novel that holds the reader's attention rapt. It's impossible to put the novel down as the action escalates, sweeping the reader into a world that is all too real. Combining the futuristic aspects with the historical accuracy, the novel provides not only excellent entertainment, but is a telling comment regarding the violence found within our society where reports of gang violence and video games that become &quot;realer and realer&quot; make us immune to death. With remarkable clarity and vision, Carson creates a must read novel that no one should miss.

It seems that even mathematicians dislike change. If you are considering adopting a text, I strongly suggest you look harder at that one.My reasons for disliking this book:1. It's chaotic. Homework problems don't match what's in the lesson. Sometimes they belong with a later section. Problem sets can be endlessly redundant, and then some don't give enough practice for mastery.2. There are errors, that seem to multiply with subsequent editions. For example, on page 323 the technology tip suggests that the values of inverse trig functions are always in radians. But my calculator is quite happy to do them in degrees.3. Explanations are brief, or sometimes just missing. Section 5.3 on solving equations with trig expressions does one without a restricted domain, then restricts the domain in the next problem, and doesn't really explain that the two types of responses could be given for the same problem. Also in this section are problems requiring a quadratic approach (factoring), but not using the quadratic formula. Why not?4. The solutions manual appears to have been written by about four grad students. Consecutive problems can have solutions worked quite differently.5. As an instructor, my copy of the book does not have the answers on the page. I really don't want to go rummaging for them in the back of the book, especially since the headers for each section are not at the top of every page. If answers for a lesson run onto several pages, you have to flip forwards or back until you find the start of the next lesson.6. As an instructor, I was told that artwork and graphics for the book are downloadable. Not very many! I want to create slides that look like what's in the book, and then talk about them. It would be nice to copy and paste the calculator screen shots, but it's not to be! Online support just isn't what it was promoted to be.7. Inequalities are ABSENT from this book. They are side-by-side in the Lial, Hornsby, Rockwood book.I've used the 1998 edition of the Lial, Hornsby, Rockwood text from Addison-Wesley since 1999 with homeschooled kids. I learn something from that book every time I open it. Students don't call for help when using that book, because the explanations are adequate. I found an examination copy of the current edition on a bookshelf at the college where I also teach, and I prepare my teaching notes from that and often borrow problems from it. That book has improved with age! The Houghton-Mifflin book frustrates me to no end.A word to publishers, if you are actually reading this: The price of these texts is too high, and the three-year cycle of new editions is clearly a scam. We who teach at the local colleges hate it. I strongly suggest that for situations like mine, where the department adopts a text, that you offer to charge $20 per student when they register, and then allow the student to get the book electronically. You could update or correct the book at any time, you don't have to spend money to print and ship, and there's no buy back program necessary. The iPad is a perfect tool for delivering this."},{"Title":"Precalculus Functions and Graphs","review":"What a terrible textbook. I can't begin to tell you how bad it is.

After 9-11-01 our country needs unity more than ever. However, there is a dedicated movement at work today which is seeking to divide our people more than any movement I have seen over the past fifty years, the racial reparations movement. As is our custom, we have always shunned movements and leaders who seek to make the children responsible for the sins of their fathers and mothers. Somehow some of us have forgotten this important principle when the subject of African-Americans became linked with the reparations idea. We must not forget our principles, and David Horowitz has taken up the task of arousing us to assert those principles once again in this important controversy!

Our country and our people are depending on each of you."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Horowitz's book, while focusing on the reparations issue, is really a statement about intolerance in our society. I always thought the idea of going on for further education was to enlighten your mind, challenge your thoughts and opinions, and to give you the ability to take emotion out of your argument by focusing on the facts. Horowitz's attackers never assualt his ideas or statements, but rather hold their venom in reserve for his personal character (which if any of his attackers had bothered to research would have discovered a person who has done nothing but attempt to make society better for minorities). It amazes me that the supposed free thinking liberals at major universities, when challenged by an opinion they do not like, choose not to fight the arguement, but rather decide to hide behind words like &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;bigot&quot;.I only gave the book 4 stars because it dragged on with monologues occasionally.

The mere fact that the book has stirred up reparations proponents like a nest of hornets...shows us how scared they are of the logic and truth that true dialogue will reveal.The people who suffered as slaves are dead...and those who would owe any &quot;restitution&quot; to those slaves are dead.

But, we didn't need this book to tell us of the zero tolerance that is ubiquitous on our campuses today.Besides this is just another battle of a bigger war.The demise of traditinal american values and western culture is their aim(NO JOKE!)And they are winning.They are just one faction of a larger politically correct group that believes in group identity,america is racist,zionism is naziism,all non-whites and women are victims.Our politicians are either members or too afraid to stand up to them.For those who know nothing of this,the book is a good introduction.Just keep some maalox and aspirin handy!"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"The focus of the book is not really on whether reparations makes sense or not. It's about Horowitz's experiences running his anti-reparations ad in college newspapers.I was expecting a legal, historical, and maybe economical look about why reparations do or do not make sense. There is some dicussion of that, but most of the book is about angry student protests, students crying because of the mean words in his ad, abuse of the author while giving speeches on campuses, and the inconsistency of school administration for defending and promoting all types of free speech.His experiences are very revealing about the degredation of free thought in some of the supposedly best schools in the country, which is a very worthwhile read, but not what I was expecting.So if you want to read how colleges have treated opposition voices to reparations on campuses and what to expect to see in future debates on news talk shows, I would give this 5 stars. If you want to read just about reparations in general, I give this 3 stars."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This book is basically in two parts. The first chronicles Horowitz's fight against the Establishment as he attempts to publicly argue against reparations to black Americans for the 89 years of slavery that their distant ancestors endured in the United States. The extreme tactics that closed-minded liberals (shouldn't that be an oxymoron?) use to try and silence opinions with which they disagree never ceases to amaze.The second part of the book is a good solid argument against reparations. Many good points are made - beyond the obvious ones of which most people are already aware. I believe that in the end logic will prevail over passion and that the reparations movement will be unsuccessful. Holding people accountable for something that they had no ability to affect sets a very bad precedent and those who create and nurture grievances for their own political gain should be ashamed."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Much of the book is about Horowitz's tour, and his ongoing war with \\"tenured radicals\\" -- left wing academics. But most leftists are not academics, relatively few academics are leftists and the expansion of part-timers in academy means many are not tenured. The book tends to engage in distortions of the views of some of the people who he attacks. The book is a bit repetitive as the argument doesn't seem to get beyond the 10 arguments that were published in Horowitz's advertisement used for his tour.Horowitz never rally addresses the data that shows vast differences between white and black in things like wealth, homeownership, unemployment rate, income levels, or likelihood of prosecution and imprisonment for the same crime.Horowitz points out that much of the south's economy was destroyed in the civil war, a fourth of the white male population of military age were killed, so, he says, the south paid the price for slavery. but the slaves were not directly compensated. it is a well-accepted legal principle that if some people make profits from a criminal enterprise, their profits should be confiscated to re-imburse the victims. Slavery was a criminal enterprise, so it should have followed that the land and other property derived by the planter class and southern corporations from profits from slavery should have been transferred to the freed slaves at the end of the civil war. This didn't happen. The freed slaves were able to be forced into virtual bondage again due to being destitute after the civil war. The 850,000 acres of abandoned or confiscated land held by the Freedmen's Bureau was supposed to be transferred to the freed slaves, but the administration of Andrew Johnson sold it off to capitalist investors. This was why the Radical Republicans in Congress tried to impeach Johnson. Lack of inherited assets such as land affected the fortunes of subsequent generations of slave descendants. This obligation to do what is right doesn't end just because of that failure at the end of the civil war. The current value of that land and capital would be in the hundreds of billons today.Horowitz argues that the various welfare and affirmative action programs of the Great Society era transferred \\"trillions\\" to African-Americans but provides no supporting data for this. In reality the great majority of beneficiaries of all welfare programs have been, and continue to be, poor white folks.Horowtiz tries to portray the issue as one of personal \\"guilt\\" but it is a question of the institutional obligations of the society, and of the American federal state, due to the damages of a huge criminal enterprise the country was founded on. Horowitz says that a majority of African-Americans today are \\"middle class.\\" This is not true. According to polls, 71% of African-Americans describe themselves as \\"working class.\\" As I said, Horowitz is unwilling to address the actual current circumstances of the African-American population.Horowitz asserts, correctly, that slavery in Africa existed before the transport of slaves to the Western Hemisphere, and that some Africans profited from this trade. But this ignores the fact that the argument is about the profits created in the USA for economic elites during the period of slavery and the subsequent period of depressed black incomes in the south due to things like klan violence and lack of civil rights and debt peonage. It was the profiting off of slavery and its aftermath in the USA that bears upon the obligations of the government of the USA and American society. The role of some Africans in the slave trade is not relevant to that.It's true that many people have immigrated to the USA since the abolition of slavery but it is an accepted principle that people who migrate here are not exempt from the country's obligations. A person who migrates here cannot get out of paying taxes to pay on the national debt by saying those debts were taken out before he or she arrived. It is true that many white people fought to liberate the slaves in the 19th century -- my own ancestors include white Christian abolitionists -- but that still doesn't address the economic issue of profiting off of slavery and off of forms of oppression that suppress the share of the product of their labor received by African-Americans. Of course, it is still a legitimate issue of how to own up to this obligation."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"David Horowitz's new book, Uncivil Wars, is a superbly well written book, that should be required reading for all students of racial politics. His new book, as has been the case in all of the books he has written since his political rebirth, is meticulously researched, and excellently reasoned. I cannot say enough good things about this book. Suffice to say, I am in the process of memorizing the entire thing, not only because it contains multitudes of factually important information, but the facts presented therein are incontrovertable. Uncivil Wars contains the ammunition one needs to win debates and counter the dissinformation of the race warlords of the political left. It is no wonder that bigoted leftists are trying to smear Mr. Horowitz's name, since they cannot dispute the contents of his books.Jud Cox"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This book exposes the dangerous response by supposed open-minded college educated students. Unfortunately, it's the same old dog and pony show. Students at elite colleges, brain shackled by leftist ideology, are unable to formulate coherent responses to Horowitz's 10 points against reparations. Instead, they reach into the old bag of tricks with cries of racism and hate speech. But equally disturbing is the vicious rhetoric of some of the leading proponents of reparations. This could be the monumental issue involving black and white relations. The white blame game has hit new lows and this may be the undoing of the civil rights extortion scheme. Horowitz's case against reparations is even more powerful with Uncivil Wars."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"I'm surprised to be saying this because, when I went to college inBerkeley during the '60s, Horowitz was one of the (...) as far as Iwas concerned -- and I wasn't alone. (Reparation) was first an issue amongBlacks (James Foreman, former leader of the Student NonviolentCoordinating Committee) and American Indians during the '60s (readOglala Sioux Vine DeLoria's answer to it). How do I know all this?Because I studied the subject; I didn't just scan it in a bookstore.My wife, a member of the Chickasaws, who were forcibly moved toOklahoma and then charged for it by the Andrew Jackson Administration,thinks reparations are ridiculous. The contention that Horowitzinvented the issue or that there were only &quot;tidbits&quot; aboutit before his opposition to it is patently false (such a charge shouldgive any college Freshman history student a good laugh). In fact,Horowitz' book is challenging reading. Readers from both the Left andRight, except for those who read the book through lenses colored bytheir own ideology, will question some of their assumptions. Horowitzcan be infuriating (I wouldn't want to be the target of his witheringsarcasm), but he certainly makes you think. Although his frustrationwith the professional Left shows at times, he never moves away frompresenting a well-reasoned argument. Any book which promptsintrospection while presenting a controversial view is, to my mind, avaluable book. When it's written in Horowitz' clear, straightforward(blunt?) style, it's one you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Good book. Since I live in the Chicago area, I had heard news reports of votes on reparations long before I heard of this book. I would wonder who these people were that felt money should be taken from some and given to others based on history. Not a single one of my ancestors lived in this country before the end of slavery, yet my children and I owe someone money based on their ancestry? There is no logic nor fairness in that. We're trying to get by paycheck to paycheck just like the majority of Americans. We have no stockpile of money that we received as a result of slavery.The outrageousness of thought that decendants of those who died fighting to end slavery owe money is a very good point made by Mr. Horowitz. Mr. Horowitz' book explains much in very logical terms. If you agree with him, fine. If you don't, fine. There is certainly no reason to attack the author. Yet he also points out how a person can be attacked for merely disagreeing with what apparently is a politically correct cause.

Horowitz brilliantly exposes the vicious, ideological intolerance within American Universities, which threatens the very integrity of education. In addition, Horowitz challenges the reparations argument and exposes the radical agenda of the pro-reparations movement.Following the placement of an anti-reparations ad by Horowitz in a dozen University newspapers, students and faculty erupted in cries of racism and attempted to censor the newspapers. Horowitz portrays the campus leftists as ignorant, hateful and comparable to totalitarians. At Brown University, for instance, students stole every edition of the Brown Daily Herald to prevent distribution of the ad. None of the students, however, directly addressed Horowitz's arguments, which were both logical and thorough. Horowitz's premise was that the reparations movement is a product of historical revisionism by radical leftists. Such misrepresentations of history include the notion that America has never confronted the issue of slavery due to the fact that the Civil War was about economics and that Abraham Lincoln was a racist. Among other things Horowitz suggests that reparations will isolate blacks from the rest of America and create a damaging sense of victim hood. Yet the students at Brown and other schools where the ad appeared, blindly condemned Horowitz as a racist using tactics not seen since the McCarthy era. Nevertheless, Horowitz's stance of reparations is widely held by most Americans as evident by recent polls. The Universities represent the fringe of the political left and in the name of inclusiveness, campus administrators have created an environment of intolerance. As vital as these institutions are to our democracy, they are themselves undemocratic. Horowitz points to the fact that on many college campuses Republicans are less visible than Marxists, greens and other contingencies of the far left. This does not reflect the nation wide reality that America is almost evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.Uncivil Wars is an excellent read and highly informative. For one not familiar with University life, Uncivil Wars provides a shocking insider's view of our nation's most prestigious institutions. Horowitz presents logical and intelligent arguments that transcend party affiliation. Horowitz rips apart the reparation argument with undeniable truths that expose the reparation supporters as far-left radicals. This fascinating journey through American history and the insolated world of America's universities should not be missed."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"So-called black &quot;leaders&quot; like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will not like David Horowitz's new book, &quot;Uncivil Wars.&quot; Nor will the followers of these men who have vociferously ranted for the payment of reparations to blacks for injustices perpetrated upon their ancestors. But like it or not, Horowitz's new opus is dead on the money and, effectively, leaves the argument for reparations dead in the water.

In it's own right, away from the emotional squabbles of the Race Issue, one that steps out of the box should ask the simple question as to who would be deemed as written to recieve these reperations and where would the money come from? If it came from the Tax-payers, then that would mean a good portion of America's money would go into a contraversial law suit with an origin that can be found so far in the past that most people who were directly related to the issue of Slavery are either dead or have been put to justice. &#60; and their have been recent cold cases involving murders during the 60's that would attribute to this&#62;Now, having said that, although History recognizes the terrible crimes of slavery, it would be a stain upon the black community for putting a set price on the issue because then you are implying that your willing to walk away quiet at a price, a price which past civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King had died and fought so strongly for equal rights, without peddling for dollars and change --- because the fight cannot have a price placed upon it. It was a human tragety. It was a fight for man to be seen as equal in the eyes of the very nation he lived in -- as well as women. Are we as human beings, to measure inhumanity by a dollar ammount --- will it even fix the problem?This is a very good book, very short yet to the point, and advise people who are intressted to read the other books that this author has written, and yes, it is true --- The facts in this book are presented on both sides, and it is up to you to decide. Its how a political book should be."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Horowitz uses this book to document the efforts used to PREVENT THE DISCUSSION of his ideas on major college campuses. The shocking and shameful fact is that those efforts were condoned or aided by faculty and administration. School by school Horowitz documents the hysterical response to the very idea that he should speak on campus. Under the current regime, Black students are considered unable to defend their ideas in honest debate. Blacks must be protected from heretical ideas by the prohibition the dissemination of forbidden ideas. This is censorship, pure and simple, only now the unacceptable material is labeled 'hate speech' Horowitz is not a racist. He is someone who does not want to see the country devolve into a collection of warring tribes. The history of Ugana/Rwanda and of Francophone Canada are examples of what he seeks to avoid. Parents of college age students should read this book and should check out the history, anthropology and sociology departments to see what passes for scholarship.This book is a MUST read. Anyone reading this that has not already done so MUST also read the Horowitz autobiography 'Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey'. One of the most important and informative books I have ever read and one I give as gifts to people that I think are open minded enough to learn from it. OK, so I haven't been able to give all that many away but I endeavor to persevere. This book is loaded with the TRUTH. The TRUTH is plainly anathema to the vast majority of the Left as they only embrace the truth when it doesn't deviate from their intolerant ideology or how they WANT the world to be! Having lived and worked a significant portion of my life in and around San Francisco I am well schooled in the ways and smear tactics of the Left. I can all but guarantee that any negative review of this tome of truth will hail from a concerted Left wing tactic to sway and smear. Don't buy the smear. BUY the book."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Not only a thought-provoking argument against reparations, but an alarming chronicle of the dire state of free speech on American college campuses. Concerning the issue of reparations, Horowitz dispassionately dissects the issue from a variety of angles, applying principles of fairness, casuistry, and appeals to common good. I found his arguments clear and compelling, and the supporting material provided some interesting historical and economic discussion of slavery. Most importantly, I understood his motivations to be based not on hate, but on true compassion and a desire for what is best for all Americans and for black Americans in particular. The real story of this book is not reparations, however, but the reactions to the publication of (and attempts to publish) his opinion in a variety of American college campus newspapers. The responses ranged from irrational, highly-charged emotional outbursts to outright censorship and suppression. His well-documented account paints an alarming picture of the stranglehold of &quot;politically correct&quot; ideology in our universities, and the seeming lost art of rational debate (as opposed to ad hominem attacks and binary categorizations) in our culture today."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This book, the latest of many by one of the bravest and most intellectually acute men in America, recounts the confusing position of those who would suggest that America owes Black's raparations payments for slavery. Horowitz asks a simple question: Who owes the money? He also points out that in terms of a lineal responsibility for slavery, only a tiny percentage of Americans ever owned slaves. Additionally, most Americans living today are descendants of post-Civil War immigrants who have no lineal connection to slavery at all.When Black defenders of this reparations proposition try to make the case that the economic consequences of slavery and discrimination are the reason for income disparities between the races today, they conveniently leave out the Black success stories that highlight the American dream. The success of Black stars like Oprah Winfrey constantly act as a magnet for people everywhere who see America as a beacon of hope for improving the lives of they and their families.The success of Black's in America surpasses by orders of magnitude Black successes anywhere else in the world. For reference one should read Keith Richburg's book, &quot;Out of America&quot;, about his three years working for the Washington Post on their Nairobi, Kenya desk.Horowitz posits another legitimate question, &quot;what about the debt Black American's owe to White's&quot;? As Thomas Sowell has pointed out, show me a country where slavery hasn't existed and show me a country where land has never been taken by military conquest? The answer is there aren't any. Whites liberated blacks from slavery, first the English and then the American's. We fought a Civil War over the issue.Blacks enjoy enormous privileges as Americans, something they would have no hope of were they still in Africa. And, as for the arguments about who built the country, the one difference between America and most of the rest of the world is private property rights and a rule of law to protect them. You can't have civil rights without property rights. Spain sent their grandees to Mexico and the English sent their religious protestors to America. Both countries had access to two oceans, abundant natural resources and cheap labor, but look who prospered? The difference was private property rights, without which America would not be what it is today. Read books by Daniel Boorstin like &quot;the Discoverers&quot; and &quot;the Democratic Experience&quot; and you will learn how America was built.As Horowitz avers it would be helpful if the Black leadership in America focused on encouraging a hand-up to its less fortunate rather than a hand-out. It's a shame that Horowitz doesn't get more support from the very people he endeavors to help. Read this book. A healthy Democracy only works with an educated citizenry."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Not Racist.Thank You Mr. Horowitz"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"David Horowitz' new book, Uncivil Wars, does much to debunk the idea of slavery reparations.

Horowitz and others can expect knee-jerk reactions when the left does not like the message. Reparations, seven generations removed, is a sop for mediocre minds with little to offer in the way of REAL agendas for improving the well being of the Negro Race. Certainly Africans haven't figured it out yet. Education, education, education, education and then opportunity.......David Horowitz, Shelby Steele,Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell, ColinPowell, all these men, and many many others have messages that need broadcasting. But for the bias of the leftist movement in mass media, they could be heard unfiltered, or drowned out with chatter.Don't ban the book......understand the close-minded agenda of the driven leftist who wrote the first review and read the book for the ideas developed. Not Noble Prize status, but thoughtfuland as noted, very provocative."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"When I first heard the term \\"slave reparations\\" years ago, I thought it was a joke. Wrong. While I realize slavery was a morally bankrupt institution, I am also at my limit of hearing African Americans telling me to feel guilty about it and to pay them for it! The author does a wonderful job of showing that African Americans have been financially compensated for decades from affirmative action, welfare, and other expensive social programs. The present liberal bias in this country along with the power of trial lawyers is what mainly feeds this sort of ridiculous trend. The lawyers who will present their case for slavery reparations will make millions if there are settlements in their favor - and they will likely make much more than any clients they represent."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"David Horowitz's &quot;Uncivil Wars&quot; should be read, if for no other reason than simply to provide balance to the massive amounts of other literature and dialogue that have recently been made available concerning slave reparations. It is very easy for one to become trapped in an ideological battle over the righteousness of reparations, but of the most paramount importance is that Mr. Horowitz's work is a vigorous and able debate with respect to all, without any intellectual being shunned or dismissed as merely a racist. With all the material that has been presented on either side of the issue, I have found most of it to be emotive at best, and tending towards racist bullying at worst - but thankfully there are some exceptions to be found. One of which is &quot;Uncivil Wars,&quot; and another: &quot;The Debt,&quot; written by Randall Robinson is another. Each leads the reader to different conclusions, yet both are presented fairly and respectfully. For one to be truly informed, they must understand both sides of any given issue, and thus, I recommend reading both books.The reason I have taken a star away from Mr. Horowitz is for his stylistic tendency to divert from a strong, well-argued and presented lucidity, into extended diatribes, and loosely concocted tangents. Another demotion should perhaps have been taken for Mr. Horowitz's propensity for conveying an overly rehearsed plea for sympathy, and acknowledgement for his own self-created heroism for telling what he considers to be the &quot;truth.&quot; In essence, too often Mr. Horowitz beseeches the reader to believe of him a victim. Mr. Horowitz, in my opinion, is no more a victim than Mr. Robinson, but both men have something of value to share. With the issue being as divisive as reparations for slavery, the intellectual should demand of himself, before allowing his opinion to cement, the self-imposed obligation of listening to the voices on both sides of the divide."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Despite the content of many of the reviews, this is not an appropriate forum to disuss the merit of anyone's political agenda. Uncivil Wars proves once again that David Horowitz is a talented and lucid writer who performs a great deal of research and is personally involved in his subject. His logic is sound and compelling. Even if you do not agree with the premise that his logic is based on Uncivil Wars is an interesting exercise in thought and research.There are well-written and poorly-written books of all idealogies, and a book that agrees with you is not neccessarily a good book. Uncivil Wars, however, is a very good book regardless of what you might believe."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"To many on the left, Horowitz is a traitor, because he abandonned his liberal ways and has given an inside account of how dishonest and greedy the liberal machine really is.To many on the right, he is a colorful, scrupulous, entertaining commentator who tells it like it is.The USA is not a perfect country -- it has many flaws, the legacy of slavery most prominent. But it is a great country. And, in my view, the stain of slavery has already been redeemed by the blood of the abolitionists who fought in the civil war 140 years ago. It's time to move on and enjoy the fruits of this great country. Reparations should have no part and Horowitz has the guts to state this plainly and clearly."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Once again, Horowitz has exposed how our academic institutions are creating a culture of intimidation while they fan the flames of hatred for the founding principles of our country. The average parent struggles to pay their children's education, unaware of the indoctrination and intolerance they support. Alumni continue to contribute to an institution that no longer resembles the oasis of free inquiry, open debate and rational analysis they remember. The &quot;Reparations&quot; issue is a vivid example of the PC atmosphere on campus.With overwhelming logic, Horowitz demolishes the &quot;Reparations&quot; argument. With unending energy, he awakens us from our cynical resignation as we remember what it is like to fight an intellectual battle for a good cause. Having followed this controversial author on his website, frontpagemag.com, the book adds to the articles written by him and about him. His clear and impassioned rhetoric makes him one of the most controversial provocateurs - enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Uncivil Wars by David Horowitz is a chronicle of his own extensive experiences with the reparations debate in some of our most prestigious universities. I found the book gripping as it drew me in.Be prepared for some disturbing revelations about the lack of intellectual integrity and free speech in our institutions of higher learning.Howoritz is so sharp and cogent it makes you wonder how there could be a serious debate in the first place. But there is. No other book out there tackles this subject where it needs to be tackled and that is in our universities where, unfortunately, silly ideas tend to be given great weight."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"You must read this book with an open mind and decide on the facts. The ten reasons that Horowitz lists against reparations are legitimate. I bought this book expecting the see each point elaborated on, and I did. My ancestors fought for the Union in the Civil War and I don't feel that I should have to pay for reparations to slaves that my family fought to free (and never owned), especially when viewed in the overall scheme of the history of slavery in the world and where the U.S. slave trade fits in. And what of the immigrants after the Civil War who had nothing to do with it? But I don't want to spend too much time on the individual points.What disgusted me the most of all the information in this book was the state of our colleges today. They are supposed to be open to all points of view, to teach our children to accept and debate and decide on their own. Instead it seems from this book that univerity administration, faculty and even students are shutting down the free flow of ideas in favor of political correctness. This book should make every adult think about how universities are teaching our children. What happened to the open debates of the past? Why is information now being censored? What kind of future society might this create? Questions at this point left unanswered but they certainly need addressed. This country was founded on freedoms, an important one was the right to disagree with someone's statement and to argue it, without repercussions for your opinions. This seems to have vanished at our college's.Granted, this question is creating many hard feelings in the U.S. right now. Many blacks from varied backgrounds are pushing for reparations and many whites are afraid to discuss such controversial issues for the fear of being labeled racist. A sad truth in our society today is the fact that at the initial point of any disagreement involving black and white the racist label flies out too quickly and too broadly.This book should be read not only by people interested in forming an opinion on reparations but by anyone who would like to know the state of our college's today."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"David Horowitz again produces an extremely engrossing book that is counter-intuitive to most leftists. Reperations has always been an issue hovering over our nation and the facts need to be brought forth. Horowitz, I commend you."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This latest book by David Horowitz is an excelent review of the reparations issue which is at the forefront of black acedemic and black activist activities.The lies and distortions that characterize the arguments for reparations to &quot;decendants&quot; of black slaves are truthfully explained and thoughtfully refuted, and the black elite in our nations colleges will surely have a fit when they find out how severely they have been exposed.This book is a must read for anyone who cares about justice and civil rights, and will be quoted for decades to come."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"In Uncivil Wars, Horowitz absolutely BURIES the reader in facts, U.S. government and independent studies, and personal anecdotes. Indeed, on same pages, footnotes are a larger portion of the page than Horowitz's own writing. This is in sharp contrast to his book-burning detractors, who rewrite his own personal history, labeling him a racist, and ignoring all of the work he has done towards advancing the american dream for all americans. However, only about a third of the book, or less, is an examination of slave reparations and the issues which lie at its root. The majority of the book details the fascist repsonses which Horowitz encountered when he attempted to publish his ad in college campuses. Overall, however, this book is a fantastic study of the state of race relations in America today."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations For Slavery by biographer and social historian David Horowitz is a powerful and persuasively written examination of the hot-button political issue of federal monetary reparations to the descendants of African-American slaves. Horowitz notes that the vast majority of non-black Americans today are not descended from slave owners; indeed, many are immigrants, or the children or grandchildren of immigrants, who became Americans long after the end of slavery. Furthermore, contemporary African-Americans as a whole are far wealthier than numerous Africans living in third-world countries today. Uncivil Wars rigorously scrutinizes the idea of reparations with careful reasoning, and is an invaluable contribution to the national dialogue over a pressing (and recurring) social issue arising from the African-American community."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This book is a quick read. You can get through it in an hour or so. It's the reflection it inspires that last a long time.Basically, this book is the story to date of Horowitz's interaction with the reparations crowd, especially as it exists at America's universities. It's told in a pretty relaxed way, much less polemic than his usual style, but this makes the story all the more chilling. A number of ideas emerge:1. America's universities are no longer hospitable to the free discussion of ideas. Instead, a bunch of left-wing bullies control the discourse. When left-wingers can't silence through heckling or threats of violence, they immediately employ \\"sensitivity\\" to get administrations to silence ideas they don't like.2. Black Americans are encouraged to self-segregate and spend their years at university learning about anti-black bias and how to claim victim status. The end result is that the gains of the civl rights era are being squandered.3. Left-wingers no longer wish to engage intellectually. Instead, when an idea is deemed hostile, the person putting out the idea is labeled \\"racist\\", at which point they can be ignored. Actually, accusations of \\"racism\\" are now sort of like waving garlic at a vampire: the accused is supposed to recoil in horror and immediately give up. Much of the outrage of the left is concentrated on those who refuse to give up the ghost, but instead pursue their ideas.4. Newspapers more or less go along with the left. Horowitz points out a \\"Time\\" magazine article where the most prominent part of the article was a picture of a woman holding a sign accusing Horowitz of racism. The woman's whacky political convictions were never discussed.5. Black leadership preaches attitudes towards whites not far removed from what Hitler had to say about jews. And there's a whole college movement devoted to furthering these ideas.Horowitz may have started on reparations, but this book points out that America's universities by and large are leftist cess-pits, dedicated to nothing less than the destruction of America. Think of this book as you would of turning over a rock in your garden. You're not sure what you're going to find, but you know it's not going to be pretty.David Horowitz deserves a lot of praise for attempting this Augean cleansing."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This book is typical of Mr. Horowitz - outstanding. I've followed the reparations shakedown for sometime and this just solidified what every sane person knows. Thanks to my mother's vigilant genealogical endeavors I can assure any and all that my German and Irish ancestors have only been in this country for around one hundred years. Mr. Horowitz makes the lucid point that forcing me to comply with any future reparations would be absurd. In essence I would pay based on the color of my skin along with Asians, Indians, Hispanics, etc. I've often wondered what would happen if we did actually pay out the million per person. Shortly after bankrupting our economy, there would be a huge outcry by the very same recipients. They would maintain that they need another million each because a racist America never taught them how to handle their finances. How many times have we heard about some lotto winner going bankrupt a year later?"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"In terms of reparations, some important questions must be raised:1. What about free Africans who owned slaves?2. What about American Indians who were enslaved?3. What about the slaves who were paid for their labor?4. Who is actually charged reparations?5. Do white &quot;indentured servants&quot; receive reparations as well?6. Will the family of Robert E. Lee be given back Arlington?7. Will Irish Americans who met with signs like, &quot;Irish Need Not Apply&quot; be paid, as well?Racism has many faces.Attempts to rewrite history are legion. Money-grabbing is popular. Put the two together and...See also, &quot;Time on the Cross&quot; where liberal professors do a study on the economics of slavery---shocking results."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Mr. Horowitz proves beyond a shadow of a doubt his position that reparation for slavery is unwarranted and bad for all Americans. He also does a very good job chronicling the extreme intolerance and prejudice that permeates our colleges and universities in regards to the free flow of differing opinions. In other words, if you don't tow the Socialist/Liberal party line, your labeled, silenced and then ostracized as a racist. This book follows in the footsteps of Tammy Bruce's &quot;The New Thought Police&quot; which is another great example on an insidious cancer that is alive and well in America. Both of these books NEED to be read by all Americans especially students getting ready to attend one of our so-called institutions of higher learning."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"The last forty pages of this book contain arguments against reparations for slavery.Most of the book is an account of the reception that Horowitz got when he tried to place a paid ad arguing against reparations in campus newspapers. For challenging leftist racial orthodoxy, Horowitz was systematically branded a racist. Many university papers refused to run the ad. Others ran it, but editorialized against Horowitz in the same edition, to protect themselves. Papers that ran the ad without comment often suffered threats, protests, and insults. Universities held panel discussions denouncing Horowitz's ideas, without inviting Horowitz or anyone else to defend him. When Horowitz was invited to speak in university fora, he got shouted down and tarred a racist for his troubles.All this for what? Because, like 75% of Americans, he opposes the idea of reparations for slavery.So in a sense, this book is about reparations. Really, it is about the reparations debate, and how Horowitz's experience in that debate reveals that American universities, rather than being centers for the free discussion of ideas, are gladiatorial pits in which one side, aided and abetted by faculty and administration, tries to howl the other out of existence."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Last year, David Horowitz attempted to place in various college newspapers an ad explaining why reparations for slavery, an issue gathering steam on the radical left, is a bad idea for Americans of all races. In his chronicle of that attempt, Uncivil Wars, he describes an incident the implications of which will vex those of us who are already suspicious of the quality of education offered by our leading universities.Following the publication of his ad in the Duke Chronicle, protesters mobilized by the Black Student Alliance occupied the editorial office of the newspaper demanding \\"two free pages for a public apology and rebuttal.\\" Others, many of them crying, formed a human chain in front of the offices of Duke president, Nan Keohane. Let that image settle in: these were not children who had just been informed that Barney is really a man in a dinosaur suit. We are asked to believe that college students at an elite school could be reduced to tears by a polemic that disputed some of their most deeply felt prejudices. Horowitz's astonishment is palpable. Seeking to understand the source of such an empty-headed response to an intellectual challenge, he writes the most brilliant passage in this indispensable book: \\"Tears might be understandable as a response, say, to \\"slavery denial.\\" But why in the world should pointing out the obvious--that slavery is long since over, and that post-slavery America has brought bounties to blacks--why should this cause people to cry? Is it because they fear that the umbilical link to victimhood will be cut and they will be forced into the moral complexity of full citizenship--a status their mentors have purposefully withheld from them?\\" Horowitz forces us to share his sadness and frustration at Duke's failure to educate. The blinkered, intolerant leftists who control the faculties of almost all major colleges cheat the students who come to them hoping to learn how to think critically. Such students cannot emerge from the experience equipped to participate fully in a democratic society. If you share, as I do, Horowitz's Weltanschauung, you will view this book as a call to arms. But even if you are an unreconstructed lefty, reading this passionate work and engaging honestly with its argument should provoke some discomforting second thoughts."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Every once in a while someone writes a book that clarifies a situation tremendously. This book is definitely one of these. I could not put this book down. I read it at home. I read it at work. I read it at stoplights. The footnotes alone are worth the money. Horowitz answered questions that I have had for years now and provided me with places to go to recheck his research. The book is essentially a two part book. The first part deals with the reaction of the campuses to an argument against slavery reparations. The second is an actual argument against slavery reparations. Well written. Well documented. I will be reading Horowitz's other books very soon."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"David Horowitz is the only person with enough guts to stand up to the people who are looking for ANOTHER handout.

To whom?3rd) Was european colonialism so bad as african leaders use to say? Who put an end, not only to slavery, but also to cannibalism and human sacrifices in Africa? Who introduced the wheel and the alphabet in the subsaarian Africa? Who built the net of infrastructures still in use today in Africa, forty years after the end of european rule?4th) Finally, is not the current attempt to demand reparations a way that the african ruling classes found to evade their own responsabilities in the dispaired situation of Africa? Is not such situation much more owed to the incompetence, greed and corruption of that same ruling classes than to a slave trade that ceased in the middle of the 19th century?...Read also the articles that Thomas Sowell, one of the persons to whom Horowitz dedicated \\"Uncivil Wars\\", wrote about the reparations problem."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"A very big problem we have in this country is intellectual laziness amongst the masses.

David Horowitz's book &quot;Uncivil Wars&quot; is at the top of my list of books that people must read in order to emerge from the intellectual slumber.

Demagogues like Cornell West base their demand for payout on fallacious and ridiculous arguments that defy reason and logic. Forcing the current population of Americans to pay for the sins of people that lived over 150 years ago is not the triumph of morality, it is the negation of morality, holding people responsible for acts that not only weren't committed by them, but weren't even committed by any of their ancestors. (We are an immigrant nation, after all.) To argue that people who had no part whatsoever in slavery are morally responsible requires such intellectual contortions as would confound any psychologist. David Horowitz has provided a public service with this book, both by exposing both the fraud of the reparations movement, and the intellectual dry-rot that has infected an academia that would support such a proposition and engage in browshirted tactics to try to silence any opposition to it."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"In this book, conservative commentator David Horowitz actually fights two fronts in he liberal-conservative &quot;culture war&quot;.One is the idea of race reparations for slavery, the other, the entrenched leftist ideology of the modern American university. Horowitz began his battle by formulating &quot;Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery Is A Bad Idea--And Racist, Too&quot; and sent it to 71 college newspapers nationwide in the form of an advertisement. The first half of the book deals mainly with reaction to the ad on college campuses. Horowitz details the reaction of university student newspaper editors, profeessors and administrators at places such as UC Berkeley, The University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Brown University. Here, Horowitz tells a chilling, frightening account of the kind of censorship attempted by the far left-of-center campus &quot;commisars&quot;. This section is an eye-opener for those who still believe that our American universities are centers for the free exchange of ideas. The section on Brown University, and the lengths that some of the students would go to to suppress the ad is particularly disturbing.The last sections of the book are mainly devoted to the idea of reaparations for slavery itself. The idea itself has been floating around for many years, but has gained monmentum in the last decade due to the publication of the bestselling book &quot;The Debt&quot; by black activist Randall Robinson as well as the formal adoption of the reparations concept by the city councils of several US population centers including Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas. Horowitz gives a reasoned,well-researched refutation of the reaparations concept which leaves one wondering what the folks populating the campi were worried about. Could they be afraid of the truth?

It is an essential part of the debate on an issue that will continue to be part of the American landscape, and a revelation to those who seek the truth."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"As an accomplished and voracious reader, I judge any book (and thus also judge the author) by its &quot;readability&quot;, &quot;relevance&quot;, and &quot;reliability&quot;. The best reading most enjoying text is essentially worthless if the topic is irrelevant, or if the writer is unreliable. Conversely, a highly reliable and perfectly relevant piece is of equally little value if it has the readability of a parts assembly guide. To my positive delight I recently discovered that David Horowitz's work more than meets my criteria in this regard. I find everything that he writes to have been well researched and eminently factual; and at the same time highly readable, thoroughly enjoyable. Uncivil Wars is no exception. Count on Mr. Horowitz to pull no punches in his relentless presentation of painful truths."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This is an important book, one which the reader will not only enjoy, but which sheds light on an important social issue, one which the US mainstream media has given little attention to.Horowitz correctly points out that the reparations issue is an on-going attempt by a relative handful of the usual black 'victicrats' to exploit lingering white guilt, stir up black animosity, but most importantly to keep their names in the news and hopefully to shake down some unearned cash.The whole idea of reparations is clearly insane, on many different levels. Horowitz does a good job of covering them in detail. The idea that all US blacks today are owed huge sums of money for slavery some of their ancestors suffered is certain to be controversial. Basically, reparations supporters are saying, \\"Whites owe blacks money for something they themselves never did and which never happened to any black alive today.\\" Truly, truly bizarre. The sad thing is that many gullible, poorly educated people fall for this scam and support the racketeers who are trying to run it on the rest of us.Perhaps the most interesting part of Horowitz's book is the portion where he describes the vicious racism, hatred and hypocrisy he faced for even wanting to discuss the topic of reparations. His descriptions of how the minds of many reparations supporters seemed hermetically sealed against reason, logic and common sense were absolutely chilling.As a black man myself, I consider this book to be a valuable look at the sociology of race in the US today, as well as an appeal by Horowitz for an end to racism and divisiveness. It's well worth the price, and deserves the high ratings it's received. Buy it today at Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"As the author says, Uncivil Wars is two books in one. It describes the way in which a small but dedicated totalitarian left is able to stifle discussion of critical issues on college campuses across the nation, and it is also a look at the struggle for the soul of black America. The reparations movement is the most powerful attempt to turn black America against this country. That it does so in time of war is a matter that is both serious and disturbing.Sadly enough, reparations today is a critical socio-political issue. Already most black organizations and media outlets have endorsed the reparations claim, as have 38 congressional sponsors of a reparations bill and the city councils of Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, San Francisco and other cities. The State of California has already written into law and funded a Reparations Bill that will assess how much black slaves are owed even though they're dead and even though California never had any slaves.The issue will gain additional prominence with the ascendancy of Al Sharpton's campaign for the Presidency in 2004.This book is not about mainstream liberalism, but the growing fringe of totalitarian and collectivist (postmodern) thought that's shutting down intellectual diversity on campus and gaining influence within the liberal movenment in America. It documents the authoritarian methods and the intolerant mentality of the left wing professoriat and their minions.Uncivil Wars will be hated and burned by the authoritarian left. It's written by one who was formerly their own. And it documents the progress of political correctness, multiculturalism, and totalitarian collectivism in corrupting traditional American liberalism and the Party of John F. Kennedy."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"The reperations debate has been around since the 1960s (as some other reviews neglect to mention). Horowitz has a rather bombastic style, but that is reflective of his personality (as it is of mine, so I sympathize). Do not let that distract from the fact that he hits a key point here - that free speech is a non-starter on the campus, and in our life in gereral, when the issue is one that the Far Left has chosen to monopolize. Those who dare to challenge the assumptions of the Leftists are subject to bombardment with Marxist-inspired personal attacks, which are designed to marginilize (&quot;he's a kook&quot;), demonize (&quot;He's a Nazi, racist, homophobe,&quot;etc.) and neutralize (&quot;Don't buy the book&quot;)the mesenger. As those of us from the Old School know, the first one to start calling names has lost the debate. (By this, I do not mean &quot;Left&quot; or &quot;Right,&quot; but the use of personal epithets such as, &quot;racist.&quot;) Horowitz makes points that are not new, as in the monopolization of the traditional megaphones of society (academia, the press, etc.), which Buchannan, for example, describes in his, &quot;The Death of the West.&quot;The value of this work lies in the author's exploration of the reperations debate, and how it is limited by the forced acceptance of certain underlying assumptions, such as white guilt for slavery and discrimination, the uniquily racist nature of society, and the slave-labor basis of our present prosperity. While not every reperations supporter uses all three, and some other arugments may be given, the above are descriptive of the basis for the claim that monies are owed to the decendants of American slaves.In response, it can be countered that slavery was universal, worldwide, and endemic from the dawn of history, that it existed here before the existence of the US Government, and that the US Government eventually ended it, in the persons of white, male, Christians with guns, known as the US Army, who faced shot and shell to end it.It also bears noting that the slaves were enslaved by their fellow Africans, or by Arab slave traders, who also did a land-office business in whites. (&quot;Slave&quot; comes from &quot;Slav,&quot; and uncounted numbers of them were Janizaries, eunuchs, etc., in the Ottoman Empire.) To use a notable example, Cinque, of &quot;Amistad&quot; fame, became a slave trader after he was freed.To make the above arguments exposes the maker to intemperate verbal assault (as it has this writer). There seems to be an underlying theme, which Horowitz took up in &quot;Hating Whitey&quot; before continuing it here, that while people are, quoting Susan Sontag, &quot;a cancer on the human race.&quot; Thus, whites bear blood guilt for the sins of all involved in slavery, which must be viewed as a white-on-black conspiracy, unique in history. No expurgation of this guilt attended on US victory in the Civil War, regardless of the blood shed in battle.Economically, the reperations crowd argues that slave labor built this country, in spite of the fact that most of America was free soil, that slaves did a minority of the work in slave states (as most farmers were freeholders), and that Sherman and Co. destroyed most of the wealth of the South, America's least-prosperous section.Having considered their arguments, it is easy to refute them. Horowitz concentrates on their motivations, and writes as an insider, having been a leader of the Left in his youth. This book is good reading for those who wish to devote more honest effort to understanding the issue than is needed to peruse the back cover while loitering in a bookstore.-Lloyd A. Conway"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"The idea of slave reparations has been met with thunderous support from many influential African-American politicians and community leaders, as well as a fair share of guilt ridden white liberals who desperately want to demonstrate their personal compassion and virtue.David Horowitz, former radical editor of Ramparts magazine, has written a reasoned and rational response to the inflammatory subject of slave reparations.Essentially, Horowitz lays out Ten Rules that state that since the Civil War is over, and many African-Americans are very prosperous today, why should it be the responsibility of struggling, recent American immigrants to foot the bill for these past injustices, of which neither they nor their ancestors took any part?Faced with factual analysis, reasoned arguments and logical thinking, the knee-jerk left was left with only one response...label Horowitz a racist.The subject of slavery reparations is one not easily dealt with, and one that is bound to result in loud and intense debates. But avoiding intellectually honest discourse, as the left desires, will not resolve this festering issue. Discussing the issue openly, honestly and factually will contribute significantly more. Read the book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Many of us sit back and enjoy the world through the prism of another's eyes. All too often this is the case with America's age-old racial conflict. We are told how bad the situation used to be, and it was quite terrible for all who experienced the days of Jim Crow and the fight to resist him. We are told by much of today's commentators that we have not come very far in this fight and how white America is still oppressing their neighbors with tenacious, overt hatred. And this despite the fact that most American's today identify with a much more egalitarian American society. Horowitz's book poses a succinct, common sense argument against reparations for slavery. He delves sufficiently into several precedents, showing how each is inapplicable to this case, and finishes with the very correct conclusion that American tax payers owe nothing but kindness and brotherly respect to those around us. Read this book for an insightful look at the reparations debate."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"...and what's crawling under it is yet another pitiful attempt by the Civil Rights &quot;Jack&quot; to racially polarize America so that it can continue to extort money from those who've earned it and give it to those who haven't. I love this book becuase it shows that the reparations movement is in essence a Marxist scheme that benefits lawyers and politicians at the expense of those it purports to benefit. By documenting the intolerance of those who support reparations to any competing argument, Horowitz reveals the movement to be based on factual error, myth, and the politics of envy. A great read! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"David Horowitz, the radical turned conservative gadfly, hits another home run in this carefully documented book. Hard as it is for those outside academia to believe, reparations is seen as a serious issue on certain liberal campuses. More important than the reparations issue itself, Horowitz details the increasing censorship imposed by those who claim to be in favor of free speech. Because these institutions educate many of our future leaders, we all need to be concerned about the leftist bias and censorship which are going on on college campuses. David does an excellent job of describing this challenge."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Hasn't any one studied reincarnation? Dejavu? If you do, you will find that the white slave owners are back and they are wearing black skin asking for other people to work for them again. What goes around does come around. When you hate any ethnic group, the hater will wear their shoes in the next lifetimes. there is no fooling Mother Nature. They who do not remember their past is condemned to repeating it. They(haters) perpetuate this vicious cycle upon themselves. It does not need anyone to believe this, but it is good to know. remember, you will reap what you sow. Have you ever wondered why Isreal or Bosnia is in the pickle that they're in? Each incarnation souls of these countries gravitate on opposite sides until they learn to forgive themselves, and then forgive others. David is right but for all the wrong reasons. \\"be ye perfect as the Father is perfect\\", show me a person that can manifest perfection in one lifetime, it is non existent. Not all blacks want reparations, but the ones who yell the loudest, study them closely. Not one human being is guiltless including me, the only difference is that I am aware of my ignorance and, working on my perfection. \\"they live in their inward thoughts(tombs) forever\\"(rebirths)PS 49:11, The Budhha and Mohammad said the same."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"I just finished this book last week and it was kind of disappointing. As a conservative black man, I was looking for a strong case against minority special rights. Instead, Horowitz came across as mean-spirited and at times even racist. I believe there are arguments to be made against special preference legislation, but I we lose the battle when we elevate our personal hatred of people of color. I almost fealt dirty as Horowitz time after time denegrates the African-American community, not for conduct, but for their actual identity. I began the book hoping for an indictment of liberal philosophy, but left feeling the taint of racist indignation. In order to defeat the Leftist agenda we need to remain objective and not condone the same strategies as used by David Duke and his ilk. I hope Horowitz presents a cleaner message in his next work."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"I know, I know, making an intelligent criticism of a conservative book will get me unfavorable votes and the usual \\"commie\\" nonsense, but I just couldn't stop from telling the truth about this \\"new\\" neo-conservative.First off, I don't see how an author can have the nerve to critisize an institution for being too biased when he himself is the most biased person out there. His own website is a tribute to biased neo-conservative thought, with article after article after article by different reactionaries basically saying the same thing, I mean, don't you guys get bored after a while? Why is this relevant you ask? What does Horowitz say ought to be done to cure this terrible problem of liberal (bad word, remember) bias in our colleges? He recommends hiring more conservative, people like himself and those who write those articles on his webpage. However, everything we have seen from Horowitz shows that if conservatives were in power, would they in fact be moderate, tolerant or permissive of views different from their own? Well, the answer to that is found by going to a William F. Buckley book review and having an opinion to the left of Pat Buchanan. Remember Horowitz's article on \\"Why Reparations is a Bad Idea-Racist Too\\" won the hearts of so many conservatives as this poor neo-conservative was being rejected in school after school by the nasty liberal elite? Sure you might be aware of that. But are you also aware what happened when liberals tried to do the same tactic to conservative schools like Bob Jones University, Liberty University, etc? Didn't think so. A liberal professor wrote a strong pro-choice article and sent to it to these conservative run schools and GUESS WHAT HAPPENED CONSERVATIVES OUT THERE??? LUCKY GUESS ANYONE? IT WAS REJECTED BY ALL! And this was just a simple pro-choice article, a FAR less inflammatory article than David's work, in fact, John Doggett, a Black REPUBLICAN, yes, REPUBLICAN, even called Horowitz's article \\"half-truths and breathtaking demonstrations of ignorance.\\" AND \\"Unfortunately, much of what he says shows a breathtaking and dangerous ignorance of what it has been like to be black in this country during the past 50 years.\\" A Republican said this! Honest, but still A REPUBLICAN! (Source:http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22146) I can also cite numerous legions of prestigous professors, intellectuals, and student organizations that have also heavily critisized the article but in a conservative room, I don't think they would matter very much.But if you got anything out of that last paragraph, please answer why it is that someone that has not shown the least bit interested in a fair discourse ought to be critisizing others for their lack of it, and why conservatives have the same right to do so when institutions run by conservatives do not offer a unbias view of things and arguably creates an even more bias atmosphere. You might ask Horowitz that next time he goes to a NASTY LIBERAL UNIVERSITY near you! Oh yea, I forgot, Horowitz is currently ON A SPEAKING TOUR OF THE SAME NASTY LIBERAL SCHOOLS HE LOATHS SO MUCH, so Horowitz, a neo-conservative, called by CNN and almost every other media outlet aside of Rush Limbaugh, a \\"controversial\\" author, someone thats been accused by Republicans as \\"insensitive to African Americans\\" is being allowed to speak to the possibly thousands of college students in the same schools he writes against! Could you do that in the conservative schools?Also, we could go back in history to the pre-1960's days when conservatives DID INDEED run thing at almost every school. I don't have the room to get into here but it goes something along the line of complete control by white old men, limit of academic freedom and diversity, discriminaton against women, minorities, Jews , commies and all that good stuff can be found by looking up \\"The Opening of the American Mind:Canons, Culture, and History\\" by Lawrence W. Levine.And Finally, I would just like to know Why, oh why do conservatives waste so much time on these silly matters instead of talking about whats real? I mean really, most students are interested in partying, having a good time, getting drunk, getting lucky, and going to termpapers.com to get by, not intelligent political discourse, no matter if its a Republican, Liberal or Commie behind the stool. So why not talk about whats real, like instead of talking about what some silly left wing professor said today, why not talk about why college graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to find jobs, why the purchasing power of college graduates have declined, why the growing disparities between the wealthy and everybody else, why radio stations and TV networks are being controlled by fewer and few hands, the same special interests funding our two major parties, the shift of unskilled labor to the third world, a growing military industrial complex that demands more money for defense yet ignores the fact that America spends more than 12 times the amount of our nearest competitor, why Americans pay more for prescription drugs than any other country in the world, corporate greed, Enron anyone? insurance greed that uses safety as an excuse to screw the drivers of America at every turn by using unrealistic speeding limits, having police and cameras monitor areas not where the most accidents are but where they can catch the most people thus raise their insurance rate, more Americans in jail than any other country, and most for non violent charges, ie simple drug possession, the drug war as an excuse to take more money from the taxpayers and to illegally dispose of unfavorable governments at the expense of Americans. These issues are very real and all this nonsense about if O'Reilly is conservative , Rather is Liberal, is just what Chomsky calls \\"Necessary Illusions\\" and it really is."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"This is a good book but I found some of Mr.Horowitz's arguments to be skating on very thin ice. For example he argues that all European-Americans on the northern side fought the Civil War tofree African-Americans and thus this is another reason they should not receive reparations. This is simply not true and there are many documents to prove that many northern European-Americans did not want the Civil War to be about emancipating African-Americans and only did accept it as nationalpolicy in 1863 as a means to winning the war. Mr.Horowitz also argues that contemporary Americans are not responsible for slavery and therefore should not have to pay reparations for it.Yes it is true that European-Americans and people of other races living today are not responsible for slavery or it's consequences. But what about the other side of the argument which Mr.Horowitz seems to neglect. What about the United StatesGovernment? Is the United States Government responsible for thedamage and consequences it caused when it wrote and executed policies that disenfranchised African-Americans all the way up tothe 1960s. Under our system of law it is. If you damage anotherindividual or his property you must do your best to restore hisperson or property. So even in Mr.Horowitz's overall thesis balance is lacking. So why buy the book at all you might say.Well even though this book lacks a balanced historical argument it does provide a excellent window into the views and thinking ofthe ultra-right wing conservative element in our society and after all this is America. Everyone has the right to state theirviews and opinions even if they arent always completely based onfact."},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"(...) This bookis full of hyperbole and hatred.

(...)"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Professional polemicist and gadfly David Horowitz here follows himself around the country on his \\"campus tour\\" in defense of his advertisement giving ten arguments against reparations to black Americans for slavery. As it happens, I agree with his general point. Nevertheless, this is an awful book, an embarrassing exercise in self-promotional grandstanding. Most of the work, \\"The Controversy,\\" is a self-aggrandizing account of his successful attempts to bait student opponents into shouting matches, providing him the requisite anecdotes to join in on the tired rant about how contemporary universities are bastions of tenured-radical-America-hating-proto-totalitarians. It's evident that Horowitz doesn't spend much time at the everyday life of universities, where impassioned but reasoned debates are routine. Spend some time in just about any college classroom any semester, David; you will find students and faculty engaged in passionate but reasonably informed debates. The conservatives like to play the part of the aggrieved and embattled minority defending free speech. Apparently that big lie has been effective, ...The final chapter in the book, \\"Reparations and the American Idea,\\" at least presents a reasoned analysis of the reparations debate and defense of America's progress on the race issue, despite Horowitz's inability to understand the historical scholarship of slavery on its own terms rather than as fuel for his polemical fire. You can stand in the bookstore and read that chapter, the only worthwhile portion of the book, in ten minutes.

It dispells the myths of what victimhnood is really defined as and calls all Americans of all colors and stripes to ignore the social engineerists that would control your life and tell you that you are a victim because of your current dna structure and skin color. There are only a small handful of times in history where slavery was even thought of as evil, and the American Unionist abolitionist movement was obviously the most successful, no matter what Joseph Ellis or Zinn say--it worked! There have been sins in America, but we all need to look to history and we will see that we have been the pinnacle of light that that has instituted feedoms that have bridged the gulf of history and have gone places with it that no ancient could ever have dreamed of. This book provides an honest, intellectual insight into the reasons why reparations only serve to hurt the African-American populus rather than lift them higher. It is a ploy to ensure their status as victims so that the coffers of liberal PACs may continue to be filled and the race card can be politically played as an offense of political war to preserve power. For further reading on past military leaders who've fought slavery, read The Soul of Battle, by Vitor Davis Hanson. Horowitz is known by his followers and share his path, but for those whose political power is threatened or those emotionally brainwashed under such demagogues, this book will invoke rage. A great work!!!"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Mr. Horowitz will always be ridiculed and verbally assaulted by those who do not deserve to judge him for telling the truth. It would appear that honesty, integrity and truth for some has become a thing of the distant past.Mr. Randall's rhetoric is an example of today's twisted social out of control world, of radicalized victimization, where anyone who has a beef with the way their life has panned out, can claim special status and receive the fruit of others labor. But more importantly the absolute hate of successful minoirty members who cannot come to appreciate the blessings God has given them in America. They simply hate everyone not of their own race for hates sake. In effect becoming that which they write about. It has become fashionable and appropriate to simply forget the real purpose of that struggle for true freedom and equality our founders engaged in.Today it is fashionable to accept being ignorant of the truth, uneducated in fact, and compliant with the claims of the victim police. Nothing could be further from the truth. The self-appointed and manipulative bigots who thrive on racial and gender strife have brainwashed the minority, soon to be majority, communities in this country.Yet the only enemy the black man or the free women face in the 21st century are the inner prejudices held by themselves towards those who have helped them.In spite of these individuals David Horowitz is a breath of true Americanism and \\"common sense\\". Once again an \\"age of enlightenment\\" and a true unadulterated \\"age of reason\\" has raised its head, with this new book \\"Uncivil Wars,\\" all-be-it in a different form than before, upon the American scene.David exposes those who childishly hide behind an even more evil racism than that of the past. It is the racism of those who have been helped out of the gutter of maltreatment, who are now trying to stuff those who assisted them into their previous position, in effect biting the hand that \\"freed\\" them sort-of-speak.No, the evil that men and women now do, seems to come from the descendents, or students of those, who once fought the good fight like Martin Luther King Jr. Who have now twisted all their philosophies and good works. They have lost themselves in the name-calling and finger pointing to the point that they can no longer declare victory or move on to enjoying the simple victory of a previously noble cause.They have now become the victims of their own mutated goals and have become the very thing, which they hated most. They live in a false past created by their own inconsistencies and the \\"monsters of their Ids\\".That which they were originally justified in fighting for, has long ceased to exist. But they cannot relinquish their power and influence, for fear of becoming just normal Americans and average citizens.Using the same tactics their oppressors once used in the distant past, they find that they just cannot give proper credit where and to whom it is properly due. The verbiage once appropriate in a just cause, is now just an ignorant rampage against anything not black or female and their continued antagonistic position is in fact beneath the dignity of the new found freedom and status they hold in the world.Mr. Horowitz informs us and proves the point, that it is no longer the average or mainstream White citizen or culture that fosters hate, mistrust, prejudicial philosophies and racism anymore, but rather the fringe elements of the Black and female communities that do so.To admit to that truth, would in deed prove that we can become brothers and sisters and that these \\"hate mongers\\" are no longer needed in the 21st century.If there is a heaven where honesty, integrity, humanity and true respect for equality are judged, where true liberty and freedom are evaluated by those who practiced it best. Mr. Horowitz will most certainly stand and watch those like Mr. Randall Robinson, Jesse Jackson and Barbara Lee of Berkley, being dragged off to the pits of eternal torment, for their inept bigotry and hypocrisy.David Horowitz should be heralded in this world as a \\"true champion\\" of the oppressed and a genuine advocate of equality. His struggle is to give all people equality not the status of infinite victim. As with so many other books published in these trying times, this is a book for the honest, open and seeking mind.True mainstream American, not the phony one portrayed by the media or Hollywood will find it enlightening and true, the others...well they will be the others...as they always are, and the hate of the far-left-wing-fanatics will remain. Hopefully Mr. Horowitz book will pull a few back to the middle and back to a reasoned, rational, honest and productive dialogue, where the future can be bright for all without the bigotry, racism and hate of the status quo from both sides. Hey, one can hope.It is definitely sad and shameful, that in America when it comes to race, gender and politics, we seem to be the spitting images of the terrorist hatemongering untrustworthy Yasar Arafat and the stubborn fed up militaristic Ariel Sharon. Not a very good commentary on a nation that has accomplished so very much for so many in just 50 years or so.We could be so much better than we are.

If you've ever found yourself under siege from people who advocate for reparations, you will be profoundly thankful that you have a copy of Uncivil Wars around. Horowitz got people talking about this subject and, I believe, he has helped render this terribly unfair proposal unviable today. The cogent point is that everybody, no matter who they are, should be grateful that they found their way to these shores. The majority of black Americans are now middle class and making it in this country. The last thing we need to do is practice reverse racism procedures like reparations.

The fact that Horowitz is white and is arguing, factually, against a subject that the liberal elite have embraced, only ensures that his reception anywhere liberals hold sway would be uncivil, to say the least.This book also illustrates another point I've read elsewhere...the point that, in general, conservatives argue logically, with facts that can be researched and supported, while liberals argue with emotion and name calling, especially of the \\"racist/sexist/fascist\\" variety.Read this book, it's definately worth your time!"},{"Title":"Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery","review":"Mr. Horowitz's account of the challenges that faced him in presenting an opposing point of view on the reparations issues is both insightful and frightening.

He lists a variety of resources to support the debate.It is frightening, in that on many of today's campuses there is little room for intellectual dialogue about the issue.

His attack on reparation is well thought out although at times his extensive use of footnotes prompts the reader to wonder if he shouldn't have included the notes in the body.

His attack on Randall Robinson concerning the history of the origins of the War Between the States was wrong. Robinson has it right unless you believe America's Caesar (Greg Loren Durand, Crown Rights Books) fought only to free the slaves and to do this had to destroy most of the Constitution. Horowitz, with his Berkeley background, is hardly one to denounce Joe Sobran's interpretaton of the war period. Even the Englishman Charles Dickens knew the devastation of the South was \\"purely fiscal.\\" This reader can agree with some of Horowitz's propositions about the state of affairs in the upper educational system of today and after reading this booklet, it is suggested he narrows his focus to his own experience or at least of history not taught at these cesspools of liberal learning.

Their hatred of American society is only rivalled by their absolute insistence that they never be criticized or challenged. They are against the Open Society as such and pretend to be \\"offended\\" if anyone questions their twisted ideals.

They have no sense of history or the human condition. They believe merely what they wish to believe--and God forbid if anyone should try to shake them from their dogmatic slumbers!Their attempts to silence Horowitz's campaign against reparations would rate as first-rate farce if it were not so pathetic and disturbing. Not only did not one radical leftist attempt to refute all of Horowitz's ten arguments against reparations, not one demonstrated that even understood any of Horowitz's arguments. The radical Left's fanatical ideology prevents these poor children of darkness from being able to understand what they read--a huge problem for American intellectuals, especially those on the Left. It never occurs to these individuals that the goal of reading is to understand what someone else is trying to say, in order that one may learn from that person and be challenged by him. But these people have no interest in learning.This is a widespread problem among American intellectuals. This was clear to me when I was doing the research for a book critical of Ayn Rand. Neither Rand nor her followers seemed to me capable of reading. They inevitably twisted everything they read that disagreed with their point of view, giving it a malicious interpretation. (Of course, if anyone misinterpreted anything Rand said, they would howl with indignation.) But in comparison with these radical leftists, Rand appears a very model of fair-mindedness. At least Rand and her followers pretend to respect logic and rational argument. These leftists, as described by Horowitz, don't even offer the merest pretense of logic or respect for rational argument. Horowitz's arguments against reparations, which most Americans would agree with, they dismiss as \\"offensive\\" and \\"racist,\\" and that's as far as they go in the direction of rational argument. Some students reported weeping because their feelings were so badly hurt! If these students really are that hyper-sensitive (rather than merely histrionic), how do they expect to make it in the real world, where no one will have any indulgence for such absurdities? I fear that these radical leftists will be in for a hard time of it when they leave the shelter of the university. Such are the consequences of adopting an ideology so contrary to fact, so belligerently opposed to the demands of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Underground Light Bulb","review":"I recently re-discovered this little children's \\"gem\\" while re-arranging my library. I have owned this book since it was given to me as a gift in 1969.Basically, with a minimum of stature (a very small format), simple black and white drawings, and a rudimentary story-line, it tells the tale of a young boy who wants to be a drummer in a band. I won't give too much away, but it is inspirational to anyone who strives creatively to succeed.The message still holds true today.This week,I will be giving it to a drummer I have known for almost thirty years as a birthday present."},{"Title":"Our Eddie","review":"I picked this book up at uni, not knowing what it was about.

I was surprised that I actually liked the content of the novel more than the cover. The story is pretty powerful and I still remember it today."},{"Title":"The Socialist Tradition Moses to Lenin","review":"This book is a history of unorthodox economic ideas, a companion volume to the Gray's acclaimed and authoritative \\"Development of Economic Doctrine\\" which covers the thought of the \\"orthodox and respectable\\" professional \\"economists.\\" At the outset Gray raises this question: What writers are properly included in a survey of socialist thinkers? Because \\"there is . . . no agreement among the experts as to what socialism is supposed to mean . . . we shall guide ourselves . . . by accepting somewhat unquestioningly those whom the general consensus . . . has agreed to designate as 'the great socialist.' \\" Gray therefore postpones to the final chapter his distillation of the \\"essence of socialism.\\"The first two chapters consider the contributions to socialist thought of those dual influences from the ancient and medieval world which have been the principals in shaping modern thinking, the Jewish tradition, modified and supplemented by Christianity, and the Greek tradition. Gray concludes that Spartan communism is not the romantic historical remnant of primitive agricultural communism but the inevitable result of a State perpetually organized for war. The communist views of Plato are presented together with a \\"cold douche of individualist criticism\\" from Aristotle. Study of the main body of Christian doctrine shows that Christianity assumes or defends the correctness of private property, although \\"wealth is a trust held for the public good.\\" The minor line of Christian thought which tends toward communism, owes its inspiration to the ancient woman-less Jewish sect, the Essenes.The transition from the medieval to the modern periods is accomplished by treatment of that \\"curious and fascinating . . . sideline in the literature of socialism,\\" the Utopias. Gray emphasizes the Utopian doctrine of the perfectibility of man and the incorporation in the Utopias of an astonishing number of modern totalitarian devices. Modern socialism finds its immediate forerunners in the French egalitarians and in the remarkable, though neglected, English pre-Marxian group, as well as in the so-called \\"fathers\\" of socialism, those interesting eccentrics, Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and Blanc. The \\"fathers\\" are described as associationists, only Blanc foreseeing the importance of the role of the State.Modern or \\"scientific,\\" socialism means Marx and Engels primarily, but Rodbertus and Lassalle are also so classified. Gray need not have included his apologetic explanation that \\"much as a sensitive typewriter may rebel against being called upon to perform so hackneyed a task,\\" it is necessary to understand the place of Marx among the great socialists, for he presents an excellent essay on Marxian fundamentals. Gray observes that the labor theory of value, the core of the Marxian system, has \\"frayed . . . irretrievably\\"; that common terms such as \\"value\\" and \\"capital\\" are employed by Marx without specific definition, consequently making possible the horde of confused interpretations of \\"What Marx Really Meant.\\" \\"Yet despite his prosy and interminable dullness, despite the confusions and inherent contradictions of his theories, despite his manifold defects in temperament and disposition . . . the indubitable fact remains that Marx has proved the most influential figure of the nineteenth century.\\" Why? Because Marx became the cult of an anemic intelligentsia unable to face reality and because he supplied a body of myths, a social religion, by which men could explain away their unhappiness. (Lenin is described in a later chapter as the one-sided restater of Marx, extending with \\"damnable emphasis\\" the theory of the strategy and tactics of the proletarian revolution and dictatorship.)The failure of the world to fulfill the Marxian prophecies led to the development of Revisionism. Bernstein, the prime begetter of Revisionism, finally came round in substance to \\"old-fashioned, mid-Victorian liberalism,\\" even declaring that \\"'one need be no anarchist in order to find the eternal heaping of duties on the State too much of a good thing.'\\" Fabianism, the other major development in Evolutionary Socialism, unlike Revisionism, was not a reaction to Marx. Fabian Socialism found its original inspiration in Henry George's principle of the unearned increment. But Gray quite properly sets George apart from the ranks of the socialists. George's doctrines, such as his principles of distribution, his clean-cut distinction between land and capital, his statement of the advantages of free trade, are incompatible with the socialist position. The Fabian Socialists improperly extended the principle of rent on land as an unearned increment to capital and labor. Thus Fabian theorists have gone so far as to describe wage differentials as the \\"rent of ability,\\" individually unearned, and therefore to advocate wage equalization! Socialist Thought, Ancient and ModernThe anarchists are represented by Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin and Bertrand Russell. Gray admits that although anarchism theoretically \\"is the complete antithesis of most forms of socialism.\\" its inclusion is justified because \\"in practice anarchism works out as an extreme form of socialism.\\" The trade-union relatives of the anarchists are considered in chapters on continental syndicalism and English guild socialism.In his final chapter, Gray concludes that socialism and individualism are complementary, involving varying proportions of the social and the individual. After considering the proportions in which present-day society should be mixed, Gray decides that \\"the great need of the day is for a prophet of liberalism\\" standing for the \\"pre-eminent worth of the individual.\\" \\"The danger involved in the drift or urge in the direction of an ever more actively controlling and intervening State, is that at the end of that path-however it may be disguised-lies totalitarianism, with the individual even less than the Guild Socialist's manure, even less than a thing of naught. The very great and deserved welcome accorded to Dr. Hayek's warnings regarding 'The Road to Serfdom' may perhaps be interpreted as an indication that the public mind and conscience are not wholly at ease on the question.\\" Few books in economics are a comparably sound combination of the sprightly and the scholarly. Particularly rare is a history of economic doctrine which can be said to be exciting. But competence of treatment has in no way yielded to entertainment. Richness of reference, evidence of familiarity with the complete works (and biographies) of the great socialists and their critics, meaty, brevity, good-natured humor commend \\"The Socialist Tradition.\\""},{"Title":"Do Your Parents Drive You Crazy: A Survival Guide for Adult Children","review":"As the daughter of a self-centered, critical mother who is constantly telling me what I \\"ought to do\\" or \\"should do\\" and the step-daughter of a tyrannical, bullying, insulting step-father who is always insulting me, pushing me around and calling me names, I found this book to be a lifesaver!

In her remarkable book, The Adventures of Swamp Woman, Ms. Wolff describes the thoughts and feelings of women going through menopause and so many of the rites of passage that occur simultaneously with it: changes in our relationship with our husbands, children growing up and leaving home, the death of a parent and many others. Her essays are so perceptive and rich in personal references it is as if she has created a map for us. That is, she says I have been there, too, and it's OK, you will find your way out. It is easy to identify with Ms. Wolff's feelings and experiences and as we do, we realize that what we are going through is not unique but something we share with most women; we just didn't know how to put it in words.

Keynes then based his entire analysis of analogy and induction in Part III of the TP on a modified version of one of Boole's problems on pp.235-237 and pp.253-257 of theTP.Let's summarise Keynes's position.Given the fact that most probability estimates are impecise intervals rather than precise single number answers,problems of nonrankability,noncomparability and incommensurability will occur.However,ALL probabilities are measurable by either one number or by two numbers.Ramsey was never able to grasp this very straightforward approach of Keynes's.He should have taken the time to read all of Keynes'book ."},{"Title":"The Stats 1998 Minor League Scouting Notebook (STATS Minor League Scouting Notebook)","review":"If you are in a &quot;keeper&quot; rotisserie baseball league that allows for the drafting of prospects, then this book is a must. I buy it every year, and believe me, it always pays for itself when I finish near the top of my league, in part due to players that I drafted when they were just reaching AA ball. An example: By now many people have heard of this year's favorite for AL rookie of the year, 3b Eric Chavez of Oakland. But how many people knew who he was before last season? Well, if you read this book, then you knew he was an excellent prospect, younger then most of his peers, with the potential to be a star. I drafted him in my league's reserve draft, and I expect I will be reaping the benefits for the next three or four years. It was the same with Ben Grieve the year before. The other great thing about this book is you will probably learn some things about evaluating minor-leaguers that you didn't know before, such as the importance of strike-zone judgement for young hitters(reflected in K/BB ratio). After reading this book, you will be better equipped to make your own judgements about prospects during the middle of the season, which will come in handy when making trade decisions. So trust me, when the '99 version of this book comes out, buy it.

Also a favorite is the Banana Raita--sooo good. This cookbook can be a little difficult at first if you don't know what an aubergine (eggplant) or courgette (zucchini) is, but this problem is minimal, especially because of the quality of the recipes.Another drawback to the cookbook is that there is no index, but since there are only 120 recipes divided into 10 sections, it is not difficult to find what you are looking for.A tip for using this cookbook would be to either have a conversion chart for measuring (easily attainable online) or to use a small scale. The ingredients are measured in grams and fluid ounces, which might be quite a setback for someone who does not know how to figure this out.I would not recommend this cookbook to someone just starting out with vegan food. Something like \\"Vegan Planet\\" would be more helpful in describing terms and making recipes easy to understand. But for the experienced vegan cook, I highly recommend Linda Majzlik's Indian cookbook. I have never had better vegan Indian food than when I have cooked her recipes, even eating at fine Indian restaurants. For someone who loves to cook and isn't deterred by some funky measurements, this is a must have."},{"Title":"Vegan Taste of India","review":"I received this book for the holidays and have been quite pleased with the recipes in it. I am vegan and I enjoy Indian dishes a lot. I found most of the recipes in the book can be made with easy to find ingredients from a well stocked grocery store and that I already had most of the spices she calls for (note: I have a lot of Indian spices already). If you're new to Indian cooking, a trip to an Indian grocery will get you set to cook. If you aren't familiar with terms/measurements, just look them up online and pencil them in. I know some people dislike metric cooking measurements but they don't bother me. Maybe not the book for you if you don't do a lot of Indian cooking and are new to cooking in general, but for the seasoned cook who loves Indian food, I can't say enough how much I enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Vegan Taste of India","review":"I ordered four vegan cookbooks from this author (Italian, Mexican, Indian, Caribbean). I hate them all. First off, they are small and contain few recipes. Half the recipes they contain are for items I either wouldn't cook from scratch (tortilla's) or are so basic they are found in every other cookbook on my shelf (tomato sauce).Next, the books are from the UK so you better know how much a dessertspoon is, what \\"hard vegan cheese\\" is, as well as know what an aubergine or courgette is. There is no glossary or nutritional information given in any of the books for any of the recipes.But by far, the most irritating feature of this author and her books is her love of nuts. No matter what cuisine the book is suppose to be about, the recipes are filled with nuts....walnuts, filbernuts, hazelnuts, etc. It would be fair to say that at least 2/3'rds of the recipes in each book contain nuts. In the Italian book 7 of 8 recipes in one chapter contain nuts! I've eaten in many an Italian restaurant and not once have I ever had a dish with walnuts in it. This woman is nuts for nuts.So, even at the low price, I cannot recommend these books to anyone, especially those with nut allergies."},{"Title":"Vegan Taste of India","review":"Great vegan cookbook!!! Easy recipes, easy to follow, available ingredient especially if you live near an indian grocery. Some recipes are nontraditional but jusy as tasty. Americans don't panick when you see aubergine (eggplant)& courgette (zuchinni) which are readily available. I'm still not a big fan of soy milk. I preferred almond milk which can be used interchangably with the desserts. There isn't an index which is why I only gave it 4 stars. That can be a headache when you need a quick referrence. I repeat alot of recipes are not traditional but they're still tasty. For example: There isn't a recipe for palak paneer (tofu) and the recipe for mattar paneer is ok.

Each book is simply a collection of recipes - often not very good ones - without a single word of explanation or information anywhere. What I can't understand is the popularity they seem to have in Britain. Every other bookshop's vegetarian cookery section is stacked with copies of the various titles. As they cost, if my memory serves me correctly, 5.99, I can only assume people buy them because they're cheap, but I don't think they would be worth having if they were being given away free."},{"Title":"African Philosophy: A Classical Approach","review":"I encountered this anthology during an African Philosophy course taught by one of its editors, Dr. Kalumba, at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.

Once I understood that my pain had come from my traumatic past, I realized that I was struggling with something called Shame. Shame is where you believe that you are bad, or unworthy of love or intimate, trusting connection with other people. I was already a born again Christian, so I began reading books on how to get free of shame by Christian authors.However, I found that Christians had the most painful, unhealing, and destructive things to say about my heart and personality. I read Christian books that told me that I was wretched, unlovable, and that God even created little babies as objects of wrath, predistined to hell. My sense of worthlessness and a growing hatred for God's apparent \\"wickedness\\" filled my heart with offense at God and drove me away from the Church and \\"into the wilderness.\\"When I found Kris Vallotton's podcasts online, I began to listen to them, and felt God slowly giving me a new hope for my future, that I really wasn't just a worthless loser. When I finally bought Supernatual Ways of Royalty and listened to it, it brought so much healing to my soul. It was like waves of water washing over me, washing away the dirt of bad theology. One of the pinnacle moments is when Kris addresses Christian's belief that it brings honor to God when we say how worthless and wretched human beings are. He says, how can it bring honor to God as a creator, to criticize and desacrate his creation, saying it is like a piece of garbage?In this moment, something shifted in my heart. I realized that all the shame that had been heaped on me by Christians was just that- Shame, coming from the Evil One. I realized that God loves people and that humanity is worth loving and worth fighting for, and even worth redeeming. Because of this, I had a change of heart. I began to really value other people and human beings in my heart, and truly love others for the first time.In addition, Kris address some of the basics of the topic of Virtue. Virtue has long been upheld by the Church as a set of ideals to which a person should aspire to be their Best Self. This subject has been neglected by Protestants, but represents the \\"missing link\\" between Legalism and Lawlessness, which allows people to actually live the life of Freedom which Paul talks about.In short, Kris' practical theology presented here is a masterpiece. Kris never went to college, but his ideas confound the scholars and wisemen of our day- because they come from the Wisdom of God."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Excellent book.

Kris tears down a lot of lies that we believe, and in many cases were taught, that prevent us from living with confidence in our identity as royal priests. There were a few sections that had some sketchy exegesis where I thought he stretched some interpretations a little too far, but for the most part it was good. I found myself disagreeing with some things only to later find myself agreeing as he addressed to the concerns I had.The most concerning thing was his look at the topic of \\"covering\\". I first heard of covering when I read John Bevere's book Under Cover. I found Bevere's treatment of it to be alarming if not outright abusive. I was concerned that Vallotton was on the same path but thankfully he seems to reject the bad parts. He doesn't hold up leaders as infallible or beyond accountability (Bevere basically says that it is rebellious to even question a leader) . He also asserts that being submissive doesn't mean you have to forget God's calling on your life (Bevere basically says we should blindly follow our leaders, they will take responsibility for what they tell us to do). He also points out that as a body we are also called to submit to one another (something Bevere never mentions and seems to reject). I hate to spend a lot of time on this because it was only the 2nd to last chapter, but I feel like this would have significantly decreased my rating if he didn't address those concerns.Is this book worth reading? Absolutely! There are so many good things in it that will strengthen you in your identity and teach you how to live with confidence and authority. I didn't agree with everything in the book, but I did agree with most of it. I received many revelations as I went through this book and I think many will find new teachings that bring freedom. This is worth reading multiple times!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"I read this book quite awhile ago, as a student in 1st Year at Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry. If I remember anything from this book, I remember it gave me one HUGE REVELATION. Jesus sees us as saints, not sinners. Jesus calls us friends, not slaves. If you are walking around as a believer and feel weak, powerless, and stuck in sin, read this book. Paul calls us heirs of God, seated in heavenly places. Jesus said we would walk in greater works than He did (!!). Think about it. Sick, sad, disgusted Christianity that is constantly in pain & suffering and has no power to bring change to the world is NOT what Jesus had in mind when He died. God didn't die so we could just attend church and weep at the altar. God died and rose so he could CO-LABOR with us to change the world! Jesus equipped 12 to heal the sick, raise the dead, & cast out demons. Then he equipped 70 more. You are the 'and so on' next generation after that 70.....YOU must see yourself as a powerful son/daughter of God that can converse with heaven to bring heaven here!If you are realizing that this is very contrary to how you see yourself, then you are a perfect candidate to read this book and let the Holy Spirit renew your mind and set you free from the belief that you are still the old man. The old man is dead. Get ready to see yourself as the new creation in Christ Jesus that you are. Christ in US, not instead of us, is the HOPE OF GLORY."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book guides you into the truth that as a child of the king, we have access to so much as royalty!!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book was absolutely amazing.

In fact, I read it two times and plan on reading it again!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book is truly to be a classic. The questionair in the back will give me a life time of areas to lift up to God to specifically have Him work on so I continue to move more and more from pauper to princess. Each chapter has been a blessing to me and the Bible Study I lead. It is where the rubber meets to road and so challenges us to grow up and move faithfully in the authority and inheritance we have always had in Christ Jesus but not walked in."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book has been lifechanging not only for me but for many others that I am in contact with through our church. Kris is very open, honest and straight forward with what he shares. He uses his real life story to share his experience from going from a pauper to a prince in the kingdom of God. This is a MUST read for teenagers through old. Eye Opening!!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"The Supernatural Ways of Roayalty is a book that can truly open one's Spirit to the realm of thinking above the normalacy of the daily Christian's walk in life. When reading this book, if one were to allow God to heal the wounds of the past, and renew a right Spirit within, this book can help pave the way to knowing who you are in Christ and allowing you to truly live the life intended as a Christian. Truly, we as children of the King should prevail to walk as such. Great teaching in the book and wonderful insight given to both authors to release God's love to the reader."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Kris again through his own journey, alongside Bill Johnson, gives us a powerful revelation of the truth of the identity of the believer. Celebrating the finished work of the cross, we are taken on a journey into the fullness of restoration and go beyond just knowing who we are to being practically equipped and inspired to live a powerful life of honor. This book revealed my own struggle with low self-esteem and made me realize it had been masked as 'humility.' Kris shows us that true humility isn't thinking less of ourselves but is actually believing who God says we are! I received a refreshing revelation of royalty and the grace to live a lifestyle of the supernatural from this understanding.Powerful book for every believer and leader."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"We've all heard how God loves us. We've also heard a lot about grace. Some have been taught we are 'sinners saved by grace'. This book challenges that thinking. Kris shows the father's heart to us. He has made us new. To call ourselves as anything other than Royalty is robbing us of our inheritance bought with the blood.Christians need to know who they are.What if someone told you there was a billion dollars waiting in an account for you but you can't have it? It's rightfully yours, but someone is saying you won't get your hands on it. You might be upset.This book is not filled with religion. It will not give you rules and steps. Kris gives fresh revelation of what normal existence needs to be for those filled with Jesus and the Holy Spirit."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book will change your life. It's about stepping into our rightful place in the kingdom as sons and daughters of God, living like we truly are heirs to the throne of the creator of the universe. In this lifestyle, Kris shows us characteristics that should be displayed as we walk in power and a renewed mind, not living life with a pauper mentality but with a princely outlook, knowing the authority and power that we have inherited. The problem he was trying to fix is that most Christians live life defeated and broken, bound by the lies of the enemy. This is a must read for every Christian!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"I also used it to teach a class in Church. The topic is one the Body of Christ needs to understand and embrace to be who they are to be. I have handed this out to many people and they say it has changed their way of thinking."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"I would definitely recommend this book to people. God recently set me free from the &#34;orphan spirit&#34; that I had struggled with for years and I didn't even know it even existed until I went to the Harvest Mission School that Iris Ministries runs in Mozambique last fall. This book is definitely a great timing for me to read because to shows you how to go from the orphan spirit of not knowing who you are in Christ to going into a new transformed life style of living as a son or daughter of the King and our Abba Father God. If you truly desire to know how God has always created you to live as His son or daughter then I definitely would like to encourage you to read this book. God wraps His royal robe of righteousness around you and His heart is just aching for you to live a life that He has destined you to live.

It's very easy read. He incorporates a lot of his own experience, so it's hard to put down. This book taps into topics a lot of us were raised not to question. Very informative. I learned a lot. It's simular to Joyce Meyer's approach. She tackles difficult topics on emotions, putting them in a practical, easy to retain form. Kris does the same with the Spiritual Realm & our thoughts. He not only explains what it is, but gives you the tools. This is one of those books you'll look back on as a \\"life changer\\". Enjoy!

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book instantly made it into my Top 25 books on how to live. Contained within these pages are statements of truth that most people have either never heard or never heard in a way that comes alive in their understanding.What DOES it mean to be royalty? As joint heirs, believers in Jesus have access to so much more than most people realize. The Church as a whole has lost the understanding of the privileges and resources available to a son or daughter of the Most High God.Kris Vallotton presents a powerful explanation that will cause your faith to soar, and make you want to do your own Bible studies to seek a concrete, lifelong understanding of yourself as royalty.

It makes you think. When the prodical son realized where/who he was, he chose to leave the pigs. Most of us that are Christians, like the fact that we are saved through grace, but we still choose to live with the pigs, rather than get up and enter the Kings house. Maybe this is an American short fall for not having a royal family and therefore the understanding of what it means to be royal, and in the Christian sence part of a Royal Priesthood. This book help you take the steps to start to correct that mindset."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"If you don't know you have a million dollars in the bank, you will never spend it.If you don't know you are royal heirs, you won't walk in it.

Kris Vallotton and B. Johnson has provided what may seem to some as basic instruction but what is truely an aide to transformation of one's image of themself. For some it will appear a little obvious and mundane however the nuggets of truth woven within the pages is what make this a must read.

This book and teaching has literally changed my life as I now understand I am a daughter of the King with unlimited resources that knows no lack. Our actions are based upon what we believe about ourselves and this book uses biblical truth to help us discover who we are as royalty. And royal people allow the culture inside of them to influence the world without, instead of allowing the world around them to influence their inner culture. This book is a great bible study book, great on its own, and you can even use it for sermon inspiration if you're trying to teach your congregation through the paradigm shift into revival culture."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Kris Vallaton provides us with God's view of us. We are not paupers, orphans, but royalty. He delivers a rare message that is unreligious, refreshing to our spirit. As I read this book, the truth of how God views me transformed my thinking and my expectation to be blessed as a daughter of the most high God! I highly recommend this book as a spiritual staple to come into our true identity."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Concepts that a reader will learn:1. Page 27: thinking like a pauper keeps you in survival mode, which will cause you to cut down other people to elevate your own self esteem.2. Page 30: when somebody values us more than we value ourselves, we tend to sabotage our relationship with that person because we do not want them to get close enough to find out that we are not as good they think we are.3. Page 46: forgiving somebody (a behavior required of Christians) does not require us to trust the forgiven person.4. Page 52: facing failures of our past (and weaknesses of our present) do not need to prevent future God-encounters.5. Page 121: leaders do not need to compete with the people they are supposed to be leading. Just as an side, after being a Christian for 29 years, people from Redding were the first ones who prayed \\"let my ceiling be your floor\\" for me. When leaders are paupers then they can be intimidated by the success of those they are leading. Leaders following the ways of royalty want and expect their followers to do better. When you grow spiritually, does your pastor seem happy or does he put you in your place with a \\"leave this to the professionals\\" attitude?6. Page 125: honoring unbelievers will show that we value them, which will show that God values them. Seeing them as pathetic losers will turn them off to us and our message.7. Page 131: the church should not be a place that we go but a tribe that we live in.8. Page 132: Christians need to have a plan to \\"parent\\" those that we lead to Christ instead of leaving them like orphans. This really touched me because the feeling I had perceived (from older believers) after conversion was \\"congratulations, here is your Bible, good luck, and I hope you follow it good enough to be found worthy of heaven\\".9. Page 144: our agreement with what God is doing is necessary to release his power into the world. God did this so He would not violate our free will and ruin our potential to love him.10. Page 152: some people who cannot find the supernatural in the church will sadly go to where they can find it (Proverbs 27:7).11. Page 160: the survival mentality has reduced the Christian experience to simply \\"holding the fort\\" while waiting for somebody (other than God) to protect, save, or rescue us.Brad"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"I purchased and read this book last month and absolutely loved it. The authors make so many outstanding points that simply aren't being talked about other places, but are so needed in the church today. I've already passed the book on to other friends to read and they have also been very encouraged and inspired by what is in this book. I would definitely recommend this book to others.Kris Vallotton also has a whole series of free podcasts that are available on iTunes which I would also enthusiastically recommend listening too.

It, unlike many other books, equipped the reader with the knowledge of a supernatural way of thinking instead of a superspiritual.

I was raised in a Christian home, sent to a Christian school and have attended church my entire life, yet I have never understand the nature of a good God. This book opened my eyes and heart to a God of love and relationship. To know that the God I serve wants to reign down his blessings on me has transformed my spiritual journey. I no longer carry the weight of judgement and condemnation of my failures with me. Kris showed me that I am free to walk victoriously knowing that God already has a place reserved for me at his table and it's been there since the day I was born. To walk in the light and love of a heavenly father whose deepest desire is an intimate relationship with me brings a whole new dimension to my life. This book had such an impact on me that I have since purchased eight additional copies to share with other people in my life. I've also gone on to read Kris' other books including his new book \\"Heavy Rain\\", each having deepened my desire to know the true nature of my Creator even more. I love Kris' passion for the heart of God, his sense of humor and his real life stories that he shares in all his books. He is a \\"down to earth\\" guy who is shining heaven from above, or as he says in his All Truth Is Not Created Equal sermon (which you can download from the ibethel website) \\"God didn't say to rise and reflect he said to rise and shine!\\".

And since I bought my first copy while visiting Bethel Church, I've bought 10 more books and have been distributing it as gifts to my friends, despite the expensive shipping rates to Hong Kong.Much of the struggles we go through as individuals comes as a result of not knowing who we are. With realization of identity comes the realization of our worth, and the purpose and destiny God has in store for each one of us. Anyone can attempt to write a book on identity, but the words of this book come alive, because Kris Vallotton writes out of his own experiences and the journey he has been on.Over the years as a Christian in the marketplace, hungry for God, I have read A LOT of Christian books. This is by far one of the most impactful books and mind blowing books I've read. My few comments about this book cannot do justice to what waits in store for you if you read this book with a hungry and open mind.

The devil will be really miffed at the contents and the truth that Kris shares as he transitions us to life living in the Palace. Kris's writing style is very engaging his personal snippets from his own testimony give us a wonderful insight into this man of God.

This book is about taking on God's perspective of who you are in Christ.

This book helped me to move in more confidence and individuality by understanding how God sees me."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Kris Vallotton does an amazing to job of building and restoring true identity back into the christian. SWR created this reality in me that I am not only saved by Christ, but I am created by Him to do great things. The book promotes Jesus back to the place He should be in the church as a our amazing redeemer AND creator! He makes no mistakes and He made us powerful and amazing to be an extension of Him on the earth to do His will and bring the joy, hope, and life into people's lives.Therefore, Kris touches on many topics in the church and in his own life that forces us to think and challenge ourselves to live in the greater reality of Heaven on earth and transform the world around us and have a lot of fun doing it.

When you know who you belong to and who you are, it is so much easier to live, out of who you are and not just what is expected of you.

This book will push you to walk in confidence, knowing that you are a representative of the kingdom of heaven.

I did not want to put it down once I began to read the truth written within. It is a great tool to help shape us into the people we were created to be, exposing mindsets and lifestyles that hinder us from discovering our true identity and the rights and privileges we have because of being a son or daughter of God, which happened when we accepted Christ Jesus. The contents of this book are biblical and will set the \\"religious\\" into a tizzy because it gives a detailed road map into a real relationship with the one and only true God, right into the arms of our Abba Father so that we can be all that we were created for in this life. We have based so much of what we have believed over the years on deception and misinterpretation. This book brings revelation, Truth and light. What are you waiting for?

I decided to read it, and it is a well written book with a wonderful message. I don't want to spoil it for you, but I recommend this book for a deeper spiritual walk with God. It would especially be helpful and applicable to a male step-parent, as there is a message regarding issues that pertain to that. I also enjoyed how the author beautifully shows the reader that many have a pauper or victim perspective, and don't fully grasp and walk in the understanding that there are riches beyond what you can magine by walking in Christ (not just monetary). We even bought a copy for a friend - it's that good."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Awesome!

Thank you Kris for writting this book!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book might puzzle or upset those who don't believe that God's word can be alive and active today in each individual life. But for those who do believe it this book can be transforming and will motivate you to allow God release His full purpose and calling upon your life. The \\"royalty mentality\\" is empowering, encouraging, and freeing.

It has taught me so much about how I am a coheir not a slave. I am a big fan and will reccomend it to others."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"this book unless you want your life to change. I'm serious.In our world today, especially in American culture, there's this pesky little thing that everybody is dying for but nobody knows what it is. Hordes of people are willing to do this and that to their bodies, to their lives, for the possibility of just one fleeting moment of feeling okay, or whole, or known, or understood. We jump through hoops and mutilate our bodies (in the figurative sense and very probable literal sense) for a sense of self. And only very few achieve this, maybe.We all want to be special, powerful, and influential but get lost in the mundane drone of life, letting each minuscule step away from truth eventually lead us to the \\"point of no return\\".At least it was this way with me. I'll be the first to admit that after reading this book my life did not make a 180 turn for the better. I hate to write this, but it's true.Instead, it has caused even more highs and lows than I anticipated. But this is just the beginning.The beginning of a process, which I believe was Kris' intention, where I get to \\"chew the meat and spit out the bones\\" of how all of this actually applies to my life. Prior to this book and learning about identity and my place in the Kingdom, when things got rough in life that's how they stayed for a long time. I had no way out, no options, nothing else to know rather than my circumstances. But now--I have the options and opportunity to side with truth. Every step is another opportunity to either believe the truth about my heritage and my life or to disagree with heaven. But the thing is, if it were that easy, well, life would be different. And this is the process. I hate it most of the time, but I'm learning that life change happens a little bit at a time, unless of course it doesn't.It's been two years since I read the book--but it still is very much a part of my thoughts and ideas.So if you want your life to remain the same, don't bother reading this book."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book really gives insight into how one can experience all that Jesus paid for. The key word here is experience. Personally I don't need another book that has good and true words, but doesn't really get beyond my head to my heart. This is about life changing experience for myself and so I can give it away to others too! I am a missionary in Central America and have a great need to know that I am loved and to love others."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"After reading this book, life as you know it will never be the same.

Anyone who wants to walk in greater favor with God and man needs to read this book. There are so many things that we do that disqualify us from going higher in our destiny in God. Many of these things are directly related to how we think about ourselves and others.

Kris' writing style matches that of his speaking, both of which present the Good News in such a way that is profound, yet simple and accessible to anyone with an open heart for the truth.The royalty of the believer is an uncommon subject in Christian literature; but in his book, Kris openly shares the various occurences in his personal journey that made this truth his reality. Through key passages in the Scriptures, he reveals the hidden road map to the Bride's seat of honor in Christ, which God ordained long ago.I personally recommend \\"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty,\\" as it has radically changed the way I pray, worship, view leadership, and relate to people. Most of all, understanding now that God sees us favorably has dramatically changed the way I approach Him in our private time.The truth of God's Word, as presented in Kris Vallotton's book, will inspire you toward deeper intimacy with God. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Outside of the scriptures, this is the most significant book that I've ever read. Incredible insight into the truth of the word of God, and His heart for mankind. Kris is transparent about his own life journey. This book is the fruit of a life yielded to God's redemptive power... a slave becomes a son! An incredible life-giving message. Highly recommended!

You carry the very presense of the Living God as a believer. You are no longer a mere human You are a New Creation in Christ Jesus. This Book is a call to live out your Christianity daily. The Kingdom does not come in Word only but in POWER this power is avaliable to you through the Gifts given to you freely by your Father in Heaven."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"After reading Kris' book, I had a whole new level of respect and admiration for him as a \\"Prince\\" of God.

I've bought and given it as gifts, and recommend you read it and do the same!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This is a great book about what we are as christians being princes and princesses and how we should behave to honor the Lord who called us to reign in our every day life and proclaim \\"the kingdom of God is at hand\\". This book is deeply rooted in the scripture and the heart of God and call us to answer to the love of Christ by keeping what He gave us but also practise and testify what the life of the kingdom is \\"a geat and superrnatural life\\". I find Kris Vallotton humble as he shows himself a learning heart in his relationship to Bill Johnson; by the way I read each one of Bill Johnson's great books."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Kris has articulated in very real way our place in the Kingdom of God and where we are in our identity.

I found myself standing taller, more secure and convinced of my worth - to Him first, and to others including myself next. I found that while I was raised with a Pauper mindset - I was already aware of being grafted in to Royalty through Jesus - but implementing it seemed inconsistent at best. I could sense a change deep within my spirit as I turned each page. A new resolve, a deeper trust, a greater love.My book is underlined, highlighted and well-worn... it's been loaned out, re-read, and referenced many, many times! From personal stories, historical teaching, and supernatural wisdom - this book, whether you believe you're a Prince(ss) or a Pauper - is WELL worth the cost. For in it - you will be purchasing a greater level of freedom, confidence (in Him and in yourself,) and a healthier worldview that will enable you to join the movement and bring Heaven to earth in greater measure!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"I have read books by both of these authors Bill Johnson and Kris Valloton and have been thoroughly blessed each time.

A group of 30 men were given the opportunity to work through this book and the accompanying workbook. Wow! Each one came away with their own personal understanding of how their identity has been tied to the lies they had believed about themselves and their circumstances and better yet the truth about who they are and how God sees them. The point Kris made about being held \\"captive' to a lie or a \\"prisoner\\" of sin was very key in exposing the web of lies these guys get entangled in and unraveled much of what has bound them in the name of \\"religion\\". Kris's transparency in his personal testimony was invaluable to them as they identified with the fears, abandonment and failures and saw how God turned what appeared to be a life of ashes into something beautiful and powerful. I recommend this book to everyone and recommend that it be read at least once per year and the royalty test be taken at least once per year as well. It will show you how much you are growing in your understanding line upon line, precept upon precept establishing your transformation into a son (or daughter).

The Holy Spirit worked through these words to help me transform my mind. I finally came into a realization of who I am as a daughter of the King!

So many people do not understand what he eloquently communicates. Other religions drive you to your knees and leave you there. Christianity has you bow your knee to accept the Lord, and then raises you up to stand for Him, adopted as sons and daughters of the King, royalty. What? Are you afraid people will become proud?

Understanding our identity in Christ is foundational in our faith walk & I haven't quite gotten there yet, but I do know that God used this book to help bring more revelation and understanding to me in this area. I am desperately desiring more & more to go from the prison to the palace, from a pauper to a princess!

So many people think their worth and value is rapped up in how much they give in an offering, how much they worship their pastor and never reach their God given destiny because people will make you think that your entire destiny in God is tied to being a member of their church or under their covering. If many great evangelist and kingdom shakers would have waited on their leaders to give them the push they needed they would still be singing in the choir, or ushering instead of doing world wide outreaches.

It talks about our identity in Christ - we are no longer sinners, but saints, once we are born again. Although I have read and heard of many teachings about our identity in Christ, this book best illustrates the implications of truly believing that we are His children and how it not only affects our personal lives, but also the people around us. It is absolutely life changing and when a congregation truly catches the truths contained therein, will completely transform that church into a spiritual force to be reckoned with. It is especially noteworthy that the truths contained in this book are clearly not just theory, but have been distilled out after many years of living them out in community - it really works and is proven to be extremely powerful."},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"This book really defines who we are in Christ!

Chris has done an excellent job of doing that and is an excellent communicator. He shares many examples from his own life and others that help you understand what he teaches.

Of anyone I know (with the exception of Steve Thompson), Kris Vallotton is the best at teaching people who they really are. Many Christians will not like this book because they simply have a hard time believing that God thinks they're awesome. It sucks to be them. You have to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"Kris Vallotton is clearly a false prophet in the truest sense, and you only have to read the first two pages to understand why. The whole premise of the book is based on a \\"conversation\\" he has with God (while awake). As such, he is claiming to report the very words of God. This is dangerous ground, and 1 John 4:1 tells us to \\"test the spirits to see whether they are from God\\". How do we test spirits? We compare what they say to the real, unchanging revelation of God in Scripture.I will quote from page 22 words that Kris claims to have come from the very mouth of God: \\"Moses was born to lead the Israelites out of slavery. Moses had to be raised in Pharaoh's house so that he would learn how to be a prince and not have a slave's mentality. A leader who is in slavery internally cannot free those who are in slavery externally. The first 40 years of Moses' life were just as important as the 40 years he spent in the wilderness.\\"Kris also says this about Moses on page 22: \\"I'm sure that everyone would laugh at his jokes, even if they weren't funny. Because Moses knew he was significant, he had confidence. I saw that without confidence he never would have felt empowered to do anything to help his Hebrew brothers.\\"So Kris is claiming special insight from God about Moses. One problem. What he says about Moses completely contradicts what the Bible says.If being raised in the \\"royalty\\" of Pharaoh's house was so important, why does the author of Hebrews write this in chapter 11? \\"By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.\\" Did you catch that? Better to be mistreated with the people of God than enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. So much for the benefits of royalty.But there's more.What does the Bible tell us about the \\"confidence\\" of Moses? This is what Moses said to God after God told him to go to Egypt \\"Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.\\" (Exodus 4:11) The life of the party? Full of confidence? The quick witty guy with all the good jokes? No. Moses said \\"Send someone else.\\" (Exodus 4:13)So what does God do? Does he give Moses a pep talk to remind him of his \\"royal heritage\\"? No! He sends someone else to speak for Moses. And who does he send? Someone else from the royal court who understands they are a prince? No, he sends Moses' brother (who was raised as a slave) to speak for the guy raised in royalty. The irony is rich.Are there any slivers of truth in this book? Sure. But that's to be expected. Paul said this about guys like Kris Vallotton: \\"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their ends will correspond to their deeds.\\" (2 Corinthians 11:13-15).Don't be fooled by the good reviews. This is a dangerous book. God doesn't use people because they are raised in a culture and expectation of royalty. Who does he use?\\"God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him.\\" (1 Cor. 1:27-29) Amen!"},{"Title":"The Supernatural Ways of Royalty: Discovering Your Rights and Privileges of Being a Son or Daughter of God","review":"...

Lewis. The story of their marriage and of her tragic, premature death of cancer was already familiar to me from a number of sources, mostly focused on Lewis; yet I knew only generalities concerning Davidman's earlier life in America. Dorsett himself is not a flawless writer, but his work here is built on extensive research into his subject's many letters, the reminiscences of friends and surviving family, and her own writings. The endnotes at the back of my edition thus span eleven pages. Overall I found the account engaging and a helpful new perspective. The hardships (even those somewhat self-inflicted) of Davidman's younger years, and her once deeply ingrained biases, cast her later Christian faith in a fresh and more impressive light. I also gradually recognized this volume as the source of many details portrayed in the original 1985 BBC-TV rendering of SHADOWLANDS (superior to the 1993 cinematic version) which I had encountered nowhere else and long thought apocryphal. Although these two very different individuals certainly found (or were Led to) each other at a time when they needed the love and support their friendship and eventual marriage would provide, Dorsett is correct in asserting that Joy deserves better than to have her own life's record 'obscured by the shadow of C.S. Lewis'. I rather think Jack would have been the first to agree, and to applaud this admirable attempt at re-introducing the world to a remarkable woman of full humanity (with all the good and bad which that implies) yet ardent faith."},{"Title":"And God Came in","review":"And God Came In is subtitled \\"an extraordinary love story,\\" and it is that. The story of the love between C. S. Lewis and Joy Davidman is told mostly from Joy's point of view, and their love only occupies about a third of the book. Maybe the love the title refers to is not that between Jack and Joy, but that between God and Joy?Dorsett begins with Joy's childhood in New York, tells of her years as a poet, then a communist propagandist. (Not glossing over the foolish things she said in defense of the Soviet Union.) He describes her relationship with her first husband, who does not come across as an ogre, though squarely to blame for the couple's troubles. He describes how Joy became disillusioned with communism, the growth of the couple's family, and her spiritual awakening.Dorsett handles the \\"and God came in\\" part well. It does sound like it was God who took the initiative. Dorsett neither downplays the mystical side of Joy's relationship to God, or her apparent healing, nor sensationalizes either. Joy could still be a pill! The twists and turns make the story itself interesting. It is also interesting because of Joy's rough honesty, and of course interesting to us die-hard Lewis fans. Dorsett is a judicious and informed story-teller; not brilliant, but wise enough not to not get in the way of the story. Douglas Gresham's Lenten Lands is a good complement to this book (I especially like the scenes that show Joy in her mother tigress mode), as, I expect, will be the third volume of Lewis' letters, due out late 2005 I think. Joy's Smoke on the Mountain is also still available, and pretty good, as I recall."},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"Like A SHORT HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR, Pratt's BATTLES THAT CHANGED HISTORY is a terrific entry-level volume, especially for the young reader. He combines a snappy, thrilling writing style with a keen ability to explain complex historical situations and an original thesis about the role of military power in world history.The key to this book is the phrase &quot;Changed History&quot; in the title. In his introduction, Pratt takes pains to distinguish his list of battles from those of the progenitor of the genre, Sir Edward Creasy, whose &quot;Fifteen Decisive Battles&quot; provided the inspiration for Pratt's work. Pratt notes that so many famous Western battles (e.g. Hastings or Tours) actually played a defensive or reinforcing role in history rather than &quot;changing history.&quot; This insight leads Pratt to choose some battles that many might view as eccentric (e.g. Beneventum, the original &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot;, rather than, say, Zama, which ended the Second Punic War). It is Pratt's rationale for these choices, expressed in clear, crisp prose, that makes this book so valuable for younger readers in need of a boost in their motivation to read history."},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"The title of Fletcher Pratt's book, The Battles that Changed History, sets forth Pratt's theme. He believes that battle can be decisive, the underdog can win, changing the course of history for good. The book is twenty examples supporting this theme. He takes classical Greece versus the Persian Empire for his first example. The Persian Empire was much much larger than the Hellenic city states. Despite smashing Greek victories at Marathon and Salamis, the Persians survived and prospered and by the end of the Peloponnesian War Sparta was accepting Persian subsidies to prosecute the war against Athens. Sparta won and imposed a crushing peace treaty. Pratt feels that in the ordinary course of events, the surviving Greek city states would have been gradually absorbed into the Persian empire, leading to quite a different history from what happened. In real history, Alexander came upon the scene, invaded and defeated the Persian Empire in head to head combat, leading to a Hellenistic Age, where Greek culture dominated the entire Mediterranean basin.Pratt is a lively writer, with many good history books and much good science fiction and fantasy to his credit. He describes the era, the players, and the background as well as the events. He has some wonderful turns of phrase, such as \\"The Greeks had to go imperial to make it stand up.\\" or \\"Within the omens instantly became favorable. The Romans poured out like a swarm of hornets...\\"I first read this book in high school. Many years, and a college degree in history later, it's still good, and Pratt's basic theme is still very tenable. His knowledge of his subjects and their periods is very deep."},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"Few writers can make history read like a story while at the same time educate with a multitude of facts. Pratt is one and this book is an excellent example."},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"My book was missing thirty pages. That's right, thirty pages were simply missing (225 through 256). Very strange. Easy solution is to return it. But this is a reference book and I highlight, make notes in the margins, underline etc, so I don't want to return it after 224 pages of that. So basically I'm left with the option of buying a second copy and hoping that all the pages are in the book (or at least the pages that are missing in the copy I received). I guess in the future I'll count all the pages in a book I buy from amazon BEFORE I start reading it. Nice job amazon.By the way, its a good book. I recommend it. Just count the pages when you get it . . ."},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"This book was an unexpected goldmine. It's not just one of my favorite military history books, it's one of my favorite books.In the introduction, the author announces that he will select battles that he can demonstrate changed the path of history from its previous momentum. (OK, *western* history.) To me, this sounded beyond audacious, it was a red flag that this author had probably over-reached and was not a good sign. It sounded long and boring.I can only say that if he did not successfully meet this goal, he certainly convinced me otherwise. He starts most episodes by plunging into the middle of a scene with virtually no context, leaving the reader (me anyway) slightly lost. This technique turned me off at first, but he quickly and efficiently zooms out to show the background of the events, then teases apart the critical threads and, pardon the clich&eacute;, unravels history before your eyes. He then explains how the outcome was a dramatic shift from the previous course of things and what the new course implied. Everything is cogent and straightforward, with few if any questions left hanging.One example: what exactly did happen when Greece first met Rome? Part of the allure is that he exposes battles most people never heard of, but, in his hands anyway, were crucial turning points of western civilization. You end up wondering how it was you never heard of these. (Well, I hadn't, anyway.)A few notes on the objectivity: I can only assume that many of his conclusions are controversial, and our understanding of some events may have changed based on later research. It's like reading The Economist in that the author doesn't pretend not to have an opinion on the matter. Some of it comes off as downright editorial. For example, some Catholics may be offended at his view that the unsuccessful quenching of the Protestant forces was a victory for independent thought in Europe. That being said, most of the battles center around obsolete political causes, and he's dry-humored and unsentimental. He gets to the point and doesn't gloss over faults or atrocities on either side.The other book I enjoyed this much was John Kagan's Peloponnesian War. I thought Thucydides was mind-numbing, while Kagan's was a gripping narrative that should be put on screen. (Putting Pratt on screen would be interesting as well, but it would require quite a bit of narration to get the real value of the book, which involves large- and small-scale analysis, not just dramatic events in sequence.)The Peloponnesian War"},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"good book for understanding of battles and campaigns that affected western civilization. read with the view that currently western civilization is at a crisis point. which happens next: kadisiyah or las navas de tolosa?"},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"I loved this book as a teenager, and read it several times. But ongoing reflection, as well as teaching and graduate study in history, leads me to offer a more qualified recommendation. Pratt's core idea, that warfare can decisively affect the course of history, is quite sound. But his rather offhand view of war outside the Western world is not supportable. Pratt asserts that truly decisive battles influencing history occurred only in the West; elsewhere, victories changed nothing, and usually victors were simply absorbed by the societies they subjected.This notion sadly reinforces an ethnocentric view that non-Western peoples somehow stand outside history, and that nothing ever really changes for them. Like many specialists in US and European history glancing at the whole world, Pratt proceeds from inattention and/or ignorance in generalizing, even stereotyping, on topics beyond his expertise. Such an assertion plainly overlooks many examples of the decisive character of warfare in Asia and Africa, with or without European participation---the conquests of Jinghiz Khan and his successors, Japan's conquest of Singapore in 1942, Ethiopia's 1896 triumph over Italy at Adowa, the effects of slaving wars in Africa, etc.Pratt renders persuasive accounts of decisive Western battles in clear, lively prose. But misjudging the miltary experience of the rest of the world weakens his case, which through fuller research could be extended fruitfully to encompass the globe. The whole subject requires further examination; there's plenty of work for numerous scholars to tackle, and this should ultimately show that Pratt's thesis is indeed applicable on a worldwide scale. Ultimately, military historians have moved beyond the Alexandrian/Napoleonic conception of decisive battlefield victory to an appreciation of the total process of war in winning conflicts.For more on the nonhistorical \\"nature\\" of non-Western societies and the processes which integrated them into a European-dominated global system, read Eric Wolf, \\"Europe and the People Without History\\" and Chinweizu, \\"The West and the Rest of Us.\\" For Asians' and Africans' encounter with Western military technology, strategy and tactics, see Geoffrey Parker, \\"The Military Revolution\\" and Daniel Headrick, \\"The Tools of Empire.\\" M. Saul & P. Royer, \\"West African Challenge To Empire\\" & J. Thornton, \\"Warfare in Atlantic Africa\\" show how African wars were actually fought."},{"Title":"The Battles That Changed History","review":"Fletcher Pratt makes history come alive in these short, challenging chapters.

So this is otensibly high powered advice aimed at \\"C-Level\\" executives and those who aspire to C-Level status. The actual content of the book is simple, verging on simplistic. This is an anthology of short, generally breezy articles from recent HBS newsletters giving advice so basic you wonder how the readers got to be where they are without knowing this stuff.The main point of this book is that a company can't be successful unless workers are actually rewarded for doing their jobs competently (or better.) It is a sad commentary on the state of Corporate America that this point even needs to be made. Another strangely obvious revelation in this book is that workers are more productive when management makes sure they have the tools they need to do their jobs.In any case, this is (for the most part) a readable book, just the right size and length to read on your next plane flight.

One thing I've noticed about most SF books from the 60s/70s is that writers expected tape to last a long time. It comes in two parts, and the second part is much more fun (most of the time). The SF writers were also very optimistic about progress in space. And truthfully, I think humans could have pulled something off in the time frame of this book more realistically if they weren't so busy killing each other. Nevertheless, I found this novel, fun and interesting. The role of women is ancient for a story based in the future, but other than that, I recommend this book because it's original and I didn't find it predictable at all."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"I read a few of Larry Niven's novels and story collections when I was in high school. I remember him as an author who would take an interesting speculative idea and chase it to an imaginative extreme, while still keeping a foot in the readable realms of popular science fiction.Protector, one of Niven's earlier books, is a bit rough around the edges, but a fun ride. The plotting of this First Contact story is a little uneven and most of the characters aren't too memorable, but the story includes classic Larry Niven elements such as creative use of science, ethical dilemmas, a libertarian-minded asteroid belt society, humans being themselves, and a perhaps-not-as-alien-as-we-might-think alien invader. The first half is a little slow, but the story picks up steam in the second half.All in all, not a bad choice for fans or new readers.

Niven deals with concepts here that aren't really picked up by other authors until the cyberpunk explosion in the 80's, that is, what it means to be human and what's the next step?Protector is about humanity, posthumanity, and the difference between the two. Niven shows the cost of a greater intelligence and strength, especially how the enhanced human is, simply, no longer human.In a way, Protector stands with Niven's assorted earlier Known Space works, especially Flatlander and A Gift From Earth, in that it not only is an enjoyable work of hard science fiction, but that it also leaves plenty of food for thought."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"This is just one book in the golden series of stories about known space. It helps greatly in understanding Ringworld series, but that is not the only quality it has. It is a gripping story filled with vivid characters and very plausible plot."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Even in the world of hard science-fiction authors, Larry Niven is a bit peculiar. His ideas, while always grounded in the physical sciences and defensible, are frequently beyond any kind of normal, logical leap. Niven's longtime collaborator Jerry Pournelle (&quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot;, among others) has been quoted as saying that he writes with Niven because Niven &quot;is the crazy one.&quot;&quot;Ringworld&quot; is Niven's most enduring work, but &quot;Protector&quot; is, in some ways, a better example of his talent for amazing logical leaps. Niven has described the premise this way: &quot;Every symptom of aging in man is an aborted version of something designed to make us stronger. In particular, we lose intelligence with age because we were supposed to grow more brain tissue, when the thymus gland dissolves around age 42-45.&quot;In &quot;Protector,&quot; this thesis is demonstrated by the appearance of the first alien species to contact humanity: the Pak. We learn that Earth was a failed Pak colony; homo habilis is the Pak breeder stage. At about middle age, homo habilis was supposed to eat a certain plant that would trigger the change to the sexless, armored, highly intelligent protectors. Pak protectors have other notable traits as well, some of which may come as a surprise to those used to more traditional tales of immortality.This is an early Niven story, and plotting was not his strong point until relatively recently. Mainly the plot is a thinly-veiled excuse to learn more about the Pak. Of the characters, only centegenarian Lucas Garner and belter Jack Brennan seem to be more than placeholders. The ideas in the novel, however, make up for many of the more obvious flaws.I'm not qualified to comment on the scientific plausibility of Niven's ideas. I will note that some linguists have ridiculed Niven's use of &quot;Pak&quot; and &quot;Phssthpok&quot; as words invented by a species with a hard beak for a mouth, and no lips. More recent fossil discoveries have suggested that our evolutionary heritage may be far more complex than was known in 1973, but Niven can hardly be blamed for not anticipating new scientific discoveries in the interim.Other reviewers have noted that this novel was later referenced heavily by Niven's &quot;Ringworld&quot; novels, particularly &quot;Ringworld Engineers&quot; and &quot;Ringworld Throne.&quot; You don't need to read this one to enjoy the Ringworld novels, but it's definitely more fun that way.For Niven fans, I recommend this book without hesitation. For those who haven't yet met Larry Niven, pick up &quot;Ringworld&quot; first."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"This is a crucial book to read to gain the full picture of what is involved in the Ringworld novels. The Pak Protectors are quite a race. They are both complicated in origin, but simple in purpose.

Larry Niven is a genius at the technical side of Science Fiction, and this novel was facinating and filled with action. I enjoyed it from many angles."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Often overlooked in comparission to the Ringworld series of books is Protector.

What is this lost colony? Well it is the third planet from a medium yellow star. Phssthpok sets into motion a set of events that will change all of Known Space.You can read other novels of Known Space without ever reading Protector but reading it makes the expierence all the more richer.Would you trade away some of your humanity to become faster, stronger, smarter and nearly immortal?

Boy, was I in for a surprise. The biggest was that very little time was spent with the original alien at all; in all the story was passed through three different narrators before its completion - not a challenge to the story but interesting when I had expected the main voice to stick with grandpa-ET the whole time.What did I like about this book? I liked the fact that it recognized that people were missing something. Even though we've evolved into this form and this way of life - we are missing something; and although the author didn't put this much into words he did address it indirectly by providing the solution: we weren't always like this.In fact, at one time we were very different from who we are now as a species, and something happened that made us lose a part of ourselves, a part that we've been missing ever since - and that msising has been gnawing away at us for some time.I liked the book. I read it in a single sitting, so it wasn't hard to go with. It turned out well; a little lackluster as far as endings go and maybe the plot didn't move as fast as it could. The problems that characters faced were all solved without much effort or ingenuity involved on their parts, seemingly - and I didn't find myself engaged by that much. Sure there was some killing and explosions - but those aren't why I read books and they aren't that good in books anyway.I would read it again, it was worth the $4 I paid for it buying it from Powell's in Portland, but Amazon has some great copies too I'm sure, I just didn't want to wait for them to arrive.Good luck, and enjoy discerning if there's a little Pak in you too.Dr. Dominic Ebacherebacherdom.blogspot.com071108.0221"},{"Title":"Protector","review":"What can you say about this tale to someone who hasn't read it?

Also, this novel is one that most of the other Known Space stories refer to, making it a must for any Larry Niven fan.The story of the Pak Protectors is also essental to the Ringworld saga, as anyone who read The Ringworld Engineers would know.

The Moon, Mars, Mercury, asteroid mining, spaceships, fusion drives, human hibernation to cope with long journeys and boredom...the hard sci-fi fan has plenty to enjoy here. Niven is good at picking up realistic science, across the disciplines, particularly physics and biology, and taking the ideas to the next stage, and the next, and the next. By and large it hangs together well. But the real reason I like this one is the entertaining alien species, the Pak. The pinnacle of evolutionary success for this race is the Protector, the full-adult warrior class member who lives to fight and further his genetic blood line by winning territory and destroying all competition. It is as if Mr Niven anticipated Dawkin's 'Selfish Gene' hypothesis and 'Independence Day' in a leap of the imagination one day in the early 1970's. The nearest thing on earth to the Pak was probably the militaristic Spartan civilisation of ancient Greece. And now the Pak are coming. Earth is a failed Pak colony, a two-and-a-half million year old experiment gone awry. Man was never meant to evolve under his own steam. They want their territory back..."},{"Title":"Protector","review":". . . is the last sentence of this novel, and leaves us with just the right swirl of emotion and wonder gyrating in our minds as we close the book. As others have pointed out, Niven's ideas often carried his stories - much more so than his plotting. But the plots explore the ideas in a way that is pure ambrosia for the hungry mind of a reader who enjoys having their imagination stretched. These are thought-out ideas, with ramifications that Niven presents to us quickly and succinctly. In the ancient tradition of all good reading, Niven's 'Protector' presents possibilities with implications, that have you looking up from the book for a moment, to let what you just read process in your mind.You don't just feel entertained ... you've grown. The idea that the aging process in humans is really a vestigial remnant of a metamorphosis to another form is pure Niven, and pure fascination, and just waiting to hear more about it produces enough anticipation in the reader to replace any deficits in plot. Watching a Pak mind solve problems is another of the hugely entertaining and mind-expanding aspects of this story. The Pak could have ruled the galaxy,but for their hormonal imperative to employ all of their matchless strength and intellect to just protecting their own bloodline against other Protectors. The Brennan-monster's base, Kobold, where he manipulated gravity as easily as a magnetic field,is yet another banquet of ideas. It may be that Niven's mind was so caught up in imagining these things, that his story plots were just delivery vehicles for them. But even then, there was method; once we had a Pak mind on our side -Brennan- the events of the story progress for reasons that are 10 steps ahead of us - and we enjoy playing catch-up as we read more. The details of interpersonal relationships is one place where Niven struggled as a writer - something his friend Jerry Pournelle helped with in their collaborations. But in a very real way, in a very Niven way, this novel was a story of the visceral love a transformed human had for all of his own kind. He had become a Protector. There were a lot of technical problems he had to solve, a lot of strategy to analyze, a lot of . .ideas . . for a reader to consider, but out of all the \\"hard scifi\\" there coalesced, unambiguously and poignantly, a love story."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"A short, pithy book that starts with a cracking idea, loses its way in the middle then ends with a complex, yet thrilling finale.

When Brennan kills the alien he saves humanity, yet there is a tragic side to the Pak's death.The second half is consistently the most uninspired in the Known Space series, and I can't believe that Niven wrote this just after Ringworld.

There's almost nothing new, unless you get a kick reading about military technology (I don't).

Premise: that humanity is an evolved offshoot of an alien species, that has decided to come knocking after 3 million years. This alien species has a third stage in its life cycle, and the consequences of this third stage provide the motivation for the actions of the main characters in the storyline. Definitely an enjoyable quick read."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Cunning. Let's just start with that word - cunning. This can describe the penmanship of Larry Niven and it can also describe the Brennan-monster, or the species of the Pak (which in Thai can mean vegetable, odd considering what the Pak eat). Cunning can also describe the plot, though I think the word \\"original\\" would be more fitting.I just loved scope of this book and it's originality. The concept could have dragged out into a longer epic, however. I wasn't satisfied enough in the end. Even after reading this, four years later, I'm still drawn back to the atmosphere that the book produced- it's creepy, forgiving, and hopeful. The older cover is captivating and it's probably one of Niven's finer works."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Throughout the Known Space books there's mention of the Tree Of Life Root and Protectors.

Where does Arthritis *really* come from? Curious? Read the book!"},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Just re-read this for the first time in about 15 years and what a great book it still is. Niven is such a talented writer, the technology and science is fascinating but ultimately it is the small touches that make it work.

It has it all: bizzare aliens, heroic humans, mysteries, and the best relativistic space battles on paper.Niven is the worlds most amazing author because he mixes real science (Well, not biology, but it's still fun) with well worked out characters and a good plot.Put 'em together, and you get a modern-day epic.

I had been braced by various short stories so I was somewhat prepared for his style..WRONG!Then there came 'Protector' a solid Hard-Science-Fiction novel that has become to me a reference point for all other Sci-Fi works. IF at times we feel humanity is groping along and 'missing' something..if we long for a 'Higher Power' guess what..we SHOULD be!A lone Protector (PAK) a not-so-Alien arrives retracing a very long previous voyage to a humanity that has mastered the Solar System and striving to the Stars. We've gone astray we've not developing according to ..not a plan..but according to our very nature!But Viva la Difference does not exist, and is in fact anathema to our ancestors the PAK. (Meanwhile) an opportunistic 'Belt' miner accidentally becomes our liason to a race millions of years our senior yet eternally fighting over the most basic primal goals (The protection of HIS/HER Family).. In manners of conflict the PAK can make Malcolm X look like Ghandi on Prozac but at least he's knows that..and imposes a peace so complete the fat and happy Humans take their idyllic existence for granted..When trouble does come from the PAK Homeworld itself the Belter-PAK must defend Billions of helpless Breeders (Humanity) and that is the sticking point..How to do it? Family of Course!This novel explores the basic nature and framework of Mankind and, as another more astute reviewer has noted, 'Mined out every vein of possibility'.This novel is Niven at his best. Read it when your twelve and be filled with wonder. Read it when your forty and read it with a subtle sense of wistfull hope."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Phssthpok is a Pak. After they are done breeding the Pak enter a stage of life known as a protector and during this stage their intellect increases many fold and they essentially become -- barring injury -- immortal. On his home planet, Phssthpok becomes curious about a group of Pak that, two and a half million years earlier left their world near the galactic core and set out to explore and colonize a world in the outer reaches of the galaxy. After many years of study, Phssthpok sets out on his own voyage to find the missing Pak colony. And where does Phssthpok wind up? Our own solar system, of course...and promptly sets about abducting a Human being and setting into action a chain of events that may wind up changing Humanity forever...In Protector, Niven sets the stage for Humanity's first contact with an alien intelligence. Jack Brennan's abduction by Phssthpok is a clever plot device, allowing us to get to know both characters as they change in response to events taking place. While Protector is certainly worth picking up and reading, the story misses the mark in a few places; primarily with the handful of characters that are introduced but we hardly get to know. Nonetheless, there is plenty in this book that is thought-provoking and interesting...and certainly worth the Hugo Award nomination (but no win) it earned. If you enjoy Niven's work but have yet to pick up this tale, I can certainly recommend this story...and even if you are more of a newbie to Niven's stories or science fiction in general, there is enough in Protector to make it a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago, and I still think it's the novel by which other works of science fiction should be judged. It's conceptually enthralling, leaves plenty of loose ends, but has a driving logic behind its narrative, as well as an incisive wit.And now I want to read it again.And I want someone to pick up the film rights, now the CGI is up to the job, and that goes for Ringworld, too!"},{"Title":"Protector","review":"\\"Goodbye and Good Luck. I Love You.\\"These, are the final words of the novel, \\"Protector\\".-unless you have read it you can have -NO CONCEPT- of what leads to those words.And it's IMPOSSIBLE for you to guess, it is TRULY an original drama AND mystery. No, it's not a mushy LOVE-story. This is hardcore Old School SciFi and it's GOOD! And... the fate of humanity rests in the hands of a salesman from a shoe store who hates his job.This is a story about a humanoid species from the center of the galaxy.They call themselves, \\"Pak\\".Their language is a series of hisses and clicks, because they have a beak.The story begins from the point of view of a Pak, named Phssthpok.He's actually on a mission of mercy and he just wants to help us.He's bringing food-plants and fertilizer.He's coming to HELP.He's been traveling in space for 32,000 years, alive AND conscious.He sat in his cockpit, and FLEW for 32,000 years.Watching the stars crawl past his window.He'd occasionally stop to exercise.As he rushed to Earth...Just to save us.By himself.He had received a distress call, so he's obligated to come.His species is very tough, and very smart.He built his own starship to come to us.His people do not build starships -Usually- ...unless they have a reason to.Like this mission.-of mercy.And, he's very dedicated to his species.But when he finally meets us...He's not going to like us.He'll have to kill us.All of us.He has to.At least, he'll try.And he has NO choice in the matter.We're LUCKY he's just delivering food plants, and fertilizer.Because there's a WHOLE PLANET- With millions more, JUST LIKE HIM, who are at war....and THEY won't like us, either.The Pak, have 3 stages in their lives: Child, Breeder, and Protector ('Protector' being the adult-stage). If humans were to meet the breeder stage face to face we would call it... Homo Habilis.The beauty of this STORY is the human drama of 2 men, Jack Brennan, and Roy Trusedale. There is a threat that the entire human species faces, but is entirely and HAPPILY unaware of. Both Jack and Roy end up drawn into something they can NOT control, is FAR larger than themselves, and they have NO power over. Yet, at their fingertips, is the fate of humanity. By the END of the story, you realize the human race NEVER ever knew of the threat! They are so well \\"Protected\\". The manner in which Larry Niven crafts originality out of scientifically accurate and common facts, YET is able to redraw our ENTIRE human history --is what makes the story compelling to a smart reader. The STORY, is truly original.This book, -IS- believe it or NOT, a ROMANTIC NOVEL about the human condition. Larry Niven turns the stage of Old Age, into one of power and control. It is set, in a True Blue, Hard Core, Old School, Sci-Fi Universe of Larry's creation.This would make an AWESOME Movie.Just because of the Human Element.And the Novel stands alone Very Well, as a story (or movie!) in it's own right.And I- would want to PLAY Jack Brennan OR Roy Truesdale -hint-\\"I Love You\\" The last 3 words of the Novel, and it's the ONLY time they are said.And unless you are a FAN- You have NO idea of what KIND of \\"Love\\" it is.You have NO IDEA of where those words leave you HANGING, as in. What's NEXT?For that- you have to have read his series.This is -REAL- science fiction. We are talking survival of the species, because with THOSE words at the End, a huge inter-species war is about to start. And whats more, is the Humans are Never even aware it is happening! They are... \\"Protected\\" by stronger beings.We didn't even KNOW we had \\"relatives\\" elsewhere in the galaxy.Larry Niven has created a universe and a space opera that goes FAR beyond this Novel. In fact it could be the basis for a whole series of great movies. THAT is how HUGE this is. You've GOT to read the story. IF you like classic fiction, you'll most likely LOVE this. The attraction is in the details of this SciFi-drama. Larry re-crafts human origins, very intelligently in this story.Larry Niven, is my absolute favorite author. And No I do not spend every day living/breathing Niven. NOT HARDLY. I have not even re-read Protector in years. But I HAVE re-read protector as well as many of his \\"Known Space\\" series. I absolutely LOVE his humane / decent / civilized / educated and scientifically and technically accurate style. I absolutely LOVE the \\"known-space\\" series, (which this novel is -part- of). The internal CONSISTENCY and Accuracy of all his writing is something that naturally drew me from the start. It is an opera \\"up there\\" with Asimovs Foundation and Robot lines. The human -romance- of THIS PARTICULAR NOVEL \\"Protector\\" --spoke-- to me from my early years. I was a teen-ager, when I read this book. A top-scoring science geek, so I truly appreciated his accurate science and technology. In this book, we discover that Humans did NOT originate on Earth. We come from a planet closer to the center of the galaxy. We also learn that there are actually 3 stages in the \\"proper\\" life of a Human, as lived by our ancestors on our planet of origin. Child, Breeder, and then Protector. Here on Earth we do not have the proper \\"food\\" that allows us to make the change to the final stage. As originally evolved, on the planet of our origins, the \\"Breeder Stage\\" is a barely sentient animal that exists to perpetuate the species. Upon Breeding, we then age, lose interest in Breeding and a biological switch flips. We suddenly have the URGE to eat a specific root, that before now, was repugnant. The root comes from a plant known as \\"The Tree of Life\\" There is a virus in this root, that causes a bodily change. The root also contains hormones, and necessary supplementation to aid certain biological processes- (remember Niven first wrote this as a short story, in 1967 where it appeared in 'Galaxy' magazine in June under the name, \\"The Adults\\"... And, he was writing popular fiction about Viral modification of genetics!) We are suddenly drawn to eat the root- Upon ingestion, the virus affects massive physiological and psychological as well as intellectual reformation. We fall into a coma, as the somatic changes occur. Our skin wrinkles and toughens, teeth fall out and gums fuse with lips to form a beak, of sorts. Our joints enlarge, (sound familar? like symptoms of Old Age maybe?...) our larger joints give a greater moment-arm for greater muscular torque right at the joints (we become massively stronger) our skull softens, and our brain grows... we become more INTELLIGENT... and wake up from the coma. Look around TRULY and fully AWARE--To quote Larry. \\"My premise was a cute one: that every symptom of aging in man is an aborted version of something designed to make us stronger.... Once I accepted that premise I was in deep water.\\"Humans, DO have a Protector stage. And even tho' OUR breeder stage are intelligent, the Protector stage is even More So. And with a re-ordered species-driven initiative. An instinctually driven set of urges.From the Novel,\\"Every human protector must wake this way.A Pak wakes sentient for the first time. But a human protector has human memories. Now he wakes clear-headed, with even greater intelligence, and remembers, and thinks with a certain amount of embarassment: \\"I've been stupid\\". ... And If this message reaches you, then a Pak fleet that was tough enough to destroy us is following just behind this laser pulse, at near lightspeed......Now MOVE!\\""},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Imagine a race of beings that:Are so hyper-intelligent that they never invented computers. It never occured to them to devise a machine to help them think.Abandoned interstellar travel because it was useless. Except to kill off a few close-by competitive races.

They don't grow old since they always die a violent death.Are amazingly strong with lightning-quick reflexes.Are Very warlike.Are EXTREME XENOPHOBES.And you have to fight them. Actually, this would be a good basis for another Niven book. But Protector does a great job of introducing this race to his future history. The middle third of the story is rather slow, but it picks up again for the final third. Great book. And essential to understand, not just the one or two books that other have mentioned (giving away part of the plot for those books)but the place of Humanity in the Known Space Universe.A Protector could eat a Klingon for lunch. And wouldn't even enjoy it. A Must Read for the space-loving scifi fan."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"I love this novel. It's stayed with me for years, so I bought it again and it still packs a punch. There is one scene in particular, a doctor is doing a biopsy on a copse and finds a chunk of the yam-like tuber involved inside the corpse's stomach. Beyond temptation, the doctor eats the piece of root while the nurses stand-by aghast. Yuck! But it made the point of how driven by instinct we can be. A lovely thought that the idiocy of mankind is attributable to a stalled adolescent development. An intriguing thought of what it would be like to grow up."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"\\"Protector\\" by Larry Niven is a very short book of around 215 pages, but it is jam packed full of intriguing futuristic technologies, plenty of space-operatic drama and a very thought provoking idea of the origin of the human species...all wonderfully self-contained and fabricated in a few pages! The story starts to take off immediately within the first few pages, of which we learn of Phssthpok, the protector, and his long journey across the galaxy in his spaceship using a Bussard ramjet fusion drive. Phssthpok has survived a thousand year long interstellar journey solely off of the \\"nourishment\\" of a tree-of-life root and his resolve of finding those of his Pak species that he must protect. Those of the Pak species left their homeworld thousands upon thousands of years ago, and Phssthpok, with his enhanced intelligence, believes to have triangulated them to a blue orb somewhere in the spiral arms of the Milky Way...The main features of this book that I thoroughly enjoyed were the adherence to basic scientific principles, which I believe is entirely lost on most Sci-fi authors. Niven's handling of time dilation and relativistic corrections due to interstellar space travel are extremely well done; there are no instantaneous hyper-accelerations to the other side of universe, because the farthest the reader travels is Alpha Centauri (quite the believable destination for Niven's technology). His grasp of plasma physics and similar concepts are well envisioned in discussions of ramjet fusion drives spaceships, as well as the \\"singleships\\" used in cruising through the asteroid belt and outer Trojan points, i.e. space travel in Niven's universe seems completely plausible and not a contrived fantasy. Plus, the idea of a populated asteroid belt at places like Ceres, Vesta, etc. was great to imagine with an entirely new \\"Belter\\" society complete with their trademark haircuts and low gravity quirks. But the coup de grace, was Niven's playful approach he took towards gravity, and especially his concept of the \\"gravity polarizer\\". A lot of awesome ideas, from a gravity lens telescope, to stasis field contained Neutronium spheres and Moebius toroid ecosystems abound, plus lots of other interesting off the wall ideas. For being such a short book this is definitely worth your time, as there is enough science fiction in this one volume to fill up Brin's entire catalogue of Uplift rubbish. A word to all the Robert Jordan's out there...you don't need a millions pages for an awesome story!!!! Quality not quantity!!!"},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Reading this book is like eating peanuts. Once you start you can't stop. This is about the best of Niven's know space books.

The story is enjoyable, and Larry injects a perfect quantity of layman-esque hard sci-fi to satisfy your cravings.

Also, it offers yet another great hypothesis of mankind's origins."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"I read all of Niven, and Protector isn't just my favorite of his works, it's my all-time favorite book. Through the Protectors' actions, Niven did a great job convincing the reader that Protectors are hyper-intelligent beings.

However, I have a small problem with the science. If I understand relativity correctly, the Pak scout ships would not be able to pass the breeder ships. In effect, both would be going at virtually the speed of light, and the scout ships would lag by a constant amount. Furthermore, a spaceship orbiting a neutron star would have to be moving fast, and in order for a projectile to hit the star, it would have to cancel out all this velocity. Unless the ship were a great number of A.U.'s from the star, a shotgun wouldn't be able to do this. Still, this was one of Niven's earlier works, so let's cut him some slack. All in all, it was quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"\\"Protector\\" is one of my favorite novels.

I listen to recorded books while using my stationery bike, and I just finished listening to this book for the second time, so I wanted to share my experience of this product. The sound quality of the book is first rate, and the reader is excellent. His rendition of Jack Brennan's post-protector voice seems spot-on. My problem is with Audible.com's prices. They are too high. I downloaded \\"Protector\\" at their \\"special introductory price\\" of $9.95. (Apparently you can \\"join\\" Audible and download books for some discounted price, but book or music club obligations have never appealed to me.) $10 seems like a hell of a lot of money to me, considering that you do not actually get anything physical, and you therefore must either download to your MP3 player or (as I did,) \\"burn\\" it to CD and rustle up a suitable cover picture from a Larry Niven web-site. If Audible.com would bring their prices down to $4 or $5 (at least for older titles,) and drop the confining policy of joining them, I would enthusiastically purchase many books from them."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"Time after time Larry Niven's powers of scientific speculation and extrapolation left me gaping.This book is not cruicial to the understanding of &quot;Ringworld&quot; , as one of the reviwers claimed , but it will add a welcome information and explanations as to it's origins and the true origin of humans.The Pac race is brilliantly presented and is fascinating. They are all geniuses and super-intellectuals - forced to live by their insticts.THE PLOT :Psssst-Poc is a offspringless-pac - and that's trouble. he must find a purpose for living or he'll just lose his appetite and die.Going trough the grand archives of his race library while allready starving , he finds a clue as to the whereabouts of a lost Pac colony.The lost cuase gives purpose to his life. He builds a spaceship (first time I understood how a ramscoop works , and I was 11 when I read it for the first time!), and goes on a 32,000 years trip. Don't worry , due to the speed of his ship and relativity he'll only age about 30,000 years.Oh , yeah. I forgot to say that pacs can live thousands of years. nobody knows how many , cause they die violent deaths all the time , or lose their appetites.Anyway , when Pssst-poc arrives earth (didn'tcha get it already?) he's amazed the star-faring civilization he sees and it's advenced technolegy. and the pacs have changed. they're mutants!From this point on the story really soars into a wonderfull exemple of scientific theory (in both fields of evolution and phisics) , Niven-style action , and great universe-building (the &quot;known-space&quot; is considered , in my opinion , the best).Niven's charecterizations are remarkeble , his writing is pure reading pleasure , his ideas and conceptions are strikingly bright , and the story - as fluent as water.It is a book you will remember , being a Niven fan or not.To those who read every known-space book or short story - I think that apart from &quot;Ringworld&quot; itself , &quot;Protector&quot; is the best known-space novel.

Larry Niven integrates the science into the background when it should be and let's the human element guide the story.

Apparently it's feasible to zoom around the solar system in a matter of hours with virtually unlimited fuel."},{"Title":"Protector","review":"PROTECTOR was Larry Niven's fourth full-length novel in the Known Space universe, and the last Known Space work written before the series' decline in the mid-1970's. PROTECTOR is a tale of how human beings came about, a story made apparent by the arrival of an outsider in human space.Phssthpok, a member of the Pak species, has travelled for thirty-thousand years to investigate what happened to colonists that set out from his world three million years before. The Pak have two stages of life, a &quot;breeder&quot; stage of limited intelligence, and a &quot;Protector&quot; stage which comes about once they have eaten the root &quot;tree-of-life.&quot; Protectors are nearly-immortal, extremely strong individuals who are driven to protect their bloodline at all costs. If a protector has no progeny to protect, he either loses his appetite and dies or manages to feel that the entire Pak species is his family.Jack Brennan, a miner of the asteroid belt, is the first to meet Phssthpok when he reaches the solar system in the 2130's. Brennan eats the tree-of-life root and becomes a protector, revealing that human beings are the remnant of the Pak colony of three-million years ago, but that colony couldn't produce tree-of-life because of a lack of thallium oxide in the soil. Phssthpok dies and Brennan, having become a monster, disappears. Thus ends the first half of the novel, which originally appeared in 1967 as the novella &quot;The Adults.&quot;The second half of the novel occurs two hundred years later. Roy Truesdale, an inhabitant of Earth, wakes up to find a cassette explaining in his own voice that the last four months of his life have been wiped from his memory. Truesdale sets out with a policewoman from the Belt to explain the mystery of those four months. He meets the man no calling himself the Brennan-monster and agrees to help him destroy the wave of Pak ships which left to follow Phssthpok. The ending is surprising and well-written.PROTECTOR is not the best of the Known Space novels, that honor certainly belongs to Niven's award-winning RINGWORLD. However, PROTECTOR is an entertaining novel and at a mere 200 pages can be swiftly read. It also fills in a gap in the Known Space timeline (the 2300s), which fell between the era of Lucas Garner (PROTECTOR, WORLD OF PTAAVS, FLATLANDER, etc) and the arrival of alloplasty on Plateau (A GIFT FROM EARTH). Finaly, reading PROTECTOR is necessary to understanding the sequels to RINGWORLD.

In some quarters - at least, it has become fashionable to regard D.T. Suzuki as 'passe' - a bridge builder, whose work has now reached its 'sell-by' date. While I can see why some people might feel that way - if training with a Roshi, or tired of 'reading too much' - Suzuki's 'essays' continue to have relevance for people making their first dip into the world of Zen.In one sense, you could say that Suzuki wants to say too much, and the 'purists' may fault him for it. But he was good at his job - and knew exactly how to write about such things for a Western audience, saying enough to entice them and whet their appetite, then drop them in at the deep end! His way of doing this was lively and engaging. Suzuki was a good communicator (he had an American wife, which certainly helped. Beatrice Lane Suzuki was an accomplished student of Buddhism in her own right) - and, in some respects, Suzuki was more successful than some of the roshis teaching in the West. He wasn't trying to sell you an institution, but pointing to the 'treasure house' we must all find, for ourselves.One thing is worth noting about Suzuki's 'essays.' For the most part, the anecdotes he has presented were taken from the T'ang masters in the Dentoroku (Chuan Teng Lu). You get a pretty fair spread of teaching-examples, and they are not all from masters in the Rinzai (Lin-chi) lineage. In the T'ang, there was no such sharp division between the Zen schools and in that sense, Suzuki's account has a freshness about it.Suzuki will not bog you down with laboured academic digressions. He was rather slap-dash about footnotes - and as such, you get the very 'marrow' of Zen teaching. Suzuki had his foibles - but, he remains the 'grand old man of Zen' who whetted our appetite. These essays have life in them yet! Digest Suzuki. You wont regret it!"},{"Title":"Essays in Zen Buddhism, first series (His Complete works)","review":"Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki (1870-1966) was a Japanese author of books and essays on Buddhism, Zen and Shin that were instrumental in spreading interest in both Zen and Shin to the West.

On the other hand, Zen masters so called are unable to present their understanding in the light of modern thought... unfortunately from the scholarly point of view, they ... do not show any lively intellectual interest in the psychology and philosophy of Zen... it is thus incapacitated to walk out of the seclusion of the cloisters... great mistake it would be if one should ever take ... that Zen could be mastered from its philosophical presentation or its psychological description; but this ought not to mean that Zen is not to be intelligently approached or to be made somewhat accessible by our ordinary means of reasoning... This book is a collection of the Essays originally published in 'The Eastern Buddhist'... The book will be followed by (Essays in Zen Buddhism, Second Series) before long...\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"So we see that Enlightenment is not the outcome of an intellectual process in which one idea follows another in sequence finally to terminate in conclusion or judgment. There is neither process nor judgment in Enlightenment, it is something more fundamental, something which makes a judgment possible, and without which no form of judgment can take place.\\" (Pg. 68)\\"Zen... does not base its authority on any written documents, but directly appeals to the enlightened mind of the Buddha.\\" (Pg. 86)\\"...my thesis that the reason for the introduction of supernaturalism into the Mahayana literature of Buddhism was to demonstrate the intellectual impossibility of comprehending spiritual facts.\\" (Pg. 102)\\"The general tendency of Buddhism is, as we know, more intellectual than emotional, and its doctrine of Enlightenment distinguishes it sharply from the Christian view of salvation...\\" (Pg. 231)\\"Generally we have no records of the inner working prior to a satori... When we read such records, we have to supply from our own experience, whatever this is, all the necessary antecedent conditions for breaking up into a satori.\\" (Pg. 259)\\"Satori is not seeing God as he is, as may be contended by some Christian mystics. Zen has from the very beginning made clear its principal thesis, which is to see into the work of creation and not interview the creator himself.\\" (Pg. 263)\\"As I stated before, Zen followers do not approve of Christians, even Christian mystics being too conscious of God, who is the creator and supporter of all life and all being...\\" (Pg. 346)\\"In Christianity we seem to be too conscious of God, though we say that in him we live and move and have our being. Zen wants to have even this last trace of God-consciousness, if possible, obliterated.\\" (Pg. 352)"},{"Title":"Essays in Zen Buddhism, first series (His Complete works)","review":"Suzuki's works offer a clear insight look at the often misunderstood world of zen.

I am revisiting it now, so I turned to the writings of D.T Suzuki, perhaps the most widely respected author in this field, both for his erudition (knowledge of all the primary texts in their original languages from origins in India, through China and Japan) and his accessibility to the layperson. This is something of an amazing feat, given the subtleties involved in explaining Zen, a formidable exercise in itself, given that the entire philosophy is based on enigmatic sayings/practices employed by masters approaching their students.Suzuki was the first to truly explain Zen Buddhism to the Western world and it is a must read for anyone who seeks the root understanding of the subject.I give it the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Essays in Zen Buddhism, first series (His Complete works)","review":"This brilliant book by Suzuki has changed my life.

It was an excellent sorce for the basic ideas behind modern metals physics.

A must have for collectors of old science tests!"},{"Title":"The Theory of the Properties of Metals and Alloys -","review":"Sir Neville Mott shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics with Phil Anderson and Van Vleck for his work in solid state physics. This classic text reflects Mott's contributions to this field. The section of this book that I particularly enjoyed reading as a graduate student in the 1970's was the treatment of the Hume-Rothery rules. Using the radius of Wigner's Seitz cells, the authors show that different crystal lattices lead to different values of the number of electron per atom (pp.170-174), with a ratios for bcc, fcc, and hcp lattices found to be 1.480, 1.538, and 1.750, respectively. Keeping in mind that each Cu and Zn atom donate one and two electrons respectively to the free electron gas of the metal, a Cu-Zn alloy (i.e. brass) goes from fcc to hcp as the Zn content increases. An analogous point not discussed in this book is the tendency for stacking faults (which are equivalent to one layer of hcp) to appear in fcc alloys as the number of electrons per atom is increased by alloying additions.A British colleague who studied at Cambridge once told me the story of Sir Neville Mott's reception at this university after returning after receiving the Nobel prize. Mott had brought with him a film (those being the days before Youtube videos or even videotapes) showing the ceremony in which he received the prize. After watching the ceremony on film, Sir Neville expressed the desire to see the film played a second time as \\"I quite enjoyed that! Let's see it again!\\" at which point the film was played a second time.On a more practical note, I would voice a single criticism of this book: that the index is not complete. In order to find the section treating the Hume-Rothery rules, for example, you need to look to the table of contents--which is quite complete."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"With a backdrop of a fairy-tale castle set in the Austrian alps and the music of Der Rosenkavalier playing below from a traveling circus, an old horse dances in a meadow, executing the precise dressage movements called the &quot;Airs Above the Ground&quot; of the famous Lippanzaners of the Spanish Riding School. The only witnesses are Londoners, Vanessa March, and her companion teenaged Tim Lacy thrown together by chance as Tim pursues his dream of untying his mother's apron strings by applying for a job at the famous riding school and Vanessa searches for her errant husband, Lewis, supposedly away on business in Sweden, but documented on a UK newsreel with a beautiful blonde during an out of control circus fire near Graz.As usual, Mary Stewart creates a fine story where intrepid characters move along a lushly described exotic locale. The delineation between good and evil is clearly defined. Like the other Stewart heroines, Charity Selbourne of 'Madame Will You Talk' comes quickly to mind, Vanessa unhesitatingly does the 'right thing.' Although she has the stereotypical loveliness, intelligence, and quick wittedness with a bit of the acerbic tongue of a married woman that makes her narration marvelously fun, she is never obssessed with superficiality like so many more modern 'romance' heroines. But, of course, a Stewart romance is a romance of the most highly literal type; the love scenes are suggested rather than depicted. The narration moves you along as if you were one and the same as the heroine; you breath her air, your heart clenches with terror when hers does, your skin prickles when in the presence of the ethereal and you quickly adopt and share her high value system. Above all the atmosphere of magic liberally sprinkling the air is maintained throughout so that even the most coincidental and improbable happenings seem to gel and fit with a puzzler's adept precision. When the tale draws to an end, you sigh with disappointment at turning that last page and you wish that Stewart had written three times as many novels so you had more to rediscover.I listened to the audio presentation of this novel read by Jane Asher; it is very well-done, well worth the investment to listen to over and over again and see that poignant image of the horse dancing alone in the meadow just one more time in your mind's eye. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Mary Stewart's Ivy Tree got me hooked on reading and I've read every book she's written. The villain in this book is so memorable I have always remembered his name. This book like all of her books marries romance and mystery but in a way no modern books do, it is romance, not sex. All of her books give you information on either classic works or other historic backgrounds, like the Spanish Riding School, that I got big points from my Humanities teachers from things I learned from Mary Stewart, I never told them how I knew the information. This is one of her best, the people are memorable and the horse is miraculous. Just a treat all round. Read all her mysteries you can't go wrong"},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Like other reviewers, I read most of Mary Stewart's novels as a teenager when they were called &quot;Gothics&quot;. Nine Coaches Waiting and Wildfire at Midnight were wonderful, and among my favorites, but Airs Above the Ground lingers in my memory as the best of Mary Stewart's works. The scene with the old horse on the hillside gives me chills and brings tears to my eyes every time I read it, or even think about it. I went to see the Lippizaners in Austria just because of the influence of this book. Read it--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Airs Above the Ground is not quite as compelling in its descriptions and plot as The Gabriel Hounds, My Brother Michael, or This Rough Magic (my favourite); however, it is still a classic Stewart mystery/romance, even if the romance is quite evident from the start. Vanessa March is quite likable and the only Stewart heroine thus far to not have annoyed me just a little bit. My favourite element of the book is the friendship that develops between Vanessa and young Tim Lacy, who is trying to break away from a stifling household and forge a path for himself. As far as the descriptions of exotic locales go, trademark to Stewart, I enjoyed the chase scene through the castle. Airs Above the Ground didn't wow me and I found the ending a bit strange as it didn't feature Annalisa at all..., but all in all, a pleasent read."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"I have loved every novel written by Mary Stewart, some more than others. I read this one well over twenty years ago and many times since then. It is one of my many favorite of her books. In her books you get to travel; you feel as if you are really there. I have wanted to visit almost every place I have visited in her books. I too had pledged to see the Lippizaner stallions someday &amp; I finally got to see them a few years ago. They were wonderful of course. There is magic in all the Mary Stewart books; the relationships in this one in particular were warm and appealing."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1965. I was in high school at the time. I decided if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Annalisa, after the character in this book. My daughter, Annalisa, will be 42 in November, 2011. I love her and still love this book!"},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"It's symptomatic of the way I found books and authors when I was younger that I never discovered Mary Stewart's gothics until a couple of years ago. In my teens and early twenties, I loved Victoria Holt's gothics, considering them a peculiar sort of mysteries, and a bit of a guilty pleasure. I hadn't heard the term \\"gothics\\". I'd have loved Mary Stewart's books, too, but it never occurred to me to look for books similar to Holt's; nor did I talk to any other readers about them. Not that I really knew any other readers. The same thing happened with mysteries, and science fiction and fantasy. I read everything by a handful of authors, some popular, some more obscure, but completely missed a lot of the giants of the genres.But it's all good. It just means that I have a few zillion old books to enjoy... along with the few zillion new books on my list.Airs Above the Ground is a bit unusual for a gothic, in my experience anyway, in that the heroine is already married to the hero. Vanessa thinks her new husband is on a business trip to Stockholm... then she sees him in a newsreel with another woman on his arm--and they're in Vienna.So when a friend asks Vanessa to escort her teenaged son to visit his father in Austria, Vanessa takes the chance to find out what's going on, and they find themselves caught up in the exotic world of a small traveling circus, international drug smuggling, mysterious deaths, and the world-famous Lipizzaner Stallions. Not to mention the difficulties of being newlyweds.The atmosphere is pure gothic, and a lot of people rave about the horses (I'm not a fan of horses), but what I enjoyed most about this book is how all the various threads intertwined and affected each other."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Mary Stewart writes great mystery with romance and at the same times teaches you something. In this book the information about the Lipizan horses is wonderful. And this is the only villain whose name I've always remembered. When I was young these weren't called Romances but Gothic Novels and Mary Stewart was always the best."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"This is the kind of book I can imagine lots of people being sniffy about, cheesily packaged and unashamedly romantic - probably a lot wouldn't even pick it up in the first place. Well that's their loss, but I'd like to get a read-mary-stewart campaign off the ground. She is so good: a deft and clever writer who wears her literary nounce lightly. I adore her stories, her settings and her feisty (but not too feisty!) heroines. No one else is as consistently good: let's hear it for romantic fiction! I've been chastised on the bookwormonthenet blog for offering qualified praise to writers like Mary Stewart and for using phrases like 'pulp fiction' - but no, it is no slur. These are stunning books by a vastly talented writer. I also think film producers ought to be trawling the stewart back catalogue: I can just see Cate Blanchett as the heroine of Airs Above the Ground and the whole sub-plot around the Austrian circus, spies and a lost Lipizzaner stallion would translate fabulously to the wide screen. Go on, someone, do it!"},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Airs Above The Ground is one of Mary Stewart's best and is well worth reading for several reasons. Ms. Stewart's heyday was in the 1960s, yet her heroines were all take charge types with careers. In this book, Vanessa March is a veterinarian though she stopped practicing when she married Lewis. The plot requires her expertise and it is the reason for the best part of the book, the story of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and its Lippizaner stallions. There is a wealth of fascinating information in this book, though it's well integrated into an exciting story and never reads like a history lesson. Ms. Stewart's description of the 'airs above the ground' in which the horses perform incredibly difficult dance-like moves in perfect precision to music is worth picking up the book alone, and she makes the horses' performances sound magical--which of course, they are.There's plenty of action in this one; there's a thrilling moonlit chase over and through a castle, a race with a train, and a parrot who says rude things. There's a circus and a mystery and romance, and horses. As always, Ms. Stewart writes smart, for educated people. Each chapter begins with a classical quotation that relates to its contents, and there are plenty of cultural allusions, like when the charming young man Vanessa is escorting to meet his father in Vienna refers to a circus performer as the 'Hungarian Rhapsody'.I've been revisiting a lot of the books I read from when I first ventured out of the children's section of the library. Mary Stewart was one of the first 'grown up' authors I discovered and I devoured every one of her books I could find. How disappointed I was to find that not every book was as exciting or as well written as Ms. Stewart's and how thrilled I am to find that they are just as wonderful in 2010 as they were in 1970."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"As in all her other novels of suspense, this one is simply wonderful. The characters are delightful; the scenery exquisitely rendered."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Another wonderful book by Mary Stewart that grips the reader and drags him or her into an imaginative world of wonder."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"The book was in excellent condition and was mailed in a timely manner. In fact, It arrived before I expected it. There was a handwritten \\"thank you\\" note included on the invoice. Nice personal touch."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Vanessa March is angry with her husband Lewis. He had promised her a holiday through Europe. But then, as she was getting ready, he drops a bomb: he has to fly alone to Stockholm for business. Alone in London, she visits an obnoxious \\"friend.\\" This friend has a seventeen-year-old son who wants to see his father in Vienna. Could Vanessa fly with Tim to Vienna? Of course not! But then Vanessa spots Lewis on a newsreel. There had been a fire in a caravan at a traveling circus near Vienna of all places, and Tim was there among the shocked spectators. But that's not all. A beautiful blonde was with him. Well... what do you think she does next? With a backdrop of the Austrian alps, beautiful performing horses, government espionage, and gothic and magic atmosphere, Vanessa and Tim uncover shocking things about her husband, the traveling circus and a celebrity horse whose \\"Airs Above the Ground\\" performance is legendary, as well as the circumstances that bring him to the circus...I hate to be one of the people to burst the five-star review bubble. Airs Above the Ground isn't terrible, but it isn't the best effort either. Granted, there are some impressive twists and turns, especially the one about halfway through the story and, of course, the ending. But the novel is somewhat boring for the most part and the author takes too long to draw her conclusions. I do like the way Tim describes the different kinds of horses and the backdrop of Austria gives the novel a beautiful and eery atmosphere. Mary Stewart has written some great books. I loved Nine Coaches Waiting and was crazy about The Ivy Tree and Madam, Will You Talk? This one, however, is middling at best. Still, it is better than most if not all romantic suspense novels written today. Romantic suspense penned by the likes of Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught lack originality and seem to be targeted to people with a fourth grade reading level. As for this one, it could be a hit or a miss. It's up to you to decide which one it is. But to me, it's kind of a tossup."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"These used to be called &quot;gothics,&quot; but they are just good stories. This novel in particular will take you on a journey through Austria, provide a historical account of the Lippizaner Stallions and entertain you well! If you've ever travelled, read Mary Stewart novels. They are picturesque and provide a vivid background!"},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"When Vanessa March is offered the chance to chaperone a teenage boy to Vienna, she nearly says no--until she sees her husband in a newsreel, filmed at the scene of a circus fire near Vienna. In addition, he's in the company of a very pretty blonde... Vanessa's travels to Vienna lead her in the way of the Spanish Riding School, circuses, and a mystery that brings mystery--as well as, of course, a touch of romance.This is one of Stewart's less romantic novels, mostly because the heroine is already married to the hero and you more or less know that they'll end up together. There's also a bit less suspense, though there's a chase scene up on the battlements of the castle that's written in classic Mary Stewart style. The mystery itself also isn't all that compelling, as it's been done many times before.What I do love about Mary Stewart's novels is the locations she chooses to set her novels in--and she does a pretty fine job of researching her settings, too. This book makes me want to book a flight to Vienna ASAP! Her descriptions of the \\"airs above the ground\\" are excellent, too. (Vanessa is a former veterinarian, so her interest in the horses of the story stems from that). The characters are all very well formed, though I thought that Tim was a little too mature for a seventeen-year-old! Nonetheless, this novel is a lot of fun--though if you're new to Mary Stewart's novels, I'd suggest starting with one of her others (Nine coaches Waiting and Madam, Will You Talk? come highly recommended by me)."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"I'm one of those people who fell in love with horses as a child and never got over it. Since I don't have one, I have to get my fill in other ways. I first read Airs About the Ground about 25 years ago. Almost immediately, it became one of my favorite books.However, don't let the fact that I'm a horsey person keep you from reading this book. Like most Mary Stewart books, it has fully fleshed-out characters that you can like, a good mystery, romance, and a satisfying ending. It's a fast read, and good for curling up with after a long day, and forget about what the boss said today.And the Lippizans? Read the book."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"My love of horses brought me to this book and it didn't dissapoint. The surgery done on Piebald ( the horse) was explained in detail. The old horse was useless to the Circus. They wanted and needed horses who could perform beautiful movements like the \\"Airs Above The Ground\\". The old horse is rescued and as in all Mary Stewart books there is a chase, this time along the top of a mansion. MS is intriguing in that she writes in detail. You can smell and feel the circus and everything about it. As always, MS keeps me reading even when I guess the ending."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"This is a great book for young adults. Full of suspense and characteristic flairs. Mary Stewart brings alive the silent countryside of Austria with this thriller."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"I read it when it first came out and one particular scene has stuck with me over all those decades.

Reader's Digest is GREAT ... but one always wonders. As a horse lover, this book particularly appealed to me. A nice, relaxing read. Keeps one engaged; however, there's no horrible, worrisome drama to give one nightmares. A super story. If you don't know anything about Lippizaners and and the Spanish Riding School, may I suggest that you do what I do and Google things in books that you aren't familiar with. I have pretty much given up reading books without my computer at my side. Too much to learn!!! I love looking up places, foods, and etc."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"I have read \\"Airs above the ground before\\" and so of course I like it. It is rather exciting but not scary, and like all the books by Mary Stewart when you've finished it it feels as if you been on trip. Should you travel to the place where it was cast (in this case Austria) you feel you've been there before. Seen some of the sights, tasted the food etc.I don't think it is for men and perhaps not the younger generation. I have 3 daughters, one of them loves Mary Stewart the other 2 are indifferent."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"Mary Stewart is an accomplished romantic suspense author with a literary style far above most in that genre. Here she take the reader to Austria as Vanessa March seeks to discover what her husband is doing there when he told her he had business in Sweden. Think of the movie \\"True Lies.\\" Her search takes her to a traveling circus where a fire had killed two men. There she realizes that she's stumbled upon something bigger than just her domestic conflict.The scenes at the circus, in the Austrian village and in the castle hotel where she stays are deftly described by Stewart. There's some midnight cat-and-mouse activity on the roof of the castle and other scenes to raise the level of suspense. Despite these, this never achieves the page-turning, edge-of-the chair effect of Wildfire at Midnight or The Ivy Tree. It was a pleasant re-read for me, but doesn't stick in the mind the way her best books do."},{"Title":"AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND","review":"This book is a wonderful read!

And author Rumiko Takahashi introduces a grotesque new opponent for the students of Furinkan High -- someone who makes Kuno look sane.Shampoo gets her hands on some kairaishi mushrooms, which make the eater do whatever they are told. So of course she feeds them to Ranma, but a mistake causes Ranma to passionately hug anyone who sneezes, including Kuno and Akane (who thinks Ranma is trying to molest her). And Shampoo turns up to cause even more mayhem with her mushrooms, by making Akane hug every man EXCEPT Ranma....Akane's rivalry with Shampoo continues when she accidently eats Happosai's super soba noodles, which bestow enormous strength. Now she's able to beat anyone (including Ranma) and she can finally whip Shampoo's behind. But while Akane and Shampoo duke it out over martial-arts ping pong, Ranma discovers a terrible side effect of the super soba. Unfortunately, Akane isn't about to give up her new power...The students of Furinkan High have never met their principal -- until a strange faux-Hawaiian guy attacks some students and tries to snip off Ranma's pigtail. Turns out this lunatic IS the principal -- and his first rule is that boys must have buzz cuts, and girls must have bowl cuts. The students riot, and find themselves in a bizarre tropical maze under the school (that's your tax yen at work, folks).Ever since Shampoo came onto the scene, we've been treated to the two girls fighting over Ranma. In a way, this is the peak of Akane's problems with Shampoo, and which features her finally defeating the Amazon and her sex-changing fiancee. And all she had to do was take massive doses of hormones and grow facial hair.Despite the intense romantic infighting, there's plenty of humour here, especially poor Ranma being compelled to hug anyone who sneezes (an affliction that breaks up at least one happy relationship), and Akane being rape-paranoid whenever he grabs her. Not to mention Ranma's sure-fire method of getting Akane's attention: \\"Waaahh! Shampoo, put your clothes back on!\\"We're also introduced to the principal -- a nutcase with a palm tree growing out of his head, and an accent that is more fake Jamaican than Hawaiian. And we see a different side of Akane -- an insecure side, which feels inferior to mega-martial-artists Ranma and the pushy Shampoo. With people like that around, and able to defeat her, it's no wonder that she wants to win so badly.Embarrassing foodstuffs and humiliating haircuts kick off another round of martial-arts comedy in the tenth \\"Ranma 1/2.\\" Now arm wrestle!"},{"Title":"Ranma 1/2, Vol. 10","review":"This book is probably the best out of all of the Ranma 1/2 series.

I haven't exactly read that many of the English-translated sets here (I do, however, have all 38 Japan-bought manga), so I can't really say this without claim, but anyway: I bought a traslated version, vol. 3, read it, and thought that the english version was sorta handicapped by the general problems of translating (that is, having to reverse pictures, erase and put in translated in sound affects - that especially, since alot of sound effects are these wording jokes that Takahashi-sensei put in, figure out how to deal with Japanese puns and jokes). But a bunch of non-japanese speaking people thinks that it's funny and action packed anyway. So what I'm saying here is that this thing isn't just funny and action packed, it's hilarious and, well, really action packed. Sorry, couldn't think of a good word. Not only that, I thought the english version ain't that bad. There's little glitches in translation, but I've had to traslate a bunch a Japanese stuff before too, that stuff can't be avoided, and they made a pretty good trans job. (Really good, if I think back on other examples of japanese traslating people... Besides, what you don't know won't hurt.)I showed the one traslated vol. 3 to my random friend (American) along with the first few stories that I had traslated for the heck of it, and 2 and a half days later she was like, &quot;You will give me the name and place of where you got this, Yes?&quot;In fact the only thing that's bad (yes, I admit the translations are pretty good afterall) is that the stuff is so expensive!

The principal of Furinkan High comes back, and he's not what he seems. He implements a new haircut rule that has the students scrambling to find a very special coconut, and his tardy plan is designed to make you late, not keep you from being late!

Turns out this lunatic IS the principal -- and his first rule is that boys must have buzz cuts, and girls must have bowl cuts. The students riot, and find themselves in a bizarre tropical maze under the school (that's your tax yen at work, folks).Ever since Shampoo came onto the scene, we've been treated to the two girls fighting over Ranma. In a way, this is the peak of Akane's problems with Shampoo, and which features her finally defeating the Amazon and her sex-changing fiancee. And all she had to do was take massive doses of hormones and grow facial hair.Despite the intense romantic infighting, there's plenty of humour here, especially poor Ranma being compelled to hug anyone who sneezes (an affliction that breaks up at least one happy relationship), and Akane being rape-paranoid whenever he grabs her. Not to mention Ranma's sure-fire method of getting Akane's attention: \\"Waaahh! Shampoo, put your clothes back on!\\"We're also introduced to the principal -- a nutcase with a palm tree growing out of his head, and an accent that is more fake Jamaican than Hawaiian. And we see a different side of Akane -- an insecure side, which feels inferior to mega-martial-artists Ranma and the pushy Shampoo. With people like that around, and able to defeat her, it's no wonder that she wants to win so badly.Embarrassing foodstuffs and humiliating haircuts kick off another round of martial-arts comedy in the tenth \\"Ranma 1/2.\\" Now arm wrestle!"},{"Title":"Ranma 1/2, Vol. 10","review":"This is good manga because it's Rumiko Takahashi.

SPSS for psychologists covers from the most basic topics to quite advanced (such as factor analysis and logistic regression).

I came across a few errors, though, but they were minor and I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"SPSS for Psychologists: A Guide to Data Analysis Using Spss for Windows","review":"If you're working on an advanced degree or in the field of social sciences, you may need to use a software package such as SPSS to analyze the data of your studies. You don't need to be a statistician; you don't even need to be a \\"math person\\" but you do need to be able to make sense of your data. This book will help you do that. It discusses each statistical tool, how it works and when and why to use it. Then step by step it tells how to implement each tool in SPSS. Exercises are included to give you a feel for how it works.Although the title of this book says \\"for psychologists\\" this book would be appropriate for users in any social science field such as educational research, medical research, sociology, politics, law, management, etc. You'll be pleased with the powerful yet easily intuitive interface of SPSS, especially if you've been using other packages such as Excel.Some suggested improvements: an early chapter should be included with an overview of the various statistical tools and when and why to use them. Also, a data disk or a place online to download data files would be great.For what it's worth -- I have a master's degree in math education and I work as a mathematical assistant in university environment with adult learners at all levels from freshman to graduate students. I recently worked with an administrator working on his PhD, helped him through a statistics course for social science majors. He's one of those brilliant but non-mathematical folks who has managed to get along fine all his life without math and now all of a sudden he had to learn to do statistics. At first he felt pretty grim.

A delightful read, and a very enjoyable deviation from previous Shugak tales, one I reread immediately"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Kate Shugak is back, cleaning up the homestead and getting ready for salmon season. At least, she would be if the jet engine hadn't fallen on her truck, the bears weren't so cantakerous, her neighbors weren't shooting at each other, and oh yeah, there are some dead bodies that just don't add up. Kate's methods may be unorthodox but she gets the job done in this hilariously low key story of early spring in Alaska's back country. The plane crash description, and Kate's mellow, just-fast-enough reaction to every incident reminded me of Smylla's attempt to use a dumb waiter as a burglar's entry device in &quot;Smylla's Sense of Snow.&quot; What fun. Too bad there has to be a philandering creep in this book, but at least Kate's got characters she can work against. I miss Emaa, and there were a few times I thought Kate was close to joining her grandmother. Overall an entertaining look at Alaska's environmental quandary"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"It is BREAKUP in Alaska when the snow melts and the people emerge from the long dark winter of hibernating in their homes. The natives gleefully visit friends and neighbors, replenish supplies, and take care of tribal business. This year, BREAKUP is even more difficult than usual for homesteader Kate Shugak. She has to deal with hungry bears, a plane engine landing on her roof, and mediating the various feuds that sometimes escalate into violence. Worse than all that combined is that her hormones are aching and she desperately wants to visit her lover in Anchorage....... No matter how hard Kate distances herself from tribal politics, no one allows her to forget that she is heir to her grandfather's legacy. The gift (or curse depending on one's perspective) of being the recognized clan leader is one that Kate would prefer to reject. However, she is unable to desert her people by abrogating her responsibility especially when her presence helps her fellow villagers. For instance, Kate decides how to invest tribal funds in a clinic and determines if a bear attack was actually a premeditated murder. Whatever the tribal requirement might be, Kate, guided by her deceased grandmother's spirit, tends to her people's need......... The female protagonist is clearly the star of BREAKUP, a work that has plenty of action, but is more of a character study than a typical murder mystery. The magic and the power of the Alaskan environment are brought vividly alive through the powerful word processor of Dana Stabenow. She successfully allows readers a glimpse into the psychological and sociological mindset of the native Alaskan resident, whom living in a harsh climate has different social survival mechanism than those found in the lower 48. The force of this novel transcends genre as the protagonist rejects the power that her community increasingly bestows upon her. For readers interested in the last American frontier, this book is a necessity......Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Maybe I'm just not a person who is capable of being a mystery fan, but this book seemed silly to me. I am perfectly willing to suspend my disbelief in most instances, but after the first few chapters, in which there were a couple of bear attacks and a falling jet engine (!) all in the space of one day, I had had it. The writing was fine, and the scenery was really neat, but I certainly didn't see the humor in much of the book that some other readers did. I also couldn't tell why it was even called a mystery until about 120 pages into it, which was frustrating.

I don't think this was one of Stabenow's best. In fact, her last two I have not liked. Her first books were fantastic and kept you on the edge of your seat!

With each passing story, Shugak's Native American roots are developed more profoundly, along with the difficulty tribal life faces on many fronts. Shugak is a tough, appealing character, and the author does a marvelous job deepening the reader's understanding of the woman as the stories unfold...as well as painting a fascinating word-portrait of life in Alaska. My only complaint (if it's that) is the unbelievable number of events that tumble one upon the other, which frequently happens in this series of books. In the course of one day there are so many convenient arrivals of various characters to move the story along, that it's comical. Perhaps that's the mood the author wishes to convey, and once you accept the fact that anybody can suddenly drop in at any time in any place, the story is acceptable. Sort of a fantasy of the wildness of Alaskan life, its frontier atmosphere, its tragic interplays of people, both native and white. Though the series is classed as \\"mystery\\", that element is often the least interesting and least developed. It's a story about the lives and loves of real people, which is the true value of the book."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"There is a certain tongue in cheek humor underlying this excellent mystery.

Enjoy all the Kate Shugak Books so far. I unfortunately recieved some out of order so have been reading them as such. When I caught on an essential character is killed a few books after Breakup....I started skipping around that book. Now it's the last one I currently have. OOPS. Still have the last 4 books in the series to arrive. I buy used and hard copy when availabe. So looks like it's time to get on with the sad book afterall. Sooner or later life serves up the bad along with the good and so do the books. And at least this writer shovels both out in handfuls. She's really good and seems to be getting better. And love her fiction...and have no problem realizing it's fiction. She's so good some readers no doubt think otherwise. Say hi to Shitting Seagull the next time you see him will you? PS maybe Breakup was my all time favorite wild ride though. I mean really? I don't want to do a spoiler here...so biting my nails trying not to. The wild ride was amazing though. I could go for a few other books like that but then....no doubt it might just tire the author out trying to sustain that kind of action. We all need a calm rest now and again. I went and ordered the liam series too in anticipation of hearing the latest book out this year in the Shugak series is tied in with that character. So before reading the very last 2012 book...I'll read the other spin off so to speak so it perhaps all comes together out of both series into the last book.If you haven't read this book and not the others yet...this one might just hook you in."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"This is probably the funniest mystery Dana Stabenow has written thus far.I have read it so many times, I have worn out one copy.

I highly recommend this book and any other of Dana Stabenow books if you want good entertainment."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"If you have to suffer through months of nearly endless nights, snow measured in yards instead of inches or feet then why not have to suffer one more indignity before spring arrives? It's called 'breakup' and it is what Kate our Heroine has to put up with.In the first chapter alone Kate meets up with some of the worst that Alaska can dish out--enraged grizzly bears with cub, moose, airplanes raining parts on her homestead, baby sitting rich people,shots fired at her more than once, a body found that is months old and one found that is minutes old.Along with all of this turmoil, Kate is being strong armed by some of the Native elders to be a tribal advisory or maybe even a little more since the death of her Grandmother in the last novel.Kate shows more character growth in this book than she has in the last 6. Ms. Stabenow shows just what a sly sense of humor she has in making Kate work so hard on this particular breakup and in allowing Kate to have a little bit of 'crazy' show through. I love how the author does not allow Kate to become a perfect person; that Kate has her good, law abiding moments but she is also allowed semi-evil, devil-may-care moments.Again, as with all the other novels that came before, the narrative is excellent, descriptions are vivid and easily imagined, the people are'real' with things you love and also with foible.A perfect read to make you appreciate better where you live and how much worse it could be weather wise!"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"This book is funny, captivating, and a great read. So far I think it is the best of this series."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"A murder mystery that keeps one in stitches seems like a contradiction. Breakup does that, because of the situations that are part of the mystery, part of everyday life in the wilds of Alaska.

The things that happen in Breakup could happen any where any time but these things really have happened in Alaska during Breakup. The characters could live in any part of the world but they really come alive in the Alaska setting of this story. I hope you have as much fun reading it as I did.Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Kate Shugak grabs the bull by the horns, any bull before her, with tenacity and initiative, sometimes whether it's hers to take or not. A thirty-something Aleut woman living on her own in rural Alaska, the forces weighing on her personally include an alluded-to past in law enforcement (this is my first Kate Shugak book, but the seventh in the series) and the responsibilities inherited from her deceased grandmother who was a very capable tribal elder. In Breakup, these forces are put to serious test by the events of the long-awaited spring thaw, called breakup, a time of natural change, but of unpredictable bears and human behavior, too. In the first two chapters alone Kate and sidekick wolf-mix Mutt face jet engine parts falling from the sky and more than one bear adventure. The bears keep on coming, newly out of hibernation, hungry and cantankerous, and the human weirdnesses blossom. There's the deaths in question, a body revealed near Kate's in the thaw and woman's death that may or may not have been a bear's doing. Families engage in shoot-outs within their own ranks and with other families over land rights. Kate ends up having to be the tour guide for a local friend's visiting high-society parents, a job the friend didn't want herself. Kate is an enjoyable character, well made and with enough weaknesses to provide some balance to her great strengths. Perhaps they were revealed better in previous series books, but I found that the secondary characters were not particularly well-developed beyond basic appearance and one or two personality traits (an exception here, the parents mentioned above). This won't keep me from looking for more of Kate, knowing I will be entertained in an interesting setting."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"In \\"Breakup\\", Stabenow stresses humor and characters more than violence, to an extreme not found in any of her other books to date. The style is reminiscent of the earlier works of long-time Alaskan Tom Bodett, which were based on the fictional \\"End Of The Road\\", in Alaska. By the end of the first chapter, I decided that \\"Breakup\\" was a tribute to Mr. Bodett, and sat back to enjoy the ride.Stabenow's strength has always been her character development, backed by her panorama of the changing (and often conflicting) lifestyles of Alaska, with its mix of pavement-bound city dwellers, bush rats, and native americans. Throw in the Alaskan outback and the state's colorful history, stir in reasonable plots, and you've got a winning combination."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"I am SO enjoying this series!!! This one was a riot to read. However, I'm not going to be going anywhere where they grow grizzly bears."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"I absolutely love all of Dana Stabenow's \\"Kate Shugak\\" stories. I am so glad that when I started the series I started with the first book because even though they stand alone as far as stories go they all tie together as well and she does it very beautifully. I have learned so much about the Alaskan way of life and philosophy from her books it makes me feel that I have actually been there. You can very easily visualize what she is saying while you read. Truly easy to escape to a different place and different way of life. I have a hard time waiting for her books now that I've read them all."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"This book reads like someone's fantasy life. The protagonist, Kate Shugak, never makes mistakes, never loses an argument, and never has to compromise. She can terrify men with a glance and stop armed combat with her bare hands. She can also seduce a cold-blooded murderer and hypnotize a room full of men with a change in her voice. She claims to love men, but doesn't \\"expect much of them.\\" The only man she maybe-loves, from many miles away, warms her heart by his casual reply to the report of a bear mauling someone to death, but she ridicules such bravado (\\"manly-man\\" behavior) in anyone else. She professes an abiding commitment to her oath to uphold the law, but commits a petty crime, and for petty reasons, minutes later. She rescues an irresponsible husband (for the second time), when he is bound naked, spread-eagled, and gagged, from the rifle of his hysterical wife, but \\"sides with the tribe\\" when she tells a state trooper that their children are not in danger.The book goes on and on this way, asking the reader to believe that a five-foot-tall woman is actually some kind of superbeing, able to cope with any kind of problem, no matter how absurd or wrong-headed her methods might be. If she were real, her mother would be Wonder Woman, and her other mother would be Marilyn. (If it were up to her, I don't think Kate Shugak would _have_ a father.) She can kick ass or make doe eyes, whichever the moment requires, and always with 100% success. Like Alda's \\"Hawkeye\\" character, everything always just seems to work out her way. She never has to deal with mistakes or meaningful opposition to her wishes.This was a really well-written book about a dreadful person living a charmed life. I can easily imagine the audience that makes it such a success. But, I found it so far below credible and so self-indulgent, that I'd give it one star if it weren't for a few snappy scenes that prove Stabenow could be a good writer if she'd only grow up."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I spent two years (1945-47) in Fairbanks when it was still a Territory and a wild and woolly place. I spent a lot of time out in the bush, and except for the damn mosquitoes, I absolutely loved Alaska. Rugged land and rugged people.Pros:* Kate and others were amusing depictions of the type of person that does live up there.* Nonstop action if that is what you want.Cons:* Kate is really an unbelievable, superwoman person.* She and other disparage the tourists who go out in bear country unarmed. Yet, at the beginning of the book she goes down to the river, a favorite haunt of the brown bears, and nearly gets eaten. Then later, up at the mine, she goes out with two other visitors, with a rifle left in the cab of the pickup, unarmed. Nobody in their right mind in bear country, especially in the Spring, EVER goes anywhere without a good high-powered rifle (I carried a .38-55).* Nothing is more annoying than an author who is so conceited she assumes everybody has read each of her prior books. This was the first one I read (well, half of it), and she refers countless times to something that happened in an earlier book, and introduces hordes of people that played a part is some previous book, with no explanation whatsoever as to who they are, or what happened before. A good author can do this gracefully without being boring.* The fixes she gets herself into, and out of, time after time after time with hardly a pause, become totally silly. The first couple of instances are amusing, then they get positively preposterous after a while.* If there is a plot, it did not become evident at the half-way point, which is when I quit reading the thing."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"I've enjoyed all the Kate Shugak books but this one rates as the best. Kate faces charging bears, tourists from Beacon Hill, falling jet engines, the Alaskan version of the Hatfields and McCoys and the obligatory murder. And in the process the real Kate Shugak suddenly comes together and shows us the person we always knew was there. She once again demonstrates that Kate is not a person to be messed with (the more descriptive expression is not one I will write where anyone of any age can read it). But in all the daring do, in all the life and death experiences she goes through, those of us that love her know that the hardest for her to face, the one that takes the most courage is when Kate stands at a meeting of the tribal elders and acts as an advisory. She has begun to accept the heritage left to her by her grandmother. The only 'bad' thing about this book is that if you haven't followed Kate through her other books, you can't see what a victory this is for her. Thank you Dana Stabenow for giving us not just a female sleuth but a well-rounded person we can enjoy reading about and admire."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Having read one Kate Shugak mystery some years ago (which I enjoyed), I decided to try more recently. I'm enjoying them all, but have seldom laughed as hard over anything as I did over BREAKUP. I'm guessing that Stabenow collected all the wildest tales she'd heard about breakup mishaps and adventures and rolled them together into this marvellous story. There is a mystery, and Kate does work it through most capably, but don't try to read this volume in a situation that requires quiet. This is definitely a laugh-out-loud book, or even a shriek-out-loud one. (Obviously) I loved it."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"It seems that Dana Stabenow touches on a different aspect of Alaskan life in each book of this wonderful series. In Breakup, we are entertained with descriptions of springtime, when the ice and snow are breaking up and all sorts of weird things happen. Kate seems philosophical through it all--from airplanes falling from nowhere to grizzlies appearing in her path. She attributes every situation to the time of year. This book has all the attributes of the previous novels in this series--great descriptions of the scenery and lifestyle of Alaska,and an intriguing murder, but it also includes side-splitting humor. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"This is the first book of Dana Stabenow's that I bought. Within minutes, I giggled. A few more pages, I laughed. Before the book was finished, I had to stop and wipe the tears from laughing so hard.I could relate to Kate's experiences. Maybe it takes living through an Alaskan break up to understand what humans and fate are really capable of that made this so funny. Perhaps it was recognizing former headlines from the newspapers. Irregardless, it was the first Kate Shugak book I read, but not my last. I immediately went out and bought the rest and I have a copy of each new one, too.It's not your typical mystery. The murder does appear secondary to other activities: falling 747 engines, grizzly bear encounters, parents from Outside visiting daughters. If you want a slice of authenic Alaska from a real Alaskan, you can't go wrong with Ms. Stabenow. If you want pure entertainment, you can't go wrong with BREAK UP.Why have I bought five copies of this book? Because each time I loaned it out, I never received it back. It's one of those books that I read again and again. But please don't ask to borrow my copy. I know a lovely bookstore that will sell you your own copy."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"As readers of this hilarious entry in the wonderful Kate Shugak series now know, Breakup is the time between the frozen solid Alaska winter and the spring--a time when the potholes reach several feet deep, the slush competes with the mud, the weather is unpredictable--and the bears wake up crabby and hungry from their long hibernation. It's also a time, apparently, when the locals take leave of their senses, and the most mundane errand is run at one's own risk.Kate sees most of the action in this novel from the floor of her local pub, where stray bullets from angry housewives are flying at random; in the mud, where she is knocked down several times by everyone from friend to foe to bear; and from her house, which just happens to be partially demolished by an engine that has dropped from the sky off a jetliner. And that's just in the first few pages!Even wonder-dog Mutt is cranky in this truly funny look at all the regulars as they emerge--like the bears--from their long winter hibernation. There's a serious undertone dealing with Kate's new and unwanted position as head of tribal affairs, but mostly it's just a wild romp as we get to know our favorite Alaskans maybe a bit too well.Much recommended!"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Stabenow manages to capture perfectly the chaotic feel of Alaska life. I worked up there several summers and it felt like I was back in one of the frontier towns that I remember fondly. This is pretty far into the Shugak series, but a librarian recommended that I start with this book. I found that I did not need to read any of Stabenow's other books in order to fall in love with Shugak and the series. Since then I have pretty much read them all and I would say that none of them quite matches this one. So if you have not read any Shugak mysteries yet, this might be a good place to start.What's so unusal about this book while comparing it to both others in the series as well as other mysteries, is that it pretty much doesnt have a mystery. Instead what makes this such a fun read is that you are lead on an excursion into the life of the protagonist that is well worth following along upon."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"I have been reading the Kate Shugak series in order this fall and just finished Breakup. By the time I finished the first chapter, I was already laughing. As each chapter continued, I just laughed harder and harder. This is one of the best female sluth series I've read yet (other good ones are Nevada Barr, Sue Grafton, etc.).In Breakup, Kate experiences a neverending series of unfortunate events that are guaranteed to make you laugh. The mystery plot is not as prominent in this story as in the previous ones, but the humor and action more than make up for it. I definitely recommend this book and series to anyone who enjoys mysteries set in exotic and/or natural locations. My only hope is that you will start at the beginning of the series and read them in order. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"Terrific book! 7th in Stabenow's series featuring Kate Shugak, a resourceful, independent, courageous, and beautiful Aleutian descendant of Wonder Woman - remember Wonder Woman, anybody? This is Stabenow's funniest book yet - in my mind, it invites comparison to Janet Evanovich's books about Jersey. The heroines are not that much alike but the zany characters are similar - another writer who comes to mind in this context is Carl Hiassen. My previous favorite among Dana's books was Blood Will Tell, which has a much more serious focus, with an unforgettable portrait of Alaskan Indians and of Kate's grandmother/tribal leader, Ekaterina Shugak (Emaa). But I loved this one too, even though it's quite a different reading experience.Compared to Hiassen and Evanovich, Stabenow's humorous mode is less over the top...her style in dialogue and description is wry with a touch of the laconic cowboy. The title refers to the season when Alaska \\"melts into a 586,412-square-mile pile of slush\\" - not quite winter and not quite spring - \\"it's too late for the snow machine and too early for the truck.\\" And everyone with cabin fever comes out to play, including the bears, the neighbors feuding over the boundary between their farms, the parents from Massachusetts determined to lure their precious daughter (Kate's friend) back from her unfashionable life as a sleddog trainer and racer in Alaska.We in Pennsylvania know about this season, but fortunately we don't have it quite as long. Pennsylvanians will get a kick out of the brief description of Pa. tourists kicking back in Bernie's Roadhouse, where the d&eacute;cor features a severed middle finger preserved in a bottle of Jose Cuervo Gold. Stabenow's characters and dialogue zing off the page and bring the whole crazy crew to roaring life.There IS a murder in this book, but that story is so skillfully woven into the comedy that it seems like a subplot. Discovery of the murderer is no surprise, and neither is the independent action that Kate takes to bring frontier justice. But the final scenes, in which we see Kate reluctantly fulfilling her Emaa's wishes by becoming involved in working for the good of the Native American community, connects us back to the earlier books and points to an interesting future for Kate. Can't wait to read it, Dana! Thank you!"},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"With the combination of humor, suspense and mystery, Dana Stabenow has once again produced a winning story. I particularly liked the reference to Jamie Fraser (from the series by Diana Gabaldon). The only thing I didn't like about this book was the &quot;art work&quot; (?) on the chapter pages. I was wondering how I had managed to mess up the first page without even opening the book when I realized it was a continuing theme on all the chapter pages."},{"Title":"Breakup (A Kate Shugak Mystery, Book 7)","review":"I stumbled upon the Dana Stabenow books and cannot get enough of them. This has to be my favorite of the Kate Shugak series. I have read this book twice in a month, the humor is fabulous. I wish the book were not only on Kindle but also an audiobook as I would love to hear it interpretted with voice inflections.

I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Only earth and sky last forever","review":"I must admit that I read this book about 28 years ago, but it touched something in me that I have not forgotten since. This book gives young people a glimpse into Native American culture in a way that can make them see the goodness of these people and their connection with the earth and all things in it.I recently gave it to my 9 year-old son and he enjoyed it immensely. I can only hope that it showed him ways to treat (and not treat) others.I highly recommend this book for parents who are trying to show their children some of the philosophy and culture of the people who were here before us and only wished to continue their way of life as they had for centuries."},{"Title":"Only earth and sky last forever","review":"In the story, the main character lived in an Indian settlement. He saw a beautiful girl named Lashuka there, and decided that he wanted to marry her. He asked Lashuka's mother if they could be wed, but she saw no reason to let him marry her. She said that he didn't have anything to offer, so he went to join with the warriors and prove himself. He attacked a small number of white men with them, but something horrible happened. Agency warriors, Indian warriors that lived on the Bluecoats' land, attacked them and saved the white men. The thought of Sioux fighting Sioux disturbed him so much, he set out in hopes of ending it and proving himself to Lashuka's mother.I enjoyed this book because it was really descriptive and its set a picture in my mind. It was interesting and I thought that it was a good topic for a book. It was exciting to see the plot unfold. I really enjoyed it, and I think that anyone who enjoys a good, adventurous book would really enjoy it, too. The beginning was good at preparing you for the rest of the book, and the middle and end was really exciting. It showed me what Native Americans went through, and I thought it was really interesting. Overall, it surprised me at how adventurous it was."},{"Title":"Only earth and sky last forever","review":"As an elementary librarian, I read this book aloud to 5th and 6th graders for many years, with only a couple age-appropriate edits. It was a valuable tool for counter-balancing the white-bias that occurs in the standard history textbooks. The story enthralled the students, and they could hardly wait for the next chapter on Story Day. Through Dark Elk and Lashuka they could identify with the Indians as real people. Although the ending was harsh and abrupt, it was in keeping with the feeling of unsettlement and emptiness that was thrust upon the Indians, and was appropriate for the story. This is a story that no one forgets."},{"Title":"Only earth and sky last forever","review":"In search of novels about Native Americans for my seventh grade classes, I recently read this work. The story of Dark Elk's struggle to make sense of his world in the critical historical period leading up to the battle of Little Bighorn is filled with a realistic mixture of hope, sorrow, strength, and futility. Benchley had my attention right up until the ending. After the big battle scene, however, I felt that Benchley must have run out of ideas. He summarizes the rest of his character's life in two short, un-enlightening paragraphs. Whether this listless conclusion symbolizes the emptiness of Dark Elk's remaining years or not, I found it to be unsatisfactory."},{"Title":"Only earth and sky last forever","review":"this was an excellent book because it tells the life of the native americans who lived here before us. I recommend it to any age reader."},{"Title":"Only earth and sky last forever","review":"This was a very interesting book. It taught me about all the ruff times the Native Americans went through when the Englishmen moved to North America. The book also showed how badly the Englishmen treated the Native Americans. The Englishmen would give the Indians free supplies just for living on a reservoir. The free supplies they got though were either rotten food or torn disgusting blankets. Many of the Native Americans would rather die fighting than to die on the reservoirs. This led to many battles between the Native Americans and the Englishmen."},{"Title":"Trust in Yourself: Thoughts about Listening to Your Heart and Becoming the Person You Want to Be (Selp-Help)","review":"Trust in Yourself, written by country/pop superstar Donna Fargo, is an excellent gift book (for yourself or somebody you love) of encouraging thoughts and messages.

While Tabucchi shows the same skill and control that he shows in his novellas, I'll admit to a preference for the latter.

The reason for this is because it is not argumentative in any manner and it is passive in its method of persuasion. Gives the reader all of the information necessary to make an informed decision on there opinions, which works in their favor. Another successful method used by this book is that the authors give positive and negative perspectives from teachers, students, and parent who have experienced this method of school scheduling. Also, given the credibility and experience of the authors, the language isn't over powering because they recognize their readers. If a person is looking for a nonbiased account on year-round schooling that is research, not opinion, based then this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Genealogical Resources in the New York Metropolitan Area","review":"I can not rate this book highly enough.

It has a very slow moving plot, that does not do anything for anyone. This book could have been condensed to 3 pages, instead of its novel size, because the plot has so few events. Perhaps it was a fine novel back when it was written, but it was a bit too &quot;lugubrious&quot; for me. The bottom line is this: if you are suffering from insomnia, I would recommend this book, because it will put you right to sleep. One more thing..

They have trouble simply getting through it, but their school deems the work edifying, or at least did the last time anybody bothered to review the reading lists, so it's off to SparkNotes and the sham continues.I claim boredom for this work but not in that sense, having read it voluntarily after all. Two novels I have ploughed through in the last year, namely The Idiot and Tale of Two Cities were more \\"boring\\" in the sense of being hard to get through, though both were greater novels by far I thought. I had no trouble on the other hand getting through Seven Gables. The boredom for me rather arose from finding nothing particularly compelling about Hawthorne's observations. Only a ponderous \\"behold my pronouncements\\" style. Rendered the more dull read so soon after that marvel of deft wit and light touch, Gulliver's Travels. Hawthorne is the anti-Swift--no travels for him! His lumbering, self-important prose reflecting his stolid, adventure-free life.An indiscriminate deployment of minute analysis unto every topic that wandered into his view--the chickens, the getting of Phoebe out of her bedroom and down the stairs (3 pages), as examples. And to what end? A dubious premise--that the sins of the ancestors are visited upon the descendants. By what mechanism--karma? The kind of God who keeps a ledger of credits and debits? Some mysterion he couldn't be bothered to elucidate, just woooo--ghosts! Then a banal and predictable outcome, in which all live happily. Half-baked trends such as \\"mesmerism\\" offered but not defended.How the novel might have been improved by Hawthorne getting out the damn house and down the street. Wade into the hubbub down at the Salem wharfs five minutes away--plenty of real adventure and drama to be found there, no need to resort to spooks. Dickens walked miles and miles in London. Melville went whaling. But this recessive little piggie stayed home, and the book suffers for it. Humorless gasbag, I say."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I tried to read this book for the first time when I was in my late teens, but I couldn't stand it. The language was just too flowery and long-winded. After twelve years or so, I just tried to read it again. This time, I was able to get through the book.I thoroughly enjoyed Hawthorne's descriptive language. His ability to paint a picture through words is amazing; however, this same technique is what caused the book to move so slowly. Hawthorne took hundreds of words to say what could easily have been said in a couple of sentences. Yes, that is just the way American romantic novelists of the mid-nineteenth century wrote; still, for American readers of the twenty-first century who are used to fast-paced life, this sort of writing can be difficult at times.My biggest problem with this book was its ending. Everything was just too neatly wrapped up. The remainder of the Pyncheon clan and Holgrave had too happy an ending. With the background of the Pyncheons, they should not have had such an ideal ending! The ending should not have been so neatly tied up. There should have been loose ends and serious problems remaining for everyone.If you enjoy Hawthorne or just simply want to become more familiar with mid-nineteenth century American literature, read The House of the Seven Gables. If you cannot abide books that spend more time with setting, descriptions, etc., than actual movement of the plot, you might want to read another book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"In my opinion, this is Hawthorne's masterpiece. Generally speaking, I do not like to compare Hawthorne and Dickens. However, this is probably the ONE TIME American Literature CAME THIS CLOSE to the fine masterpieces of Europe. Like Dickens, Hawthorne presents us with profound and chilling images. As Dickens presents us historical backgrounds and realistic pictures of Victorian England, Hawthorne does so (except with Puritan America.) As Dickens offers us deep psychological insights into human nature, so does Hawthorne. Hepzibah is fine as the poor woman who is out of place and needs to survive somehow and take care of her brother Clifford. Clifford is memorable as the character who teaches us about a second chance at youth, and who has to later take care of Hepzibah. Phoebe is touching as the innocent young woman who brings what cheer she can. Jaffrey is frightening as the villain who wants the mysterious lost treasure AT ANY COST. Chapter 18 not only offers a unique narration style, but is probably the most terrifying moment in all of Hawthorne's writing. As frightening and tragic as this story seems, Hawthorne manages to offer us a happy ending. If you are not that familiar with Hawthorne, you may do good to read Chapter 13 FIRST. The events in Chapter 13 take place before anything else."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Hawthorne's work is a creepy classic -- one of the most interesting books to emerge from an entirely different era of American letters."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"What a great book. In truth, I found The Scarlet Letter a little hard to read, though I can appreciate its merit. This novel, however, kept me involved from start to finish and the symbolism in the text is so rich that one could read HSOG twenty times and discover something new each time.Hawthorne is really dealing with appearances in this text but is also suggesting the step toward modernity with the advent of the railway and electricity, things still \\"novel\\" at the time of writing. HSOG spurns tradition in many ways and lays bear the faults of an aristocratic society.This is a small book, but very dense. A rewarding classic without question."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"150 years ago, on the site of the house of the old Pyncheon family in Providence, New England, lived one Mathew Maule in a log-built hut who was executed for the crime of witchcraft. Before dying, Maule uttered a prophecy to Colonel Pyncheon: \\"God will give him blood to drink.\\"Villagers could not understand that Pyncheon wanted to build his house over the unquiet grave of the dead wizard Maule and why he should prefer this site that had already been accursed in all the vastness of New England. At any rate the house was built in the grotesqueness of Gothic fancy with seven gables pointing sharply to the sky. On the day of the ceremony of consecration of the house, Colonel Pyncheon suddenly died and some said that Maule's prophecy could be heard throughout the house spoken in a loud voice...From father to son, the family clung to the ancestral house with tenacity. Bu Mathew Maule's prophecy seems to have planted a heavy footstep on the conscience of the Pyncheons as though they committed again the guilt of their ancestor thus inheriting a great misfortune.An impressive novel in which an old house itself is the major character. The story is filled with contrasts and oppositions between the dark and gloomy interior of the house and the bright and sunlit exterior. Shadow is the atmosphere of the invisible world of evil, of the past hidden in the recesses of the old mansion. As one follows the lives of Hepzibah, Phoebe and Clifford, one realises that the human fates of the present times are closely linked to the web of the past."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Im 17 years old and I enjoyed Hawethorne's classic tale, House of the Seven Gables.

At his best he was sublime (&quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;), and at his worst he was ridiculous (&quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot;). This books lies somewhere in between. It is based on an interesting premise, the handing down of a sin through generations, and the dark shadow of Puritanism. The plot is slow to get moving, however, and most of the characters are less than engaging. Still, it's worth a good look, especially if you have visited the house itself upon which the tale is based, in Salem."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"So far this is my favorite Hawthorn novel, although to say that is deceiving. I have only read \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" and \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" which I loathed... even seeing the cover of the \\"Scarlet Letter\\" brings on waves of nausea which only large quantities of sunshine and a good dose of trashy horror novels can cure. But that was long ago, and I am a much more mature reader now, besides, people call this a horror novel.They Lie.This is not a horror novel... It's some sort of family drama/morality tale with a smattering of bad romance thrown in. So is it terrible? No, Hawthorn does have a way with words... but I also believe that he thinks his readers have the short term memory of a melon, therefore he has a tendency to continually bash the reader over the head with an idea until he is absolutely positive that even a mouth breathing troglodyte will not only understand, but also have it burned into the interior of their skull.Short Summary: Loooong ago a maniacal Puritan leader by the name of Pyncheon falsely executed a local by the name of Matthew Maule by claiming he was a wizard and in league with the devil. As he was hung, Maule uttered a curse on both Pyncheon and his descendents. Pyncheon then takes over Maule's land, plows his house under and builds his own enormous dwelling on top of it - a house with Seven Gables. Flash forward to the 19th century and we have the descendants of Pyncheon, still living in the house and suffering as their family's wealth, status and sanity have dwindled to almost nothing. The elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon(that's a female name by the way) is forced to open a penny shop to try to bring food in. Enter Pheobe Pyncheon, a niece who has come to stay with Hepzibah and is full of life and vitality. They run the shop, do some gardening and entertain Clifford (Hepzibah's brother) all the while living in fear of their cousin Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon who seems to want something from them.There were some parts of this book I enjoyed, and the over all concept was interesting... the sins of the father shall be paid for by the sons, but there is a lot that is left unexplained. And the reader is never sure if there truly is a curse or if the fear of a curse is what has kept the Pyncheon family down for all of these generations. Their sense of pride is almost a physical character in the book. In truth there is only one likeable character in the book, and that's Pheobe... and Hawthorn is so determined to make us like her that he goes on and on about everything she does, how she looks, how bloody cheerful she is, how everything is better as long as Pheobe is around... to the point that the reader hopes a ghost either gets her so that we don't have to read any more about her or grabs the rest of the household so that she can live in peace.I understand the historical significance of Hawthorn's works, and his mastery of the language. However this particular book becomes almost as suffocating as the house itself, dreary, stifling, repetitious and sadly... the reader may find themselves searching for a way to escape (much as Clifford does)... lucky for us the escape is much easier than it is for the characters. There are other classics that I would recommend before digging into this one. It's not a difficult read, after the first 15 pages or so the language clicks and you can read it quite easily... it's just not an overly exciting read, nor is it an overly rewarding read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"To those who approach \\"classics\\" with trepidation, I heartly recommend House of the Seven Gables. Not only the characters but the very house come alive, in all their splendor and in all their shortcomings.Cousin Hepzibah Pynchon stands as one of the most pitiful but admirable characters of fiction. The befuddled Clifford, the mysterious Holgrave, and the sweet Phoebe come alive to the reader. Even the house itself has a life and a spirit.Come home to the House of the Seven Gables."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is probably one of the most despised figures in the American literary canon, at least in the minds of the millions of school children forced to read \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" I will go so far as to admit I never finished that novel. I took one look through the book and laughed at the ridiculous idea of reading such a convoluted looking story. That was at age seventeen. Now, many years later I am able to go back and actually read some of these daunting novels. What is surprising is that they are not daunting at all, just written in an ornate style from a different age. The plots often deal with the same issues and concerns modern people fret about. For those uninterested in relationships and human dramas, there are also great old stories with supernatural elements, which is where this book comes in. This edition of the book includes an introduction by Mary Oliver and several commentaries on the work by Edwin Percy Whipple, Henry T. Tuckerman, F.O. Matthiessen, and Herman Melville. The Melville commentary is actually a letter the author of \\"Moby Dick\\" sent to Hawthorne where he concludes with a demand that Hawthorne \\"walk down one of these mornings and see me.\\" Pretty neat.In \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" the author tells his reader the story is a romance. What he means by this terminology is not a cheap paperback that involves swooning hearts with Fabio on the cover, but \\"a legend prolonging itself, from an epoch now gray in the distance, down into our own broad daylight.\\" Hawthorne's specific goal is to show that the bad behavior of one generation devolves on future descendents. He accomplishes this by examining the Pyncheon family, a clan founded on America's shores by the stern Puritan Colonel Pyncheon, who used his considerable influence to inveigle prime real estate from one Matthew Maule in the 17th century. Pyncheon carried out this task by using the Salem witchcraft scare to secure Maule's execution. In his last moments, Maule laid a curse on the good Colonel and all of his descendents, telling him that God would give them blood to drink as a punishment for this evil injustice. Shortly after the Colonel builds his house with seven gables on Maule's property, he dies in a way that makes Maule's curse seem to be a reality. Rather than trace this terrible evil down through the ages in minute detail, Hawthorne only touches on a few important points before beginning his story in the middle of the 19th century.The Pyncheon family is slowly moldering into extinction when Hawthorne introduces us to poor old Hepzibah Pyncheon. She lives alone in the ancient estate, reduced to near starvation because her brother Clifford is in prison and Jaffrey Pyncheon, a rich judge who lives in his own manor in the country, refuses to offer her assistance. The only way to survive for Hepzibah is to open a penny store in an old part of the decaying house. Just when things reach a nadir, another Pyncheon turns up to save the day. This is Phoebe, a vivacious young lady who lives in the country. This fetching lass is a blessing for Hepzibah; she runs the penny store, helps to lift the gloomy atmosphere in the house, and when Clifford returns from his long imprisonment, Phoebe entertains the doddering man with her multitude of charms. She even strikes up an acquaintance with Holgrave, a young boarder in the house. Things start to look up when yet another tragedy strikes the Pyncheon family, leading to the momentary evacuation of the ancestral estate by Hepzibah and Clifford before Hawthorne settles all accounts in an ending that is both quick and highly implausible.The reputation this book has with many people is not good. They disparage the lengthy digressions, the massive amount of time Hawthorne takes to explore Hepzibah's dilemma over opening the penny store, the sentences that go on and on without seeming to make any point whatsoever, and the organization of the book as a whole. There is some foundation in these charges. The chapters describing the penny store do seem interminable, especially when viewed in the context of the story as a whole. As for the descriptions of Hepzibah's scowling countenance and Clifford's puny mental state, we get the idea well before Hawthorne quits harping on them. Yes, there are flaws in \\"The House of the Seven Gables.\\"However, I personally enjoyed the deeply rich 19th century prose. Hawthorne's command of the English language is impressive and, at times, as precise as a cruise missile. One need only read the chapter about Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon's unfortunate incident in the house to grasp the beauty of this author's style. As for the digressions, if people have a problem with chapters such as \\"Alice Pyncheon\\" and the introductory material setting down the history of the doomed family, it is really their loss. It is when Hawthorne writes about supernatural elements that he really managed to grab me. If this counts as a lengthy digression from the story, I will take more, please!If I had to assign a Hawthorne novel to a group of slack jawed high school students, I would give them this one in place of \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" At least with \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" someone might enjoy the eerie curse that united the Maules with the Pyncheons for two centuries. A letter sewn on clothing cannot stack up against ghosts, a disembodied hand, and mysterious deaths. The kids will still grumble, but not as much when they realize there are less \\"thees\\" and \\"thous\\" tossed around in this novel."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"It's very obvious from reading all of these reader reviews that The House of the Seven Gables is not for everyone. But, I urge you to determine if it is for you. If it is, you certainly don't want to miss it. This novel was not written with today's readers in mind. You cannot call it quick-paced, by any stretch of the imagination. The novel is however, a wonderful work of art. Every sentence, every word is carefully crafted, carefully chosen. This novel is meant to be read slowly, to be savored. The novel tells a fairly simple story--the story of the house, and its perhaps doomed family of inhabitants. Many years after a curse by a supposed warlock--there are only 4 members of the doomed family surviving. Is the house haunted? Maybe. Hawthorne is so clever--every time he tells us about a supposed ghost or haunting, he gives us a more &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation. Were they ghosts swirling around the house one evening, or was it just the wind. Is the family doomed? Maybe, but then there is young Pheobe who seems anything but. The House of Seven Gables is far superior to any contemporary gothic you can read. It is novel writing at its best. The characters have depth, the story is engaging, and even, at times, funny. But, you have to be ready for a novel written well over a hundred years ago. If you are, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I must say that the negative reviews that I have read about Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables are sorely off the mark. The prevalent sentiments are that the plot is dull (or almost absent), the characters are flat, and the description is overwrought. But you who say this are simply missing the point, as well as taking Hawthorne's work out of context. You have to understand that this novel was written during a very transitional period in literature. Writers had shifted from the Enlightenment to Romanticism (the period in which Hawthorne writes), and as Hawthorne writes his novels, another movement is being made to Realism. Realism is what we are used to in modern fiction. It contains real characters and real events. But Hawthorne had not yet fully employed these new ideas, and he still hung on to the Romantic sentiments. Therefore, he was much more interested in ideas rather than character development (a modern technique). Hawthorne chooses to convey ideas, emotions, morals, etc. rather than fully developed the characters like they would be in a novel today.As for no plot, you have to keep in mind that Hawthorne still looks to the old tradition (not to mention his guilt of his heritage), so he uses his writing as a way to teach moral lessons, not necessarily to describe a highly detailed story and plot.Finally, I can't deny that there is plenty of narrative description, but most of it serves a great purpose, and for the parts that you think do not belong, just read and enjoy them for their poetic beauty and technical merit.Hawthorne is a fantastic writer, but to acknowledge this, the reader must not take his work out of its context."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Sometimes it seems a mistake to force high school students to read 19th century literature. It does take patience to adjust to the \\"old fashioned\\" prose, but it's worth the effort. House of Seven Gables is an eerie ghost story based upon actual historical events. Hawthorne knew Salem and its history inside and out, and he also knew how to create a haunting atmosphere and a story that stays in the mind forever. He's one of the few authors who conveys a sense of Puritan fatalism and repression without resorting to gothic romance cliches. This is an excellent piece of literature, and if you haven't given it a chance by rereading it as an adult, you're missing a great experience."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I read the House of the Seven Gables about thirty five years ago. I enjoyed the book then and I enjoyed rereading it. Nathaniel Hawthorne has a way of turning a phrase. There are portions of the book that I have reread several times. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves to read the classics. Hawthorne details scenes and emotion in a brisk, but complex way. I felt, sometimes, I was living in New England. As a classic, House is very readable. I try not to analyze, to deeply, all of the reasons a writer chooses how to handle a subject. Mid-nineteenth century literature can be a joy to read, it rewards one with a tangible sense of history. If you enjoy reading House, try The Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"What can you say about Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;House of the Seven Gables&quot; that hasn't been said before? It's dark; it's Gothic; much of it is depressing; and the language is dense 19th century prose. Those who read primarily for plot will find it slow going, and those who look for likeable characters may be largely disappointed. In other words, for modern readers, this book may be a tough sell. Personally, I found it a little dull and a letdown after having recently reread (and enjoyed) &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot;Nonetheless, &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; has its pleasures. Hawthorne, the scion of an old Massachusetts Puritan family, injects an unusual sense of historical depth into his writings. This is certainly true of &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; which explores the idea of character flaws, evil and retribution passed down from generation to generation in a single family. Of course not everyone in the family is guilty, but the sins of a few taint the lives of all. As in much of Hawthorne's work, the supernatural, sometimes implied and sometimes explicit, plays a role in the workings of the plot. Even the daguerrotypist--nothing but an early photographer to us--must have given the 19th century reader a frisson because of his combination of mesmeric powers and miraculous ability to produce telling images out of pure light.Hawthorne is a master of description, an expert at using his words to create images that convey far more than simple visuals. Even when the plot seemed stale and the characters wooden, the author's use of the language made it worth continuing. Hawthorne's descriptions of a little boy's love of animal-shaped cookies, of the garden with Maule's bitter well, and of the dead Jaffrey unmoving in his chair, to mention just a few, made the book well worth reading. &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; may or may not be Hawthorne's best work (that's always a matter of opinion--try some of his short stories too), but it is an interesting book nonetheless"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"A slow, leisurely, and deep read. Hawthorne has a wonderful prose style that is uniquely him. He has a poetic way of taking things that seem small or insignificant and making them large and thoughtful. The plot does not move along quickly, but I found that the reading did. The characters seem to move in slow motion for a great majority of the book, and every movement has volumes of meaning. I feel this book is very representative of the emergence of american values of equality, of a disdain for the importance previously placed on pedigree or heritage and of course, of the emphasis on things like virtue, humility, etc. A delicious read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Besides being a classic Hawthorne this is an exceptional edition because of the wonderful annotation."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The story, Hawthorne's second, is a romantic mystery that takes place in a battered seven gable house in a small New England town. It begins with a complicated and top-heavy backdrop. At its center is the socially prominent Pyncheon family. The Pyncheons are a family that holds many dark, mysterious and often deadly secrets -- not the least of them being that 150 years earlier, the land on which the house of the seven gables was built, was actually swindled away from its rightful owner, Matthew Maude, by the locally prominent Colonel Jaffery Pyncheon. After the \\"good colonel\\" had swindled away the land, he then promptly (and conveniently) proceeded to have Maude executed for practicing witchcraft - an easy charge for a prominent citizen to level against someone of lesser status at the time. However, from the scaffold, Maude placed a curse on the entire Pyncheon family, and the plot of the story is launched. The rest of the story is primarily about both the unfolding of the deadly secrets of the Pyncheon family, and the effects of the curse that Maude had placed upon them, get played out.Colonel Pyncheon was so unfazed by the promised curse that he brazenly hired to build (on the land he had just swindled from his father) Maude's son as his carpenter. Well, he \\"shouldn't have oughta\\" done that because true to the curse, at the house warming the \\"good Colonel\\" is found dead sitting at his desk. To add more intrigue to an already galloping mystery, the Colonel had also left a will with directions to a deed for a giant tract of land somewhere in Maine.With this dense backdrop the prologue ends and sets up a complicated pretext for the second act of the story, which begins with Hepzibah, an old maid and one of the few remaining heirs to the now dwindling Pyncheon fortune as she opens up a penny store on the ground floor of the house of the seven gables. Finally waking up to her diminished social condition, becoming a shop operator was her last resort way of trying to \\"make ends meet.\\"The rest of the story and its intertwined intrigues, unfold within the store and with the tenants of the house being at its center. The Maude's curse continues to bring bad luck to the Pyncheon household, culminating in Jaffery Pyncheon II's alleged murder by his young nephew, Clifford. After spending 30 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Clifford, the last of the Pyncheons still possessing first hand knowledge of the complicated set of family secrets, returns to the house, to be cared for by his elder sister.Everyone thinks Clifford knows where the deed is, including his uncle who stalks the returned prisoner for his hidden secrets. But the deed is never found and the uncle, like his father, is found dead sitting at the same desk as his dead father was found. Hepzibah and Clifford abandon the house for a time but return in time for Phoebe and Hargrove (a photographer and tenant), to wed. This wedding appeared to be the cathartic medicine needed to rid the house of its evil spirits. Yet, Phoebe and her new husband chose to move the family away from the cursed home, and they (apparently) lived happily ever afterwards.The moral of the story is that the sins of one generation can live on to infect subsequent generations. Or said differently, the sins of the father will always revisit the sons of subsequent generations. This was a much too long and too complicated and illogical novel for my taste. Three stars"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This book is really good. Very deep mystery about a dying witch's curse. It's not a fast-moving thriller, by a slow and methodical one. Every word is chosen so carefully by Hawthorne, that it is fun to read and a challenge for the mind to find the hidden meaning. The novel starts with a discription of the house- the house with human attributes and ends with a lone cat watching the fulfillment of a witch's curse. Really excellent. There's plenty of characterization, hints of incest, and omenious surrounding to keep the reader entertained. Love love loved it, read it in a college American literature class."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I was just on vacation in Salem and wanted to read this book again... Sounds like another review I read... DeJaVu. It has been such a long time, and to be honest, I'm not sure I ever read it now. It took several pages to get used to the language, but once I did I have had trouble putting it down. At the rate I'm going, I'll finish it in a few days. I don't want to give away any plot for those who haven't read it, so I won't say anything about the story. This edition was put together by a group of volunteers and I heard the free books can be hit or miss on the conversion to Kindle format. I haven't seen any instances where the book was obviously incorrectly converted or anything like that. It has been a Gem so far, and my wife will want to read it right after I'm done. I'm glad I started with this one as my first book on the Kindle."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is my favorite American novelist (well, except for Henry James. But I never really think of James as American, since his works all seem so British...). And \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" is my favorite of Hawthorne's works. To modern readers who are wired for short attention spans and fast-paced, plot-centric, dialogue-heavy prose, I can see where this book would be daunting and difficult. But to readers who appreciate the beauty of language, the importance of meaning behind plot, and an author's ability to transport you to another time and place, this book is phenomenal. Hawthorne masterfully weaves an imaginative, romantic tale, giving us insight into a very specific corner of our heritage that is often overlooked in American history, and of which modern audiences (and even scholars) know very little.If you're not used to reading the classics, this might not be the best one to start with. But if you've already cut your teeth on Dickens or Austen or Eliot, this book will be a treasured favorite to add to your collection."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Wordy, pedantic, familial soap-opera... yes, yes, and yes.As much is made of Hawthorne's mastery of the English language, his style doesn't translate to the modern reader terribly well in The House of the Seven Gables. Many reviews here criticize the slow-moving story line, frequent digressions, and over-abundance of adjectives. Be that as it may, it's a wonderful period view of New England society. I, too, found the first half to be difficult going much of the way, but the detailed snapshot of life in the mid-19th century kept me going.It's not a horror story, it's a time capsule."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Hawthorne I believe is the best American writer of all time. Rather than romanticize the house for the purposes of story telling, he provides us with more of a lesson in community, law and history while putting the house of seven gables in such a perspective.His style is magnificent and he never strays from his purpose of uplifting the human soul to indulge in sensationalism, or the like except in his the artist's story of Matthew Maule and the Pyncheon's which is quite a humorous exposition.What impresses me most and distinguishes Hawthorne from most other American writers, is well beyond his excessive grace and knowledge is that his characters are all story tellers, and not just some stiffs spouting off one liners in the midst of some formulaic or contrived plot. His contrivance of plot the legal documents is funny and well put into perspective by his emphasis on the human condition in a new england town.Its a very good book, although the Scarlet Letter was more gripping to me. I think he is a far better author than Twain and especially Faulkner who I believe is a total hack, and even Melville for Hawthorne's spareness, clarity and grace. And Hemingway - give me a break, that guy is not in the same league as Stephen King. Hawthorne is definitely the greatest writer in American literature, although of course he didn't turn out the same number of books as some of these other guys, you can only read so many books anyway.Grace, style and exposition (with romance) of all manners of the human condition and sound advice are what makes Hawthorne the best. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne continues to prove his amazingly gifted talent as he writes The House of Seven Gables. This literary masterpiece is now one of my favorite of his works along with The Scarlet Letter. The most obvious common thing both novels share is the use of symbolism. It is undeniable how his novel is delectable and truly a work of art. Combined with the horror tale of ghosts, the curse following generations, a hint of humor, the history and setting of the nineteenth century, romanticism, and the drama that follows, Hawthorne proves how ingenious he really is.The novel beings describing the old Pyncheon House, otherwise known as the House of Seven of Gables, and divulges the house's misfortune. The House of Seven Gables was built by Colonel Pyncheon, who was an early Puritan settler. The land on which the house was being built, however, belonged to Mathew Maule who later was charged with witchcraft and forever cursed the Pyncheon family before he was hanged. Almost a century and a half later occupying the house is Hepzibah Pyncheon and Mr. Holgrave and Phoebe Pyncheon, the young cousin of Hepzibah who is only visiting. Soon after Phoebe arrives, Hepzibah's brother, Clifford, is just let out of his thirty year imprisonment for being wrongly accused of his uncle's death because of his cousin Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon. When Phoebe returns to her home, the house is just as gloomy as it was before. Judge Jaffrey, then, visits the house and demands Hepzibah to speak with Clifford. After refusing, Hepzibah finally gives in and goes into Clifford's chamber to find that he is not there but in the parlor pointing at Judge Jaffrey dead body in the chair sitting. Quickly Hepzibah and Clifford take off to the train station and leave from the House of Seven Gables. Meanwhile, Phoebe returns and Mr. Holgrave lets her in, tells her about Judge Jaffrey's death, and then confronts her about his affection for her and she does the same. In the end, Judge Jaffrey's wealth is strangely inherited by Hepzibah, Phoebe, and Clifford.Hawthorne's writing is effectively powerful in the depth of this novel as he magnificently planned what may seem like a simple story really goes beyond the lines of realism and imagination. Although the book and characters seemed to move slowly because of all the descriptions and be a little difficult to read, I still grasped the concept and realized that the description served a meaningful purpose for Nathaniel Hawthorne, in my opinion, is one of the best literary novelists. The House of Seven Gables is genuinely a classic and a memorable masterpiece."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"At first I felt the characters were too gloomy for my taste and it took some effort to keep reading. Hawthorne's writing style kept me going because it is so clearly descriptive that I felt I was experiencing the story (creepy as it was at times). When the young relative was introduced into the story, it gained momentum and I was hooked. I can see where the story would hold little interest for teenagers and is better suited for more mature readers, but I certainly can see why this book has been around for 150 years."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"People who are patient enough to appreciate the writer's craft, educated enough to understand the significance of those pesky things called words, worldly enough to know that life beyond the television set exists will enjoy Hawthorne's best novel in its original form. For others, simplified versions are available."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I remember enjoying this old classic as a teenager. But compared to current novels, I found it less than enchanting. Very little action. Very little dialogue. Lots and lots of philosophizing by the author."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I choose this book as it is on the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list. I try to read at least 20 a year. I struggled with the book and at times it was difficult to follow along. Not sure if it was the book or just the time I read it."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"My introduction to the genre of Gothic Fiction was actually made not by a novel or short story, but by a graphic novel. Unlike the films, Mike Mignola's Hellboy series is a dark and moody walk through crumbled castles and vine-ridden monasteries, albeit with the occasional gun fight and mad Nazi scientist. Reading it got me in the mood for more of the same, and after some research I discovered that Mignola was playing with a genre that's been around for quite some time. The addition of the Guardian List brought with it a large selection of Gothic fiction to the WWEnd site, including one novel by an author I was already familiar with, Nathaniel Hawthorne.By the time Hawthorne wrote his very popular House of the Seven Gables, he was working within an established genre whose shape and borders had already been established by such writers as Horace Walpole, William Beckford, Matthew Lewis, Charles Maturin, and Edgar Allan Poe. Hawthorne doesn't disappoint any reader who comes to his novel expecting the same as what these earlier writers provided: ancient aristocratic homes, tyrannous judges, estranged relatives, unspeakable crimes from long ago, one-sided depictions of ancient religious communities, and of course a good haunting. While his book was and is well loved, I'm not sure that I agree with those who love it.But the fault isn't, I think, with the genre itself. Even though this is probably the only novel I've read that accurately conforms to the classical tropes of the Gothic genre--authors like Bram Stoker and of H.P. Lovecraft wrote books similar to the Gothic, but were developing their own ideas--I still have a strong draw to its peculiar atmosphere. Hawthorne, though, is something of a hack writer, and that harms the novel. Never content to allow a metaphor to remain implicit, he often spends multiple pages explicating an image he just inserted into the narrative, as though afraid its meaning might possibly pass a reader by. His prose is hardly bad in and of itself, but he can't stop himself from pointing out his own cleverness. Adding to this weakness is his proclivity for digression, in which he interrupts an ongoing part of the narrative to talk about a character's or object's history, or to wax so poetic about something or other that the wax starts dripping all over the place. But for all his literary gurning, Hawthorne leaves a hugely important occurrence at the end of the narrative unexplained even after so much else is revealed. Sometimes one wishes he would shut up and tell the story.Here's part of Hawthorne's description of the eponymous house:\\"All, as they approached, looked upward at the imposing edifice, which was henceforth to assume its rank among the habitations of mankind. There it rose, a little withdrawn from the line of the street, but in pride, not modesty. Its whole visible exterior was ornamented with quaint figures, conceived in the grotesqueness of a Gothic fancy, and drawn or stamped in the glittering plaster, composed of lime, pebbles, and bits of glass, with which the woodwork of the walls was overspread. On every side the seven gables pointed sharply towards the sky, and presented the aspect of a whole sisterhood of edifices, breathing through the spiracles of one great chimney.... Little spiral rods of iron beautified each of the seven peaks.\\"Although The House of the Seven Gables is probably not the best example of Gothic fiction, its influence, especially on American horror, cannot be denied. Hawthorne himself is something of an acquired taste, but I know many people who think he's one of the finest literary figures from early America. Maybe someday I'll come around to their way of thinking, but it might be a while."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I did not have to read Hawthorne in high-school, so my impressions were not based on some previous experience. I did not quite know what to expect when I picked it up. What I got was a moderately interesting book, which did not touch me on any serious emotional level. The problems faced by its characters are dated and don't translate well into modern world, the thoughts may have been original in 19th century, but by now are trivial, the characters are built through descriptions and not through actions. There are several paragraphs in the book that I thought were great and interesting, so the book is not a total waste of time. In a way, I can see why it became a classic of American literature, but it did not preserve well.One thing that I'd like to point out is a complete lack of any moral or a point to the story. It's just a collection of events that happened to leave positive characters prospering and the bad guy dying. Random stuff. \\"S..t happens and sometimes it happens for good\\" seems to be the main idea of the book. It's an OK idea for a \\"vacation-book\\", but I usually expect more from a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Though there were definitely times when this book was slow or difficult to understand, Hawthorne's writing, through the use of metaphors, allusions and other rhetorical devices is a wonderful accomplishment. It was hard for me to get into the book at the beginning and especially through the long discussion of the Pyncheon family but it payed off to know this information when the climax arose. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, but was not totally impressed by the story, reguardless of the universal themes that apply to us today."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I have come to the conclusion that this is a novel you will either love or you just can't get into it. I am one who couldn't get into it. Hawthorne gets off of the topic often and takes forever to accomplish the discription of something I felt most writers could have done more quickly and more succesfully. All of the discription seemed excessive and only confused me. I had to force myself to read the first half of this book, and by the time I had reached that point I came to the conclusion that if it hadn't already captured my attention then it wasn't going to.I have always enjoyed early American literature, Greek literature, and have read my fare share of William Shakespeare, but I just couldn't enjoy this one. It was just too dry, and the story really seemed to go no where. I really couldn't recommend this one to anyone as a good read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The book arrived in good condition, well-wrapped but I would hesitate to buy from here or anywhere again which uses DHL and then transfers the order to another company for delivery.

Instead it traveled one and a half times around the country with DHL (according to the tracking record it went from Texas to Kentucky then finally to California, where it was given to USPS to deliver.) Yes, it arrived within the 19 days window, but that was a very silly route to take. At the same time another order of mine came from the east coast to here in only 3 days directly with the USPS.

But I made my way through the House of the Seven Gables and think I should give my honest opinion. I read this when I was a voracious reader and was plowing through a book every two or three days. I made a point of making every third book I read a piece of classic literature. Without much exception I could really see why these books were classics. They resonate with meaning even today. This slender tome was one of the most dry, difficult and unstimulating books I recall reading during that time period. In spite of its modest size it took me more than a week to finish. Just when it would start getting interesting it would turn deadly dull. The language is the dry pretentious sort that leaves you feeling like you just swallowed the dust off the books in a thousand libraries. The book is all descriptive of the pervasive spirit that indwells the house as a result of its operatic history. The characters that dwell in the house are merely furniture for the house with little backstories of their own. But mostly they are there to set a mood. Little of interest happens in the book. It is a book about language and mood. Call me pedestrian but House of the Seven Gables could have made its point more interestingly if written by Count Floyd on SCTV. Look boys and girls...this house here is scary. It will scare the pants off you. Look at that picture on the wall with the frame. I bet your hair is turning white. Whooo. I am frightened just thinking about it. Hooowwwwlllll. House of Seven Gables inspires me to write a hundred seventy page book describing indepth the decay of my last television set. I am going overboard but this is a book ideal for people who like Hawthorne. If you like spending time decyphering meanings from carefully chosen words you may greatly enjoy this book.

Through a series of strong arm tactics, the senior Pyncheon brings a curse onto the family with the House of Seven Gables - a house designed and built for Pyncheon by Maule's son on land that had been wrested from the Maule family. After generations of failure and thwarted ambition, the Pyncheon line is almost dead and the curse continues to linger. There is only an old maid with a scowl to scare children, Hepzibah; her brother Clifford who returns from a long imprisonment for the murder of his uncle; Judge Pyncheon, the son of Clifford's victim, an ambitious man who cloaks the depravities of his soul with a false magnanimity; and Phoebe, a country cousin who seems not to be born down with the weight of the curse except through her exposure to the others. When the Judge dies under mysterious circumstances in the House of Seven Gables, the curse is set to either finally destroy the Pyncheons and the Maules or to expire and leave them to a new peace.House of Seven Gables is more notable for me in the language that he uses. The way he describes everything is absolutely beautiful, particularly when he is describing the young women - \\" All her little womanly ways, budding out of her like blossoms on a young fruit tree, had their effect on him, and sometimes caused his very heart to tingle with the keenest thrills of pleasure. At such moments - for the effect was seldom more than momentary - the half-torpid man would be full of harmonious life, just as a long-silent harp is full of sound, when the musician's fingers sweep across it.\\""},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This was a slow yet interesting read that definitely helps to build a strong vocabulary, something that is hard to find these days. I found the plot interesting yet it moved somewhat too slow for me, especially at the end, which seems to drag on for a couple of chapters without getting to the point. Overall, it is a recommended read, if only to experience the artistic writing style."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Although I'm a big fan of Hawthorne's short stories, this is my first venture into his novel writing. His short stories, by their very nature, move from conflict to climax without much ado. They are preachy, pedantic, and allegorical--and I love them. \\"...Seven Gables\\" moves along at a much slower pace, developing symbolism and characters with greater subtlety and depth. The plot itself is not much deeper than one of his short stories. We watch humbled, yet strong Hepzibah struggle for a living from a one room shop in the house. Along the way, she meets a variety of characters and becomes host and confidant to a long-lost relative, gentle Phoebe. Phoebe is sunlight, poking into the shadows of the gabled house, bringing vivacity to its occupants, Hepzibah, Clifford, and Holgrave. Yes, Hawthorne hints at sinister things in the past and present of the old house, but only with the arrival of Judge Pyncheon do we begin to suspect trouble brewing.The conclusion of the book involves death and hidden riches and suspicions and redemption. The symbols throughout--the house, the chimney, the elm tree, the chickens, etc.--manage to reveal their purposes in due time. In a satisfactory manner, Hawthorne contrasts the insidious nature of religious hypocrisy with the virtues of honesty and gentle love. The horrors of the Pyncheons' past fade away in the light of Phoebe's commitment and care. Her time in the house brings life to all within...all except one.Hawthorne could've encapsulated this tale in one of his short stories. He could've sliced away words with meticulous demand. Instead, he allows us to know and care for the people in his story. Some readers, granted, will find it difficult to care and will call it a waste of their time; sure, it takes a little effort. But, just as Phoebe and Hepzibah display sacrificial love, a reader who's willing to give the time might find worthwhile rewards by the book's end.If you're already a fan, you'll enjoy it. I certainly did. If it seems too long, try some of his short works and work up your appetite for these heartier courses. This is rich stuff."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"When I first began reading this book, I thought, &quot;Ah, crap! A book that'll be as boring as the monotonous English teacher.&quot; But then I began to pick apart what Hawthorne was saying, and it is a little hard, because he uses an antiquated, descriptive style of writing. Its a very cerebral horror, one that if you care at all about great literature you'll appreciate and love. Its not the easiest book to like, but give it a try."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"If you want a fast paced action thriller, then rent a movie.

Hawthorne's language has a nice poetic flow to it, and once accustomed to it, reads very smoothly. The first chapters of this book were the hardest for me to get into, or care about. Though Hawthorne weaves his words well, his characters are less interesting, and sometimes the slowness of the plot makes you wonder what direction the book is going. Or if it has any direction at all. Also, I didn't really feel that this book had a lot of supernatural elements in it, there were some to be sure,though they were hardly anything to get excited about. Many passages were overly long and took away from the enjoyment of the novel. This book took me about 2 months to read, although I read several books during that time as well.

All in all, it was a decent book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's 'The House of the Seven Gables' today enjoys unshakable status as one of the brighter stars in the firmament of American literature. Though praised by Hermann Melville, Edgar Allen Poe, and other respected authors and critics at the time of its publication in 1851, many of today's readers may question the novel's reputation for greatness. Was it one of the first substantial novels by an American author? Where Americans of the era, tired of bowing to European cultural tradition, hungry for a literary hero of their own? Undoubtedly. Coming more than twenty years after the bright, crisp style of Washington Irving, the regressive 'House of the Seven Gables' reads like the kind of tiresome classic many people dread being forced to confront in higher education classes, for the book feels more like the product of the 18th rather than the 19th century. Like the balance of Irving's short stories, 'The House of the Seven Gables' is set a century earlier than the period in which it was written, thus making comparisons with Irving even more difficult to ignore.The major problem with 'The House of the Seven Gables' is that its story could be told by a shrewder and less indulgent author in one tenth of its 268 somnolent pages. Hawthorne worked within the framework of a specifically chosen plot and theme, yet the novel, taken page by page, appears to be about almost nothing: there seem to be vacuums between the words, voids between the sentences, gulfs between the paragraphs. Hawthorne considered this work a romance, and there are some suitably gothic shadows, but, if in fact a romance, 'The House of the Seven Gables' is the flattest major romance in Western literature. Though its plot elements include a corrupt judge, accusations of witchcraft, the hanging of a sorcerer, a poisoned well, and a murderous, disembodied hand, the tone throughout is tepid and airless.Structurally, the novel is disastrous. Elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon, one of the last members of a declining New England family, is opening a small penny goods shop on the lower floor of the seven-gabled house in which she lives in solitude. Now financially destitute, Hepzibah bravely faces down her elitist illusions concerning her family's social superiority when she realizes how completely present the wolf is at her door.After a turgid history of the righteous Pyncheons of Salem in chapter one, the second concerns itself only with an account of Hepzibah's fumbling attempts to open the shop on its first day of business. In the third chapter--\\"The First Customer\\"--Hepzibah encounters her first customer. By the close of the fourth, \\"A Day Behind The Counter,\\" readers find themselves on the book's 56th page, almost one-fifth of the book, and still passing the time unproductively with Hepzibah in the shop on its opening day.Unfortunately, Hepzibah's protracted confrontation with reality is the strongest part of the book, Hepzibah being by far the most distinctive of the characters within its pages. But Hepzibah soon fades into the background, taking away with her what little drama exists; none follows.In a later chapter, Hawthorne spends 6,352 words coyly conveying to the reader that an apparently sleeping man is not sleeping, but dead, something the reader has already guessed after completing the first of the many hammering paragraphs to follow.Winded passages like \\"You hear the ticking of his watch; his breath you do not hear. A most refreshing slumber, doubtless! And yet he cannot be asleep. His eyes are open!\\" and \\"an infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated sight! Where is our universe? All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring about, in a quest for what was once a world!\\" abound.Hawthorne was fond of exclamation points and short of self-discipline. It could be argued that Hawthorne was simply layering his prose with multiple crosshatches of irony, sarcasm, and satire, but, if so, Hawthorne, here already a king with no clothes, only doubly underscores his shortcomings as a prose stylist.Readers of Hawthorne's third novel, the punishing 'The Blithedale Romance' (1952), or his short stories 'My Kinsman, Major Molineux' and 'The May-Pole of Merrymount' know how willfully vague and turgid Hawthorne's work can be. His reputation today is probably some combination of accident of birth, proximity to high society, uncritical alliance to literary tradition, and the fact that his suffering prose style is interpreted by the pretentious or uneducated as evidence of highbrow genius. In truth, Hawthorne simply did not prove himself a very good writer in most of his work, regardless of the grandiosity of his themes or their genuine relevance to American history.In an often reprinted essay, Hawthorne scholar Newton Arvin argued that Hawthorne's dominant theme was the 'prideful sin' of \\"cultivating the intellect at the expense of the sympathies,\\" a phenomena which is generally understood to have been particularly commonplace in Puritan-rooted New England. However, Alvin, who clearly empathizes with Hawthorne on this point, fails to acknowledge that sympathy for others, whether sincere or unconsciously affected, can as readily become a source of sinful' pride as the intellect or any other human capacity.Hawthorne, whose best work is found in his simply written short works such as 'Feathertop: A Moralized Legend' and 'Young Goodman Brown,' in addition to his two books for children, 'A Wonder Book' and 'Tanglewood Tales,' was an intelligent man of strong emotion, and it was there, in his dominant feeling function, that he understandably forged his creative work.Those seriously pursuing a study of general Americana, American literature, or the history of New England should read 'The House of the Seven Gables,' and perhaps visit the lovely site of the actual house in Salem, Massachusetts. For everyone else except the masochistically curious, the novel is unessential reading."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"After reading The House of the Seven Gables, I think that it is a decent book to read. I would not recommend it for younger teenagers because of the fact that the language is so descriptive and at times difficult to understand. Throughout the book, I found myself picking up a dictionary to find out what certain terms meant. At times I found it annoying because I did not understand all of the meanings, but then you have to remember that Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote this book in 1851. During the beginning of the book, I would find myself reading, and as I got down to the bottom of a page, I would realize I had no idea what I had just read. The book was dull and boring at times, but the plot was rather interesting to me.

I found it disturbing to read and impossible to understand. The aura of sin and guilt, combined with the complex literary style made it an extremely difficult read for a young person. On one hand there is a sense of a great primal sin, of a past that has corrupted the future. On the other hand the bright character of Phoebe presents a certain hope for something different. In all this there is a sense of the grotesque and weird, things I have never loved in Literature. This book was too dark and difficult for me. And if today I know its themes, and its story it still seems too much of an effort to give my time to."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The only thing I don't like about the book is the print. You have to concentrate when you read this book, but it is a good book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I am a firm believer in young people being exposed to the classics of literature. So much so, that I am in favor of exposure from cartoon and comic books. Therefore, I recommend this cartoon book synopsis of the classic story by Hawthorne.The drawings are crisp, in black and white and although the story is condensed into 61 pages, it is thoroughly covered. It is written for young people, when more difficult words such as \\"high-sheriff\\" and \\"Lieutenant-Governor\\" are used, there are footnote explanations of what they mean. A series of 8 study questions about the story are included at the end."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This isn't exactly a page turner, for that you should check out Hawthorne's short stories. However, the writing here is very good and the story is interesting. What struck me most of all about this book, however, is how funny it is. Not funny in a joke-cracking way, knee-slapping kind of way, but Hawthorne has a very dark sense of humor, and in this book he deals with dark themes like death, curses, witchcraft, and old age in a surprisingly humorous and deadpan manner. He writes the best death scenes! I don't want to give away any details, but you need to look past the image of Hawthorne as a stuffy dead white guy in order to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Purchased in anticipation of a trip to Salem, MA to visit the actual House of the Seven Gables, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book far more than I thought I was going to. Written in 1851, The House of the Seven Gables is at once both a period romance and history of the Pyncheon family, focusing on a several week period of the lives of the current owner, Hepzibah Pyncheon, her brother Clifford, cousin Phoebe and their lodger, Holgrave. Themes of guilt and retribution run throughout the novel, as the histories of both the house and the Pyncheon and Maule families are all brought to light.Hawthorne relies heavily on not only his own family's history to help him build some of the plots in his novel, but also on the general history of the area, with aspects of the novel dating back to the Salem Witch Hysteria of 1692. The house has stood for centuries as a spectator to these happenings, and seems to be haunted by the ghosts of the suffering that has occurred within its halls.While suffering from many of what I see as familiar plot devices for its time (family secrets, hidden identities, convenient deaths and sudden marriages that let everyone live \\"happily ever after\\"), Hawthorne was still able to craft and wonderful and imaginative novel. While some of the descriptions may seem extraordinarily long by todays standards, I felt as though this added to the books charm. Some may find it hard to read, but if you let yourself be picked up by the story and not try to think your way through the book, you'll soon find yourself completely engrossed in poor Hepzibah's trials and tribulations."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I have to admit that i thoroughly enjoyed this book. It consisted of love, fear, confusion, and suspense all at once.In the seventeenth century puritan colonel Pyncheon, an early settler on the New England coast, desired to build a mansion on the beautiful property that belonged to a man by the name of Matthew Maule. In order to get what he wanted, colonel Pyncheon accused Maule of practicing witch craft. Because of this, Maule was executed. Right before he was hanged, Maule cursed Phycheons family for many generations to come. Pyncheon went on to build his mansion. As soon as it was finished, Pyncheon died a sudden and mysterious death. His mansion went on to be known as the house of the seven gables.A century and a half later, the house is occupied by Hepzibah Pyncheon, an elderly maid, and Mr. Holgrave who rents out the upstairs apartments. The house is dark and gloomy until Pheobe, Hepzibah's niece, arrives to help. From this point on, the book becomes not only a mystery, but a love story as well. When Clifford, Hepzibah's brother, arrives home from his thirty year imprisonment, Pheobe helps him restore his health, she then leaves returning to her farm home, and the house becomes dark and gloomy once again. At this point i thought that Pheobe possibly had some kind of power. Hawthorne has that way of implying things, but not assuring them. It keeps you reading the book to find out what is really going to happen next. The story goes on to reveal mysterious deaths, unexpected plots, and a passionate love between two people.I believe that Hawthornes writing is unique and genuine. He has a way of persuading you to believe what he writes, making everything seem very real. His word usage and in depth descriptions pull you right into the book as if you were there."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\", may not be as riveting as his \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", but still will be appreciated by those familiar with 19th Century psychological fiction as epitomized by, for example, Henry James, with more than a passing nod to Edgar Allen Poe. This is a complex tale spanning generations between the Pyncheons and the Maules; a blood feud which emanates from the infamous Salem witch trials. Hawthorne is a splendid writer of descriptive prose, and it is so descriptive, that I must confess I was confused occasionally as he goes back and forth between the late 17th Century Pyncheons and Maules and their mid 19 Century descendants. This novel isn't nearly as tragic as \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", ending on a somewhat hopeful, optimistic note."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This is another good Hawthorne book. It builds the charactersdescriptively so your mind's eye is there. It gives a peakof how things were in that era. Written in his usual,exquisite, expressive use of the English language."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"\\"Nathaniel Hawthorne continues to prove his amazingly gifted talent as he writes \\"The House of Seven Gables\\". This literary masterpiece is now one of my favorite of his works along with The Scarlet Letter. The most obvious common thing both novels share is the use of symbolism. It is undeniable how his novel is delectable and truly a work of art. Combined with the horror tale of ghosts, the curse following generations, a hint of humor, the history and setting of the nineteenth century, romanticism, and the drama that follows, Hawthorne proves how ingenious he really is.\\"(Andrea Chapman- amazon.com) He accomplishes this by examining the Pyncheon family, a clan founded on America's shores by the stern Puritan Colonel Pyncheon, who used his considerable influence to inveigle prime real estate from one Matthew Maule in the 17th century. Pyncheon carried out this task by using the Salem witchcraft scare to secure Maule's execution. In his last moments, Maule laid a curse on the good Colonel and all of his descendents, telling him that God would give them blood to drink as a punishment for this evil injustice. Shortly after the Colonel builds his house with seven gables on Maule's property, he dies in a way that makes Maule's curse seem to be a reality. Rather than trace this terrible evil down through the ages in minute detail, Hawthorne only touches on a few important points before beginning his story in the middle of the 19th century.The Pyncheon family is slowly moldering into extinction when Hawthorne introduces us to poor old Hepzibah Pyncheon. She lives alone in the ancient estate, reduced to near starvation because her brother Clifford is in prison and Jaffrey Pyncheon, a rich judge who lives in his own manor in the country, refuses to offer her assistance. The only way to survive for Hepzibah is to open a penny store in an old part of the decaying house. Just when things reach a nadir, another Pyncheon turns up to save the day. This is Phoebe, a vivacious young lady who lives in the country. This fetching lass is a blessing for Hepzibah; she runs the penny store, helps to lift the gloomy atmosphere in the house, and when Clifford returns from his long imprisonment, Phoebe entertains the doddering man with her multitude of charms. She even strikes up an acquaintance with Holgrave, a young boarder in the house. Things start to look up when yet another tragedy strikes the Pyncheon family, leading to the momentary evacuation of the ancestral estate by Hepzibah and Clifford before Hawthorne settles all accounts in an ending that is both quick and highly implausible.The reputation this book has with many people is not good. They disparage the lengthy digressions, the massive amount of time Hawthorne takes to explore Hepzibah's dilemma over opening the penny store, the sentences that go on and on without seeming to make any point whatsoever, and the organization of the book as a whole. There is some foundation in these charges. The chapters describing the penny store do seem interminable, especially when viewed in the context of the story as a whole. As for the descriptions of Hepzibah's scowling countenance and Clifford's puny mental state, we get the idea well before Hawthorne quits harping on them. Yes, there are flaws in \\"The House of the Seven Gables.\\"However, I personally enjoyed the deeply rich 19th century prose. Hawthorne's command of the English language is impressive and, at times, as precise as a cruise missile. One need only read the chapter about Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon's unfortunate incident in the house to grasp the beauty of this author's style. As for the digressions, if people have a problem with chapters such as \\"Alice Pyncheon\\" and the introductory material setting down the history of the doomed family, it is really their loss. It is when Hawthorne writes about supernatural elements that he really managed to grab me. If this counts as a lengthy digression from the story, I will take more, please!If I had to assign a Hawthorne novel to a group of slack jawed high school students, I would give them this one in place of \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" At least with \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" someone might enjoy the eerie curse that united the Maules with the Pyncheons for two centuries. A letter sewn on clothing cannot stack up against ghosts, a disembodied hand, and mysterious deaths. The kids will still grumble, but not as much when they realize there are less \\"thees\\" and \\"thous\\" tossed around in this novel."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"couldn't get into reading.

Hepzibah Pyncheon is one of th e most lovable characters in our literature; her climatic train ride, with brother Clifford, is a fascinating ride into the future."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This novel -- or romance, as the author calls it in hopes of getting certain indulgences from the reader -- initially drew me in. There's certainly an atmospheric richness to the haunted house, and the way owning family is trapped in its moldy ruins is catchy. In this sense, it would make an awesome Tim Burton film. But ultimately, I grew impatient with the work and found it slight. In the end, the characters, no matter how richly painted, are painted cardboard, they're maddeningly passive and the finale comes across as cheesy and contrived. (But there is one really cool chapter toward the end that I can't describe without giving away what little plot there is. It describes how everyone in the neighborhood reacts to something that happens in the house.)In academia, there's a common insult for books: it would have made a nice article. That is, someone had a good idea for a short piece and then played it beyond its proper length. Hawthorne's piece is the same way: it would have made a nice novella. But it's not a novella. It's a novel that's made up mostly of description in ornate prose that isn't particularly charming (like, say, Jane Austen's or Dickens's). So every possible baroque curl is added to the story, to the point that you wish that the characters would, for the love of God, just do something. (They finally kinda sorta maybe do, after hundreds of pages.)If it were written today, Hawthorne's writers' group would have ripped it to shreds. If it were up to me, I'd recommend cutting back on the description. Starting with the two pages devoted to the chickens.Also, if you're going to read this -- and it's main interest is historical, as a classic early American Gothic novel or as a forerunner to Scooby Doo -- examine the edition before you buy or check out of the library. Perhaps they were trying to be cheap or trying to hide how many page-long paragraphs there are, but the Signet, at least, jams so many words onto the page that it's a chore to read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"House of Seven Gables was mandatory reading in high school.

Then consider this novel. Yes. Hawthorne needed an editor, but the dense prose can be skimmed if you so choose and the heart of a good story remains.Hawthorne develops his characters in astonishing depth and detail focusing on physical, environmental and behavioral characteristics that reveal their souls to the reader in a way that modern writers don't have the patience or talent to achieve.Readers may be put off by Hawthorne's excessive character detail and prefer to come to their own conclusions about his characters, but one can't help but be impressed with his impressive abilities and depth of thought.If you're already read and enjoyed \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" consider this novel."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The House of the Seven Gables was a very intersting book, full of suspense, surprises, and even a little humor. Here is the basic plot: The story starts in 1692, when a man named Matthew Maule is hung for witchcraft by a vicious member of the Pyncheon family. Before he dies, though, Matthew screams, &quot;God will give him blood to drink!&quot; After the death of Maule, his property is acquired by the same Pyncheon who saw him to the gallows. This Pyncheon dies mysteriously at his house-warming party, and the curse of Maule sticks with the Pyncheons. The previously mentioned Pyncheon had a house(incidentally, with seven gables), which was eventually possessed by the main character, Hepzibah Pyncheon. Hepzibah must set up a cent shop to buy her bread, and her main customer is a hungry, gingerbread-purchasing little boy. Her load lightens with the arrival of her young cousin, Phoebe, but the plot thickens when Hepzibah's brother Clifford comes to stay. Her other cousin, the vile Judge Pyncheon, acts very oddly toward Clifford from the moment Clifford arrives. I won't tell you how the book ends, but I sure liked it, and I feel it proves that the evils of a family can be thwarted by a few members."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"If you are not familiar with Nathaniel Hawthorne, it may help you to read chapter 13 first. The events in chapter 13 take place before anything else in the story. That said, this book is phenomenal. It would almost appear that Nathaniel Hawthorne was taking lessons from Charles Dickens at this time. Amongst other things, Hawthorne explores the theme that greed leads to one's downfall. (One of Dickens's favorite themes.) After setting the mood, Hawthorne introduces us to Hepzibah. (A down on her luck lady who realizes she needs to survive somehow and opens a cent shop. Yet another Dickens's element.) In her desperation, she carries dignity, but also places demands on our sympathy. The young Phoebe later comes to help Hepzibah, and she adds some hope to the picture. We also learn that Hepzibah's cousin Jaffrey is after Hepzibah's brother Clifford. Hepzibah is frightened of Jaffrey, and Hawthorne will later tell us why. Showing another Dickens's element, we meet the sympathetic and eccentric Clifford. (His room is actually concealed. He has habits that appear strange to many, and Hepzibah is frightened of him ending up in an asylum.) Phoebe remains in bliss in her ignorance, but this is not to last. Though her kindness has a nice effect on Clifford. Interestingly, when Holgrave tells Phoebe about Hepzibah and Clifford, Phoebe gets cold feet and needs to get away for awhile. Well, in comes Jaffrey. He is after a will over land, Clifford may know something about it, and Hepzibah is frightened. In a surprise burst of strength, Clifford confronts Jaffrey and leaves with Hepzibah. (Dickens enjoyed giving his eccentrics sudden bursts of strength or a sudden show of virtue.) In yet another Dickens's technique, Hawthorne himself taunts Jaffrey with a fierece and driving narration. And using a Dickens's technique of irony, the document Jaffrey was searching for was worthless. (Greed and irony. 2 of Dickens's famous trademarks.) Moving on, the good Holgrave, Pheobe, Hepzibah, and Clifford are happily reunited. And not only that, but Hepzibah and Clifford come into money and are rich again. But that is not the end of it. Alice from chapter 13 finds peace. While Hawthorne's previous \\"Fanshawe\\" and \\"Scarlet Letter\\" ended on a depressing note, the \\"House of the Seven Gables\\" ends on a happy note. SIDE NOTE: If you are ever in Salem Massachusetts, make sure you see the House of the Seven Gables."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Many complain that Hawthorne's style is too turgid, too stilted and dense to be enjoyable. Admittedly, I was not that fond of The Scarlet Letter, though its merits probably rest beyond the attention spans of most people committed to reading it in lit class. As anyone will tell you, it takes supreme effort and time to wend through any Hawthorne book.I found The House of the Seven Gables much more enjoyable, a novel more accessible to the casual reader than the Scarlet Letter, but still imposing and impressive and just a bit pompous, as anyone can say of the little Hawthorne they have read. The characterization is marvelous. The adumbration of Hepzibah's insular misery and Clifford's simple minded pariah-hood, and the reforming agent of Phoebe's love and rustic vivacity, as well as multiple other character sketches and glorious descriptive passages, are what carried me through this novel. Unlike in the Scarlet Letter, it seems as though the tedium (what little there is here) is always at some point made up for, as though Hawthorne was attempting to counterbalance certain dry passages with heavenly description and character revelations.Those who detested the Scarlet Letter will likely find little but soporific tedium here; for those whose initiation into Hawthorne's craft was not overly harrowing, keep this one in mind for a rainy day."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Describe. Describe. Describe. When in doubt, heap on the adjective clauses. That's the strategy Nathaniel Hawthorne employs in the writing of his novel The House of the Seven Gables, originally published in 1851.The opening chapter promises a multi-generational drama with Gothic undertones, like an American Wuthering Heights. Unfortunately, the novel doesn't deliver on that promise. Instead of penning an epic that spans centuries, Hawthorne chooses to focus on minutiae. He revels in the minute description of the titular house--every piece of its furniture, every plant in its garden, every crack in its woodwork. He is equally adept at depicting humanity, in both its exterior appearance and interior psychology. The result, however, is a book populated by vividly drawn characters that don't do much of anything.The house in question belongs to the Pyncheons, a once prominent, aristocratic New England family whose glory has faded and whose membership has dwindled. Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, the family's most notable and prosperous surviving constituent, is the absentee landlord of the place. His cousin, the elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon, inhabits the house. She is joined by Phoebe, her beautiful young niece from the country; Holgrave, a photographer who rents one of the gables; and Hepzibah's aged and feeble brother Clifford Pyncheon, who has just been released from prison after a decades-long sentence for murder. Though the story revolves around crimes, both past and present, Hawthorne avoids talking about said crimes as much as possible, instead concentrating on the lives of the four people in the house--their habits, their eccentricities, and their relationships with one another. Hawthorne concentrates so intently on every breath and movement that it takes half a chapter just for a character to walk across a room. The atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife, but it leaves little room for activity. When things finally start happening in chapter 16 (out of 20!), it's too little, too late. Despite the macabre events taking place, the pace is still so slow it could put even James Fenimore Cooper to sleep.The House of the Seven Gables is a book better quoted than read. You can pluck almost any paragraph from this novel and hold it up as an exemplar of English language prose, beautifully poetic in its descriptive elegance. But the sum total of all these perfect passages is one tedious, disappointing book. There were moments in some of the better chapters when the writing reminded me a bit of Balzac, yet Hawthorne could have learned a thing or two from his French contemporary. Balzac excelled at both atmosphere and action, and could juggle the two expertly. Perhaps that's why his books still feel as fresh, insightful, and entertaining as the day they were written, while Hawthorne's novel seems just as musty and cobwebbed as the house it so intricately depicts."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"House of Seven Gables has been one of my favorite classics since the middle school days, decades ago. This review is of the CDs and the performance of the narrator himself, not about the novel. The reason I decided to buy it in the first place was becasue it was on sale for $15, and the fact that it's unabridged. Anthony Heald has terrible reading speed, he would pause at wrong places while not stopping at periods. Anyone that has read classic novels would know that most of them have long sentences with many semicolons, and conjunctions. He sounded like he's catching his breath quite often, and his pronounciation is kind of slurred as well. At least it didn't cost me that much. If you search for unabridged audio editions of this book, you'll find a few others by different companies, which all cost at least $30 or more. If you are poor then get this one, it's the cheapest. I'm certainly shopping for another set."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I have never read anything quite like this book. The authors style is very different and amazing. He is so descriptive. Every scene, every event, every little detail is written about in such a away that you know really start to connect with this time, place and people. This is also the books down fall. When it takes 3 pages to describe Clifford sitting at the window, it is hard not to get exhausted reading it. It took me over a year to finish this book because I kept having to stop and read something else for a change of pace. I mean really it is over 300 pages about a couple of shut-in's and their history. Nothing really happened until the last 40 pages or so. But to the books credit, I kept coming back, it was interesting how history and life can affect someone and I wanted to see how it turned out. I would only reccomend the book to an avid reader and someone who enjoy's classics. If you need suspense, romance or action, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The story of &quot;The House of Seven Gables&quot; begins in the midst of Puritan New England (which Hawthorne paints characteristically, and forgiveably, quite bleak) with the fantastic tale of a severe dispute between stern Colonel Pyncheon and alleged wizard Matthew Maule over a piece of land. Maule is conveniently executed (while cursing Pyncheon) for his &quot;crimes&quot;, and Pyncheon builds Seven Gables on the aforesaid land. Several years later, the colonel dies suddenly, supposedly the mark of Maule's curse, which is to forever haunt the Pyncheon mansion.Several generations of Pyncheons come and go, and the family decays and whithers until it can boast only four remaining members, two of which are old and frail. But one, a Judge Pyncheon, rotten under his trim exterior, is up to unsurfaced mischief.The story tends to move slowly (much of the meat of the plot is not encountered until nearly half-way through!), but every word bears weight. Hawthorne weaves his story in such a way that every moment spent getting to know the characters is crucial. Neither is the slow development boring: far from it! Relax, enjoy the pace, and allow yourself to feast on Hawthorne's brilliant prose. As Henry James once stated, &quot;The House of Seven Gables&quot; is &quot;the closest approach we are likely to have to the Great American Novel.&quot;"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne gives the reader a lesson in descriptive writing in this 1851 American Gothic novel. The purpose of descriptive writing is to completely describe every person, place, or thing so that the reader clearly sees it in his mind. This is why the writers of the 1850's were accused of being paid for each word. How about his initial description of Judge Pyncheon: \\" It was the portly, and, had it possessed the advantage of a little more height, would have been the stately figure of a man considerably in the decline of life, dressed in a black suit of some thin stuff, resembling broadcloth as closely as possible. A gold-headed cane, of rare oriental wood added materially...\\" Okay, no use continuing with the description, you get what I'm saying. This kind of writing along with the use of archaic words is the reason it is so tough to get through these classic novels. Do you hear me Herman Melville? Try to read his 1851 'Moby Dick'. I'm not saying that I didn't like Hawthorne's book, I loved it as I loved 'The Scarlet Letter' (1850) and I'm sure I will love 'The Marble Faun' (1860) when I get around to reading it. In a preface by the author, he calls this book a Romance! But it really is what scholars now call a Dark Romance. Yes, I would agree that this book is very dark and gloomy!Hawthorne takes the reader on a emotional ride. In the 1600's, a greedy puritan Colonel Pyncheon has Matthew Maule hanged for witchcraft so he can obtain his land and build The House of the Seven Gables on it. Before Maule is hanged he issues a curse on the Pyncheon Family by uttering \\" God hath given him blood to drink!\\" Maule gets his revenge when the Colonel is found dead with blood on his beard. Two hundred years later, we meet the remaining Pyncheon family, most still living in the decaying mansion, destitute and alone. The reader will meet characters inclined to sin, self destruction, rapacity, a craving for wealth and one unpretentious lady. Lets meet the participants, shall we?We have the spinster with a scowl, Hepzibah Pyncheon, who opens a penny store in the front of the house in order to make ends meet. Her brother, Clifford, returns home after serving thirty years in prison for murder, a broken and imbecilic shell of a man. The only friendly neighbor is Uncle Venner, a old man on the decline.The mansion is falling apart, musty smelling and decrepit after nearly 200 years of neglect. Did I mention that it is currently haunted by the ghost of Alice Pyncheon? Sounds like a dark and dreary story, right? Well, yes it is! Enter Phoebe Pyncheon, a cousin that has come to live in The House of the Seven Gables. She brings joy and hope to Hepzibah and Clifford, who were decaying like the fungus of soft timber. Also enter the dishonest and deceitful cousin, Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon! The Judge says that he would like to help the family by bringing all the cousins to his estate. But is that the real reason? Hepzibah vehemently declines the Judge's offer. Also enter, the house's lone renter, Holgrave ( no first name given ) who is an daguerreotypist and writer. What's his real mission in the house? Is he looking for retribution? Then Phoebe has to go home for awhile to clear up her affairs, and when she does: It sends Clifford into a bed ridden state and depresses Hepzibah into a maddening state of mind. Then the avaricious Judge Pyncheon returns to the cursed house for, as we would say today, round two! Reader, if you can get through this gothic novel of the 1850's, you will have read a true American Classic.I found this novel to be similar to a great painting with Hawthorne as the artist. The way he paints the mood shifts and the use of light and shadows gives the reader a feeling of good and evil depending on what character is about. Truly his descriptive writing is brilliant, whether it pertains to a person, the house ( dark and damp ), or his descriptions of the backyard garden where Phoebe has many talks at different times with Clifford and Holgrave separately. I also thought it was brilliant of Hawthorne to leave doubt in the readers mind, whether the Maule family were actually in possession of mystical powers, or not. I found myself re-reading the \\"Governor Pyncheon\\" chapter again and again. It was the most superb episode in this marvelous novel."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"With the success of The Scarlet Letter (1850), Nathaniel Hawthorne took his place alongside Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau as the leaders of New England's literary community; the book also made Hawthorne enough money so that he could turn all his energies to writing as a full time endeavor. The House of the Seven Gables was published a year after The Scarlet Letter came out, and although most of its themes had been considered in the earlier novel, Hawthorne's point of view in the newer work was as he put it, \\"a more natural and healthy product of my mind ... and a more natural book for me to write.\\" The book is less severe and even charming in its own way, and it was even more popular than the Scarlet Letter. Whereas both works are still considered masterpieces of early American fiction, The House of the Seven Gables is now generally seen as being much the inferior work.Hawthorne knew his reading public well and understood that the dark themes previouly developed in The Scarlet Letter could be counted on to sell a lot of books. The idea that \\"the wrongdoing of one generation lives into the successive ones\\" was not new, but Hawthorne was determined to give it his full attention; indeed maybe too much attention, resulting in a weakening of the book as a whole. In many ways, the book becomes an idea in search of a supporting cast and plot. It is too episodic (the train ride of Hepzibah and Clifford is not only irrelevant to the plot but could - if the names of the characters were changed - have been lifted from another book entirely); the ending is painfully contrived and all to easily ties up the missing links; and the characters are more like portraits than they are like real people - none of the characters are developed enough to compare to either Hester Prynne, Roger Chillingworth or Minister Dimmesdale.And while the book may not succeed in its entirety, it is not void of some elements of literary genius. Hawthorne was a master of description and the chapter entitled \\"Governor Pyncheon\\" shows him at his best. Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, a cousin of Hepzibah and Clifford, is the consummate hypocrite: a man, who while affable in society, is obsessed with power and greed and is a manifestation of his Puritan heritage. Having little sympathy left for this heritage, Hawthorne not only kills the Judge off, but spends an entire chapter detailing the dead Judge's vanities and ambitions, and tauts the deceased about the finality of death. And while the hours pass and rigor mortis sets in, Hawthorne takes pleasure in placing a common house fly on the dead man's nose. It is a wonderful touch and a startling demonstration of Hawthorne's literary talent."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The book condition was fine. I am disappointed in the story. I thought he could do better, kjghlopiugpoiug piuhpuhphg uhpiuhgpgh"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This splendid novel of Hawthorne's is, essentially, a dark,brooding, Gothic tale penned in typically gloriously ornate Victorian prose with a happy ending to it all. I really must say that the readers complaining about the lush prose should try broadening their horizons just a bit beyond the bare-bones. minimalist airport paperbacks to which they have so obviously grown accustomed. Read George Eliot (real name Mary Ann Evans), Charlotte or Emily Bronte, Thomas Hardy etc etc etc. Don't let your minds be bound and enslaved to the here and now. Books like this one are such marvellous time machines if you allow yourself to discover that, quoth Emily Dickinson, \\"There is no frigate like a book\\" for transporting you to lands and sensibilities far away.That being said, the plaudits of the positive reviewers have covered the plot of the story and the curse of the Pyncheon family and their eponymous gabled mansion quite well. It only remains for me to add what I found of personal significance in the novel. My favourite character in the novel is the highly-strung, greatly-wronged, poetically-attuned character of Clifford Pyncheon as described in the chapter \\"The Pyncheon Garden\\" which ends thus:\\"Alas, poor Clifford! You are old, and worn with troubles that ought never to have befallen you. You are partly crazy, and partly imbecile; a ruin, a failure, as almost everybody is - though some in less degree, or less perceptibly, than their fellows. Fate has no happiness in store for you; unless your quiet home in the old family residence, with the faithful Hepzibah, and your long summer-afternoons with Phoebe, and those Sabbath festivals with Uncle Venner and the Daguerreotypist, deserve to be called happiness! WHY NOT? If not the thing itself, it is marvellously like it, and the more so for that ethereal and intangible quality, which causes it all to vanish, at too close an introspection. Take it, therefore, while you may. Murmur not - question not-but make the most of it.\\"Whilst \\"The Pyncheon Garden\\" represents well the idyllic light in the play of light and shadow that constitutes the tale, the chapter entitled \\"Governor Pyncheon\\" is more powerful and more fully represents the darkness that hangs even in the background of the Pyncheon Garden chapter until it is dispelled at the end. I'll only quote one harrowing line from this thanatopsis on what happens when the soul departs the body so as to leave the intrigued reader to discover the rest:\\"Where is our universe? All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring about, in quest of what was once a world!\\"The book does have a rather contrived ending that detracts from it as a work of art, but which does serve as relief after all the funereal ponderings.

While the book may sound appealing, it is actually quite boorish with a poor climax, and a tiresome storyline.The story starts out with a 30 page introduction about a Colonel who wants to expand his house, but his neighbor's property seems to be in the way. So he frames a plot against the man and calls him a witch, he gets hanged and the Colonel gets the poor framed man's land. However on the scaffold he places a curse on the Colonel and his future generations. The Colonel then gets the son of the man who cursed him to build his house. On the day that the house is finished the Colonel dies. Thus, we are taken to an old maid who has never worked in her life is now forced to set up a shop within the house. The drudgery continues from there.Some interesting points within the book are how Hawthorne has a much different writing style in this book. He often makes comments to the reader criticizing his characters; most of these comments are quite comical. I did enjoy how he developed his characters even though it seemed he lost interest in some toward the end of the book.Overall, the book had some up points and some down points, but overall it had many more down points than anything else.

They will be \`slaves of bygone times.'The House of the Seven Gables, the expression of that odious Past, stands for \`what we call real estate - the solid ground to build a house on it - is the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of the world rests.'One of the main characters, the Judge, represents the respectability of Puritanism. But he is in fact a selfish, iron-hearted hypocrite, greedy of wealth. He is a member of the schemers: \`practiced politicians skilled to adjust those measures which steal the people the power of choosing its own rulers.'As in \`The Scarlet Letter', Nathaniel Hawthorne exposes in this book forcefully the Phariseism of the Puritans and the powerful. It culminates in a very surprising and highly dramatic end.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The Never-Ending NightmareThe mood of Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables is dark, and painstakingly creepy and slow. The story centers around the murders of two men, centuries ago, the curse that was placed upon the house as a result of that conflict, and the repercussions to the current generation. The overall story is like that of a nightmare of total and complete oppressive darkness. Not so much the fright that results from images of goblins and monsters, but that feeling of being scared of the dark; not because of what is there, but because of what you don't know is there. Hawthorne sets this mood by describing the events that triggered the curse placed upon the Pyncheon mansion in the very first chapter, but never reveals more than a piece of the motivations and consequences at a time, throughout the remainder of the story. The descriptions of the house deteriorating throughout the years covered in the book establishes the sensation of the endless nightmare -- that despite mortal man, the house remains as it was from the day it was erected and only the outward appearance changes. . In fact, as the story centralizes around the curse placed upon the house, it is almost the main attraction of the story, the other characters only playing supporting roles to show the potency of the dark power that the house holds on members of the Pyncheon dynasty. Because Hawthorne gives the house human characteristics, \`So much of mankind's varied experience had passed there -- so much had been suffered, and something too enjoyed -- that the very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart. It was itself like a great human heat, with a life of it's own, and full of rich and somber reminiscences,' you feel as if the house holds deep resentment for its residents and that it is contemplating its next attempt at haunting for the entertainment of seeing them hide underneath their bed covers. And that, with each creak and groan of the old estate, the wizards death is warranted by the enjoyment that is gained from each chill and shiver of the residents, and the curse that \`God will give them blood to drink' was premeditated merely for the old houses enjoyment. The very construction of the house itself portrays the feeling that, even though you don't know what exactly you have done wrong, or pretend to not know, the house can see through your transparent shell, right to the core of your sin. \`The deep projection of the second story gave the house such a meditative look that you could not pass it without the idea that it had secrets to keep, and an eventful history to moralize upon.' All in all, the house is the centralizing character that creates the mood of darkness, suspense and revenge. This mood helps to portray the underlying moral of the story of how our actions have consequences. Colonel Pyncheon, because of his incredible covetousness in desiring Matthew Maule's acreage and his participation in putting all assumed wizards to death, placed a curse upon all future Pyncheons. The permanence of the house and the creepiness that it is, shoes that what we do will affect our posterity, and that even though we ourselves may no longer be haunted by our actions in this earthly realm, their our repercussions to those who proceed us. And just as God did give Maule's Blood for them to drink throughout the generations and his death was rectified by their suffering by the house, so we too are responsible for our sins and they will continue to haunt us and our families, just as the Pyncheon mansion, for generations to come."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Hawthorne's 2nd novel stands as sturdily as a milestone of 19th century American literature today, as when the title mansion was first constructed--a finely crafted blend of Gothic horror, mystery, and a good old-fashioned ghost story. Deliberately alternating the pacing (long paragraphs with virtually no action with sudden shocking revelations or developments), the author weaves a literary tapestry of chiaroscuro and sound effects, all of which heighten the readers' senses and subtly stimulate the imagination. How much can we figure out on our own by reading between the lines; will we surpass the author's intentions with our overzealous conclusions as we are inevitably drawn in and down a spiral of suspense?New England superstition and small town suspicions prove a fertile backdrop for the turbulent events played out in the moldering mansion built by puritanical Colonel Pyncheon many generations previously. Built on a foundation of blood and witchcraft and constructed on land which was fraudulently and criminally obtained despite the refusal of the real owner, \\"wizard\\" Maule, the impressive edifice was stained by Pyncheon blood on the very day of its housewarming festivities--which precipitated rumors of a family curse. Three irascible Pyncheon men were destined to meet inexplicable deaths under the famed gables. But was it clearly murder? Therein lies the mystery, but if not foul play, then does one assume it was Nature herself which chose to make retribution and serve Justice in her own mysterious way?Spinster Hepzibah-near sighted, beturbaned and known for her scowl-shamefully opens a cent shop on the premises, for she is faced by penury to sully the family's once genteel reputation. The arrival of two newcomers-relatives-changes her dismal routine, though the old maid is easily agitated and naturally depressed by the grim past. When Phoebe, a young, blooming country cousin comes for an extended visit, she brings the first true sunshine into the gloomy interior; she offers invaluable help both in the kitchen and in the shop. Then Clifford, a childlike old man--frail in both body and mind-- seeks shelter under his sister's maternal wing. This pitiful creature, a shadow of his former self, has been broken by years of confinement and false conviction of a heinous family crime. After thirty years of institutionalized care, this man is more ghost than substance.The Pyncheon siblings tremble before the stern and commanding presence of their cousin, Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, whose public face and public reputation belie a selfish, sinister interior. How can the three simple residents of Seven Gables withstand his terrible will as he seeks to dominate their lives? Holgrave proves an extraneous factor among these four--who views events in the mansion as if enjoying some lugubrious theatre. The young daguerrotypist argues the pretensions of a social reformer, but which side of family strife will win the support of this odd boarder who rents one of the gables?Hawthorne's townsfolk comment on events in the great house and provide tidbits of information, much as Hardy' country locals contrast with the passions and tragedies of the main characters. What will be required to end the family curse of drinking its own blood-or is there simply no hope for the decaying family line? Will the Colonel's impoverished descendents be restored to their former grandeur and gentility? Do they deserve their long-denied financial fortune? A true classic admired on both sides of the Atlantic, House of Seven Gables is steeped in New England tradition, and still captivates modern readers, with its dark shadows of shame and crime whichmelt into scarlet memories in the elusive sunlight."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This review contains spoilers.I have a vague memory of reading \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" sometime in middle school, and coming away feeling like you would expect after you'd read a novel about Puritan repression (that's all I thought it was about at the time). \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" was like finding a Hawthorne I'd never known before - one of ghosts, the eternal return of historical memory, and high Gothic romance. This time, it reminded me more of Horace Walpole and Matthew Lewis than it did the cold Puritanism that I once associated with Hester Prynne. In this sense, it stood up to what Hawthorne identified most of his longer fiction as, that is, \\"romance.\\"In the late seventeenth century, the eponymous house (actually inspired by an historical 1688 colonial mansion in Salem) served as the residence of Colonel Pyncheon, who once accused a man named Matthew Maule of sorcery in order to have him hanged, and then stole the land upon which he would eventually build his house. One day, the Colonel keels over at his desk under mysterious circumstances, but his presence and his nefariousness seem to haunt the Pyncheon house in various ways.Several generations later, Hepzibah and her intellectually challenged brother Clifford come to occupy the house. They are both descendants of the Colonel, but now the family fortune and good reputation have withered away so much that Hepzibah has to open a store in her house to make some extra money, and thinks herself an abject failure because of it. Holgrave, a daguerrotypist, rents a room from Hepzibah upstairs. One day, a distant relation to both Clifford and Hepzibah named Phoebe Pyncheon visits and manages to quickly change the whole tenor of the house: she is able to bring vim and vigor to the Hepzibah's failing penny shop, and she gives Clifford the companionship and attention that he needs. Just as soon as she appears, however, she leaves again and the house falls into its former dilapidated state.Judge Pyncheon, another member of the family and a wealthy man about town with an eminent reputation, appears at Hepzibah's house and announces that he wants to institutionalize Clifford. The Judge claims that Clifford knows the whereabouts of certain documents that will allow him access to vast tracts of land in Maine. While waiting to talk to Clifford, the Judge dies in much the same way that the Colonel did so many generations before. Hepzibah and Clifford head to a train station to leave their outre circumstances. Later, Phoebe returns to the house with only the artist Holgrave in residence, and he admits how he has (admittedly, somewhat predictably) always loved her. Hepzibah and Clifford soon return to live there, with Phoebe having inherited all of the Judge's ill-gotten land. Holgrave proclaims that he is himself a distant relative of Matthew Maule, so long ago accused of conjury. The House of Seven Gables, so long riven by tumult and strife, is finally exorcised by that ultimate mage, love.I read this mostly as a meditation on the transgressions of history and our inevitable tendency to bear them witness no matter how far removed in time we are from them, two of Hawthorne's pet concerns. Indeed, it's interesting how the sins of Colonel Pyncheon seem almost to take place in a prelapsarian past while at the same time having such a profound effect on the characters presently at hand. Hawthorne wonderfully blends the oppressiveness of the past with the stark newness of the present throughout the novel: the figures of the Salem witch trials (one of whom was Judge John Hathorne, Nathaniel's great-great-grandfather, who found many of the \\"witches\\" guilty) haunt the novel in spirit, but so do all kinds of (then) modern technologies, from Holgrave's daguerreotype, to the train that Hepzibah and Clifford use to escape the ghosts of their pasts. Published in 1851 and with the possibility of freedom from the past being central to the novel, Hawthorne might have meant for this to be, at least in some respects, a commentary on the coming Civil War. As Faulkner, another American equally concerned with the onus of history said, \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\"I enjoyed it so much I immediately picked up \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" a review of which will be posted soon."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Hawthorne wrote The House of the Seven Gables during a time of social unrest in Europe and a time of questioning in the US. This was the same decade that Marx wrote \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" and that Thoreau went into the woods in order to live \\"deliberately\\" and not be a slave to material things. Everywhere in the western hemisphere, there were those questioning the material conditions of humankind: why were some people wealthy to excess, others starving? Why were some people good, others evil?Marx called for political action. Thoreau called for individual action. In The House of the Seven Gables, Hawthorne sought to show how old, accepted institutions and old accepted ways were crushing the life out of the present: were standing in the way of change. The character Holgrave, himself a harbinger of the future because he makes his living taking what are today called photographs, speaks for social change. The Pyncheon mansion, the house of the title, was built on murder and ill-gotten gains. In 200 years, no Pyncheon would step forth and confess the wrongs of the past and return the property to whom it belonged. And so, in what looks like a supernatural curse but might be only hereditary, each Pyncheon dies a horrible death which makes it seem as if he were \\"choking in blood.\\" In this novel, the wrongs of the past are brought to light and made right.It's true that Hawthorne describes things to excess -- at least it seems like excess to our modern tastes. But this is a relatively short read, and the plot marches forward toward doom for some, liberation for others. And some serious thinking about right, wrong, and social justice for anybody who reads this book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"\\"'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.'What profit has a man from all his laborIn which he toils under the sun?One generation passes away, and another generation comes;But the earth abides forever.\\" -- Ecclesiastes 1:2-4 (NKJV)Before commenting on the book, let me mention that I've always found it hard to get into. This time I listened to a reading by Donalda Peters and it made all the difference. Give it a try!The Old Testament tells us that crimes can carry curses into future generations. Hawthorne examines that theme by having Colonel Pyncheon acquire the property of one Mathew Maule through Maule being found guilty of witchcraft in colonial Salem, Massachusetts. On the land was built the House of Seven Gables, and the consequences of the original action certainly seem to singe and tinge the current generation in a variety of ways. Rather than make this just a Biblical tale, Hawthorne beautifully investigates the questions of nature versus nurture in determining character and what choices are made.Much of the story is told through the use of extended irony of the sort that's found in the book of Ecclesiastes. It's very well written and compelling.Those who don't like dark stories should realize that there's a special beauty in certain kinds of darkness. And, too, weeping may endure for a night, but joy can come in the morning. Love can conquer quite a lot."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Reading this novel, it is somewhat funny to call to one's mind how the roots of Puritanism turned into the other extreme during the last centuries, how US-American culture became a symbolism for innovation, eternal change, destruction of everything only slightly old or conservative, endlessly impatient, dissatisfied, always convinced that the next step must necessarily be better than the last one. Traditions overturned, buildings torn down one after the other, entire cities redesigned, customs overthrown, technical innovations overlapping one another in an endless chase for perfection, that's what it stands for now - the country where once the Puritans emigrated to searching for a pure spot of untouched nature where their children were supposed to grow up unspoilt.The house of the seven gables is a mansion built by an archetype of a Puritan and inhabited by his descendants ever since, and nothing but sadness and depression seem to inhabit it and to affect whoever lives there. The daguerreotypist, last descendant of the original owner of the land the house stands on, whose family was forced into poverty after having been tricked away from its ownership, some time in the novel has a long and enthusiastic speech declaring how useless it is to keep a building up for more than twenty years; the son of the house, now in his sixties, is even more enthusiastic about change, calling every kind of building not a home and refuge but a place where life is suffocated, and loving how travelling by railroad - a method of transport which was very modern about the middle of the 19th century, when the novel takes place - makes a human being speed from one place to another, never resting. Likewise, how much does the author enjoy to emphasize again and again the age, ugliness, futility, incapacity of doing anything good in this world, of this man's elderly sister, and repeating again and again the loveliness and freshness of the - of course seventeen-year-old - country niece.Despise for every kind of tradition, for age and dignity, for experience, for the past, that is what this novel is all about. The small concession at the end, where in a few sentences it is said that perhaps the best solution is to keep a house as it was on the outside, and to refurnish it again with every generation so it will suit to it, is drowned by the countless words which have incessantly crucified throughout the novel anything that has to do with age and tradition. The reader's impression is that not the dishonesty by which the builder of the house got hold on its territory is the reason for the \\"curse\\" haunting the family, but the very fact that it is old, decaying, and thus not worth anything in the first place.It is likewise interesting to see how this selfsame novel, while so intent on saying how desirable solely youth and novelty are, is dull and somewhat dusty to the today's reader. Very little happens, and the descriptions between the few things that happen are, though well-written, extremely long and make it all the clearer that not the plot, but the \\"moral\\" of the novel is what the author is after; it is called a \\"gothic novel\\" without having any suspense or mystic trait in it despite the ever-reoccurring hints about (perfectly harmless) ghosts hanging around the house and \\"mysterious things\\" going about. I can hardly recommend this novel, unless a) You want to learn a little about the style of life of a small US city in the 19th century (very little, since almost everything takes place in and about the house and we learn quite little about the city itself), or b) You are interested in philosophy respectively politics and want to analyze where today's US-American mentality came from, with its constant, almost frantic need for destruction of old things and love for new ones that will, this time, certainly be better; blind in the search for treasures, neither willing nor capable to separate the things that indeed must be changed from the ones that, though old, are good and immortally valuable, convinced that as soon as something is new - that is, newly discovered - it must, invariably, be \\"it\\".Other than a few sarcastic smiles, this novel has wrought nothing from me and I would never recommend it to the average reader who wants not only to be lectured, but also to be, at least a little, entertained and involved into an interesting story with credible, live characters. This book's setting, characters and plot are so grey and vacuous and have so little of a real classic in them, which would be a book that one can read and love years, decades or centuries after it was written, that it has deservedly fallen, for today's reader, almost completely into oblivion."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I've had a copy of the House of Seven Gables sitting on my bookshelf for a number of years. The poor little book is slightly out of place between a plethora of fantasy and science fiction novels. Every once in a while I try to venture into a different realm of subject. That's the reason I finally picked up this book to read. I would have read it sooner but I was forced to read \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" in high school and never had the heart to read another Nathaniel Hawthorne novel.Not expecting much, I have to say I was very impressed with this book. The details got to be a bit much at times. I have to admit there were parts of the book that I scanned quit quickly because I just didn't need to know that much description about a certain thing.That being said, Hawthorne was very good at clearly painting a picture in my head. I could smell the mustiness of the house, feel the joy when Phoebe entered a room, and feel Clifford's sadness and confusion. What took me by surprise was the sharp wit throughout the book and intellectualness of this wit. Quit often I found myself laughing out loud at some of the dry humor in this book. Also of course there was the mystery of the book which kept you hanging on until the end.I don't know that I will read any additional Hawthorne novels but I would recommend this as a good example of his work. It is much more interesting and engaging than the Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is probably much more well-known for his classic book \\"The Scarlet Letter\\". As good as that book is, this book is as good in it's own right. It is probably one of the best ghost stories I have ever read! It is also a story about love and loss, curses that live through the years, The most profound truth that Hawthorne focuses on in this book is that the sins of the father are felt by children through many generations. The setting for the book is a brooding, old New England house. This house used to be the home of a proud family, but it had been haunted for generations by an ancient blood curse. At the beginning of the book, Judge Pyncheon dies in his family home in his great oak chair. The strange thing is that though alone, his shirtfront is stained scarlet. And to make matters worse, his body is not discovered for some time. This strange death is somehow traced back to the old family curse, and the reader is treated to what the Judge saw in his last hours. But the story is also a love story. It is in fact the love of two young people that appears to break the curse of the house. The book is a gothic romance, but it is much more than that. I can't really say enough about this book. I read it sometime ago, and it has stuck with me for a long time. It's a great one!"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This mysterious novel about a cursed family and its mansion is one of Hawthorne's few works with a happy ending. Perhaps Hawthorne, when he wrote it, had come to some degree of peace with the curse that was rumored to have been placed upon his own family. The novel is interesting, and it contains some profound insights. It boasts one of Hawthorne's \\"reformer\\" characters, Holgrave. Hawthorne did not seem to have much faith in reform and reformers, but Holgrave is a more sympathetic character than Hawthorne's other reformers, because he is portrayed as an optimistic youth who will eventually outgrow the excesses of his reformative tendencies."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This literature has a taste of mystery, but it is not as fascinating as I thought it would be.

Hawthorne could describe a character picking his/her nose and transform it into something beautiful and illuminating of the whole human condition. I especially like this: \\"Life is made up of marble and mud. And, without all the deeper trust in a comprehensive sympathy above us, we might hence be led to suspect the insult of a sneer, as well as an immitigable frown, on the iron countenance of fate. What is called poetic insight is the gift of discerning, in this sphere of strangely mingled elements, the beauty and the majesty which are compelled to assume a garb so sordid.\\" It might be good for today's students to cut away from their tweeting and texting to contemplate, and attempt to translate, that sentence into a modern statement."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"They just don't come like this any more. The House of the Seven Gables is a book that will take time to read, but is well worth it for the historical events, language, and thought. Relationships between characters are interesting and the history of the house itself brings you far deeper into the story than you could imagine. There is no one plot here, but several moving around and shifting all at once; each character having their own story told to its conclusion. If ever you wanted to pick up a book for the single purpose of diving in to complex language and thought, into deep feelings and actions related to such, this is one of those books. There are scenes and images that will remain with you as beautiful, heart warming, or sad, all the way throughout. Inspiration for writers and thinkers can come from these pages, don't be modern and rush through each page. This is a book best read in time, as if you were living in the days when books were the television of the era. Set aside your schedule for a little while each day and go back in time.

I know I was forced to read it like pretty much everyone else, but it was still really good. This book actually turned me on to Hawthorne's short stories, which are even better."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"This is a book that is much-criticized for its laborious descriptions, plodding narrative, and the odd, self-aware style in which it is written (in which the \\"fourth wall\\" is sometimes removed, and the reader is directly-addressed by the omniscient narrator). It is also reviled for staring a cast of characters who are all unlikable. I sympathize with these critiques; the book can be a bit of a slog, and I found one of the characters - Clifford - really irritating. When I listened to the audiobook for the first time, my mind wandered for much of the first half.But then, \`long-about chapter 13, there came a turning point. The narrative got a bit more interesting, and - more importantly - I began to pay closer attention to the clever writing. Much of the book is actually laced with humor - of the sort that pokes fun at the ridiculousness of the human condition. For instance, my favorite chapter consists of a narration of a single day's plans that one of the characters has made for himself. As the narrator explains, this man fails to carry out any of his plans, because he is - rather inconveniently - dead. The chapter is in many ways unnecessary; from its very beginning we know that the man in question is dead, and we know that he will not pursue any of the tasks he had set for himself. But through it, Hawthorne in a humorous way, exposes a few tidbits of plot, while at the same time reveling in the absurdity of making plans for ourselves in our capricious world. Then too, there is just the tiniest bit of suspense in the chapter (or at least there was for me). There is, after all, an element of the supernatural that pervades the book, and one can't help but wonder, as the chapter lingers over the corpse, whether the dead man will suddenly rise up, and go about his business after all.I ended up liking the book, and after I had finished, I went back and re-read the first few chapters...with more patience. Much of it made me smile - sometimes wryly. I found myself impressed with Hawthorne's ability to impart depth to what might otherwise be considered rather mundane scenes. For instance, in Chapters 2 and 3, Hawthorne introduces us to a 60-year-old woman, Hephzibah, who has lived her entire life as a lady - never having had to work for a living. We meet her just as poverty is forcing her to step down from this lofty position to open a cent shop in the House of Seven Gables. This is, (as Hawthorne takes great pains to state), a trivial event in the scheme of life. Epic poems are not written about such mundane matters! Nonetheless, in these two chapters, Hawthorne puts us inside Hephzibah's skin, and imagines what a tumultuous confluence of emotions she must be feeling. Though I am not usually one to scrutinize writing, in this case, I sat down and made a list:* Doubt (when Hephzibah wakes up, and wonders if she should really open her shop)* Nervous energy / anticipatory fear (before the first ring of the shop bell)* Shame (recurring throughout the scene)* Overwhelmed (as her giddy laugh turns into sobs)* Sorrow (at the passing of her status as a lady)* Pride (when she refuses the first two payments)* Resignation &, (at the same time), the thrill of newness (when she makes her first cent).* Despair, when she overhears two laborers discussing her prospects* Hurt when she feels these same laborers have dismissed her* Envy & bitterness when a lady passes by her store-front.* Pride (again) when a neighbor comes to gawk at her* Angry defiance when her cousin, Judge Pyncheon sees herIt is fascinating to me that each and every one of these myriad emotions are conveyed to us within a single chapter - primarily through the vehicle of observing Hephzibah's interactions with her customers. For a writer to attempt to convey such a complex set of feelings is an ambitious endeavor, and demonstrates to me that Hawthorne was an extraordinary observer of human behavior. Say what you like about the laggardly pace of the plot; there is much more to this book than one sees at first blush."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"I became interested in this novel when my wife learned that she is a direct relative of the man who owned the house which inspired Hawthorne to write this book.I was not disappointed with the novel and I quite enjoyed the dark and mysterious tone to it. Perhaps the modern reader won't have the patience to wade through Hawthorne's meandering prose. I admit that this book takes patience but look beyond and you'll recogize the beautiful elements that make it a classic in American literature. In a historical context, his writing is crisp and evocative as he hangs on to the romantic elements in literature. I realized while reading the book that the enjoyment is not to race to the end and see what happens but rather to enjoy the flowery prose and sensorial descriptions. The story is quite simple but involves multiple generations of a family doomed by a suspicious curse flung at them by the disguntled landowner of the plot on which the famous house with the seven gables was built. The \\"Deus ex machina\\" ending seems hokey to modern readers but in 19th century literature was virtually expected and highly appreciated. If you're willing to take the time to appreciate this novel, then I recommend it to you."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"What a great read. Enjoyed the flowery language. It was like a vocabulary lesson mixed into a neat story. Definitely recommend"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables,: A romance,","review":"The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne is set in the early times of this country and Hawthorne uses his vivid word choice to describe every little piece of what is going on. This can get quite boring at times because of the dry reading that is made from it. One example of this is where he goes on for over ten pages of describing every detail of the Pyncheon garden. After awhile of this descriptive word choice and very little dialogue, the book starts to become very dry. At certain points of the novel it becomes very hard to read and understand what is going on. What saves this book is the very intense story line that is going on in this book. The main story line is revenge and greed. The difference in the characters in this book of being nice and kind and then other characters that are evil are greedy provide foils for this book. This helps the readers define that people are either good or evil and the differences between the two are quite large. This makes readers interested because it makes the characters relatable and the readers woot for good to triumph over evil.The reason i gave this book 3 stars is that my opinion is split on if I liked the book or not. I loved the story line and how the plot unfolded. The characters were well written and the plot was very well thought out and executed perfectly. The thing that I did not like is that some points were just described too much. At points it was hard to understand the plot and the characters with all the verbage that Hawthorne uses. He intertwined describing and the plot line together and at some parts it was hard to keep everything in check. Overall this was a good book except for the wordage that Hawthorne uses but that is typical for his work.

A flawless tale of adventure and freindship. My boys absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"It's no secret that some of the best books are written for kids and teens. Baby Boomers will fondly remember Scholastic Book Services before they were a mainstream publisher, and little four page weekly reader newspapers that were passed out in class. Books cost about 50 cents and you'd order them together as a class. What a great stake in classroom reading, how fun to take home your books from class, and how different than a $30 Harry Potter hardback. And what great books they were: Encyclopedia Brown, The Amazing Adventures of Alvin Fernald (part of which showed up on TV), Danny Dunn and the Homework Machine (predating PCs) are a few that come to mind. The Runaway Robot was a classic among classics, penned by golden age sci-fi author Lester Del Rey, and now collectible for it's space-theme cover. These are only a few of the great books modern librarians cycled out of libraries in their continuing war on the imagination. But until someone reprints gems like these, my advice is order yours used, and discover this long- lost classic. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"This outer space *Huckeberry Finn* story has remained one of my favorite stories over the past 30 years since I first stumbled across it in the public library. Lester Del Rey has an understanding of androids -- who can recognize their superior qualities, but ultimate inferiority to humans -- that has seldom been equalled. The story of Rex (a robot named like a dog, incidentally) and his teenaged owner's attempt to get from Ganymede to Earth by stowing away, trickery, and &quot;long-term planning&quot; remains exciting, and is worth hunting up!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"My brother had this book. He was an avid science fiction fan when we were little. He still is. I guess I got hooked on it from him. Runaway Robot by Lester del Rey, was written in the 1960s. It's about a boy and his robot. The boy, whose name escapes me, is ordered by his father to sell the robot. The robot's old and supposedly unreliable. The boy refuses to have his companion sold &quot;down the river&quot; to a scrap dealer. So they escape and their adventures on Ganymede are all part of the story. This is a good book."},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"Even after over thirty years, this is still one of the best books I have ever read. It's about a boy and his robot forcibly separated and the adventures they have trying to return to earth together as stowaways. Along the way, the robot develops very human-like traits. I read this to my wife when we got married. I have now read it to my very enthusiastic 7 year old daughter three times! If you can find a copy somewhere, get it!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"I read this book when I was about 10 years old, and I'm sure that I wore that copy out re-reading, and re-reading it!

I read this in 2nd grade and the story has stuck with me over the years. It's a great morality play and will inspire the imaginations of young and old alike! It's definitely in my all-time top-ten!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"This was the first sci-fi book I ever read. It got me hooked. I've read it over and over countless times and loved it every time. The cover has even fallen off, but it's hard to find a copy. If you can find one, get it. Ranks right up there with Rendevous With Rama, 2001, and Stranger in a Strange Land."},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"This was the first Sci-fi book I ever read in 1969.

I RATED THIS BOOK ONLY 5 STARS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HIGHER RATING."},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"This was the 1st Science Fiction book I read, which I got from my elementary school library in southern New Jersey in the later half of the 1960's. I don't remember the details of the story line, but I remember how much it inspired me to appreciate science and the dreams of future technolgy. Now 30 some years later living in San Diego CA, the inspiration remains enough for me to look up and see if the book was still available. If anyone has a copy out there I'd sure like to buy one or at least borrow it for a while. :-)"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"I read this in the sixties when I was about 10 or 11 and remembered it fondly. It helped develop a life-long love for science fiction.. I have just reread an old copy of it I found and although my science fiction tastes have surely matured since then I still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"I read this book when I was 10 and never forgot it. When I saw it I bought it so my 7 year old could share the adventure and to fulfill his love of robots. He read it to me chapter by chapter and his excitement grew throughout. His only disappointment was when it ended he found there was no sequel!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"I can't believe this book still has not been made into a movie. I remember buying this book as a 10 year old. I still have that book. I read it aloud to my daughter when she was young, and she's read it several times since. The story concerns a robot, Rex, who, through a series of adventures and experiences, \\"evolves\\" to the point where he develops free will and selflessness. At the book's climax, Rex risks his own \\"life\\" to save a human child from a rampaging fellow robot.Although this book is credited to the science fiction great, Lester Del Rey, it was actually written by a now-forgotten ghost writer in Del Rey's name, a fact not many people know.I don't believe that this book is in print anymore, which is also hard to believe. It's a timeless story that works as well today as it did in the 60's. If anyone has any pull with any movie studio, please get a copy of this book to them!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"This was one of my favorite books growing up, I read it at least once a year. Unfortunately my copy had disappeared. I was thinking about it quite a bit and decided to try to find a copy. The copy that was mailed to me was in outstanding condition and the book was just as I had remembered it, it was a really pleasant walk down memory lane. Brought a much needed smile to my face."},{"Title":"The Runaway Robot","review":"I read this book many times as a fifth grader in the sixties, it was my introduction to science fiction.

Perhaps this one will become one of her most popular in the next 10 years as record numbers of baby boomers turn 50 every day. Although both women and men will find plenty that speaks to them, the book is very much in a woman's voice and will resonate more powerfully with many female readers.Each poem deserves its own comment, but I would exceed my word quota if I did that.Let me see if I can group them a bit for you. Some of the poems focus on how things have changed with age. &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is a good example, which lists a lot of things the author does when she's feeling wild -- like &quot;I didn't bother flossing before bedtime.&quot; &quot;Second Marriage&quot; is the tale of a widow and widower whose family situations keep them from following their hearts. &quot;To a Middle-Aged Friend Considering Adultery&quot; advises the woman in question to give up the idea of a young male lover. It won't last and it's not worth it.She also finds plenty to be pleased about in being 50. In &quot;Exercising Options,&quot; she skips all of the strenuous exercises in favor of floating on her back in a pool. In &quot;Happiness,&quot; many simple blessings like good health turn out to be the most enduring sources of happiness.Children are never far out of the picture. The brief joy of the empty nest quickly evaporates as they all return to stay (some with spouse or children in tow) in &quot;They're Back.&quot; &quot;How Can People Want to Bring Children into This Terrible World&quot; is a poetic discussion with a daughter-in-law about the author's desire to have a grandchild. There's always an edge of unsettled concern in these. For example, in &quot;You Say You Want to Know How the Children Are Doing&quot; is a litany of superficial updates on great numbers of children ending in the lament, &quot;But what does it mean?&quot; She has advice for her son in how to answer his wife's question about does he love her in &quot;Some Advice from a Mother to Her Married Son.&quot;Other poems are filled with hope and are forward looking. In &quot;Before I Go,&quot; she tells how she'd &quot;like to make things better.&quot; She aspires to be a &quot;Sexy Old Lady&quot; in the poem by that name at 80 with &quot;my sexy old husband nestled beside me in bed.&quot;The book's tone is perhaps best captured by &quot;Pleasures of an Ordinary Life&quot; in which she praises having &quot;a long history and connections&quot; with other people.Judith Viorst is as gentle a guide as you can find into the land of the 50s. You'll enjoy your birthday and the decade more if you read and draw upon her wit and wisdom. It'll help you overcome your misconception stalls about what's next."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"Judith Viorst has become the poet of aging with books of poetry dedicated to her lyrical and funny perceptions of each decade of life from the 20s to the 60s. With Forever Fifty And Other Negotiations she explores with insight and humor the joys and fears of being in your fifties. The book contains 24 one-page poems that are accompanied by full page graphic illustrations in green ink on a rich cream paper. The 24 graphics are reproduced on the end papers. The attention to design makes this a wonderful gift for a quinquagenarian friend.The poems are funny and sentimental yet bittersweet. In some poems we see a person who is struggling to accept the limitations of middle age (where running wild is to go for a walk without sunscreen and memory can't be relied upon). In others she seeks the joys that come with the wisdom of years as when she says \\"We're quicker to laugh, and not so eager to blame.\\" In yet others, she makes affirmations to live life \\"as a sexy old lady\\" and lists the things she'd like to do before she goes.There are poems that take humorous looks at adult children, long-term marriage partners, and young doctors.Overall, a wonderful but light look at the aging process of the 50s. It is a book you will enjoy, but one that will not burn into your soul."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"This small book of verses contains Judith Viorst's reflections on herself and her world as she turns fifty. The book is advertised as 'poetry' but if poetry we mean \\"the deepest expression of feeling in words\\" this is not poetry at all.These are mild thoughts grouped into little stanzas centering usually on a single theme. One most interesting one centers on ' what happened to the children' and simply states the very varied and idiosyncratic career and love choices made by what I suspect are not only her children but those of her friends and neighbors. Another , the opening poem focuses on the whole business of being asked how old one is, and the hidden intentions behind the question. Another poem is about the ' second marriage' and the calculations and considerations involved in it of a friend. The final poem which truly epitomizes the spirit of the whole book is called \\" The Pleasures of Ordinary Life\\" and focuses on the consolations of good health , and small pleasures when one reaches an age when the big violent passionate dramas of life are no longer there.These verses are often light and can be mildly amusing. They are not profound, deep and moving as the best poetry ordinarily is."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"This book was recommended to me by an almost 80 friend and I sent it sight unseen to a 50 something friend. Both absolutely love it. So I guess I have no choice but to get it."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"Judith Viorst has produced a poetry book every decade since she did thirty, and is now up to seventy! The poems are about relationships with family and friends. Many are humorous, many are touching, and all very readable. She really hits home with her lines, and the reader can relate with no trouble at all.She also writes children's books and has written a mystery full of wonderful characters! All three genres are exceedingly good."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"I read it when I was 50 and gave it to my daughter on her 50th birthday. It's a Classic."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"Judith Viorst makes us laugh at ourselves and pricks the bubbles of our pomposity - she laughs at herself and we laugh with her"},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"I love all of Judith Viorst's work. I think this little book, with both humor and wisdom, makesa great 50th birthday present for certain of my friends and daughters in law."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"Judith Viorst tells it like it is/was....at least for a girl of the late 50s, married young, and with kids and grandkids...how does she do it?"},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"A quick fun read. A few very entertaining pieces, but many others were just silly."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"I intended to give this book to my sister for her 50th birthday but didn't. The writings in the book have a very negative feel to them. Now in my fifties, I am seeing my life as something to be celebrated. This book is more for those who are bitter about where they are and what life has done to them.Instead, I bought a book with quotes about love and asked everyone in the party to write something to my sister describing what she means to each of them."},{"Title":"Forever Fifty and Other Negotiations","review":"This book was not nearly as entertaining as her other books - it was disappointing. The others (\\"Suddenly Sixty etc.\\") were more up-to-date than this one, regardless of copyright date. This one shows it's age."},{"Title":"Pero Donde Esta Ornicar?/ Duck Billed Platypus? (Spanish Edition)","review":"This story is about a classroom of animals just returning from summer vacation to their \\"teacher\\" (a young girl who looks about 7 or 8). The new pupil is a duck-billed playpus (Ornicar), an Australian animal whot does not fit readily into the milk-drinking born-alive mammals/oviparious animals dichotomy. As the teacher tries her usual classification schemes (\\"milk-drinkers here, egg-born there; fur here, feathers there\\"), poor Ornicar feels more and more left out and finally runs away. The teacher and the animals go to look for him, and when they find him the teacher thinks up other types of classifications that can include Ornicar as well as the rest of the animals. At the end of the book is a simplified table of plant and animal taxonomy.The illustrations are playful and appealing; the colors are muted, but the animals have a great deal of expression.The book was originally in French; this version was translated in Mexico and published by Editorial Tecolote. The Spanish is letter-perfect (not surprising for something translated in Mexico, but a pleasant shock for those who have seen too many American English books translated into \\"Spanish\\" by U.S. publishing houses). An excellent investment for public libraries, school libraries and people who just want to read to their children in Spanish."},{"Title":"Spirit and Matter: New Horizons for Medicine","review":"Spirit and Matter is a title we are lucky to finally see printed in the English language. No light reading here, you will get your money's worth for years to come. In a new age market saturated with simplicity and fiction, it is refreshing to own a title you can \\"sink your teeth into.\\" This paperback is more like a textbook, plan on saving time to study chapters such as: The Wisdom of the Ancients; The Seven Bodies-or Fields of Dimensions; The Chakras; Spiritism; Karma; Apometrics; and The Malefic Action of Disincarnated Spirits. Brazilian Dr. Dr. Jose Lacerda de Azevedo entered a six year medical program, followed by four years in surgery and gynecology. For twenty years, he was head of a psychic research division in Brazil. He's created a book that looks at both physical and psychic approaches to medicine, using the Spiritist Healing Paradigm. You will learn about the astral body and silver cord, also about physics and matter. Read actual case histories and treatments of Dr. Azevedo's patients. This title has been selling out and being re-ordered at Amazon. Finally, a spiritual book to read, digest, and read again."},{"Title":"Spirit and Matter: New Horizons for Medicine","review":"I met Frank and Rita for the first time after doing the Exploration Essence program at TMI in 2006. In addition to being gracious, kind, and highly intelligent, they are/were intensely spiritual people and that energetic was immediately apparent upon entering their presence. Rita crossed over last year to that state of higher energy for which we are all destined. We are all privileged to have the opportunity to share in their exploration of greater consciousness.Be prepared to have your belief system challenged while reading this book. In my humble opinion, an expansion of consciousness is good for everyone. It often results in personal growth.Live journeys into the energetic fields of being are difficult to communicate in the American language system but Frank does an admirable job of presenting the material in a readable and enjoyable form. For those who already enter expanded states of consciousness, some of this may not be new material. For those who have lived largely in ordinary consciousness (ego oriented), this may be difficult to comprehend. For those who have had some very unusual experiences occasionally, this book may help you to expand your consciousness further and bring back more of future experiences in expanded states of awareness.If your curiosity is truly peaked after reading this book, i recommend a trip to The Monroe Institute (Faber, VA) for a Gateway Experience. If you go, take this book with you and get it autographed. Frank lives a short (though steep) walk from the Institute."},{"Title":"Spirit and Matter: New Horizons for Medicine","review":"While the book \\"Journey of Souls\\" by Michael Newton describes the normal evolution of souls in the reincarnational process, \\"Spirit and Matter\\" describes the pathology of the spirit world. The effects of simple possessions by wandering entities to maleific spirits that aim to do harm. This book tells it like it is from the standpoint of how mediums or seers see the suffering of patients and the causes of their problems in the astral plane. Dr. Lacerda describes scientifically the laws of the spirit world and how to heal both the patient and the trouble making spriit. Gods love and compassion for all souls is clearly witnessed in this healing process. This book is a must read for doctors, priests, and healers."},{"Title":"The story of Switzerland (Famous nations, the stories of peoples which have attained prominence in history)","review":"As a Swiss I have a vested interest in reading about Switzerland, I was interested in reading about a comprehensive history of Switzerland, starting in prehistoric times., preferably in French. I settled for this book in English.There is a lot of information (and this is great) crammed in this book without care about getting it organized in a understandable fashion. Sentences where the grammar is so poor that you cannot figure out what the subject is from the object. (Is it the Duke such and such who did that to the Counts, or the emperor to the Duke , or someone else?... for example). Who did what to who and exactly why and is it related to this event or another one? ? And this occurs again and again. I gave up half way through. I am going to keep looking."},{"Title":"Using Women: Gender, Drug Policy, and Social Justice","review":"This item was fairly priced and arrived on time. I would purchase my textbooks in this away again in the future."},{"Title":"Using Women: Gender, Drug Policy, and Social Justice","review":"The author describes how women who are addicted are viewed by society, and how the laws governing drug policy have been shaped by society's expectations. The author believes female addicts are judged more harshly because the stray from what society expects from them as women. The book describes how media often misrepresent women who are addicted for the sake of sensationalization.anyone interested in the history of addiction and its treatment in the U.S. will like this book."},{"Title":"The Men We Never Knew: How to Deepen Your Relationship with the Man You Love","review":"After reading The Men We Never Knew, I have so much more compassion for men and their dilemma in not being able to express their most tender emotions. I've been aware for quite a long while as to how screwed over men are in our society, and now I know there is a way for men to break free of their emotional constraints. Thanks to this beautiful book, I can open my heart and mind to men's emotions. Further, I can love them as they are and accept their fears, anxiety, anger__and know that beneath the hardness there is softness, tenderness, vulnerabiltiy__much more than we women claim to have. Now I can be strong for my man so that he can open up and be &quot;weak&quot; with me. Thank you, Daphne Rose Klingma, for sharing your compassionate insights with us. I recommend this book for every adult woman who truly wants men to express themselves and to connect with them on a profound level."},{"Title":"The Men We Never Knew: How to Deepen Your Relationship with the Man You Love","review":"This is a powerhouse of a book which addresses very deep issues in understanding both men's and women's hearts and minds. I found myself repeatedly saying Yes! Yes! on page after page, and noting passages I wanted my partner to read. From this book's title and appearance I expected it to be rather shallow pop psychology, a rehash of what I'd heard elsewhere. I was overjoyed to find that I was completely mistaken on that point, and the author's engaging and graceful writing style is icing on the cake. Everyone who wants to understand men and women better will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Men We Never Knew: How to Deepen Your Relationship with the Man You Love","review":"Daphne Rose Kingma's book, &quot;The Men We Never Knew: How To Deepen Your Relationship With the Man You Love,&quot; is a revalation. This book opened my eyes about men and their emotions and the role that women play in creating and encouraging the fears that men have and the inability of men to relinquish those fears. As I read this book, I saw so many of the men that I have known and I was finally able to understand what they were going through. Reading this book is giving me the opportunity to change my thinking about men and my relationships with men, not only the romantic relationships, but all of my relationships with men. I am going to give this book to all of my female friends."},{"Title":"The Men We Never Knew: How to Deepen Your Relationship with the Man You Love","review":"Women want their men to show their feelings, be in touch with their emotions and be able to talk about them. But women do not know how to deal with that kind of man! We have taken for granted that men will put their own emotions aside to be there for us in a supportive manner whenever we feel the need to let our emotions loose - which it pretty much any time we want. We act as if we have carte blanche with our emotions and though we say we want men to express theirs - we are SO unpracticed in the role of putting our emotions aside and being the supportive partner. Above all, this book illustrated this dynamic so clearly to me. I am still practicing being there for my partner, who I am so blessed to be able to say is in touch with his emotions. Thanks to this book I understand what I am working towards and how he struggles against society's expectations in his quest to become a more whole person. Recommended reading for all!"},{"Title":"Counting Katie's Gifts","review":"Counting Katie's Gifts is wonderful children's book. At the beginning, Katie is sad because her friend got a present for no reason. Her mother comforted her and told her that she has many gifts. Katie did not understand at first, but then her mother took her outside and showed her a bird in the tree. Katie didn't realize that the bird was a gift, but it was, from God. Then Katie was able to find many more neat gifts of nature that God gave us. I believe this is a valuable lesson for all children to learn."},{"Title":"Political Racket","review":"This is another masterpiece by Martin Gross, the modern master of muckraking. In his book \\" The Political Racket\\" Gross exposes the greed, corruption, dishonesty, and downright criminal actions of the political class. Gross exposes the gifts, perks, pay raises, and abuse of campaign finances that pervade modern politics.While reading this book one is enlightened, yet outraged at the collapse of public service, honor, and citizenship by our elected officials. Gross brings forth the total sham of the current campaign finanace system which is nothing more than legalized bribery. He shows how the political class elevates themselves above the average citizen through perks, abuse of funds,expense accounts, and assistance from lobbyists.He provides some proposals to clean up politics. One os a National Primary for the Presidential campaign therby minimizing the ridiculous influence of the New Hampshire and Iowa, Abolition of the Electoral College, replacing it with a run off election, and an amendment regulating campaign donations by banning all donations except from indiviuals. A great, great book!"},{"Title":"Renfrew of the Royal Mounted","review":"An excellent and exiting story of action in the frozen north. Renfrew is an officer in the RCMP in the early 1900's. He is similar to Sgt. Preston of the Yukon from the old TV series. Much of the action involves manhunts, and being a \\"Mountie\\", Renfrew \\"always gets his man\\". This book is especially suitable for young boys, and should instill the finer concepts of manhood."},{"Title":"The History Buff's Guide to the Civil War","review":"Although this isn't a book about the Civil War, a chronology of events or a description of a certain battle, it includes a lot of information that wouldn't be included in a book like that.

It has it's highs and lows, and some of the book feels a bit like filler just to make it a bit longer (the last few lists, especially). But overall it's a great start and introduces a great many ideas, names and places to get you to a good starting spot if you have interest in going further into detail about a certain aspect, place or important figure in the Civil War.

There really are reasons for the Civil War other than slavery. Texas was settled not for the perpetuation of slavery, but due to the Mexican government knew its people would never settle the area of Texas, and thus opened it to Anglos to do so. Texans fought Indians, built the area into an agricultural success, and developed trade with America. Then the Mexican government wanted to transplant it's own people to take it over. Texas entered the Union as an understood Slave State, then the U. S. Government declared war on Texas for being such. Sorry, but I am still trying to stay with it, however, I am greatly disappointed."},{"Title":"The History Buff's Guide to the Civil War","review":"THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND.

Key figures, battles and social phenomena are explained in language that a novice can understand (after reading it, you'll finally know what a &quot;flanking maneuver&quot; is). He also approaches the topic with a touch of humor (his list of &quot;ways to be a successfull re-enactor&quot; is required reading as much for re-enactors as for those of us who question the sanity of wearing a wool tunic on a July afternoon). For those who've already earned their stripes as a &quot;buff&quot; this book is still essential reading. A fellow buff of mine and I have already had many lively debates about Flagel's ranking of the best and worst generals--George McClellan the second worst general in the war?

It's both a key subject for academic historians and a point of fascination for amateur readers of history. That being the case, it's difficult to come up with an entirely new approach, but Flagel comes close. He's one of the academics but also obviously a \\"buff,\\" and he takes the approach here of collecting more than thirty \\"Ten Best\\" and \\"Ten Worst\\" lists about all aspects of the War and its preliminaries and aftermath. The result is a large number of short, often anecdotal, well-written articles and sketches which the reader will have difficulty putting down. The \\"Top Ten Surgical Tools and Medicines,\\" for instance, will take you into discussions of mercury poisoning, the fact that the Confederate Army ran its own distilleries, and the procedure of amputation. The \\"Ten Most Significant Battles\\" are selected in terms of their consequences, and while any list like this one will start arguments, Flagel does a good job of defending his choices. Nor does he restrict himself to the military side of the War; the \\"Top Ten Acts of Government\\" allows him to show the relevance of the Homestead Act, Lincoln's suspension of habeus corpus, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment. Small factoids are scattered throughout and nearly every statement or assertion is sourced -- though mostly to other secondary sources. This is exactly the sort of book that is likely to have you jotting down subjects and books for further perusal."},{"Title":"The History Buff's Guide to the Civil War","review":"American Civil War expert and history teacher Thomas R.

Learn and apply!"},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Strategic thinking (or exploration) is one of my pet subjects. So, when I first browsed this book in a local bookstore, I was intrigued by several terms found in the Index page: strategic hypotheses, opportunity creation &amp; exploitation (OCE), business strategy as falsifiable hypothesis, falsification vs verification, asymmetries (natural, created), web of belief. I was even more surprised when I found terms like astrology and guided imagery in a mainstream book intended for general managers. I bought the book and I have not been disappointed after reading it.It took me quite a while to appreciate the author's intellectually provocative ideas about strategy formulation.I find it quite informative to read the author's masterfully intertwining of contemporary models of breakthrough corporate strategies (real-life cases) with revolutionary concepts drawn from science, philosophy, military, political history as well as business history. However, I still think he was a little bit too long-winded in the process.The author's artful usage of the \\"Hammer and Pivot\\" metaphor (drawn from a successful historical military battle formation) in the Strategic Anatomy chapter (3) as a tool for internal capability assessment was quite a gem. This will definitely help to enhance the traditional SWOT Analysis in a company strategy formulation exercise. Overall, I find his insights refreshing.In a nutshell, his brilliant arguments in the context of strategy formulation, can be summarised as follows:1. A strategy is a hypothesis.2. A strategy is a testable and falsifiable hypothesis.3. Goals and mission statements are only the starting points for strategic hypotheses.4. A falsifiable strategy has two basic elements for testing and verification: Conditions and Outcomes/Consequences. (The author puts a lot of emphasis here, and also shows how to use IF and THEN statements.)5. To craft a successful strategic hypothesis, begin by asking questions. (The author provides some penetrating questions. They will help to spell out the conditions and consequences.)6. When experience or experimentation falsifies a theory, learning naturally takes place, by doing, of course.7. Strategy formulation is a work of constant refinement.I enjoyed very much perusing the four chapters (5,6,7, &amp; 8) covering opportunity creation and exploitation (OCE), the two chapters (9,10) on corporate cultures and the web of belief, and the last chapter (11), which summarised the book in the form of Do's and Don'ts.At the end of each chapter, the author provides many points to ponder (P2P), several questions to ask (Q2A) and some things to do (T2D) in the form of \\"Consequences, Implications and Checklists.\\" I find these summariser/activator features to be very useful for readers, especially for me. They make the book so much easier to read and digest.Summing up, this is a MUST-READ and MUST-DO book to be included in your Strategic Thinking Library. Highly recommended for entrepeneurs."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"I have been attempting to write you for several days regarding my impressions of SR.

However, disappointment set in already in the first chapter. It gave the impression that the whole strategic concept was based on a &quot;falsifiable strategic hypothesis&quot; with little room for imagination and creative thinking. The historic lessons appeared also to be scarce and somewhat academic. I ran out of incentive to complete reading the book. As a fellow McKinsey alumnus and a 'student of the arts', I had expected something better than that."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Evan Dudik has made a critical contribution to the strategy field with an examination on how to recognize if a strategy is good (meaning, has a rock solid chance of success). If Mr Dudik had been a Harvard Business School professor, this book would be on the bestseller list and Mr. Dudik could command consulting fees ten times as great as he is now. Maybe it is not too late....Using the philosopher Karl Popper's approach as a guide Mr. Dudik draws a parrallel between scientific theory and strategy. Like a theory, a strategy cannot be proved at all. Instead they both can prove their greatness by their \\"great explanatory power coupled with great specificity about what observations...would make the theory false.\\"Mr. Dudik's insight is to apply this concept to the cause-effect relationship that must exist between the assumptions on which a strategy is based and the results the strategy is supposed to lead to. That cause-effect relationship he says is best expressed as an IF... THEN statement. For example, \\"IF I enter the market with a product of equal performance than the leader and at 20% discount, THEN I will gain 5 points of market share.\\" It is not enough to express it that way, the cause-effect relationships need to be proven correct by testing and whatever other means that exist. Most companies express a strategy as above but never bother to go to that step of proving that cause-effect relationship and making that connection compelling. In other words, most strategies are built on quick sand and stay at the level of \\"pray and hope\\": \\"IF I enter the market with a product of equal performance than the leader and at 20% discount, THEN (I HOPE and I will PRAY) I will gain 5 points of market share.\\"I happened to have read Mr. Dudik's book right before a meeting with a client who was looking for help in strengtheneing his strategy. Summarizing what he presented as an IF...THEN statemnt, and pointing to the various assumptions he was making in the cause-effect relationship was extremely valuable.This IF...THEN approach is by itself worth the cost of the book and the 5 stars I am giving it. There are many other areas that Mr. Dudk's cover. Most books I have read on strategy focus on how to develop one, regardless of whether it can work or not. This book is different. It focus on the \\"greatness\\" quality of the stated strategy. You can use all the tools that exist (like SWOT, balanced score cards, core competencies and the like) but if there is one critical cause-effect relationship relationship that is false, the entire edifice can collapse. Mr. Dudik shows us how to avoid the trap.Mr. Dudik's book is a classic, and like all classics it needs to read and reread a regular basis."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"I am a big believer in the use of metaphor and historical examples to frame strategy questions. Consequently, I was excited by the premise of this book - using ideas from science and history to build innovative strategies. By the time I finished the first chapter, though, this excitement had dissipated. Two issues surfaced in the first chapter:Dudik starts by emphasizing a flaw common to most strategy books - relying on a sea of examples to justify a particular perspective. He argues that relying on examples is flawed, because of the potential for distortion and selectivity. For the moment, ignore the fact that both inductive and deductive reasoning have a place in scientific inquiry. Instead, my concern here is that author then proceeds to use his own sea of examples to justify his own framework.The second issue is related - he condemns theories that aren't suitable to testing. Citing Karl Popper, the author notes that many theories - e.g., Freudianism and Marxism - are not readily testable. As such, they become matters of belief. Dudik use this rationale to argue that strategy theories should be testable. The argument is a reasonable one, and he shows how this can help firms uncover assumptions behind a mission or a strategy. Subsequently, though, he offers his own model of strategy - the Hammer and Pivot. As far as I can tell, it is no more testable than these other theories he critiques. His own recommendation to carefully try and falsify a theory is also ignored.The bottom line, then, is not to trust an untestable model supported by countless anecdotes. I could not get past this basic contradiction.More generally, I did not find much in the way of new thinking here. Many of the topics have been covered better elsewhere - e.g., in the context of sustainable advantage, Charles Fine has a much more insightful assessment in Clockspeed, and Dudik largely dismisses the role of human capital and culture as the basis of an advantage. Other recommendations are scarcely novel. Some of his recommendations include: stretch goals improve performance; anonymous participation lowers inhibitions in a discussion group. Finally, most of the parallels come from military history - a different orientation than one would expect from the book summary."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Evan Matthew Dudik says businesses do not select their strategies based on scientific thinking, but on anecdotal evidence. This trend has contributed to the explosion of new and changing ideas about what businesses should do. The resulting churn of activity is reflected in the many different approaches that books and consultants advocate. Dudik calls for a return to building and testing theories scientifically, arguing that no one-size-fits-all business strategy exists. Instead, managers should create and test hypotheses to determine an effective approach. Dudik also suggests applying effective warfare strategies and tactics to business. Overall, this is a fairly innovative, refreshing take on developing strategies, although presumably market research is set up to do some of this testing. Paradoxically, Dudik's battlefield analogy seems like one more use of anecdotal evidence to bolster a theory. Generally, however, we[...] recommend this thoughtful, helpful book, noting that its primary strength lies in explaining the use of scientific methodology to test business presumptions."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Is your corporate strategy stuck in the mold of Sustainable Competitive Advantage, that is becoming rapidly outmoded? Do you find that really creative ideas are stifled by your corporate culture? Do you find yourself relying on imitating your competitor's strategies, and brainstorming in dead-end circles? Evan M. Dudik is offering a better way to develop strategy within your organization by creating and exploiting opportunities. He has identified four guidelines for developing strategy:1. The strategic hypothesis: create a strategic hypothesis about something vital and central to the company. Ask yourself the question, \\"If this strategy were used, would it be vital to the company?\\" Then ask yourself what would be even more vital. Cut to the core of what your company needs to create a successful strategy.2. The if-then statement: Recognize that your strategy must be conditional. Create an if-then statement where the \\"if\\" outlines concrete actions that are expected to produce the \\"then,\\" the desired result.3. The pivot and the hammer: this is an old military strategy. The point where you decide to concentrate your effort is the hammer. The point where you are already strong enough to play defense is the pivot. Identify the positions where you can successfully and easily defend your market position. Pull extra resources off of your defensive position to implement your offensive position.4. The principle of complementarity: The elements of your strategy need to complement what your company already does."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"I use this book all the time.

As a manager in charge of developing and launching a successful high-tech medical product, I found two of Strategic Renaissance's sections particularly helpful. First, the author's refreshing take on competitive strategy where the key issue is determining the unexpected weak link in the competitor's position. In my field this can be regulatory, product development or simply how best to approach our medical doctor constituency. This goes far and beyond the usual axioms of features, benefits, costs and pricing.The second area that was really helpful was Dudik's discussion of strategic team-building. From my experience in larger companies, I was impressed to find that Dudik not only analyzes the eternal struggle between culture and strategy, but he actually comes up with some tools for getting culture to work within corporate strategy in a symbiotic fashion. As my company moves from development stage to product introduction, this will be massively important.Finally I found Strategic Renaissance fun and easy to read. Unlike most business books which have one or two ideas that get beaten to death, Strategic Renaissance has lots of \\"insights per square page.\\" Those of us who like history will really enjoy this book.

Evan shows how to not only develop strategies that will actually be the most useful for your business but then also supplies the teaching on how to prove (or disprove) the theory behind the strategy. A must read for both traditional Old World and Internet company strategists. Kudos to Evan for re-introducing us to the oft forgotten world of real visionaries who, in their time, faced strategic requirements in life to a greater degree than we ever face in the business world today.

Well, at least part of the answer is that those who are willing to pay for competent counselors and consultants - and those who can then listen to their advice - are more likely to succeed - or at least survive. This is why I give the highest praise to Evan Dudik for his book Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies. For a fraction of his hourly fee, Dr. Dudik has made available to the reader his extensive experience in the world of business strategy. I have now read this slim gem of a book three times now, and I think it is heads and shoulders above other business books available.Dr. Dudik's credentials include an undergraduate degree from St. John's College - The Great Books School; and a Ph.D. from Harvard School of Business. Dr. Dudik has both a business owner and - most recently - business consultant. He writes with a clarity that comes from an obvious mastery of his craft.Evan Dudik's book: (1) is easy to read; (2) contains just the right number and variety of concrete examples to illustrate his points; (3) has relevant and understandable diagrams; (4) effectively draws lessons from the history of warfare (now, finally after 25 years, I understand the brilliance of Themistocles' strategy during the Battle of Salamis against the Persian empire), recent business stories (- so that's why Costco is so successful!), and science and philosophy to illustrate the arguments contained in each chapter.Because of the systems thinking approach of Dr. Dudik's book, I think this book is relevant (and I have recommended it) to CEOs of large Portland manufacturing companies, union electricians, physicians in private practice, professors teaching business administration, and as well as to machinists working in a Boeing machine shop in Gresham, OR. They have all found it immensely helpful in understanding the business forces that are currently influencing their livelihoods.We are witnesses to and participants in a number of massive technological, political, social, environmental and economic forces and changes which will shape how we and our children live and think in the coming years. How to avoid extinction (- or at least devastating business failure)? I think this book will be of great help.

Schedule a one-day offsite meeting and base the agenda on the sequence of 11 chapters. Have each participant come prepared to correlate the key points made in each chapter with the organization's current circumstances. Also, to discuss (specifically) what must be done to achieve \\"great strategic success.\\" This book can not only help set the agenda but also guide and inform discussion of subjects on that agenda. Dudik's \\"Hammer and Pivot Model\\" will also be helpful to individual executives who are eager to improve the quality of their strategic thinking.This is a superb achievement."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"In preparation for a class on strategic thinking, I read through many sources including a number of books on strategic thinking. The first thing that struck me was what a refreshing read Strategic Renaissance was compared to all of the other drones I had read. Dudik's book is lively and clear and extremely easy to follow.But what made the book so enjoyable was the freshness of his approach. After years in consulting, Dudik has arrived at his own conclusions that bring energy and vitality to the field. From his four key elements of a successful strategy, to the hammer and pivot, to the end of the sustainable competitive advantage, to the creation of dynamic strategy, Dudik lays out a thoughtful and timely message. The remaining chapters of his book delve into a new strategic approach that gives you a step by step analysis of how to approach strategy in a world where nothing is certain any longer.The book is also filled with ongoing cases that are compared against his theories so we get a very good look at how companies could have changed their strategic approach as well as seeing mistakes they made along the way. Finally, Dudik draws upon a wonderful knowledge of history to provide strategic insights as well.If you are looking for a fresh read, lively prose and inventive thinking, I wholeheartedly recommend Strategic Renaissance.Chapter OutlineChapter One - What Strategy Has Learned From Astrology and What it Needs to Learn From ScienceChapter Two - \\"Only Make the Right Wing Strong\\": The Four Key Elements of a Successful StrategyChapter Three - Strategic Anatomy: Strategy's Hammer and PivotChapter Four - The End of an Era: The Twilight of Sustainable Competitive AdvantageChapter Five - Making Strategy Dynamic: The Dawn of Opportunity Creation and ExploitationChapter Six - Better Tools for Better Strategies: Creating, Testing and Falsifying Strategic IdeasChapter Seven - Strategic Breakthrough and Exploitation: Making the Right Choices and Choosing the Right ToolsChapter Eight - Deploying Resources: Tools for ExplorationChapter Nine - Born Allies and Sworn Enemies: Corporate Strategy Meets Corporate CultureChapter Ten - Top Management Teamwork: Tools for Harmonizing Strategy and CultureChapter Eleven - 81 Do's and Don't's on the Road to a Great Corporate Strategy"},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Strategic Renaissance, by Evan M. Dudik, provides a refreshing recognition that practically timeless traits characterize effective strategy. Mr. Dudik weaves his philosophical, historical, business and strategic acumen into a practical work that should be of interest to a broad audience, not just corporate strategists. Rather than providing us with the typical simple formula peppered with retrospective examples of success, Strategic Renaissance examines the best strategic characteristics of war, business, science and other fields of human endeavor during the past one thousand years.For instance, try to imagine drawing parallels between events as divergent as the impact of the internet on business practices, ancient Greek military campaigns and behavioral psychology to evaluate that next bold corporate move. No CEO will dispute the traditional strategic factors of geography, transportation, cost, price, culture and people will remain increasingly dynamic as a result of technology. Therefore, no strategy, regardless of its current success, can sustain itself indefinitely. Dudik seeks to help the reader define a framework for identifying the ongoing process of creating, exploiting, destroying and re-creating successful business strategies.Strategic Renaissance is exceptionally readable and Mr. Dudik's frequent quips and humorous real life anecdotes help to maintain the quick pace. Nonetheless, not every professed strategist is going to be comforted by the thoughtful challenges presented here. But for those who are willing to put aside, at least for the moment, their current notions regarding the development, maintenance and evaluation of business strategy, I promise a genuinely new view of the field. Strategic Renaissance allows, actually requires, its readers to consider strategic adaptation not as failure but as necessary for continued survival and success."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Not many strategy books begin with a burning at the stake, but for this one, the image fits. Four hundred years ago, Giordano Bruno was one of a long string of brave zealots who clung to his belief in the scientific observation at the cost of his life. Vested interests could not abide the notion that unconventional thoughts could be rigorously tested unfettered by the passions of belief.Now, at the turn of the millennium, science has embraced Mr. Bruno's views, but business strategists continue to burn heretics at the stake. Why? Because many companies adopt strategies as belief systems, so challenging them risks career death. Dudik argues that strategies are ideas, not beliefs. Like other ideas, they can be formulated as hypotheses subject to rigorous tests. Strategies that don't meet the test in due course should be rejected.Rather than trot out yet another set of consultant-polished beliefs, Dudik presents a series of techniques and approaches borrowed from his interest in military history and experience in consulting. These ideas may or may not work for you, he says, but any that you select should be couched as falsifiable hypotheses that must pass merciless, scientific scrutiny. Only then can you avoid the trap of falling blindly in love with your ideas.For this fresh perspective alone, this book is worth its quick read. Dudik's application of the military hammer and pivot strategy is insightful, and his 81 do's and dont's of strategy development are innovative and practical. Strategic Renaissance deserves a place on the bookshelf of any executive with the courage to challenge and invigorate his or her organization."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Evan M. Dudik's &quot;Strategic Renaissance&quot; is an engaging product of a richly informed mind at work. The promise in the subtitle that it will use &quot;insights from history and science&quot; proves too modest, for it does not fully encompass the resources behind the insights--notably the writer's knowledge of past and current corporate strategies and of the luminaries of Western thought from Aristotle to Sir Karl Popper. It is Popper's idea of &quot;falsifiability that Dudik adopts as a guide to sound thought. It is the acid test of inductively developed theories, a safeguard against being persuaded merely by the accumulation of data. The book offers much to readers besides those concerned with corporate strategies. It is a lucid, persuasive treaise on how to think and is in itself an impressive example of the processes it recommends. As an educator I was pleased to see it as scholarship functioning outside the ivory tower, as an affirmation of the practical value of the liberal curriculum."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"Book Review-Strategic RenaissanceStrategic Renaissance is the business strategy equivalent of a hot date-exciting, challenging to keep up with and something you want to snap up before your competition. Exciting, because it devastates the past 25 years of conventional thinking about strategy as pseudo-science. Challenging, because it dares to replace that thinking with firmly grounded ideas from history, science and the law that seem obvious-once you look back on them. And it's something you don't want your competitors to read before you because it shows the true meaning of strategic judo.One of the things I liked best about Strategic Renaissance is that Dudik doesn't stop with insightful analogies from history and science. Instead he goes on to make them practical-how to make strategy dispassionate and scientific, not just what's wrong with strategic business thinking now; how to select and deploy business SWAT teams and rapid deployment forces, not just why you need them; how to squeeze the most out of strategic planners and consultants, not just why they are misused and abused; exactly how to probe for strategic opportunities, not just exhortation to be \\"opportunistic;\\" how to cut the ground under your competitor's strategic \\"Pivot,\\" not just how to identify it. The 81 Do's and Don'ts should be ripped out and pasted to every top manager's office wall.This book isn't perfect. I wish some of the worksheets had been larger and the section on team building for strategic victory had been a little longer. Somebody's going to make money creating a large format \\"Strategic Renaissance Workbook.\\" And the book takes intellectual guts to read, although I found the prose polished and exciting.

Those first 17 pages contain fundamental thinking about scientific method and business strategy.Much later in the book, the author offers a critique of corporate culture. His many anecdotes confirm what I have been experiencing for years: virtually every project I've been associated has been plagued with some portion of irrationality. I hear the same from my friends. We regularly trade &quot;war stories&quot; over lunch about difficulties we encounter with our bosses and customers. In some cases, these problems are quite serious. They go deeper than just waste and folly. They affect individuals' careers, health, and families.The author offers plausible explanations for how and why such upsetting situations occur.For me this a big stress reliever. Dealing with circumstances and behavior that I don't understand is difficult and exhausting.So the book has already helped me. I don't know whether I'll be able to implement any of the author's strategic suggestions or whether they'll help my business become more profitable. I hope they will, but only time will tell.In any case, he has taught me some useful ways to think about things.Also, the book deserves praise for its accurate references to the history of science and philosophy."},{"Title":"Strategic Renaissance: New Thinking and Innovative Tools to Create Great Corporate Strategies...Using Insights from History and Science","review":"In his book Strategic Renaissance, author Evan Dudik states: \\"there can't be a cookbook strategy\\". He says that a business strategy should be a hypothesis and then continually test the main strategic hypothesis your company is based upon. That means rather than looking for reason that your plan will work, you look for reasons it might not. Above all, find ways to measure outcomes. Hypothesis testing involves constructing a series of if then statements and measuring what happens, learning by doing. Dudik states that opportunity creation and exploration goes through the following 4 cycles: Opportunity creation and discovery Opportunity recognition, breakthrough and exploration Opportunity consolidation Opportunity dismantling and recyclingEmergent strategy should be developed from the bottom up. Dudik states that research bears this out. Over 70 percent of successful new product ideas originate with market needs and 50 percent involve direct input from customers. In emergent strategy, tactics should dictate strategy. Dudik states that for emergent strategy companies should try a lot of ideas and \\"test the heck out of them.\\" Like others, Dudik advocates a two-pronged approach to strategy. He call the hammer your competitive advantage or deliberate strategy and the pivot, where you set up small experiments and then try to refute your null hypothesis as emergent strategy development."},{"Title":"AP Biology (Arco Master the AP Biology Test)","review":"This book gave a thourough review of biology.

He arrived in Africa from England in 1890 at the age of 17. Book was written in 1930, after 40 years as a pioneer on the African frontier. Buckley passed away in Africa in 1948.

From almost dying of thirst, to almost being trampled by charging game, to narrowly escaping from the Lugwara Tribe, this book will keep you entertained of a profession long-gone."},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"Isaac Asimov was fascinated by &quot;The Legion of Space&quot; as a boy, but found it unreadable when he came back to it as an adult. This isn't particularly surprising. &quot;The Legion of Space&quot; is a perfect snapshot of 1930's space opera, or &quot;super science stories&quot; as they were known at the time. Reading it for the first time recently, I can only imagine what mind-blowing effect this breathless tale would have had on an imaginative twelve year old in Depression-era America.No doubt inspired by the sort of adventurous, gadget-oriented science fiction that E.E. Smith began in the late 1920's with &quot;Skylark of Space&quot; and the stories John W. Campbell, Jr. was writing a few short years later, &quot;Legion&quot; takes us into the 30th century with a swashbuckling fight for the solar system. Owing much to &quot;The Three Musketeers,&quot; the few remaining members of the Legion travel via hyperspace (remember, this is 1935!!!) to a wandering star populated by the Medusae, who are classic pulp BEMs (Bug Eyed Monsters), complete with gelatinous tentacles. They get to rescue a beautiful girl who is able to build a secret weapon known only as AKKA. Needless to say, the good guys win.The &quot;super science story&quot; became comic-book fodder within a few years when John W. Campbell, Jr. became editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine (later &quot;Analog&quot;). Campbell presented the world with Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and a host of other writers who took science fiction in a much more serious direction. Williamson, unlike many others, managed to adapt to the world editor Campbell was building. Others did not, or didn't even try (like E.E. Smith).I was struck by the parallels of &quot;Legion&quot; with the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series of films. The remnant of a kind of knighthood, the villainous relative who in the end redeems himself, and a secret weapon powered by (as we learn in the novel's 1936 sequel, &quot;The Cometeers&quot;) &quot;the force&quot; . . . is the similarity a coincidence? Possibly.Imagine it is 1935. You're twelve years old. You pick up a copy of &quot;Astounding,&quot; and you discover within its covers a distant future, and a group of fierce Legionairres who are determined to save the world. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"It is always interesting to read science-fiction written before Childhood's End and Stranger in a Strange Land, back when anything that wasn't human was necessarily evil and bent on humanity's destruction. Most of today's sci-fi's writers go to great lengths to create and explain alien civilizations; not so in The Legion of Space. The aliens are ugly and they want to kill us. Period.\\"A reader\\" has already accurately summed up the novel. I will add only that The Legion of Space is an interesting read for its gender portrayals. As one would expect from the 1930s, the male characters are all obsessed with how fragile and vulnerable the heroine is; they must do whatever they can to protect her and shelter her and the thought of her in danger or even uncomfortable fills them with chauvinistic horror. Williamson allows the men to carry on this way throughout the book, all the while giving us a woman character who needs no protection whatsoever and saves the day herself. No weeping in hysterics for this heroine; Leia-like she leads the escape from the alien fortress while the men hesitate. She and she alone has the secret to the weapon of ultimate destruction, and she unhesitatingly builds it and deploys it. Not bad for 1936, eh?"},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"Jack Williamson is one of the most noted Grand Masters of Science Fiction. This is one of his earlier works, and has the unmistakeable feel of the era (Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers). It is very dated, but still a 'ripping good' read.This book introduces one of my favorite characters in all Sci-fi: Gile Habibula - who is loosely based on Falstaff (according the JW himself).Sit back with this book, and enjoy as the Legion legens (John Ulnar, Hal Samdu, and Giles) - fight the evil members of the reactionairy Purple Hall."},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"\\"The Legion of Space,\\" the opening salvo of a tetralogy that Jack Williamson wrote over a nearly 50-year period, was initially released as a six-part serial in the April-September 1934 issues of \\"Astounding Stories.\\" (This was some years before the publication changed its name to \\"Astounding Science-Fiction,\\" in March '38, and, with the guidance of newly ensconced editor John W. Campbell, Jr., became the most influential magazine in sci-fi history.) It was ultimately given the hardcover novel treatment in 1947. One of the enduring classics of swashbuckling \\"space opera,\\" \\"Legion\\" is a true page-turner, written in the best pulp style. Though Williamson had only sold his first story, \\"The Metal Man,\\" some six years before, by 1934 he showed that he was capable of coming out with a blazing saga of space action to rival those of E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith himself. That elusive \\"sense of wonder\\" is much in evidence in \\"Legion,\\" and the book's relentless pace, nonstop action, incessant cliffhangers, and remarkable panache make it truly unputdownable. Simply put, the book is a blast.In it, we meet young John Ulnar, a recent graduate, after five years of training, of the Legion Academy. His initial posting as a Legionnaire is the planet Mars, where his supremely important duty is to guard beautiful Aladoree Anthar, keeper of the secret of AKKA, the system's ultimate superweapon. Three fellow Legionnaires (read: 30th century musketeers) are detailed to the same assignment, and so we get to meet, for the first time, the perpetually cool Jay Kalan; a redheaded giant of enormous strength, Hal Samdu (yes, an anagram of \\"Dumas\\"); and the perpetually complaining Giles Habibula, a master lock picker and a character universally described, in the 75 years since his initial appearance, as \\"Falstaffian.\\" When Aladoree is kidnapped by the Medusae--enormous, levitating, jellyfishlike aliens from the dying world around Barnard's Star--with the help of some traitorous Legionnaires, the quartet embarks on an interstellar quest, against tremendous odds, to rescue her and save the human worlds from invasion. Before all is said and done, Williamson has dished out several space battles, a nebula storm, a raid on Pluto's moon, and a transcontinental slog across the Medusan homeworld, fighting various alien flora and fauna (including a giant amoeba!), not to mention the elements themselves, the entire way, all culminating in a suicidal incursion into the Medusans' miles-high city. This is truly red-blooded, rousing stuff, guaranteed to pump the adrenaline of all readers who are young at heart. \\"The single most popular science fiction novel serialized during the '30s,\\" sci-fi great Alexei Panshin has written of it, and is it any wonder?\\"The Legion of Space\\" is not for everyone, however, and does admittedly come with its share of problems. The book is inelegantly written, to put it mildly, and those readers who prefer their sci-fi to seem more like prose poetry should stick with the likes of Ursula K. LeGuin or J.G. Ballard. Several passages contain instances of fuzzy writing (such as the descriptions of the space cruiser The Purple Dream), and there are also some instances of faulty grammar, such as misplaced modifiers. Some of the action in the book will most likely strike readers as being highly improbable. (Is it really possible to climb down a 5,000-foot-high drainpipe in the pouring rain? Or construct a glider from the wings of a giant alien dragonfly and some lumber?) And time, it must be said, has rendered many of Williamson's scientific/historic pronouncements...well, dated. Man did not colonize the Moon before the 1990s, and the distance from the Earth to Mars is not the 100 million miles stated in the novel, but, at the most, 63 million. The Martian moon Phobos is not 20 miles in diameter, as Williamson has it, but a mere seven. And Williamson gives the planet Pluto a moon in his story, called Cerberus, although no moon had been discovered as of 1934. It would not be until 1978 that Charon was discovered, and then Nix and Hydra in 2005. Still, the grammatical goofs, improbabilities and scientific/historic blunders all somehow fade into nothingness while the reader is engaged in flipping those pages. The book is utterly engrossing and utterly fun, and has been thrilling generation after generation of readers since it first appeared. The secret of AKKA, and that unusual acronym, is NOT revealed in this book, I should add. Readers are advised to proceed on to book two in the series, \\"The Cometeers,\\" for further explication...."},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"You've got to love a sci-fi novel that predicts that seven centuries from now, ALBUQUERQUE will be the capitol of the entire solar system.Seriously.That's due, certainly in part, to the book's author having lived and taught for years in Portales, New Mexico, and I suppose the idea of Albuquerque (Population: Really Not That Many) as the big city to beat must have worked its way into his thoughts and his work.The story tells of a crew of Musketeer-like space soldiers travelling across the solar system to rescue a girl from evil, jellyfish-like aliens bent on taking over the solar system, because the girl knows how to build a powerful weapon that can save the fate of everyone. The story frequently defies logic, but is almost always fun--particularly the character of Giles Habibula, who, when locked in a cell for a few hours, just can't believe he wasn't in there for weeks and weeks, he's so hungry.My favorite part was when they disentegrated the moon, and it was all okay because the aliens were on it. No big deal! It was just the moon! Nothing important! It only influences Earth's tides and gravity, that's all. Good thing no one was hurt! Whew.The story has great (although extremely 1930s-pulp) characters, and was good enough that I bought its three sequels after reading it."},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"This is a space opera in the grand manner, written in the days before the editorship of John W. Campbell, Jr. made much of that genre obsolete. It was serialized in _Astounding_ in 1934, slightly expanded into a hardback published by Fantasy Press in 1947, and reprinted in various forms since that time. The edition that I have at hand is a 1967 Pyramid paperback with a Jack Gaughan cover.Part of the novel's success rests on Williamson's decision to steal ideas from mainstream literature. The story is a reworking of _The Three Musketeers_. And the character of the roguish Giles Habibula (who steals the show from the others) was modeled partly on Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff and partly on characters from Rabelais. Here he is in action, while being pursued by guards:\\"Ah, poor old Giles is dying for a drink. Perishing for one blessed sip of wine! His precious throat is dry as leather. Poor old Giles; lame, feeble, sick old Giles Habibula-- he can't stand this any longer. Climbing till he feels like a mortal mechanical monkey!\\" (61)Giles always manages to rise to the occasion, picking locks, refitting engines, fighting-- and whining and complaining every step of the way.The style is an old-fashioned type that Williamson later outgrew. It is heavily visual, with sharp shapes and bold, strong colors. Here is a scene on a terraformed Phobos:The _Purple Dream_ dropped upon the landing stage atop the square, titanic tower. Beyond the edge of the platform, when they disembarked, John Star could see the roofs of the building's great wings, glistening expanses of purple stretching out across the vivid green lawn and garden. Beyond, the woods and hills of the tiny world appeared to drop with an increasing, breath-taking abruptness, so that he felt as if he were perched insecurely on top of a green ball, afloat in a chasm of starry purple-blue. (46)Old-fashioned, yes. But at times it comes to life. Colors follow a rough and unsystematic kind of symbolism. Purple is associated with the old Empire and aristocracy, and green with nature and the forces of democracy. Red and black are associated with the alien Medusae and with old age, disease and death. Yellow is associated with stagnant liquids and sewage.The plot is simple and straightforward. Our hero (who at the outset of the novel is not the brightest laser in the ship's armory) allows the heroine to be kidnapped by aliens, along with the secret of a superweapon called AKKA. The rest of the novel consists of captures and escapes, flights and pursuits, and alarums and excursions as our heroes set out to rescue her. There is certainly nothing terribly sophisticated here. But Williamson keeps things moving with a fair amount of energy and zip.Williamson could not do scientific doubletalk as smoothly as Doc Smith or John Campbell. And he didn't have their sense of _bigness_. But his characters were well-drawn. And like his friend Edmond Hamilton, he knew how to tell a story that still swings a bit today."},{"Title":"The Legion of Space","review":"This book makes my top 100 books of all time not so much because it's great literature, terrifically innovative, or even unique science fiction... but rather because I read it at a time in my life (as a youngster around the age of 9-10) and it absolutely hooked me on science fiction & fantasy stories. I've since reread it a number of times, and always manage to capture that feeling of amazement and wonder that the story engendered in me so many years ago. I handed my beatup old copy to my son a couple of years ago and told him to give it a try... he loved it as well.

Much of it is ridiculous, but the book comes to life when the heroes arrive on the alien planet, which Williamson compellingly depicts, painting for the reader stark images of vast ocean, dense jungle, and cyclopean city, each an otherworldly hell inhabited by horrifying monsters. This sequence, which is genuinely thrilling, earned my forgiveness for the silly space travel stuff and the weird plot holes, and makes the book a worthwhile read.I read the 1967 Pyramid paperback, with the Jack Gaughan cover."},{"Title":"Consuelo: A novel","review":"Do you like music, romance, history and adventure?

I also was struck by the wisdom about the current work culture that is not set up to support moms--and what we need to do personally (while we're waiting for the world to adapt to the realities of working mothers) as well as politically.

I did what I thought were 'all the right things' by reading such books asWhat to Expect When You're Expecting: 4th Edition, but the reality is I was so focused on my child's well-being that I forgot my own. It took years for me to pull out of that role of total sacrifice.

Amidst the mixed messages in the media landscape about motherhood, Amy has risen above the ashes to pen a most noteworthy book that alleviates guilt and the perfection syndrome so many of us have.~Christine Louise Hohlbaum is the author of Diary of a Mother: Parenting Stories and Other Stuff and Sahm I Am: Tales of a Stay-at-Home Mom in Europe."},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"I think every new Mom should get a copy of Mojo Mom at her first baby shower. There is just not a handbook on becoming a mother and Amy Tiemann really captures all the insecurity, doubt and chaos that can come when youget home from the birth. Having a book that describes the many different feelings that happen during those very hormonal times is a real lifesaver. Moms are so busy looking after their families that they always forget the most important person; themselves. Tiemann is right on track with Mojo Mom. I'm looking forward to her next book!"},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"Mojo Mom promises to help mothers nurture themselves while raising a family, yet it delivers much more than coping tips. True, its format often includes those compelling bullet-point action plans that we love, but its deeper message rings clearly. Tiemann calls us to value the transformation inherent in motherhood and to use the tension between our needs and family needs to spark creative impulses and fuel actions that can change the constricted environment many mothers find themselves in.The writing is clear and intelligent; Tiemann substantiates her points without getting lost in references. Never losing sight of the complexity of our current situation, she writes an accessible and inspiring manual to help us trust our deepest intuitions and experience the happiness that comes from acting in alignment with those intuitions. I highly recommend it to any mother who knows something is missing and needs wise guidance and support."},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"This book feels like something coming to life that has been rumbling in the earth.

It sounded like it would be helpful for working Moms. It started out more pro stay at home Moms and put her off so she never was able to read it all.

I didn't think it was worth the money."},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"As an editor at a parenting magazine, I see hundreds of parenting books each year, but Mojo Mom stands out as a personal favorite. Many moms read about pregnancy, delivery, newborn development, potty training, discipline, but forget to pick up a book about what's happening to mom.For a job that is so life-changing, so consuming, so challenging, there are very few books with thoughtful, practical advice about how to take care of ourselves - I found Mojo Mom hit the target beautifully. Tiemann writes like a best girlfriend, a coach, an expert, and fellow mother about the earth-shattering shifts to a mother's identity and how to nurture that tremendous change with down-to-earth, thoughful advice.I recommend this book to expecting moms, new moms, any woman with children. Chapter 8 \\"Keeping Your Resume Fresh and Your Financial Future Secure\\" is particularly inspiring, especially if you've taken a step back from your career to raise children, but want to be prepared for the next stages of your life. Chapter Five, \\"Centering, Silence and Reclaiming Your Mind Space\\" is a wonderful chapter if you're drowning in demands, not only from family, friends and work, but from noise, media, news. Chapter Two, \\"Life Inside the Cocoon: The Early Months of Motherhood\\" is an essential read for expecting and new moms.What grabbed me about Mojo Mom was the subtitle, \\"Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family.\\" Everyone tells us to enjoy these years with our children, and Mojo Mom is a wonderful \\"how-to guide\\" to show us how to do that. Plenty of references, resource, suggestions, advice, insights, and easy-to-read chapters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"One accusation often leveled at \\"bad mothers\\" is selfishness. But there's a selfishness of self-importance and superiority, and a selfishness that simply acknowledges that one's self is just as important as anyone else's. The subtitle of Amy Tiemann's book refers to the second kind of selfishness; it's the idea that we're actually better nurturers of our families and communities when we don't lose ourselves in the process.Acknowledging that motherhood changes our identities, Tiemann's premise is that change doesn't have to equal loss. Even when we're overwhelmed by the exhaustion and demands of early motherhood, we need to recognize that our own needs and wants still exist - and deserve time and attention. It's not going to be like this forever, and self-care is the first basic step in ensuring that a sense of self remains healthy.Tiemann's tone throughout the book is knowledgeable and encouraging, rather than authoritative and insistent. Beginning with the early-motherhood period she calls \\"the cocoon,\\" she suggests that this time of intense mother-and-child togetherness can also be a time when we re-evaluate who we are and who we want to be. The changes motherhood brings can help us focus on how we want to go forward as ourselves. And despite the somewhat New-Age-y way I've put that, Tiemann's approach is very practical. She discusses ways to handle guilt and anxiety, claiming time and \\"mind space,\\" and discovering outlets for self-expression. She examines relationships with partners, money, and the larger community, and suggests that at-home-mom/working-mom \\"mommy wars\\" may be fighting the wrong enemies. She offers references and resources in every chapter, as well as illustrative anecdotes.I would recommend this book for mothers-to-be and new moms as a little nudge to care for themselves during this wild transitional time. However, motherhood has a number of transitional times - as do the childhoods is parallels - and Mojo Mom's ideas and guidance could be valuable to mothers whose children are emerging into the pre-school and school-age years, and even mothers of teens and those on the verge of emptying nests. Amy Tiemann's book suggests that it's never too late to locate and nurture your Mommy Mojo."},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"I bought this book and literally could not put it down. Even before I finished, I started putting Amy's suggestions into practice. And the small changes I've made have already made a difference. I am examining all the things I do and determining which activities are really necessary and bringing me (or my kids) enjoyment. I'm realizing how important it is to have an identity other than mom - not that being a mom isn't a great or important thing but just that we are still our own person too.I so recommend this book for all moms. It would make a great shower gift too. There are tons of books about taking care of your children, your body, etc. This one tells you how to nurture your spirit and gives practical ways that you can do it no matter what the age of your children are or what your situation is.This would be a wonderful Mothers' Day gift too!"},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"Mojo mom is a must-read for mothers, mothers-to-be, and supporters of mothers who feel that current parenting literature neglects one of the key elements in a healthy, happy household--the mom, herself. When I was pregnant with my first child, I felt simultaneously overwhelmed and underwhelmed with traditional pregnancy and parenting literature--books like What to Expect When You're Expecting gave so much information I felt I couldn't absorb it or ever be the kind of mom they were describing. They also neglected the emotional aspects of mothering. The Girlfriends Guide was a humorous alternative, but certainly does not get to the core of what it means to be a woman after you become a mom. Mojomom addresses the subject head-on with true empathy and in a beautifully written, enjoyable style. Becoming a mom, for many of us, is a bit isolating even as it is joyful. The traditional antidotes to that isolation, such as mothers' groups, with their heavy focus on children, don't do much to counter that isolation. The most beneficial aspect of Mojomom is that as you read it, you begin to feel validated and part of a community of mothers who believe that one of the best gifts you can give your children is keeping a bit of yourself intact."},{"Title":"Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family","review":"Tiemann is truly gifted in the art of poignant messaging. As a new mother of a 3 1/2 month old girl, this book could not have come at a better time in my life. I have read parenting books, magazines, and websites galore but none came close to the effect this book had on me. Tiemann takes on the intense amount of change most career-oriented women face when we feel a chunk of the life we were used to slipping away and gives us practical advice on embracing it. Thankfully, she reminded me that I am allowed to hold onto myself without questioning any of the profound love I have for my daughter. She seemed to know exactly what it was that I wished someone would tell me and laid it out in one easy, fun read.Being a parent is the most important and rewarding journey of my life, and now I feel that I have one more tool in my toolbelt to ensure that I am the best parent I can be.

Wells. A must for anyone who plays wargames.On a psychological level, it is interesting that Wells champions \\"Little Wars\\" as a replacement for the real thing. It appears never to have occurred to him that playing miniature wargames may have something to do with perpetuating and validating the use of force to resolve conflicts.A few minuses:the text contains references to the illustrations in the original book. They are not in the Kindle edition, which is an unfortunate gap, as they are no doubt enjoyable.there is no active TOC.only the first two chapters and the last chapter are of general interest; the remainder is made up of the rules for Little Wars, which have been superseded by far more elaborate rules for modern wargamers."},{"Title":"Little wars: A game for boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books","review":"Little Wars is - of all things - one of the first tabletop miniature wargames, created by Mr. Wells and a couple of his bored friends. The gentlemen began by playing with some toy cannon left behind by the kids. Then, after an hour of lazily plinking at soldiers, their latent instinct for systemisation kicked in and they started creating the rules.There's normally nothing particularly interesting about reading a gamebook, but in this case, Mr. Wells is completely transparent about the creation process. What results is the fairly joyous story of a middle-aged Victorian paragon crawling around in his garden with a bunch of toy soldiers purloined from his sons' playroom. Furthermore, the discussion of how he added more and more layers of complexity into the game makes for oddly fascinating reading. Who knew debates about measuring supply lines could be so fun?Eventually, however, the details swamp the narrative. Mr. Wells goes into great depth with a play-by-play demonstration of one of his battles. Although the photographs are entertaining, as any gamer will tell you, there's only so much you enjoy someone else's playground war stories.Although weirdly enjoyable as a book (in that, \\"something for reading\\"), I'm not sure I can weigh on whether or not the game itself seems particularly fun. Or whether or not it can even be played (although these people have tried). There are weird gaps in the rules that mostly stem from the core materials (the cannons, especially) being so dated. And, in a similar vein, Mr. Wells' casual (and frequently-repeated) dismissal of female players places Little Wars as an artifact of a bygone era."},{"Title":"Little wars: A game for boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books","review":"This is, as the subject suggests, a hard book to rate. It's a fun light read (5-stars) but it's short, topic is dated (you just need read the sub-title) and if you know nothing about war games, perhaps even hard to get into (1-star).I liked it, I play war games (like this) and the old world view is just fun. I mean, I had one of those little spring worked cannons as a kid. Had I had these rules (this is both a book with story and a game with rules you can play) back then, I'd probably still have it and still be playing with these rules.This is after all a book from another time on a subject not for the electronic generation. It's sunshine, cold tea (or hot tea on a snow swept day) and simpler past times.

Coming across it accidentally while in the kindle store was one of those epiphanous moments. I couldn't download it fast enough and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It is a rare glimpse into the creative process of simulation design, he starts out with a series of \\"back to the drawing board\\" games and then goes through the step by step developement of the game's design.

Several members of the class said that they would also like to have the study book and I offered to purchase it for them and went to Amazon.Com to make the purchase. I ordered the first 10 books and while they came in 4 separate packages, they arrived in time for class and then the next week we found that we would need 3 more books and I contacted Amazon.Com once again and the books arrived in time for class the next Sunday. This week we are studying Chapter 3, but so far I, myself, am very pleased with the study and how it is presented. It makes one think, but also explains John's presentation and that is how we will continue to learn.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Be Alive (John 1-12): Come to Better Know the Living Savior (The BE Series Commentary)","review":"I found his work confusing and not well-thought out. Likely due to his Arminian point of view of a Gospel that is all about God's work in saving His own sheep, and contrasting the unbelief of those who do not have the Spirit, who are DEAD. (Hence, his title, Be Alive.) You would be better off reading the Gospel itself, than trying to find coherence in this commentary."},{"Title":"Safe conduct: An autobiography and other writings (Signet book)","review":"I was surprised to see only 2 reviews for this book. It is a beautiful short read that may not be appreciated by people who are too literal or lacking in imagination. It is a small but rich impression of the shadow of Mr. Pasternak's life. It is not the life itself but something found in the wake and ripples that are created along the way. I certainly recommend this book for anyone interested in a creative view of the world (perhaps the reviewer Kara J Buller is not one of these). I have given portions of the book even to undergrad students and they have truly connected with it. The life of Mr. Pasternak is told through the lens of poetry and mixed into this are insightful musings on the creative process. The author's insights are not too far separated from Rilke's writings on creativity and art.Take the following quote and if you find it engaging you will enjoy this short and enjoyable book. \\"And it is from this theme that art is born. It is more one-sided than people think. It cannot be directed at will where one wants like a telescope. Focussed on a reality which feeling has displaced, art is a record of this displacement. It copies from nature. How does nature get into this state of displacement? Details attain clarity, losing independence of meaning. Each detail can be replaced by another. Any one is precious. Any one chosen at random serves as evidence of the state which envelops the whole of transposed reality.\\""},{"Title":"Safe conduct: An autobiography and other writings (Signet book)","review":"In this autobiographical essay B. Pasternak reveals his views on art, his failed careers, his life and loves as a student, his travels across Europe and the artistic and political scene in the USSR.After studying music (under the baton of A. Scriabin) and philosophy (neo-Kantianism in Marburg), Boris Pasternak finally found his true vocation: literature.His artistic faithAs superbly explained by his French translator, Michel Aucouturier, B. Pasternak's aesthetics are fundamentally influenced by Schopenhauer. Art, true lyricism, binds 'the world as representation' (the objects) to the 'world as will' (our perceptions). True art reveals unexpected features, new aspects of reality. Prose or poetry give a name to these new aspects for the first time and in a unique manner. In this way, art creates a new reality through the 'strength' (the feelings of the author) and through images. In other words, the lyrical principle is a principle of subversion. Art cannot be driven by political imperatives. The poet is always a rebel against the social order: the most enduring images are those of the iconoclast.Mayakovsky and the totalitarian StateAmong the authors of the various Russian literary movements at the time, V. Mayakovsky was B. Pasternak's real hero. The suicide of the one \`who had the novelty of the time in his blood', was a very serious blow for B. Pasternak and an unmistakable omen of things to come. (See the memoirs of D. Shostakovich for another view on Mayakovsky.)During his travels across Europe, B. Pasternak was amazed by Venice, but he stumbles on its 'boca di leone'. Those boxes were for him the symbols of the totalitarian police State: mouths of lions are haunting you everywhere, putting their noses in everything that is intimate; mouths of lions that gobble up one life after another in the secret of their dens.This literary and politically important book is not a good introduction to B. Pasternak's work. Its phraseology is sometimes ultra poetic. It lacks also the vigor of his masterpiece 'Doctor Zhivago', one of the greatest novels of all time."},{"Title":"Safe conduct: An autobiography and other writings (Signet book)","review":"This was assigned to me in grad school in my \\"fiction as autobiography\\" class.

Rappaport was one of them. He was a student of Marvin Harris who proposed that all cultural traits should be assumed to have survival value. The mountain people were stereotyped as wasteful of resources because they consumed pigs only once or twice a year, concentrating their rare source of protein when they should have spread it out over the year. Mostly the pig feasts were held before combat. The high consumption of salt in their pork limited their abiltiy to fight, resulting in a kind of \\"civilized\\" warfare where village boundaries were established, males gained prestige, but few casualities occurred.The ethnogaphy has proved invaluable since so little was known about the New Guinea Highlands. The theory of curltural ecology is still under review.

I especially was engrossed in his chapters on \\"The Idea of God\\", \\"Eschatology\\", \\"Flesh and Spirit\\", and \\"The Divine Purpose\\". One may argue that nothing really new is presented and it fails to engage present day discussions, but the way Stevens explains his position is so clear, consistent, and concise so as to gain a much better understanding of traditional doctrinal concepts to help me better articulate NT teaching. Even for those who are more scholarly in their reading of contemporary systematice theologies, I think reading Stevens NT Theology would be a great review of the doctrines of the Christian faith and might even stimulate further thoughts on already too familiar subjects."},{"Title":"The Words of My Perfect Teacher, Revised Edition (Sacred Literature Series)","review":"Patrul Rinpoche's tried and true guide for clearing out the old wrong views and establishing a solid foundation to experience minds true nature.

But in a precious text like this one, which you will probably be taking into your heart and thinking about a lot, it seems well worth paying about a penny per revision.If you're looking for a first introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, you will probably be happier with something like Sogyal Rinpoche's The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying - again, get the revised edition. However, if you are looking for a deeper introduction to the ngondro practices, this is a book of great depth - and humor, and charm.It seems a previous reviewer was upset that the translators didn't get it \\"perfect\\" the first time, and felt that a revision was merited.

While specifically focusing on the Longchen Nyingtig (\\"Heart Essence of Longchen Rabjampa\\") terma tradition in the lineage of Jigme Lingpa, the exposition is equally applicable to virtually any Dzogchen ng&ouml;ndr&ouml; system, although the few details given regarding specific visualizations may need to be modified to fit the practitioner's sadhana, subject to the instruction of one's own lama. The teachings on the Outer Preliminaries, which account for more than half of the book, are likewise equally applicable to the foundations of Mahayana practice in any of the Tibetan traditions. The latter half covers the entirety of the Inner Preliminaries, including all five primary accumulations as well as the pendant practices of ch&ouml;d (Kusali offering) and P'howa (transference of consciousness at the moment of death).

One of my fondest memories was watching the then Senator on the evening news and my mother telling me that &quot;Senator [Robert] Kennedy is a man who cares about people. That's why we voted for him.&quot; I believed that fully.This is a book I would have LOVED as a child. This is a book I respect as an adult. I feel it gives young readers a good overview of the Senator's life and character and makes him somebody they can relate to. We follow the progress of little Bobby, 8 and 10 years younger than brothers Jack and Joe respectively determined to keep up with them. We smile at the small boy who was so determined to teach himself to swim that he flung himself into the ocean at age 4. Some 35 years later, we see that same little boy, now a Senator, determined to climb a previously unscaled mountain in Canada. He was a man who suffered from acrophobia, but he tabled his terror and climbed that mountain out of love for his brother.Robert Kennedy is a hard worker and his life is a litany of hard won successes. He had to live with people comparing him to his brother Jack, who was elected president in 1960. He had to contend with the feeling that he was still trying to keep up with Jack. It is only in the tragic aftermath of Jack's death does the full adult face of Robert Kennedy emerge -- the man who had previously worked behind the scenes promoting his brother becomes a KNOWN force to be taken seriously. He is the man who in addition to pursuing teamsters and mafiosi (&quot;bad guys who break the law&quot;) finds his own voice, his own interests and his own identity beyond the shadow of his brother. He is the man who, in the last half decade of his life became the voice for many. He was better than a great man. Robert Kennedy was a good man.That same caring side is brought out on issues concerning minorities, poverty and civil rights. The man who would be president in 1968 comes across as serious and sincere in his efforts. As we track him on the campaign trail in 1968, we are left with the painful question of what the intervening years would have been had he lived to win that presidential election."},{"Title":"A Ripple of Hope: The Life of Robert F.

Of course, this book is a very tiny sample (and even the author recognises that the sample is biassed - too many sterile rather than infertile respondents compared to population statistics - perhaps that tells us something about sterile men) and necessarily the author could not interview any man with fertility problems who had made the ultimate withdrawal from an unsatisfactory world.I know a man who is sterile and I can see synergies between him and the responses reported here, even though his cicumstance is different from all of them. Unlike the respondents here he knew before he was in a relationship - so he did not have a partner to provide support - neither did he have a partner with whom he could bury his own responses by providing her support. It affected him in different ways, but then his life did change. But, for all of these afflicted men, the continual ache in the background does remain even when parenting softens the blow to a degree.None of the men with infertility problems in this book makes the demand on their partner that they should just accept what fate has dealt them. These men - despite qualms and uncertainties - go along with their partners and fufill their own desires as much as is possible, by following the routes of adoption and assisted fertility processes such as donor insemination (DI).Perhaps there is another book to be written - one with a broader perspective. How do men cope, for whatever reason, with a failure to become a parent? Is it important to them? Does it have an impact on their life's 'achievement' (think about Beethoven for example)? Are men different in this to women?Be prepared to confront uncomfortable ideas when you read this book - other people's sadness. One of the men saw that he had an 'invisible disability'. For me this might have been the most telling comment of all - perhaps everyone has invisible disabilities of one sort or another and we should respond to people with understanding and acceptance of that.But then there was the anguish too. As one of the men said - It's terrible to have a problem, and your wife is the one who gets all the treatment and suffering for it."},{"Title":"Male Infertility - Men Talking","review":"I am fascinated by actual and perceived gender-atypical phenomena. There are men who have lupus and women who are colorblind, for example. Although many reports now say the man is equally likely to cause a couple's barenness as a woman, there's still a perception that women are to blame. In this book, the author speaks to infertile man.This book will definitely make you sympathize for the group. From a scientific perspective, researchers are not as interested in male infertility as much as its female counterpart. Fertile men have said to them within earshot, \\"At least I'm not shooting blanks!\\" The book does mention instances of couple's divorcing due to the problem. One man said, \\"I'm masculine and hairy, how can I be infertile!?\\"Still, I wish this was not reporting by the author; I would have prefered for each man, or couple, to have had a chapter all too themselves. The author is always giving her two cents and summarizing things that are obvious. I really think those readers with this difficulty would have related more to men just speaking about themselves without a journalist's filter.This is a British book and I think things may be different in the US. First, I imagine that the British health system would pay for infertility treatments that stingy US medical companies would not. Several times men said, \\"I'd be ruled too old to adopt.\\" In the US, with our large number of parent-less children, I highly doubt that would be a problem. These men seemed reluctant to have donor insemination and in the US, they keep things so private with donor substance that it would be easy for a couple to get help and just pretend it's the husband's child.This book left two occurences out that I imagine are major. First, I bet that many men don't know they are infertile until they are on a second or third wife who doesn't get pregnant. I'm guessing that many men blame their wives for childlessness without digging further. Second, something tells me that many an infertile man has his brother or male cousin do the goop-supplying if they cannot. The author only mentions a fertile man telling an infertile one, \\"You want me to set you up?\\" once.The (female) author stated that she became interested in this subject because her husband is infertile. She never reveals whether he was accepting of her putting his business all out on Front Street. She never says how she and her husband addressed the problem. She could have let him speak for a few pages to clear up these matters.There are very few books out there about male infertility. The ones that exist are mostly boring, scientific tomes about curing the problem. This is one of the few books that I found that allowed men to talk on this matter. I thank the author for her effort, but I would have done this book much differently."},{"Title":"Dance of Dreams","review":"This book explores the relationship between Ruth Bannion (you may remember her from the story of Seth Bannion and Lindsey) and Nick Davidov (who also appeared in the previous story as Lindsey's dance partner). Ruth gets her dream of dancing on stage in New York and for years both Ruth and Nick have longed for each other. In this story they finally come together. It's short, sweet, and lots of fun!"},{"Title":"Dance of Dreams","review":"DANCE OF DREAMS is the follow-up book to DANCE TO THE PIPER, but doesn't focus on one of the O'Hurley clan. It has us continuing with the same cast of characters but focusing on Ruth Bannion who was a child in DANCE TO THE PIPER. Also includes is Nickolai Davidov - the former dance partner of Ruth's step-mother, Maddie O'Hurley, and now a big time choreographer. Ruth has always had two loves - dancing and Nickolai. She just needs to convince him that she's no longer a child.DANCE OF DREAMS deals with fears - fears of the professional dancer and the cut-throat competition of that profession, fear of rejection and the fear of losing true love. With a background of dance practices and performances, Nora Roberts tells a love story that is anything but typical.At times while reading this book, you'll want to grab one or both of the main characters and shake some common sense into them. However, it's a good story that's well told and brings people into the lime light with whom the reader can relate, even non-dancers."},{"Title":"Air Passages: Surviving Asthma Naturally","review":"By reading and performing these simple, easy to learn exercise, it has helped in reducing the need to utilize my inhaler as often.

However, for those of us whose ex-spouses aren't up to the job--logistically, emotionally, psychologically, morally or geographically--this book does the serious disservice of presenting &quot;primary parents&quot; as vengeful, short-sighted and selfish. It's simply not so in many, many cases. Also, I question the assumption that all children thrive under and prefer shared custody arrangements. I've known several children (now adults) who've lived with these arrangements and have literally hated every minute. I'm not trashing shared custody--or this book, for that matter. But Ricci's perspective is not balanced; it's biased and, in my opinion, without credible evidence that this program is necessarily the best--or even humane--for all kids and their families."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"This book has been like a friend to me during difficult times.

It addresses the overwhelming decisions and crushing emotions that paralyze us, force us into hasty decisions and bad judgments, and send us running to someone else to make those decisions, or leave us depressed, immobile, or worse. Reading this book gave me a road map, a feeling that the author has seen thousands of people go through this process and can tell us what helps and what works. My experience is that this book works, I wish I had had it going INTO my marriage. There are no cure-alls here. Many of the suggestions take extensive time and thought, but the author persuaded me that if I didn't do it now, I'd still be dealing with the same issues in five or ten years. My stepchildren and lots of 30 and 40-year-olds are still dealing with their PARENTS' divorce. As soon as I started making lists for meetings, prioritizing my issues, ticking off the items in the parenting agreement that would and wouldn't be big issues in my particular situation, I felt better. Once in the process of working through my &quot;family change&quot; using the book, I understood that each small accomplishment builds you up for the next one and is basically creating your new life for you as you deal with the immediate issues of finances, custody, how to have a conversation with your ex, and how to recognize the parallel path your children are traveling with all of their specific problems (different from the parents'). This book gave me the confidence that if I just kept slogging through, eventually it would get me through the tying up of all those loose and messy ends that lie around for years. For those who want a decent divorce, to heal all family members as much as possible, and learn how to have better relationships, this book is the original guide.

Have a narcissic ex-partner or having issues with child alienated which Mom's House, Dad's House doesn't answer, try Warshak's book until you can get both of the parents to follow Mom's House, Dad's House.

Therefore, my daughter travels between our houses (about 8 blocks apart) every few days. I was hoping this book would help her dad and I make the most of our daughter's situation, but it seems to focus on parents who do not get along. Perhaps, because my daughter does not remember ever having two parents in the same home, this book isn't as relevant to her as it may be for some. The book seemed to focus on picking up the pieces, rather than just growing as a nontraditional family. I will say one positive thing: the book stresses avoiding the use of \\"ex husband\\" and \\"ex wife\\" and replacing with \\"my daughter's dad\\". I feel that makes for a better situation."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"This is an excellent book that every parent should read.

Very helpful, very practical, very informative."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"This book is a new, revised and updated edition of the book of the same name originally published in 1980. Dr. Ricci heads the Statewide Office of Family Court Services for California'as 82 family courts and has been a licensed marriage and family therapist for 22 years. The material for Mom's House, Dad's House came out of her experience as a therapist and mediator, teaching seminars and classes for divorcing parents. From her students and clients she learned how difficult and complex it could be for divorcing parents to pull away from their former intimate relationships and reorganize their lives. The present volume is a distillation of all that Dr. Ricci learned in those early and in subsequent years. Its goal is to inform divorcing, separated, or remarried parents on how to constructively heal the wounds of separation and establish a healthy new life for their children. Dr. Ricci argues that, contrary to traditionally accepted beliefs that divorce means destruction of the family, a new kind of really workable and satisfying family life can be created for a child while parents maintain separate residences. Reaching this state is, however, not easy. It involves an understanding by both parents of their mutual goals, and much hard work at &quot;pre-separation boot camp&quot; to actualize these goals. This is a painful process where former intimacy is replaced by a business-like approach with the needs of the child rather than those of the parents being paramount. The rewards to all parties are, however, enormous. Fortunately, as difficult as the process of separation may be, Dr. Ricci leads us through it in great detail, dissolving commonly held myths, describing the various stages of separation and the problems inherent in each, how to set up separate residences and still maintain a &quot;family,&quot; and the path out of our irrational negative intimacy to a rational relationship. Her points are well-illustrated throug the felicitous and ample use of quotes from clients. Also included are sections on the all-important legal side of separation and divorce and how to make it work for you, the divorcing parent, rather than for attorneys. The basic elements of parenting plans and agreements &quot;the most important legal document when it is filed&quot; are well-described in great detail and are alone worth the price of the book. Post-separation problems include those of the parent who fades out of the picture and their possible re-entry into the family relationship are well-described as are the wherefores of developing an extended family and acquaintance network, long-distance parenting, and difficulties involved in moving on. remarriage, dealing with &quot;flashbacks&quot; to the original relationship and former family life, and all the other problems one is likely to encounter even years after a divorce. Finally, for the layman who wishes to know more and for the professional, there are sections of detailed chapter notes, further reading, and appendices on information for your child's school, how to find a knowledgeable attorney, the costs of raising children, ideas for customized private clauses for private contracts, a mediation confidentiality agreement,and a guide for choosing child care. An index completes this exceptionally well-written and edited book. I have no hesitation in highly recommending Mom's House, Dad's House to anyone contemplating or involved in separation from a marriage. Indeed, I would even consider it must reading for anyone thinking of having children, to educate them as to the seriousness of bringing a child into the world. After all, you may be the one in two couples whose relationship will end in separation. My only regret is that this book was not yet in print when I separated from a former wife years ago when we had two children. Much emotional trauma all around could have been avoided or ameliorated if we had had Dr. Ricci's wisdom and practical suggestions then. Separation and divorce will never be a pleasure for anyone with children, but armed with MOM'S HOUSE, DAD'S HOUSE, it no longer has to take its vicious emotional toll. In both my professional life as a psychiatrist and in my personal life, I recommend this book to everyone. Richard A.

The description of the book, chapter titles, etc., made it sound like exactly the information I was looking for to help us through a very rough time and give us some ideas on how to improve communication and ease tension.However, I finished this book feeling a little let down and confused. As another reviewer pointed out, if the people in the book were able to work so well together while getting divorced, why did they not attempt to remain together and seek counseling/structure for their marriage? The ultimate dream of any small child with divorcing parents is for them to remain together.Also, it seemed like 90% of the examples of families/home structures in this book had the children living with their mother, and the father as the non-custodial parent. Although my husband did not ultimately get custody of his daughter, he is a wonderful father, and we know many dads who have physical custody. A few more examples of kids living primarily with their father would have been nice. As a parent, I can definitely say that I don't believe a mother loves a child any more than a father does. There is a special bond for a woman and her children to be sure, but there is just as special and loving bond between father and child.While the real-life examples conveyed the anger and frustration of divorce, there wasn't much about custody cases. This was a topic that was supposed to be covered in this book, and it was only lightly touched upon. Dr. Ricci would have done more of a service to the readers of the book if she had touched on any and all scenarios of divorce/custody/visitation.I believe there is always room to grow as a person and as a family.

The very first page of Chap. 1 made me cry. My main concern was that our son (4 1/2) feel as though he had a place HE could call HOME. I felt that flip flopping back and forth on the current 5,5,2,2 day schedule was unstable for him. I feel as though an angel touched me on the shoulder and brought this book into my life. My view instantly changed about shared placement when the little girl from Chap. 1 responds to the businessman on the airplane that she has two &quot;real&quot; homes. I tear up thinking about each time. I no longer feel that our son should be placed primarily with me - that he will have 2 homes - 2 families and that is wonderful for him. I especially love the use of &quot;rose&quot; words and changing ! such terms of &quot;visiting&quot; to &quot;living with&quot; each parent. I have already implemented the use of these terms. The surveys are also wonderful self examinations that (if answered truthfully) will be so educational for you. The use of a &quot;Parent Agreement&quot; is also something I think is wonderful. I have already typed the initial draft and I plan to approach my child's father with it and get his input. It was great to see the different stages literally mapped out for you. I also enjoyed the chapter on changing your once intimate relationship into a business relationship and avoiding the negative intimacy that can be so prevalent in these situations and how to avoid &quot;hot spots&quot;.I cannot emphasize how inspirational this book has been for me!! I would and do strongly recommend this book to anyone thinking about, in the process of, or in a post-divorce situation.

I highly recommend it to any divorced or divorcing parent who is committed to minimizing the divorce's negative effects on their children.

This book advocates putting the child first and tells parent how to behave civilly and work co-operatively with the other parent for the sake of the child, telling parents what to do and what to say that keeps your child out of the middle of the anger between former spouses.

While I do think that parents need to make the children a priority in divorce, this book can tend to make divorced parents feel like failures if they do miss their children when they are visiting the other parent or make custodial parents feel guilty for having primary custody. Her stories of how divorced mates still love each other and admire each other from afar and work together in harmony for the sake of the children tend to read more like a fairy tale than the reality of most divorce situations.This book fails to address issues of selfish parents and what to do with an ex spouse who is bitter and angry and consistently uses the child(ren) as a weapon(s). The book tends to villainize parents with primary custody, making them sound like selfish control freaks who only have their own interests at heart and not their child's. In most cases that I have seen, this is far from the truth and joint custody isn't nearly as rosy as Ricci claims it can be.If you can pull it off, I give you lots of credit. But very few divorced parents that I know can do this successfully."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"My divorce has been and continues to be a very difficult personal struggle. This book really didn't provide much help. Maybe if I re-read it in a couple of months."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"Mom's House, Dad's House by Isolina Ricci: I did not find this book remotely helpful and, by contrast, found it did a diservice to the process in which I was engaged when my ex walked out on my kids and me. Parents who can get along as well as Ricci purports ought not to have divorced in the first place (read Hendrix for more info on keeping the love you find). When a divorce is an action of intentional abuse, as many are (an affair is abusive as is the \\"walk-away\\" concept), and is an act of grossly misdirected anger, no amount of co-parenting, negotiation, or mediation will ever effect an equally loving, shared responsibility toward the children nor will it effect any healing between the estranged parent and the grieving children. Ricci's book and her advice simply makes for more frustration and heartache to hope that a fundamentally abusive person could offer the kind of nurturing, structure, and love that a child needs (and be willing to keep up his end of an agreement).I think that Mom's House, Dad's House by Isolina Ricci does a huge diservice to those Moms who really ARE working their tails off to do the best possible job of parenting their children and I think it also misguidedly reinforces the notion that shared custody is healthier for children in all situations. It is not. The best family has an intact marriage where couples are willing to go the last mile to openly communicate and treat each other with respect and equality in working out inevitable power struggles. If two people can do what she purports in this book, they ought never to have divorced in the first place. Divorce is mostly (though not always) an immature way to deal with relationships and parenting. True growth happens within the context of commitment to the marriage and to the children. This book is also somewhat \\"anti-woman\\" since we often end up with sole custody. While this approach may work in a handful of split families, this is a highly unrealistic view of post-divorce life and seems to be more of a text designed to earn money for the author than to provide help for families."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"Still reading this, but so far is a good book.

I had plenty of time to read suddenly, after all. I found this book to be not only the most effective in handling kidds, but probably contained the best advice on keeping the marriage together. Alas, it was not meant to be.A key thing: my children's mother and I have always wanted to be civil with one another. I recognize that many relationships do not end this way, and many parents are abusive or neglectful. There are other books that are better for handling those types of situations. For example, \\"Where's Daddy?\\" by Jill Curtis is likely to be helpful for a mother dealing with an absent or abusive father; for me it was not very helpful.This book can be key in helping a couple that doesn't want their divorce to turn so sour that they can't stand each other's sight. It is helpful in handling each parent's relationship with their children, and their relationship with each other.If you are already hunkered down in the middle of a war, this book may not be right for you; if you are trying to avoid getting into that situation in the first place, this book should be at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"I don't care if this was supposedly \\"Revised and expanded\\" it's still something that does not have enough relevant information for our time in the 21st century.

From an objective stand-point, ie: step-parent of 2 non-custodial children, the guilt issue is far too overplayed. Get over the guilt &amp; deal with what is feasible for either parent to do for both the children AND themselves. Sure, the children are important...but so are the parents...and I have not seen that mentioned anywhere in this publication. Are the parents of these children really so unimportant that their own well being doesn't matter? Are the children so important that it's ok for the parents to put aside their own needs in favor of what a child wants? I don't think there's much of a balance in this book. It's all very one sided...and not a terrific over-view of what really happens once one parent re-marries!"},{"Title":"Moms House Dads House","review":"The product showed up on time and was exactly as stated in the specs for the product.

I certainly understand where she is coming from and the struggles involved. This is a highly individualized condition where no two cases are alike. There are however some consistencies in most people with DID. The average time spent in therapy is between 8 and 10 years. Her book only spans 2 years in which she discovered, worked with, and integrated most of her splits. This is almost unheard of. She ended the book very ubruptly because she wanted to get it published, not because she was at a point of healthy living. She was open and honest about her marriage and relationship with her therapist, but I kept wondering about her kids. She stated that she had two children but in all her family stories, they were never mentioned. DID effects all relationships. Why leave such a vital part of her life out? The struggles and guilt of what this does to a mother is horrific. That is what other's with DID would have related to and wanted to hear. Finally, her constant preaching, praying, and bringing her parts \\"into relationship with Jesus\\" made healing seem like a formula. She almost implied that healing and integration depends on them becoming christian.

I'm always looking for studies to recommend either to others for personal study or for Sunday School classes. I was a bit shocked when I received books 1,3 and 5 to review.The study is divided into 4 or 5 weeks worth of lessons per book. I took a little time and read through the questions for each week and was very happy with what I read.The study is a bit on the basic side, but it's in-depth for basics. It's not too complicated for a new believer and it's not too basic for even someone who has studied the Word for years. It would be great for use in a Sunday School setting.The study is a bit long for each week, but if it's taken a few questions per day, it would not be too overwhelming, even for a new Christian.I like that each lesson has a space for journaling during the week and several have charts to match the lesson.I will be recommending this as a church wide study and look forward to completing the study both by myself and in a group.I received no monetary compensation for my opinions.

I can talk about this book and the series with a good amount of experience. We have an adult Sunday School class that has used books in this series, in concert with the Bible, as its sole resource for about three and a half years.This is simply the best guided discussion book to work with the Bible that we have encountered. The form is deceptively simple. Sections of scripture are used to structure both teaching and discussion about the teaching. As a Sunday School leader, you simply read the designated scripture and fill in the blanks to answer the questions the book poses. When you go to lead the class, you then have a perfect outline for structure of teaching, discussion and answering the questions.This sounds simple - and it is - but God really works His miracles when you take this book to class. It is easy to introduce the topics and start discussion. What is wonderful to behold is how everyone in the class immediately jumps in and offers their ideas. I often have observed that the class runs itself in the sense that once it takes off the leader really does very little other than keep it all on track. Of course, it is God speaking through the scriuptures who runs the class; all the leader does is facilitate the process.I highly recommend this book and this series. If you are looking for new directions in Sunday School that stay accurate to the Bible this is an excellent road to take. The Lord will use it to take you to great places you have never been before!

Their sense of new genre public art builds on exposure, deconstruction, and rejection of modernism's constructs and myths. Throughout these essays terms such as \\"community\\", \\"consensus\\", \\"truth\\", \\"good\\", and \\"multiple voices\\" are used to propagate a genre of public art that is dematerialized and progressive. Yet, it is not realistic to assume that consensus and community will always be progressive forces. This book raises more questions than it answers. Such as; can an artist go too far in the direction of consensus and community? Isn't there danger in not recognizing the tensions and conflicts within any group interaction (small community) for the sense of consensus (common good). Do the multiple voices include those that do not label the project \\"art?\\" Do these, and other public art projects have the potential to fall back into the modernist trap of being seen as a fraud, a hoax, or a loss of craft, in which audiences are insulted? Are these projects art because an artist was involved, and what happens to that role if the artist is simply a conduit for other voices? Can the artist speak for communities from which the artist does not belong (is it better to utilize local artists from within the communities)?"},{"Title":"Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art","review":"Arrived from the seller top-notch!

I bought the paperback and quit smoking even before I finished the book and have not smoked since. Thank you Walter for writing it."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Written at the cusp of the 'consumer revolution', this book is both a quaint historical piece and a prophesy of what was to come. The tangential thesis of the book is that by the mid-fifties, the standard problems in capitalism -- those of production and distribution of goods -- were solved, but that this introduced another problem: all of these goods must be consumed. So, it became necessary to step up the techniques used to market these goods.Advertising was nothing new, but the psychological intricacy and sophistication in it was ratcheted up significantly. Using Freud, Jung, and whatever other foundation proved workable, social scientists and psychoanalysts honed their skills to develop an ever-growing repertoire of tricks that would induce us all to spend and consume at ever-higher levels.Two things make the book relevant today: 1) nothing has changed either in the economic situation or in the techniques, except that both have become even more intense (two thirds of the 2002 U.S. GNP depends on consumer spending); and 2) no other book has yet come forward to do a better job at showing, in great anecdotal detail and for a broad audience, what depth marketing is all about."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"The Hidden Persuaders explores the dark world of advertising and the effects it has upon our minds. Even though it was written originally in 1957, most of its material is still relevant today. At first, one may be lead to the conclusion Vance Packard has gone off the far end with his accusations of subliminal mind control, but he provides so much factual data you finally come to realize this isn't any joking matter. Everyone should read this book, at least to become familiar with its theme, and to increase personal awareness of the underlying messages our minds are exposed to every day. Packard will help you understand virtually hundreds of ways corporations get you to give away your hard earned money readily. He explains not only how companies make you tick, but why they make you tick. After reading the book, you will never watch another commercial or listen to another advertisement the same."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS by Vance Packard stands as one of the more eye-opening accounts of the development of the motivational sciences in the 20th Century. What is being described by Packard is the evolution of a systematic relationship between merchandisers of America's then-booming manufacturing industries who teemed up with Madison Avenue-style advertising firms, who themselves were backed by a network of behavioral scientists. As described by Packard, this network not only developed novel and creative ways of reaching into the psyche of its intended target audiance to tap into hidden motivations; but in the process of turning us all into more compliant consumers, so shifted the values of the entire society that they changed American society for all time. Today many of us have virtually succumbed our natural &quot;reality&quot; to a phony existance based upon presenting an image of ourselves to our peers that is actually based upon media and market-generated values. Once we understand the process that created this vast consumer culture, with all it's attendant neuroses, we can then begin to fashion for ourselves a strategy for recovering our basic humanity. What is being described in THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS, is the origins of a system to manipulate us out of that humanity."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Vance Packard is a man ahead of his times. Although this book was published forty years ago, it is not dated at all. Packard shows us in a witty way how producers hire motivation researchers to determine why consumers buy the products they do. This is the first book I have read on this subject, and it is very interesting to read how people actually have a job in which they determine what motivates a person to buy a product. I knew that a product's appearance had some weight on its probability of selling, but I had no idea as to what extent this occurs in. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is very easy to understand and straightforward."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Most of us realize that we are being influenced all the time. What most of us don't realize is just how much we are controlled and influenced. The Hidden Persuaders will describe to you the early efforts made to understand, control and influence people in the name of consumerism and control. This book should scare you, especially when you stop and think about how much more refined the methods are today.A key point made by the book is the primary difference between manipulation and persuasion is intent. Even the most cursory look at history will tell you that when the tools exist, someone will use them to dominate and control others. In fact, they are being used right now and everyday to control us. The Matrix is alive and well and real.Read this book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"It is hard to believe that one of the most perceptive and important books on the shaping of modern society is out of print. This book shows how the workings of our minds have been scientifically evaluated, and this knowledged used to manipulate them. Not in any 'X-Files' manner, just straight out appealing to our basic desires and needs. Read this book, and then as yourself what every ad and salesperson is doing to you when you see them. It's all there, so they aren't hard to work out."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"What's really interesting about this book is how old the information is. The ideas Packard described are being presented to us today as relatively novel, as though our culture is just now waking up to the idea that consumerism is about hidden motivations, hypnosis, rationalization and social striving.Take the example about how people want big cars but feel ashamed of buying them, and how you can help them justify it to themselves by talking about safety. This kind of information is being presented to us in the present as though it were news, but there it was, in 1959.As for it being dated, well, in some ways it is. Still, a lot of the psychological information still represents our best information about human nature. It's interesting to see theories devised for healing psychological pathology employed for monetary gain, especially if you don't have a background in advertising and marketing.If you are already an expert in those areas, it might make a fun history lesson."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"A really insightful and illuminating book about the introduction of psychological conditioning methods into product marketing and politics which I consider to be essential reading for anyone who would be aware at this time. What's all the more remarkable is the fact that this book was written at the advent of this development, and the author well understood what it portended. Time to wake up, Neo."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I met Vance Packard's (1914-1996) work with his The Pyramid Climbers, a pioneer study on American enterprise management developement. The Hidden Persuaders is about a very different subject, and it was also one of the first true considerations on how propaganda, or media manipulation, changes the way America behaves toward franchises, merchandising and, in the end, how it shapes the way we structure our goals and, to use Focualt's title, the order of things. It, of course, shows its age since it was first published in the 1950's. However it is in no way obsolete and thanks to Packard's excellent pen it is a breeze to read, and an excellent example of the so called Pop Sociology."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"We have been programmed by marketing strategies, tv commercials, billboards and anything else that marketing strategists can possibly conceive of!

But the bottomline is that the book no longer belongs to the present time and generation. It is sad but true that this insightful writing needs a relook in present context."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book is extremely relevant even its release has been thrown fifty years ago.If you go back to the real origen of the problem , you will find this clever definition of the advertising : It is the art the money of your pocket comes to mine .You may disagree or not with this statement but you must to understand the world has been composed for the consumer and the producer . That means the timeless principle of the Yin and Yan; the force and the reaction; the muscle and the mind; the innovation vs tradition .I love the advertising just for it overthrows the unhealthy paradigm of the last discover; and in the same way that the archeology does , you must to accept the truth always under a veil of relativity . In the market as in the life there is no anything secure and definitive .And that circumstance allows to keep us in continous movement.Packard analyzes the origins of the underworld of the different devices about how to persuade the consumer to acquire things that not necesarily are useful .That is why a whole universe of new disciplines have been created to induce the population to follow certain patterns of induced behavior.I think if you are a centered human being , you can face your inner dragons and win the challenge ; but if you are not a well positioned person , you will be forced to turn around the suggested roads about how to build and rebuild over and over your way of thinking and living.This last option may be well appropriate for this important segment who lives in the first level of Maslow pyramid . And please do not forget this clever statement of Pascal : The mankind looks like as child who always is reborn . That is the real and timeless effective target .Recommended for marketing designers , market research, motivational human sciences and for all those people really interested in that passionate discipline ."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book was a great eye opener for me! it mad eme aware of what was really going on in the advertising world!

It is a marketing book and I like marketing books. I was interviewed today and the interviewer asked me if I was more of a mentor coach leader than a marketer. I did not know those were opposite leadership styles.This is one of the original classic marketing books. It was copyrighted in 1957 so it is fairly amusing to read when you see the examples used, like the \\"cancer scare\\", \\"Today's modern housewife\\", and \\"for people entering the second half of this century\\"Much of what he talks about is still true today, although because the book is so dated, it is difficult to pull out all of the lessons. If you want to read it, read it for fun, not for the marketing lessons.It seems whenever I read an older book, the writer thinks that the times were changing more then than ever before and even with the current books, that seems to be the tone. Even back then Packard talked about information overload and overload of marketing. I think the bottom line is everyone always think the times they are in is uncertain, changing etc.To this I say \\"Change is opportunity\\". Find the opportunity for you in change."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I really enjoyed this book. You will be left with your jaw dropped. A great read for those interested in the contraversy of Marketing."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"The classic book which first exposed the psychological tricks used by advertisers to sell everything from soap to ideas. This information is even more important today when so much information is gathered about each of us. This book shows how even the must seemingly unimportant detail about a person can be used as a tool to manipulate that person's opinions and buying habits."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written. It is a book about how psychological research, motivational research was being employed at the time to sell Americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want, or weren't necessarily very good for them. Sounds very much like Reality as we now know it. This selling also extended to Politicians, and Packard foresaw the way the Image would become in many instances more important than the Message in choice of political candidates.As I said the book is filled with information. I am embarassed to say that I have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned Packard's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth. Brush after you eat, he advises, as I now recall many dentists have told me through the years.In any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that Advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Such a great book and such shocking proofreading. The ebook is full of typos. Considering all the publishers have had to do is turn it into electronic text (once) then sit back and take the money, they should be ashamed of the job they've done. A very poor advertisement for ebooks. If only I still had my Penguin copy ..."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Packard's book may have been ground-breaking at the time, but some of his conclusions translate well enough to the digital age."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Everyone should read this book before they go college, it will prepare them for the unexpected that you won't learn in school."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I read this book when I was in high school, and it was an eye-opener. It created my interest in communication."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"What is perhaps most interesting about the early market researchers is the amount of attention paid to class: they imagine, for instance, that the subtle gradations in difference between Buick and cadillac is a telling sympton of American class differences. That is one reason that the Edsel failed, because it was based on the idea that families would &quot;trade-up&quot; to an Edsel if it was positioned as slightly higher-class than a Ford. You can also learn a good deal about life in the 50s: before flouride, people brushed their teeth in the morning, and not for hygiene but for cosmetics. It is a testament to the power of the advertising (and the research) that we now all brush our teeth at night. Packard is long on examples and short on analysis, and he waffles between being golly-gee-willickers impressed with the &quot;scientists&quot; and their methods or repulsed by the cynicism and naked manipulation of their backers. Their definitely is the sense, which is so unfamiliar today, that these guys in lab coats are really strange birds, but surely they must represent progress. After all, isn't it a good thing that people brush at night? Packard is not your standard culture curmudgeon like Galbraith or, much worse, Adorno. Class, of course, is much less important today than then, but it is still important. Packard relates the fascinating story of why people went to loan sharks instead of the wood-panelled banks (and just think of how wood-panelled station wagons have been replaced with the plastic wheel-rims of SUVs): because the borrowers could feel superior to the loan sharks, even if they had to pay higher rates. I suggest that the publisher reissue Packard."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"If you have an interest in what it was like to be in 1950's America, this book is like a time travel excursion taking you there. It's very dated, but an interesting look into life in that time, very much like being there. If you know a little about the 50's, this rounds out a lot of what you think you know. I'm just old enough to have missed the 50's (born 1962) but still recall much of the effects of those years on society. Growing up in Maine, it took awhile for the 50's to actually leave. Much of what I remember as a child relates to that era. If that's you too - you'll enjoy this quick, easy read."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I rarely put a book down, even if I find its not what I expected. I feel a book at least deserves the chance to be heard out -- but not this one.I heard about Hidden Persuaders on NPR when they talked about consumer buying habits. Thinking it would be an intriguing look into the way things are marketed to us, I bought the book. Vance and his publisher want you to believe that this is a shocking expose of the advertising industry but I doubt even he believes his assertion. Perhaps these were revolutionary techniques in the 50s but they certainly aren't relevant now. Does it require a psychologist to tell us that we all want a convertible and leave with a sedan? That you'd rather have a cake mix that requires eggs and milk instead of just water? That you want to indulge in a guilty pleasure but need to be reassured first? That sex sells? It's armchair psychology and nothing in the book is shocking or surprising.Even the publisher doesn't take this release seriously -- it clearly skipped the editor's desk and went straight to press typo's and all. The cover teases you in with promises of scandalous marketing tactics, but it fails to deliver any more than wasted print."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Mountain Man","review":"Non stop action in the tradition of the dime store Western!

He finds the series to be quite intriguing and an easy read."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Mountain Man","review":"\\"Pride of the Mountain Man\\" by William W. Johnstone is a clich&eacute;, at best. A lone hero and a few sidekicks take on a gang of villains. Fine. Most western novels are clich&eacute;s, and their effectiveness depends on such elements as descriptive language, sense of place, historically accurate background, and unique characterizations. Mr. Johnstone's narrative is instead a catalog of bloodshed, and graphic depictions of bullet wounds and the writhing throes of death. I agree with the premise that America and the Old West were extremely violent and that life was often short, brutish, and nasty. Unfortunately Mr. Johnstone uses this premise for an entire plot as he fills page after page with killing after killing.Witness these random descriptions:* \\"Hicks fell over on his back, feet kicking, reaching for his mouth with both hands...'Lookee there ! Tom's teeth come plumb out of the back of his neck. Two of \`em's layin' there underneath under his skullbone'.\\"* The gunman was midway through looping his reins around the hitch post when he stiffened his spine....His stetson flew off amid a cloud of crimson mist, and it appeared that a plug of his long black hair went with his hat.\\"And so on. This is the substance of this novel. These depictions substitute for any sort of writing acumen or skill.I also had problems with Mr. Johnstone's lack of even a modicum of historical research.* The author mentions several times that his villain Bloody Bill Anderson was reported shot down after the Civil War. I have no problem with Bloody Bill being resurrected, but he ould have been reported dead in October, 1864. The war did not end till the next spring.* He has Bill Anderson fighting with the Army of Tennessee in the battle at Franklin (TN). Bill never served in Hood's army nor did he fight at Franklin.* Wyatt Earp is described as the 22-year old City Marshall of Dodge City. Earp was actually Assistant Marshal at the age of 30. He was never marshal.Okay, I'll allow for poetic license, but I would suggest that in the future Mr. Johnstone at least take a cursory glance at Wikipedia for a few pieces of factual information.Finally the title belies the plot of the narrative. It is about a rancher/gunfighter. A mountain man only has a peripheral role as the mentor to the hero. The reader becomes acquainted with him only through the hero's recollections. I fail to see how this story has anything to do with his \\"pride\\".William W. Johnstone has apparently authored a huge quantity of western novels. My guess is that it took him less time to write this trashy book that it did for me to plod through its tedious pages."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Mountain Man","review":"And heres another good book about Smoke Jenson who beyond all odds thrives to kill people and bring about a personal revenge. Wyatt Earp is not a very central figure so dont buy it because of that. Buy it because it's a good shoot 'em up book."},{"Title":"Family law in a nutshell (West nutshell series)","review":"\\"Nutshells\\" are not just for slackers who blew off the semester and need to cram at the last minute. I've been consistently impressed with the quality of West's Nutshell series. They're excellent study aids for summary, clarification, and getting the key points and big picture. This one is written by two prominent scholars in the field, the senior of whom (Harry Krause at Illinois) is also the lead editor on one of the major casebooks (Krause, Elrod, Garrison, Oldham, Family Law: Cases, Comments, and Questions). Thus this little book is epecially valuable if your class is using that casebook.This nutshell provides an excellent tour through all the major areas and issues of family law. There's a nice balance among history, leading cases, and commentary on how the law is evolving. It's short, concise, and, as the authors are not afraid to be droll now and then, a breezy, interesting, and pleasant read."},{"Title":"Family law in a nutshell (West nutshell series)","review":"I am a paralegal student and these Nutshell series books are PERFECT!

Like most of the Nutshell series, it is a quick and easy read, and provides enough information to help with exams or familiarization with the topic."},{"Title":"Catalogue of Egyptian revenue stamps: With Sudanese revenues & Egyptian cinderellas","review":"This book, published in 1984, is a catalog of the revenue stamps and papers, interpostal seals (round local labels used in the 19th century), and miscellaneous postal labels of Egypt and the Sudan. It also include those revenues overprinted for Palestinian use and the wildly misperforated &quot;errors&quot; commissioned for King Farouk's personal collection. Feltus systematically divides the material into categories, lists and illsutrates each issue, and, in copious appendices, provides background documentation on their production and use. There are even a few color plates at the beginning of the book.Peter Feltus has put together an indispensible reference for those stamp collectors who specialize in Egyptian philately or in revenue stamps more generally. My only complaint about this volume is that it needs updating to cover post-1984 issues and new discoveries (I hope the author is working on it). Nonethless, this catalog is a marvelous piece of research and has a permanent place on my philatelic bookshelf."},{"Title":"More From Hollywood; The Careers of 15 Great American Stars","review":"Dewitt Bodeen was a constant contributor toFilms in Review. He wrote about the old starsas if they were dear friends and most of thetime they were. Not from Dewitt's pen wouldyou get the venom tipped scandal mongering -he would write of their beauty (or theirhandsomeness), their popularity with the publicand if they did suffer a fall from grace, hewould always write about it with sympathy andunderstanding.One of the first career articles I remember readingwas one on the other Gish sister - Dorothy. I didn'tknow much about her but Mr. Bodeen brought her tolife as he talked of her wit and charm and her greatfriendship (when they were both young girls) withConstance Talmadge. The problem was Constance couldcharm D.W. Griffith around her little finger butGriffith, somehow, couldn't take to Dorothy. Thearticle originally appeared in 1968 when DorothyGish was only a footnote to most people. So Mr.Bodeen may have been the first person to give publicrecognition to her talents. This article is expandedand lots more pictures are featured, along with abeautiful article about Garbo that I vividlyremember reading in Focus on Film. He reminiscedabout working on his college paper and how he hadbeen given his first film to review - \\"Ben Hur\\". Oneof his friends was given \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" andwhat's more thought Barbara Kent outshone Garbo!!Dewitt couldn't believe it and said after that hecould never trust people who slighted Garbo!!!The other articles are Elsie Ferguson, PaulineFrederick, Clint Eastwood, Val Lewton, JeanetteMacDonald, May McAvoy, Frances Marion, CharlesRay, Blanche Sweet, Nazimova, Antonio Moreno, RamonNovarro and Florence Bates, all written in Bodeen'sconcise and easy, friendly style. Florence Bateswas the most fascinating - you will know her fromcountless character parts.

She gone from an ordinary middle class working stiff to one of the richest women on the planet. She is also the daughter of a convicted murderer, one who killed her father and gave birth to Holly while in prison. She and her in-laws are all ashamed of her which is the reason she was given away in a private adoption.Now the only heir left is John, ane'er do well despised more than Holly. Her great-aunt contacts her before her death to inform Holly about her true identity and inheritance. She decides to collect her Randall inheritance evn though it means displacing John. Her Uncle John, who has lived off of the money for years, could not care less that the heir has surfaced. He knows that there are ways, including lethal means, for him and his avarice spouse to insure that they keep their current standard of living. It will be interesting to see how Holly copes with her duplicitous family.Readers who have perused Daphne Du Maurier's REBECCA and Emily Bronte' WUTHERING HEIGHTS will understand the atmosphere that permeates THE INHERITANCE, a modern gothic tale. The sense of foreboding and the dark and dire happenings that change the characters forever is brilliantly captured by Tom Savage. This powerhouse of a writer creates a memorable novel because of the lead female, who is both more and less than she seems. More books like this will lead to a gothic novel renaissance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This one reads like an episode of the old Alfred Hitchcock Hour. It's not perfect - I'd have to comb it over a couple times to be sure all Savage's loose ends are really tied-up - but in the end it doesn't matter. The Inheritance is a cleverly plotted and satisfying trip down decadent Murder-the-Heiress Way.There's nothing new here, you've seen it all before - the Cinderella innocent who discovers she's suddenly a multi-millionaire, the greedy relatives who intend to horde the money for themselves, secret identities, hit-men, long-buried family secrets, and nobody being quite what they seem - but Savage is a deft writer, and makes it all fresh and fun.But what I liked best about this piece - and what most reminds me of the old Hitchcock show - is its fiendishly entertaining (and surprising) epilogue, that evoked a genuine laugh along with its added finishing chill."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I highly recommend this thrill ride of a book.

A few too many characters to track...it was hard to tell which ones were essential to the plot until the end, then I wondered why he'd spent time on their stories (i.e., the local police chief). Savage has a wonderful imagination. He works in a mystery book store, and obviously all the books he's had access to have rubbed off! The very last page was overkill (pardon the pun). Holly, the protagonist, obviously had a conscience, so I doubt she would have taken the &quot;epilogue&quot; risk of going for $600 million rather than a measly $300 million. Then again, I could be wrong! I'd love to know how the author arrived at that ending. Thanks, Mr. Savage. I will get your previous books and read them too."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Who would of guessed that the sweet innocent girl had all those tricks up her sleeves. The shocker for me was when the book stated it wasn't the first time she saw the house. She was there at the beginnng of the story and knew exactly what she was doing. It is true that there are many twisting and winding roads but its worth it. You say to yourself where is this author taking me on this roller coaster ride. This is the last book Tom Savage wrote and I am waiting to see what he too has up his sleeves."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Don't believe the book blurbs on this one. This book is written in the most amatuerish style and filled with cardboard characters such as the girl from the wrong side of the tracks who suddenly discovers she's a modern-day princess (read: &quot;rich&quot;). You can spot nearly everyone of these characters coming from about a mile away. The only saving grace of the book is the incredible plot twists at the end but, by that time, you're so beaten into numbness by what comes before that it hardly matters. If only the author had spent as much time revising the rest of the book as he did figuring out the ending. And, while the ending is surprising, it's surprising in a not very satisfying way -- turns out you won't like any of the characters. Pass it by. How bad was this book? I left it on the plane the moment I finished it."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Great execution on depicting greed. This book was hard for me to put down. The twists and turns by Savage are incredible. Savage really establishes the characters very well in this book. I really felt like I was in Randall house as a fly on the wall.

Also, there were 1-too many twists at the end of the book and a little dissappointing about not establishing Toby's character a little more."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I've read two of Tom Savage's other novels: Valentine and Scavenger. I own Precipice, and will probably read that one soon. Valentine was very clever and so was Scavener. Both had endings that genuinely shocked me. But, The Inheritance is different. It's not as good. There are some interesting twists, but these twists don't redeem the mediocre writing and stagnation of suspense in the middle. One thing is certain: Savage has a twisted mind.Speaking of twists, I was able to guess many of them. I shouldn't say \\"guess.\\" To guess is to pick blindly. I had plot evidence; so it was deducement. Or is it inducement? Either way, I knew what was coming much of the time. A couple of things did genuinely throw me for a loop. But cleverness can't be credited, only slight of hand. The biggest problem I see in the book is Savage's propensity to have guilty characters act innocent even when they are alone. A related problem is the seemingly out of the blue personality changes. At the end, I felt cheated and dissatisfied. While Valentine and Scavenger have unexpected but inevitable conclusions, The Inheritance's ending seems like Savage just decided to come up with something to shock the reader despite betraying the story and characters he spent the entire book building. Even after finishing the book, I still don't know how much was an act and how much were genuine emotions, actions, and thoughts. Was there one innocent moment for any of these people?"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"You know the story......girl adopted at infancy suddenly inherits a ton of dough but encounters lots of twists and turns and suspense along with it.

Great beach/bath book."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"While entertaining in the first half, this book never pays off. The characters are not fully developed and the ending was ridiculous.

In fact, this novel (as do his earlier books) owes more to Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr and writers of fair play puzzle mysteries of the early 20th century. I don't think Savage has ever really read a real Gothic. He certianly doesn't acknowledge the creators of the genre: Anne Radcliffe and Horace Walpole, or the 19th centruy writers who made it entertaining Sheridan LeFanu, Wilkie Collins. This book is great on plot but is fairly mediocre in every other respect. Surprising since this is Savage's third novel. The characters are stock; the dialogue is banal, stilted and surprisingly lacking in wit; the setting (aren't Gothics supposed to be 95% local color?) is unimaginatively realized. It definitely is &quot;lite&quot; reading. But as always the Savage twists and surprises are plenty. It strikes me that this would do better as a tongue-in-cheek send-up of Gothic stories. It's a borderline gay camp thriller, if you read between the lines. The characters certainly lend themselves to parody especially the evil Catherine and her lusty husband. It's all so ridiculously serious and the plot is too preposterous to be taken seriously. By the end (outrageous and close to immoral), not a single character is who you thought they were, most of them having every last bit of decency wrung out of them. Easily knocked off in one sitting, &quot;The Inheritance&quot; is recommended only for those who like trying to outguess the writer at his own tricks."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I read this book in a matter of 2 days, which is good for me seeing how many books I have that have a bookmark somewhere in them where I either got bored or just quit reading. I thought the story moved well and you will get used to the fact that it's being told in first person. Don't worry, you find out who drowned the lady in the beginning and all the other questions you have throughout the book will be answered. I thought the last page of the book made the entire story. In fact, I covered it with a post-it so that the next person who borrowed it from me wouldn't cheat. I doubt it would make sense even if they did read it, but you never know. In fact, about 8 people have borrowed my now tattered book whose cover is long gone and all have loved it as much as I did and yes, the post-it note is still covering that last page and everyone agrees to just leaving it that way! ;)"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Former travel agent, Holly Smith has recently discovered that she is the heir to the Randall fortune. When she was a baby she was put up for adoption and now her grandfather wishes to leave all his fortune to her after his death. She is unaware of the circumstances of her adoption but once she comes to live at Randall House she will learn the truth. Holly's other relatives are not happy with her appearance since she now owns most of the Randall Estate. They want her dead and make it look like an accident in order to get their hands on the money.If you have not read any of Tom Savage's novels you are in for a treat. Things are not what they seem. This book has its requisite twist and turns with a surprise ending. Unfortunately most of his novels carry the same formula. If you have never read his novels you will enjoy this one, if you read him before the surprise will be lost on you."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This book was a great read!! It had twists and turns throughout with an ending that makes you reread the last chapter again. Savage did an excellent job of keeping the reader involved and tying up EVERY loose end. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who likes twists and surprise endings!!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I have been a fan of Tom Savage's since reading Valentine and couldn't wait to start this book. I thought the beginning was very well written, but this book lags in the middle. I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen, so why bother finishing it? I almost put it down but stuck with it and I'm glad I did!I never saw the end plot twist coming at all, I was SHOCKED when I read it! Let me just say this, no one is who they appear to be. My advice is, if you read this book, is stick with it through the middle part which is some what boring, the pay off is worth it in the end! Now that I've read all of Mr Savage's brilliant novels, I just hope he puts another one out soon!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"As one who has grown tired of the suspense/mystery genre, Tom Savage has rejuvenated me. Similar to Valentine's Day and the Precipice, the Inheritance is as page-turning as a Sidney Sheldon novel, but with twists that are not only believable, but mind boggling. Tom Savage, you da man!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Sometimes I listen to books that I won't read in print form. I had several audio books on request, but needed something on hand in case my sporadic insomnia came calling. So I browsed the shelves before I left work recently and came across this gothic novel. I haven't read gothic novels since I was a young teenager; I thought I'd revisit the genre.The plotline is quite simple. An adoptee learns that she is really an heiress and heads off to claim her fortune. When she arrives at the stately mansion in Connecticut that is her newly inherited home, she discovers quite a cast of characters. There's the gorgeous chauffer who chases rich women, the chauffer's mentally ill sister who repeatedly buries a baby doll, the sickly sweet but secretly sinister aunt and uncle, the silent boy and his dog who wander the grounds and the physically deformed chess player who never comes out of his room.But not everything is quite as it seems.While most of the book is mildly entertaining, the last few chapters will make you feel like you've just seen a horrific accident. If you listen to the audio book in the wee hours of the morning, don't plan on going to sleep during the final cassette."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Tom Savage has become my new favorite author. I just wish he'd come out with a new one soon! Inheritance was a nice, easy read until you got to Chapter 13. If you can't dedicate yourself to finishing the book once you reach Chapter 13, put it down until you can. There was one shock after another. My husband thought I was having heart problems because I kept gasping!! Make sure to read the rest of his book; they are just as suspenseful!! Please, Tom, come out with another one soon!!!!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Savage is the master of the twisting thriller and this shocker is one of the reasons why.When Holly Smith finds out she is a inheritor of the vast Randall estate and must live with her new family she enters a web of murder and betrayal where nothing is at it seems.This chilling novel of murder, greed and betrayal will keep you guessing and shocked with it's sinister atmosphere,fiendish plot twists that don't end till the final page!A true Gothic chiller that you will never forget. Hitchcock would had been proud to film this novel."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I found the novel a bit dis-jointed at the beginning. Perhaps it was just me. I had trouble figuring out how the characters were related to one another. But as the novel progressed, those relationships became clearer.I found the novel to be fairly fast-paced and not prone to getting bogged down in unessential details. A few unexpected twist and the surprise ending clerarly tells me that I would do it again (read) with this author."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I have to agree with some of the other Amazon reviewers that the writing style of this book is ameteurish: flat, stilted, one-dimensional. At first, I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and assumed that he was parodying Gothic conventions, both in plot contrivances and in style. But, no, I think the writing is just bad. However, it is a fast, easy read and I guess I'm glad I finished the book. The twist ending(s) almost made it worthwhile. A young struggling woman inherits a house and a fortune, out of the blue, and her life changes instantly. Some characters are out to get the inheritance for themselves, others want to help the young woman, and figuring out who's who provides a few minutes of pleasure. The characters and the set-up have promise, but the shoddy writing throws away any good will the reader builds up toward the author. As noted above, there are a couple of mighty big twists at the end, and they do give you an interesting outlook on what you've been reading, but it's not really enough to redeem all those pages of poor prose style and cardboard characters."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"The characters and plot of this book are so contrived it was difficult for me to finish it (fortunately it is fairly short). The ending truly is surprising, but so much so that it is unsatisfying. There was a very little bit of foreshadowing, but not enough to give the reader any clue as to what was coming. It would have been far more satisfying if there had been a hint that something was amiss. At least that would have kept the reader guessing."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Each of the characters are not developed fully, bythe end, you are disappointed in all the characters. Holly'scharacter is hard to buy by the end of the book as well as not believable. Without giving to much away, you could almost connect with Toby except for his behavior towards his mother was ridiculous. And the last page especially didn't make sense, why would Holly act that way, they explain her reason for action, but even if it would have worked, she still would not have gotten what she wanted."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I read the first 150 pages of this worthless novel and decided to stop. I have better stuff to do than read boring novels. I can almost always tell from the start if books are going to be good. This one started out real lame. Holly Smith/Randall or whatever her name is, discovers she is adopted and then she gets a phone call from her real great aunt. Then the aunt is later killed and Holly comes running to the family's house. She does not get along with a lot of the family members. She feels that the housekeepers son is strange and so on. I feel like I need some ALEGRE! BUT... I loved Tom Savage's novel &quot;VALENTINE,&quot; that was a great novel believe it or not. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; is NOT!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Ignore all the blurbs, this is an overwritten piece of Grade Z hokum that reads like a first novel by a not-so-gifted amateur who doesn't understand the difference between building suspense and padding."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},P={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",R,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",P,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-843a18b6"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/10.md","filePath":"drive/10.md"}'),D={name:"drive/10.md"},j=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
