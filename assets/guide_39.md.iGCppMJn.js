He was well respected and reviewed in his time, but he never had that huge breakthrough novel and, perhaps when public opinion was best poised to embrace him, he published \\"Now Playing at Canterbury,\\" not an especially good book. Most, if not all, of his novels are out of print today, but they are not especially hard to find and, certainly in this case, well worth it.This is one of my favorite novels. I have read it at least half a dozen times, and for quite awhile tended to pick it up every two or three years until my old paperback with the racy cover fell apart and I invested in a hardcover first edition.Confessions is a classic American coming of age novel set in the years leading up to and including WWII. We follow our hero Quince through adolescence, first love, work, college, New York, the war, to trying to find his way in American--damaged and disoriented--thereafter. The most remarkable things about the book are not the plotting--Bourjaily tells a decent story, but the novel is more picaresque than otherwise, and as much as I admire and enjoy him, there is often something vaguely dissatisfying at the close of his stories--perhaps because he refuses cheap or easy resolutions. No, the finest things in the book are Bourjaily's writing, the extent to which he is in touch with the America of his time that simply no longer exists, and his ability to write effective, evocative and memorable scenes. As to the first, Bourjaily is a master prose stylist. As proof, I would offer the introduction to this book: his discussion of the motivations of writing a \\"confession,\\" and the manner in which we perceive ourselves, always taller, shorter, more or less handsome, wittier or duller than we ever really are. His prose is sometimes reminiscent of Fitzgerald. Although a little less studied, it is often beautiful. As to Bourjaily's America, he makes us feel Quince's experience as a kid finding hard work for the first time in the country, falling in love, meeting \\"Cowboy,\\" a worn out, dying relic of another time, going off to college as the outsider and falling in with Central Park Wes (a fine character), finding almost accidental success writing ad copy in New York, and then going off to war. We really get the feel of growing up in America between the wars. As to the \\"scenic\\" in Bourjaily, there are many unforgettable episodes--the scene with cowboy and two girls in a motel, the \\"smoker,\\" the girl he leaves behind to go to war only to find later that she was rather more friendly than he might have hoped with many men, including a friend who can tell him only that she was so beautiful and so easy, well, what else was there to do? Quince's parting from the girl is simple, inevitable and touching.This may not be THE great American novel (although I think a case could be made) but, if not, it is still a very very good one. It is sensitive, perceptive, evocative, a bit nostalgic, and beautifully written. It would be a shame for a writer as good as Bourjaily to be lost. This novel at least deserves to survive. If you have the chance, at least read Bourjaily's introduction. If it catches you, you may have found a book that you will return to."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spent Youth","review":"Confessions of a Spent Youth is bold. Unafraid of the warped, pre-p.c. agendas of the 1950's-60's, it is an honest tale of a young man peering through the mask of hormones, war, death, sex, and the constant inhaling of random drugs and liquors. Riding with Quincy is an adventure.Probably the most memorable aspect of the book is the boyish way it is written. He's curious in his egotism, shocking in his innocence. He doesn't try to grab your collar and make you feel some fake emotion that's more outrage than empathy.He's real.Yes - this book is... good."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The book is not as dynamic and fascinating as the last book of the trilogy but nevertheless extremely interesting and quite comprehensive. Pretty much all imaginable sides of life in Germany under matured Third Reich are dissected in variety of ways and exposed under different angles of view. Author does his best to stay impartial in his narrative although it is clear that it is not that easy for him to do. Third Reich political system is shown as a tough regime that grows more and more radical, slipping to extreme brutalization towards its own citizens and, eventually, to war.There are many aspects of that epoch that are relatively well known. Persecution of certain minorities as well as such large scale actions as Night of the Long Knives or Night of Broken Glass would sound familiar (even if vaguely) to many. But Mr. Evans goes much further - he explores less known corners of life then - artistic and literary life, education (both higher and regular), religion and economy. It gets clear that hardly anything was left untouched - even such seemingly other-worldly spheres as mathematics experienced intrusion. Mr. Evans writes that there was an attempt to create some true \\"German mathematics\\", which stressed geometry rather than algebra. Somehow geometry, he writes (page 309), \\"was supposedly more closely related to the ideal human form as expressed in the Aryan racial type\\". It is not that easy to see how mathematical disciplines other that geometry can be less (or more) related to that ideal, moreover geometry itself (except for maybe elementary one) deals with matters that are so far away from human form in its level of abstraction that it may be possible that whoever was trying to reshape mathematics under Third Reich did not have mathematical education. Another aspect of that reshaping was so-called Aryanization - that phenomenon took place everywhere, but especially in education and economy. Quite eloquent testimony of consequences of that phenomenon at one of the best in the world research facilities can be seen in the dialog between David Hilbert, prominent German mathematician, and Bernhard Rust, Nazi Minister of Education sometime in 1934. Rust asked, \\"How is mathematics in G&ouml;ttingen now that it has been freed of the Jewish influence?\\" Hilbert replied, \\"Mathematics in G&ouml;ttingen? There is really none any more.\\" (quoted from Wikipedia).Interestingly enough, some consumer brands well known today, as Mr. Evans shows, have stamp of Aryanization in their history, namely cosmetic products of Nivea and shoes Salamander. Story of Voklswagen is more complex. Reportedly Adolf Hitler was involved personally in design of a certain model as the book says. What really surprised me is that Volkswagen was in fact available to German consumers and many did own it in 1930s. Viktor Klemperer, whose diaries are frequently quoted across the book, had one and had driven often German famous autobahns in it.Overall though, the book is not a happy reading. All social innovations by the regime, introduced by Nazi ideology, made lives of many either hard or unbelievably hard with great deal plunged into destitution, forced to flee the country or perished in concentration camps, prisons, or series of pogroms. Each time I look at my neighbor's Golf, I can't help but think about Viktor Klemperer and his rides in his Volkswagen across German countryside shortly before racial policies culminated in Nuremberg Laws that shuttered his life so completely. Mr. Evans' book does a good job in description of that era and generating reflection but one question after the book is finished is left unanswered in its entirety - what should be done to prevent repetition of that episode of the human history? Chances are many readers will formulate that question for themselves and it is very probable that the answer is a very complex one."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"In the second part of the said three volume history of the Third Reich, Mr. Richard Evans enters the territory of William L. Shirer. He joins a rather august group of chronicilers of the subject of the Third Reich in the English language.I'll make this review short and sweet. Mr. Evans explains the complete mindset of Adolph Hitler.1. The progressive Jewish genocide pogroms.2. The complete change of Art culture according to the tastes of Adolph Hitler.3. The complete ruin of intellectual activities in all German pedagogical institutions.In short a Germany as seen through the eyes of a Madman. In this study we also see Adolph Hitler's seduction of the Prussian military elite. The bully conquering of the Sudentenland, Czecho-Slovakia and Austria. As Winston Churchill noted this was \\"The Gathering Storm\\".I highly recommend this book as a popular historical masterpiece. Read it and learn! I'm looking forward to Mr. Evans take of the Second World War in Europe."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is the second of three volumes of what is shaping up to be the definitive history of the Third Reich. In the first volume, \\"The Coming of the Third Reich,\\" (also reviewed on Amazon) the author, a distinguished Cambridge University historian, artfully explained how the Nazis rose from a humble position (to say the least) to grab control of Germany. This volume focuses upon the period between the acquisition of power and the launching of the Second World War, which is the subject of the concluding volume yet to come. The central theme of this volume is how the Nazis consolidated their power and exerted control throughout Germany from roughly 1933 until 1939 and the invasion of Poland. Topics include the creation of the \\"police state\\"; exerting domination over public discussion and publications, including the press; and the struggle with the Catholic church and exercising control over religious institutions. A most interesting chapter deals with \\"prosperity and plunder,\\" which reflects some recent research arguing that the financial dimensions of Nazism (including confiscation of Jewish property) effectively induced mass support by providing financial goodies to the population. Whether the Nazis delivered on their promises to the middle and lower classes is the topic of another section of the book. The goal of attaining a \\"racial utopia\\" by means of sterilization, driving Jewish people out of the country, and the early beginnings of concentration camps is also discussed. The final section deals with the movement toward war, including recovery of the Sudetenland, the murder of Czechslovakia, and the development of German military power despite the ineffectual limitations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.As usual, the author is extremely thorough in his research and narrative. I know some critics believe he goes into too much depth, but one is free to skim the sections that do not interest the reader. At 800 pages, including extensive notes, this is a big book--but indeed so is the topic. One feature that appears in this volume is that Evans focuses upon some individuals in his narrative and shows the impact of Nazi power upon them and their reactions. These include one of the most important sources for understanding this period from the perspective of a single oppressed individual, the diaries of Victor Klemperer (also reviewed on Amazon). It is simply engrossing to see how the Nazis managed to exert control over virtually every institution and group in Germany through quite masterful manipulation. Simply the superior available source on this topic."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This book is the second in a planned three book series about the Nazis, and it covers the time period from Hitler's ascension to office and the invasion of Poland. In a very lucid fashion, the author explains how the Nazis in power changed the face of Germany. We are given culture, arts, politics, religion, the family, and other subjects, and can readily observe how Germany was transformed, for the worse, by the Nazi party. It is a chilling tale of a people that allowed themselves to be seduced by propaganda, and even though the book shows that not eveyone was happy with the government, things just went along because Hitler appeared to be able to accomplish almost anything he wished. Once again, we see how the reluctance of the Western countries enabled him to accomplish what should not have been possible. It's a morality tale for our time, because it seems that now most of the world justs sits by while Iran works on a nuclear option, and hopes that things will just turn out all right in the end. Reluctance to confront evil is no option any more, as this book very well shows."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Again, to all who loves WWII history, a book that must be in collection.

The author shows how Hitler manipulated the system, seizing power in an ever widening grasp. He then began to infiltrate and subvert every aspect of German society. Propaganda stepped up. Government from local neighborhood groups to the top of the Reich heap were controlled and monitored. Hitler's feared henchmen were the Brownshirts and the SS. At first, the Brownshirts under Roehm were far more powerful and threatening than the SS. But fearing Ernest Roehm's ambitions, Hitler and Himmler waylaid him to consolidate their hold on power. Throughout this period, both groups used terror against political opponents and then the Jews. Hitler's focus was war - pure and simple - girding the Germanic nation for the future onslaught against the world.

We know about Hitler and his squalid band of psychopaths and how their crimes haunt our consciousness to this day. What I didn't appreciate until I read this book was how thoroughly and quickly Hitler's vision permeated all aspects of life in the Third Reich.The populist appeal to the small merchant led to a campaign against department stores that initially restricted their scope (in-store restaurants banned, for example). This was not a town council passing an ordinance; this was set out at the highest level of the government upon the Nazis taking power.Hitler's struggles as an artist instilled a distaste for any sort of Modern Art. Artists who produced work satisfactory to the regime were lionized; galleries that displayed modernist art were closed and offending works were seized and sold abroad. A \\"Law for the Confiscation of the Products of Degenerate Art\\" was promulgated.It was thus not a big leap to coerce the population into behavior consistent with the Nazi worldview in matters of procreation, worship and basic human rights.These efforts to transform the mindset of the people met with mixed success but why it was able to even attempt these intrusions continues to baffle us. How thoroughly worn down could the people have been following Versailles and the Weimar Republic? And of course, how would I have reacted in these circumstances? This is what I found fascinating in reading this book."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"What an achievement. One of the pre-eminent Third Reich scholars teaching today has written an incredible synthesis. (The bibliography is 74-pages long and includes about a dozen of his own books!) In seven sections, covering everything from the economy to racial policy to education to militarization, Evans takes us from 1933, when Hitler became chancellor, to 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. (The third book, THE THIRD REICH AT WAR, takes it from there.) Extremely well-written and easy to read -- though I did pause at the end of each section to either read a few magazines or another book (a sort of palate cleanser), which greatly increased the odds that I would finish this 700-page tome."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"So I've now waded through all three volumes: The Coming of the third Reich; Third Reich in Power, Third Reich at war. Yep, as my husband has gently reminded me, there is such a thing as going into \\"too much detail\\". However, I started with Shirers's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Riech\\" then \\"Bonhoeffer\\" by Metaxas followed by \\"In the Garden of Beasts\\" by Larson and that led me to these tomes. Really challenging for me to wade through them but also vitally important for one as shamefully ignorant as I to understand not only the horrors perpetrated by the Nationalist plague that became the Third Riech but how exactly they came to be in power to begin this horrific period in our history. These works are strictly historical. Shire's is more subjective (and therefore more appealing and easier to read in my opinion). Leisure reading this is not, but vitally important to all of us who understand the importance of this quote \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\""},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Perhaps the most brilliant aspect of this series is how the 3 volumes (one still coming) are divided up. Volume 1 is a highly readable and thorough account of how the Nazis came to control Germany. It can be read completely standalone as either a pure history of the times or as a cautionary tale of how a democracy can fail. Volume 3 is to cover the war, and I suspect again it will largely stand on its own given how many other books have already been written about that period of German history.The period covered by this book, Volume 2, is also self-contained: defined by the period after the Nazis seized power but before the arrival of war swept away most other considerations. Of the three, I think this is the period that is the least well-covered...perhaps in many ways it is the least dramatic. Most histories tend to be divided up more into \\"before the war\\" and \\"the war\\" with the bulk of the first part covering the rise of the Nazis and treating their time in power as merely prelude to the war itself.Evans covers the usual topics from this period with suitable detail and emphasis: the persecution of the Jews, the night of long knives and destruction of the SA, the union with Austria and the final stages of the pre-war period in the confrontations with and over Czechoslovakia and Poland. But these topics have been covered elsewhere. For example Donald Cameron Watt's \\"How War Came\\" covers the Czech and Polish situations in a more traditional way, as diplomatic history from the points of views of all the players (and arguably in a more readable fashion). Evans in contrast writes from a very German-centric view, which is a nice departure from the norm (at least of books available in English) but can occasionally leave one with a lack of perspective.What sets \\"The Third Reich in Power\\" apart from previous works is the detailed attention to the social and economic consequences of Nazi policies on German life: from religion (the Nazis tried to establish their own form of Christianity, even proposing dropping the Old Testament from the canon), to education (at all levels, Evans goes into depth on the Nazi Youth, the University system, the various education initiatives), to population policy, to women's rights, to industry and the relationship between business and the Nazi party. The word that comes to mind over and over is \\"detail\\". This book is enormously detailed.If there is controversy about this work, it will center around the author's stance toward whether the German people supported the actions of the Nazis or not, in particular as regards to anti-semitism. Evans clearly does not subscribe to the \\"German people as first victims of Hitler\\" theory, but I think he has drawn back from the \\"German people fully cooperated with the Nazis\\" thesis that has received so much attention the past decade or so. He never comes down strongly on one side or the other, and at times even seems to contradict himself. This is probably inevitable in a work of this depth, as these situations are complex and he presents much contradictory evidence: people who supported the Nazis in some areas or at some times and fought them or ignored them at others. But it does not make for as exciting writing as some of the more opinionated works.In the end, it is the amount of detail that will make this book indispensible, but may be a barrier to its readability. I'm not qualified to rate the book on its historiography, but I would certainly give it 5 stars on the amount of data and research presented. However, for the non-professional it may become overwhelming. Your own tolerance for dry detail (I would classify the book as \\"engaging academic\\" or \\"dry popular\\") should determine if you want to read this book."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Evan's \\"Third Reich in Power\\" falls just short of being a great book. I would rate it a \\"9\\" if Amazon had a ten-point rating system. Evans concentrates on the period between the elevation of Hitler to the chancellorship and the German invasion of Poland in 1939. Evans uses what might be called the \\"mosiac\\" method. He examines most of the essential features in which Nazism attempted to regulate and direct the lives of the German people, and does so in succcessive chapters. This is an interesting approach -- rather unusual for contemporary history --, and is reminiscent of that taken in, say, Cambridge's Ancient History and Medieval History series. No \\"grant theses\\" emerge, but several themes suggest themselves.First, Evans demonstrates that the German people were extremely ambivalent about the Nazi regime. On the one hand, most Germans genuinely idolized Hitler. On the other hand, they were deeply distrustful of his underlings, and of many things the government was doing to the economy and to national welfare. The picture that emerges is of a people disturbed by the quotidien aspects of Nazi rule -- censorship, police surveillance, low wage rates, labor restrictions, etc. -- but sufficiently sympathetic with the broader aims of the regime to make tolerance for the disagreeable aspects possible. The picture of the German people which emerges is rather unflattering: it was distrustful of the disorder occasioned by the regime's extreme anti-semitism, but disliked Jews and was more than happy to profit from their suppression. It was suspicious of militarism and the march toward war, but happy about the economic recovery rearmament enabled (as long was the eventual war was fought by somebody else). It was unhappy about the restrictions on art, culture and education, but shared the prejudices against modernist tendencies and agaisnt the educated elite which caused most people to shed few tears when the Nazis systematically dismantled Germany's high culture. Above all, Evans paints a picture of a people very queasy about what was happening, but unwilling to do much to save anybody else from the clutches of the Nazis. The Germans were not so much Hitler's willing executioners as Htiler's self-absorbed bystanders.Second, Evans attempts to paint a picture of the Nazi regime as an attempt to completely mobilize and structure the way society thought and behaved. Evans emphasizes the role of terror and coercion, implicitly disagreeing with other historians who emphasize the small size of the Nazi policing appartus when compared with, e.g., the Soviet Union. He also focuses on something which has received relatively little attention -- the \\"dumming down\\" of German society. While Evans notes that the Nazi efforts to change the nature of the German educational system -- particularly its system of higher education -- met with mixed results, his claim that the quallity of the product of that system had dropped considerably by 1939 is compelling. One wonders how the Germans managed to be as successful in World War II as they were; it probably did as well as it did principally to the extent that its efforts to totally transform society were unsuccessful.Finally, Evans confronts and sheds light on a very important issue. Nazi \\"philosophy\\" was, in important way, incoherent. It idealized men who were at once, aggressive, bullying, Darwinian, anti-intellectual, athletic, competitive and warlike, while at the same time obedient, self-sacrificing, other-directed, altruistic, idealistic and dedicated completely to the common \\"good\\" (as defined by the Nazis). It is very difficult to create a docile thug. The Nazis were as successful as they were in this endeavor by separating the thugs (who were allowed to do just about anything, as long as they did not threaten the regime) from the sheep (who, if obdient -- and Aryan-- were largley immune from thuggery by a sort of protection racket).Evans paints a compelling picture of a society whose contradictions were bound to result in fatal instabilities in the absence of an every-victorious state of war. It is also a picture of a regime whose very commitment to physical and intellectual brutality would eventually make it impossible to quit while it was ahead."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"It would be difficult to add anything new to the many excellent reviews of \\"The Third Reich in Power\\" that are already posted here. But I must briefly echo the praises for this monumental work. It should be required reading for all conscientious citizens, and especially for all politicians, as a cautionary tale of how governments that operate without \\"checks and balances\\" can destroy the very societies that put them in power.The detailed story of how the Nazi leaders of the Third Reich transformed Germany between their assumption of power in 1933 and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 is compelling reading of the highest standard. During that period, the Nazis by decree imposed their political, economic and racial agendas on virtually every aspect of German society--literature, art, music, education, broadcasting, retail sales, land ownership, architecture, banking, recreation, law enforcement, etc. The Nazi's programs affected the everyday lives of EVERY German citizen to a greater or lesser degree.Mr. Evans' readable, matter-of-fact style, and his reliance on supporting data and statistics from the historical record, make \\"The Third Reich in Power\\" perhaps the most valuable work yet written on the subject. While its 700+ pages may at first seem daunting, it is well worth the effort to read. You will definitely come away from the experience with a better understanding of how prejudice, inflexibility, demagoguery and unrestrained nationalism inexorably led to World War II, and of the threat that such attitudes continue to pose to the world today. I give it the highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Do you like your history light or full-strength with nothing taken out? If you want to skim through yet another book about the Nazis that tells you something you probably already knew but in a different way then don't bother with this book. However, if you want to read first class, detailed historical writing then this is certainly the book for you. Evans makes 1930s Germany come alive. How does he do it? By using historical records and documents to recount incidents involving \`ordinary' people. He recalls appalling things that happened to people no different to his readers. He recounts cases of \`ordinary' people doing unspeakable things to their fellow Germans. The reader is brought back 70 years and is really made to feel (as much as is possible now) what it must have been like to live in an all-embracing dictatorship. The author forces you to ask yourself the uncomfortable question, \\"Would I have behaved differently\\"? You'll have guessed by now that this book does not make for easy reading. This is exactly the way it should be. You probably won't pack this book the next time you're going on a sun holiday. However, if you want to read a book that actually tells you something new then this is the book for you. Evans makes no concessions to readers who don't like too much, \`boring' details and who are only interested in the \`big picture'. This book describes in detail how the Nazis mercilessly quashed all opposition, controlled every element of German society, remilitarised at breakneck speed and remorsely drove Germany into a second world war.

The first book,The Coming of the Third Reich, narrated German history since Bismarck, explaining how the various elements of what we know as Nazism grew during the 19th century, intensified as a result of Germany's defeat during the Great War, and then rose to power following the Great Depression and the inept political leadership of both the traditional right and left.\\"The Third Reich in Power\\" picks up where the previous volume has left. Hitler's regime is now in power, but it is not in control. Even at their prime, the Nazis never won a majority of the popular vote. Most Germans had at best a partial allegiance of the regime, undermined (at least in Nazi eyes) by their association with the Churches or the trade unions. Although competing political parties where quickly outlawed, the former Social Democrats and Communists were no fans of the regime, and the Conservative circle around President Hindenburg had allowed Hitler to assume the chancellery of Germany, but had expected full well to remain in control. Pockets of -potential- resistance existed in the Universities and the armed forces, and even inside the Nazi Sturmabteilung (better known as the SA). And of course, there were the Jews, the mythical, eternal enemies.Most of the volume details how the Nazi state dealt with the challenges of winning over the German population. The means included propaganda, control of the media, Arts and Press, Nazified education system, popular programs of Social redistribution such as Strength Through Joy, a program offering subsidized cultural and social events for the people, an economic recovery and the prestige won through the regime's foreign policy triumphs. But they also included darker means - concentration camps and secret police, military purges, racial laws and even Pogroms.Evans divides his book to theme based chapters, one for the Arts and the Press, one for Religion and Education, and one each exploring the Police State, the Economy, the Racial Laws, and Foreign Policy. As in his previous volumes, Evans manages to 'hit' all the best known items in the Third Reich. So we encounter Leni Riefenstahl directing \\"The Triumph of the Will\\", Eichmann directing the Aryanization of Jews, The Catholic Anti-Nazi encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge, and Martin Neimuller's poem \\"First they came...\\"Evan's narrative is best when he manages to demonstrate the effects the Nazi regime had over the lives of simple people. The travails of best selling author Rudolf Ditzen, for example, are page turning, and demonstrate the difficulty of living under Germany's dictatorship even if one was neither a political opponent nor a handicapped nor a Jew (pp. 149-152).As in the previous volume, Evans's thoroughness as a researcher is sometimes at odds with his Powers as story teller, and we are sometimes subjected to fatiguing details of disciplines in Nazi Prisons or Bureaucratic infighting. Furthermore, some of the best parts are narratives from fairly well known German diarists, such as Jewish Literature Professor Victor Klemperer and League of German Girls activist Melita Maschmann.Unfortunately, in my view, Evans mostly spares the reader the details of scholarship controversy. Only the footnotes contain hints of controversy regarding Nazi influence in Universities, the Fuhrer's involvement in the regime, and the Nazi's status as \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\". The most interesting question of the Nazi economic recovery, whether or not the Nazis pursued a progressive Keynesian recovery program, is hinted to but not developed enough.The major insight I gained from \\"The Third Reich in Power\\" was the centrality of Hitler's projected eventual European War on the Third Reich. Everything in Nazi Germany was subordinate to the needs of Rearmament, and Hitler risked endangering the economic recovery and the quest for Autarky, and even the pace of the Anti-Jewish persecution, in order to achieve readiness.And the War Came... the culmination of the Nazi Project, the fight for Lebensraum and eventual world domination, occurred when Britain had finally abandoned its policy of Appeasement and declared War on Germany, following Hitler's invasion of Poland. Although the German people were far from enthusiastic about the War, they had followed their leader, and they had now answered to his call. Everything the Nazi Regime had worked for was set to come during the War: the Solution of the Nation's perceived need for Space and Resources, the regaining of the lost position of Germany as the World Leader, and the solution, as last final, the Jewish Problem. But Evans's account stops now, and we must patiently wait for his last volume, \\"The Third Reich at War\\""},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is the second volume of a 3 volume history of the Third Reich. As with the first volume, this is a substantial work of synthesis of the enormous literature about the Third Reich. Evans has aimed at producing a work that can be read usefully by scholars and by the general reading public. Evans has largely succeeded by producing a massively documented and very well written book. Evans has also made the book more accessible by avoiding a strictly chronological approach. He covers a series of topics related to the social and economic history of the Reich and concludes with foreign policy and the outbreak of war. Reflecting his prior research interests, the sections on the social history and structure of the Third Reich are excellent. The final section, covering foreign policy and diplomacy, is less thorough, though this is a twice told tale. Several unifying features emerge. One is the Nazi intent to reshape German, indeed European, society along the lines envisioned by their peculiar Social Darwinist ideals. The second is the success of the Nazi state in 'coordinating' almost all the institutions of German life with their ideology. A third is the primacy of Hitler's decisions. A final is the obsessive goal of an aggressive war to conquer Eastern Europe, which often distorted other Nazi social and economic policies. On completion, this trilogy will be a standard reference work for this period."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The Coming of the Third Reich is British historian Richard J.Evans monumental work on the Nazis seizure of power. In this second book he surveys the governance of Gemany and in his projected volume 3 the tale will be told of their downfall in World War II.In this book \\"The Thiird Reich in Power\\" the focus is on how the Nazis and the evil Adolf Hitler ruled Germany from his takeover in JANUARY 1933 to the outbreak of World War IIlaunching the horrific war which would claim over 50 million human souls.Evans portrays what life is like under a cruel dictatorship.He explores every aspect of German life in the 1930s includingeconomics; the arts; the horrible racial laws; jurisprudence;military preparation for the planned war; diplomacy;sports; the regimentation of society beginning in youth and many other topics.Evans is an academic whose prose is easy to read and comprehend. This book would be well used in a class on Nazi Germany. Along with Ian Kershaws two volumes on HITLER and Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'I consider Evanscontributions to understanding the Third Reich to be essentialreading for this terrible time in human history.Excellent! I look forward to his third volume with eageranticipation."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Continuing with the second volume of what is undoubtedly destined to be an epic work for both historians and the general public alike, Richard J. Evans explains how Hitler transformed--or attempted to transform--Germany after seizing control.This work differs from predecessors because it challenges the idea that the German people were mindlessly accepting of Hitler's policies. He points out that when the Nazi regime began, both the communists and social democrats had received a third of the vote in the national elections of that year. More however, he argues that a majority of the German people themselves were reluctant to enter into another war--correctly believing that it would not end in their favor. Infighting allowed the Nazi's to go ahead with their own plans. Partisan gridlock and the public's weariness of this coupled with a desire for 'anybody' to do 'anything' to end it and promises of economic rejuvenation gave the Nazi's an opening. And they exploited it.The Nazi's established a police state and warned citizens that their every word was being watched. The Nazi leadership was so determined to control the people that they even tried to dictate personal grooming and consumer products. Yet, Evans provides lots of documented information that this part of the plan was not as successful. People (including those who were members of the Nazi party) were resisting. Constant political proselytizing by the government actually turned many 'every day' Germans off.He includes several chapters on the Nazi persecution of the Jews and the German people's failure to help resist this persecution. What could have deflated his own thesis works here because Evans uses primary source reports of the people who were there and did nothing. Evans explains how the Gestapo, the Nazi's infamous police, was not composed of party elite. The majority actually were career policeman. They were everyday Germans who were enforcing compliance with a state ideology their neighbors etc...did not particularly care for.Because this era already had many books previously written about it, I was amazed by the wealth of information and original research contained within this one volume. Evans's research illustrates what happens to public and private life when a fascist government assumes power and promises to make everything better."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The first two voumes of Evan's masterful study of the Third Reich is essential reading for anyone who wants an up-to-date scholarly study of the period. His use of the sources is impressive indeed. Even with the eventual publication of Volume 3, Evan's work, however, still cannot be called \\"definitive,\\" as ongoing research will continue to unfold the events and circumstances of the Nazi period. (Then again. can there ever be a truly \\"definitive\\" work of history?) Still, Evan's study, along with William Shirer's Berlin Diary (for a sense of immediacy) and the classic Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (still not oudated), and Ian Kershaw's epic two-volume biography of Adolf Hitler taken together will bring us as close as we can get for now to a full understanding of Nazi Germany. These are no small accomplishments."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Evans does another masterful job in presenting the history of the Third Reich. This books tracks the ways in which the Nazi's shored up their power domestically and the mobilization towards war. The end of the book does cover some of the foreign policy considerations but as always it is the domestic scene where the research really shines. From looking at the anti-Semitism to the centralization of police there is a voluminous amount of information here. The book is very well written and if there is any fault it is that you get almost too bogged down in the information. If you are just starting to look at the Nazi regime a classical book such as William Shrier's might serve you better but for those who really want to understand how the Nazi's transformed Germany this cannot be beat."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Professor Evans is writing a comprehensive three-volume history of Hitler's Germany, with this the middle book. The scope of the undertaking is daunting to the casual reader, with many topics taken to extreme lengths. For example, how average German citizens were organized for holidays and relaxation in the 1930s takes up many pages. However, a good book for the person with keen interest in the political, economic and social life of Germany in the critical years preceding WW II.While the author is sympathetic to the average German of the period, I still think responsibility lies with all those millions who blindly--or with eyes wide open--followed."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Why is the Kindle version more expensive than the paperback? This makes no sense when one considers that it is much more costly to print a book on paper. I refuse to buy this book until the Kindle price is lowered."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is a detailed and sociological analysis of Hitler and the Nazi regime's years in power prior to the outbreak of war in 1939.The author pursues various themes: Germany as a police state, the suppression and take-over of all media, the struggle with the Churches, the appropriation of business and putting it on a war footing, the indoctrination and manipulation of the people (by the Hitler Youth, subsidized vacations...), the war against German Jews for the support of racial purification and finally the foreign achievements (the annexation of the Rhineland, Austria...)All this is approached from the internal German perspective; little is mentioned of Germany's traditional enemy France and all the foreign tensions Hitler created during this period. So do not look to this book for a broad European context.There were times where I felt that the author over-emphasized the coerciveness of the Nazi regime - as if Germans were forced into Nazism. So many photos and films with joyful flag-waving Germans (like on the cover of my paperback edition) illustrate the enthusiasm with which the German people revered their country and leader with little in the way of compulsion. Many followed him to the bitter end.There was a tendency through-out the book to quote those who dissented with Nazism, rather than those who loved it. The author cites examples coming from Social Democrats and/or Communists who were underground or in exile. Sometimes it is difficult to understand when these opinions were given - those after wars' end could possibly be discounted. He also excludes working class Germans from the evils of Nazism (on page 216 of my edition): \\"anti-Semitism had become widespread in German culture... though it never had much purchase in the organized working class\\". Was not the bulk of the SA from the working class? Who was the audience of Der Sturmer?Mr. Evans almost gives the impression at times that Nazi rule was merely tolerated - as if they converted Germans into automatons obeying commands. The enthusiasm with which the German people subjected entire parts of Europe and North Africa does not bear this out.Nevertheless the author is very thorough and scores points with how Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry reduced Germany's newspapers and radio to become mouthpieces of Nazism. There was little room after 1933 for \\"deviant\\" thought and expression. He is very correct in pointing out the raison d'etre of the regime was to prepare for war and subjugate Europe. Nazism constantly imbued the German people with their alleged racial superiority over all others. Mr. Evans discusses this racist nationalism towards the end of the book.He does provide many valuable details of Nazi methodology and how quickly all these came into play after the acquisition of power in 1933. I do not feel he answers all the questions (and perhaps no one can) of how Germany pursued war so vigorously and why they adored a leader who led them on such a disastrous path."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"\\"The Third Reich in Power\\" is the second book of a three volume history written by Richard J. Evans. It describes the growing breadth and reach of the Nazi Party into the politics, society and economy of Germany between the Summer of 1933 after the Nazis had neutralized most of their organized opposition to the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. Evans explores in detail the reach and effect of the programs initiated by the Nazi party within government, political organizations, the military, finance, industry, agriculture, labor, education, health, and other aspects of German life. Evans also describes the various tools and methods used by Hitler and the Nazis to maintain power through repression, to rearm Germany in preparation for war, and to pursue their program of racial purity and hygiene, particularly at the expense of Germany's Jewish population. Evans also describes for the reader a number of conflicts and contradictions in implementing the vision of German life imagined by many top Nazis. For example, identifying and establishing which Germans were Aryans and which were Jews, a top priority by Hitler and his top officials, turned out to be a much more complex problem than they originally imagined.Much of the material covered in this book can be found elsewhere within various publications. A pair of such examples are the venerable \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" by William Shirer describing the growing power of the Hitler and National Socialism during this period and the more recent \\"The Wages of Destruction\\" by Adam Tooze describing transformation of the German economy during the same period. However, Richard J. Evans does succeed in blending a large amount of knowledge concerning this period into a comprehensive overarching narrative. Although long, the book is quite readable and holds the reader's interest well.So if you are a reader of the history of the Second World War but feel a bit uninformed about Nazi Germany's prewar history, \\"The Third Reich in Power\\" would make a worthy addition to your library. If you find this book to your liking, this reviewer would also like to recommend that you read the author's other two volumes, \\"The Coming of the Third Reich\\" and \\"The Third Reich at War\\"."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This second volume of the definitive history of the Third Reich explores how the Nazis were able to transform the grudging plurality they won in 1933 into absolute rule. Evans dispenses with all the easy nonsense about Hitler being a special \\"evil genius\\" or about the Germans being uniquely suited to totalitarian rule. The story of the Third Reich, unfortunately, is the story of human nature. The fault is not in Hitler or in the German character, but in ourselves.Evans stresses the overwhelming support for discipline, authoritarian rule, and for a restoration of Germany to great nation status. The Nazis gained legitimacy by pursuing these policy goals. None of this meant that totalitarian evil, war, or the holocaust was inevitable. What should have happened is that some strong man would take charge and restore German power without attempting a revolution of German society and without plunging the world into a race war.But by pursuing these desired policies which we can at least understand, Hitler gained the legtimacy and prestige to pursue policies which baffle us and for which there was no consensus support in Germany: mobilization of society and economy for an inevitable world war; rejection of Judeo-Christian ethics for a new secular religion of Social Darwinism; and strangulation of the Jews. The truly depressing thing is how Hitler was able to wear down resistance and to gain acceptance of, if not overwhelming enthusiasm for, his more radical agenda. There is something about human nature that allows itself to be worn down; to adapt to the new reality dictated by the powers-that-be; and to convince oneself that the new order is an accomplished fact, can't be resisted, and is perhaps maybe for the best.Evans demonstrates the brute simplicity of Nazi ideology and consolidation of power. Every aspect of life is taken over piece by piece. Education becomes indoctrination and the Nazis reach over the heads of the parents to connect with the youth. Every block has a warden who snitches to the Nazis and makes sure everyone is politically correct -- imagine your own block and you'll see how effective this technique can be when the local busy body is empowered by the Gestapo.Evans explodes the myth of Nazi efficiency. The economy was a great bubble. Over the objections of his initial advisors, Hitler is simply printing money and over-stimulating the economy. But he doesn't care because he knows that if he goes to war and conquers, the bill will never have to be paid by Germans. There is no question that Hitler intended, pursued, and caused World War II. There was no way to avoid the war. It was what Hitler desired and what he pursued with single-mindedness for 6 years.The most sickening thing is how Hitler was able to exploit the worst in human nature in persuading Germans, bit by bit, to abandon all human sympathy for the Jews and to accept their fate as enemies of the Reich. Nothing in this is unique to Germans. This is what makes the history of the Third Reich so disturbing.This is a brilliant and depressing book."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is an excellent account of Germany in the years leading up to WWII. It should be read in conjunction with contemporary writings such as Nora Waln's \\"Reaching for the Stars\\" (still in print). The description of the unravelling of a (fairly) progressive, cultivated society into a barbaric dictatorship should be required reading for all young people who are impatient with progress in a democracy. It makes quite clear why WWII was necessary to rid the world of such a regime.The other two volumes in this history by Richard Evans should be read to complete the picture."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"To most people who follow the 20th century the ultimate history on the Third Reich was \\"the rise and fall of the Third Reich by William Schirer\\". This book is even better than that. Anyone with the slightest interest in the subject needs to read this book.All to often on TV and in books people cover the Germans only by covering the military or political events. Whereas that is a good way to cover time periods it isn't everything. Time periods then become just rare events in flashy scenes. People loose what was the event and how it affects the average person. That is the only way you can really understand how movements change people, nations, and cultures to do horrible things. These stories of what the Nazis did was engrossing and fascinating. It will capture you entirely.This book does that. Any reader will see that in this book. The author covers every imaginable aspect of German culture in the 30s from art, to music, to theater, to education, to home, to business, then to the usual politics. You can see how the Nazis used a mix of propaganda, extortion, violence and corruption of the law to do what they can do. That is how the land of the protestant reformation can launch the Holocaust. I don't know of any other book that will do that. This minute examination of Germany in the 30s in small detail can tell you how step by step the Nazis did what they did.I think now after you read this book you can see how what happened there could happen anywhere anytime. I think the average reader will start to see the potential of another Nazi like movement showing up today. If you want a comprehensive story of what happened this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"THE THIRD REICH IN POWER is the middle of historian Richard J. Evans' trilogy of life and politics under the Nazis (the first deals with their rise to power and the new final volume the experience of war). It is Evans' stated attempt to steer a middle course between dry and highly specialized academic texts on the one hand, and excessively popular (and increasingly outdated) works on the other, and in that it succeeds brilliantly IMHO. I have a major in German studies but was looking for social as well as political history and came away with enhanced knowledge of some aspects of Germany in the Thirties (the inexorable spread of anti-Semitism) and brand-new and fascinating knowledge of others (did you know Hitler had a hand in designing the Autobahns?).In fact, this book explicitly makes the day-to-day life of average Germans important; not mere nuggets but information and narrative that give the reader an excellent overview. For instance, one wide-ranging program, called \\"Kraft durch Freude\\" (Strength through Joy) did everything from build resort hotels and offer cheap rates to (Nazi-approved) groups, to opening up a lay-away program for the newly developed Volkswagen(a plan cut short by war).And speaking of war, it is impossible not to agree that Hitler started war planning from his first day in office. As medievalist-turned-mystery writer Dorothy Sayers once remarked, the only shock in his annexing the Sudentenland (Bohemia) and perpetuating even worse atrocities is not that Hitler didn't make it quite clear what he intended to do -- it's just that the western democracies chose not to believe him. I highly recommend THE THIRD REICH IN POWER. Whether you read it in hardcover or in paperback, you'll probably want to hang onto this work for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The Third Reich in Power by Richard J. Evans, the second volume of his three-volume work tracing the history of the Third Reich, is a powerfully written and eye-opening recounting of Hitler's Germany. It contains over seven hundred pages of text and leaves no detail uncovered, telling the story of the regime \\"from the moment when it completed its seizure of power in the summer of 1933 to the point when it plunged Europe into the Second World War at the beginning of September 1939.\\"To accomplish this, Evans employs a thematic approach, offering in each of seven chapters a mixture of narrative and analysis as he covers the chapter's topics chronologically within the chapter. Reading the book is like ascending a spiral staircase as Evans enlightens the reader about establishing the police state, mounting a propaganda campaign under Joseph Goebbels, dealing with religion and education, intervening in business and the economy with a \\"Four-Year Plan\\" headed by Herman G&ouml;ring, and building a nominally classless community, yet this equality of status proclaimed by the Nazis, the author points out, \\"did not imply equality of social position, income or wealth.\\" The most influential Nazi leaders lived like barons; the working people suffered through shortages and rationing.The two concluding chapters deal with two of the lynchpin concepts of Nazi policy. The first of these was the establishment of what Hitler saw as a \\"racial utopia\\" not only reducing government expenditures on \\"inferior and asocial individuals, the sick, the mentally deficient, the insane, cripples and criminals,\\" the Nazis would also employ a ruthless policy of \\"eradication and selection.\\" African-Germans, Gypsies, homosexuals, and, of course, Jews bore the brunt of this inhumane policy carried out through a series of laws regarding sterilization, marriage, employment, and citizenship. This legalized discrimination was designed \\"to purify the German race and render it fit for a war of world conquest.\\"The concluding chapter is called The Road to War, detailing Hitler's involvement in the Spanish Civil War and his \\"bloodless\\" conquests of Austria, Czechoslovakia, even parts of France and Poland in his insatiable quest for expansion, for \\"living space\\" for the German people.Reading such a thorough and voluminous work requires a certain stick-to-itiveness, but the reward is a deeper understanding of this crucial and troubling era of European history."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"In \\"The Third Reich in Power,\\" Richard Evans explores the mechanisms and methods by which a previously marginalized political movement came to dominate every aspect of German society, culture, and thought. The Nazis were not content with their police state -- they wanted to bore themselves into the German psyche and soul, and re-make it in their image. Evans makes a compelling argument that in some quarters the Nazis succeeded, but in most -- especially in the economy -- they fell dramatically short of their goals. Ironically, with the crushing of the left-wing (the Communists and the Social Democrats), the only resistance and thus the main resistance against the Nazis came from the conservatives, mainly the aristocrats and the Germany officer class (those who originally helped position Hitler into power), who now saw Hitler as a dangerous megalomaniac divorced from reality.Where the Nazis were most effective was in demolishing the Jewish identity and people, and in antagonizing the world to declare war against Germany. And Richard Evans argues that these two policies were the manifestation of the distinct personality of Adolf Hitler himself. But placing Germany's discrimination against the Jews and militant expansionism squarely on the shoulders of Hitler is a bit too much. A far more plausible explanation is that Hitler was himself a manifestation of the darkest corners of Germany's psyche and soul. German discrimination and hatred of the Jews is something that's been well-documented well before the rise of Hitler, and it's always been a German national obsession to create \\"living space\\" by effectively annexing all of Eastern Europe.What's odd about this book is that while Evans believes that the police state, authoritarian system, mismanagement of the economy, and militant expansionism all derive from Hitler himself we see very little of the Fuhrer in this book. In fact, when he does appear, he seems a mildly competent if grandly narcissistic political leader. Yes, he's loyal to those who are most loyal to him, but he's also concerned with competent management and balancing the power of Nazi factions. He has absolute power, but he still chooses a simple life (even his sex life is plebeian) to protect his image. Without a more full and detailed explanation of Hitler during the 1930s it's hard for us to readers to conclude that Hitler's individual influence over Germany was as great as the author argued.As a serious and academic treatise, this book is also long and ponderous, full of minute detail and covering every aspect of Germany under Nazism. The book is like a long mundane drive, and it can feel like drudgery at times to read this book. The best part of the book is towards the end when the author is discussing Germany's foreign policy, and the mendacious and short-sighted British and French reactions to Hitler's aggressions that would encourage Hitler to start World War II. There's also a couple of lines towards the end that made me laughed out loud:\\"The international furore that greeted the raid led the Germans and the Spanish Nationalists to deny any responsibility. For years afterwards it was claimed that the Basques had blown their own town up.\\""},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The Richard Evans Trilogy: The Coming of the Third Reich, the Third Reich in Power and the Third Reich at War is a series, with excruciating detail, that should not be missed by students of the WW II War with Germany."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The second book in Richard J. Evans' Third Reich trilogy, \\"The Third Reich in Power,\\" covers the life of Germany from 1933 through the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. Longer than its predecessor, and at times significantly drier, it nonetheless paints an intriguing portrait of daily life under the Third Reich. Most interesting are the descriptions of how the Reich was (as was not) able to leverage political and economic support from interests as varied as academia, labor, medicine, agriculture and manufacturing. The speed of the transformation of German society into a colossal war machine becomes comprehensible in large part because of the detail (often tiring in its ordinariness) assembled here.The benefit of hindsight allows for the characters in this story, including the most die hard Nazis, to display an amazing ability to simultaneously defy and conform to stereotypes. It is, in the end, not enough to vilify the top Nazi bureaucrats and summarily indict them for their crimes; the infrastructure of society as a whole - its politics, values, pressures - must be illuminated as well to create a truly meaningful understanding of the catastrophe of Nazism. This Evans accomplishes with great skill. I look forward to the final book in the series, \\"The Third Reich at War.\\""},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is an extraordinary book, in many ways the most important of Evans three-volume series. We know the results of the Nazi regime for all European peoples but those abstract lessons are easy to banalize for events that happened now so long ago. This book cures that as well as any I have read. It is a narrative history of those years but, more important than that, a detailed accounting of the radical nature of a regime, insanely dedicated to the intensively destructive effort to create a pure, master race. Hannah Arendt identified the regime (along with Stalin's Russia) as a totalitarian regime defined as those whose goals are beyond any utilitarian one and lead to a rush toward a system of total destruction. The earlier announced goal of recovering what had been lost as a result of the unfairness of Treaty of Versailles gave way to a plan to risk everything on a total war of destruction. Even the war did not satisfy the blood lust as illustrated by the use of immense resources for killing Jews and others as the the war was clearly being lost and resources were in extremely short supply on the eastern front. Evans details the nature of the Nazi state and shows that it was directed toward it goals for destruction from its beginnings in 1933. An essential work."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this volume is broken down into sections, each of which is devoted to one sector of German society during the years 1933-1939 (i.e.: the labor movement, the churches, education, the arts, etc.). The book does not, therefore, proceed in chronological order, but instead each section starts at 1933 and proceeds from there.This basic outlay of the book makes it difficult (almost impossible, actually - unless you have an incredible memory for all the details in the previous sections) to keep the broad picture in mind and relate what happened in one sector (i.e. the churches) to what was also happening in education or the arts at that same time. And, when one is trying to grasp how and why the National Socialists came to power, retained that power, and led the German nation into WWII, it is essential to relate each sector to the other as they moved through time. It WAS all related.An egregious example of this is the fact that, as we are reading about events taking place in any particular sector during 1936 (in the first 600 pages of the book), there is absolutely no mention made of the fact that 3,000 German troops marched into the Rhineland (demilitarized zone) in March of that year. Or when we read about events taking place during 1938, there is similarly no mention made of the Anschluss of Austria in March of that year.To make matters worse, in the course of any one section events are also not given in chronological order. As an example (Pg 383): \\"Even Hermann Goring was seen as late as 1936 paying a lengthy visit to Bernheimer's carpet store in Munich, which ended with the purchase of two carpets for the impressive sum of 36,000 Reichsmarks. The February sales at Sally Eichengrun's textile house in Munich in the same year were said by the local police to be attracting queues of customers. Both enterprises were Jewish-owned. The following year, the Security Service of the SS complained that - especially in Catholic areas - people were still ignoring the Party's exhortations not to buy from Jewish businesses. Nevertheless, Party activists were not deterred. Many of them were motivated by the personal desire to get rid of business rivals at a time when the consumer economy was in the doldrums. Violent boycott campaigns continued throughout 1934...\\"We were in 1936 and all of a sudden are back in 1934?!? But at least here there were specific years mentioned. At many points in the book I would be asking myself, \\"What year are we in?\\" and have to search back through pages to find out what year the events in question took place.Thus far I'm simply pointing out that the general lay-out of this book can be confusing and doesn't relate the important events of the 1933-1939 years with one another.But more importantly, I really question Mr. Evans' scholarship.Case in point (Pg 303): \\"After the first flush of enthusiasm, however, most of the special lecture courses on Nazi ideology were dropped from university teaching, and by the mid-1930s, fewer than 5 per cent of lectures at German universities were overtly Nazi in their title and contents.\\" Although this book has multitudinous end notes, there is no end note regarding this statement. It is, indeed, stated as fact, but how could one possibly know such a percentage? And it isn't something that one could verifiably research. First of all, it is doubtful that all of the professors of the time meticulously filed away all of their lecture outlines; secondly, even if every one of them did so (absurd to even contemplate), great numbers of such outlines would have been destroyed in the tremendous destruction that took place in Germany at the end of the war. Or are we supposed to believe that this figure came from the extant notes that students took at the lectures? This method would be just as unreliable and as the professor's outlines. Or was this figure culled from conversations w/ surviving professors and students from that time? If so, I ask, first of all, why wasn't this mentioned in an end note; and secondly, would the people who chanced to survive the war really be representational of the broad university populace (probably not, as the most ardent of the Nazis would probably have been the most likely to perish); and thirdly, isn't it likely that recollections regarding such matters would get whitewashed (intentionally or unintentionally)?Mr. Evans very frequently states percentages such as this throughout the entire volume, and this is one particular case in point where there is no scholarship to back up the statement.And how about this for scholarship (Pg 306): \\"Despite his Nobel Prize, Lenard was full of bitterness and resentment at being pipped to the post by his pupil Wilhelm Rontgen...\\" \\"Pipped to the post?!?\\" And this is supposed to be a scholarly compendium? Unfortunately, Mr. Evans chooses to express himself in British slang quite frequently throughout this volume, thereby giving his non-British English-reading public the task of translating his colloquialisms as best they can.Even worse is the statement on Pg 380: \\"Coming on top of a decline in sales that had begun already with the onset of the Depression in 1933, this got them into serious difficulties.\\" The \\"onset of the Depression in 1933?!?\\" It's widely chronicled that the Depression to which he's referring started with the stock market crash in the U.S. in 1929. This was reflected in German unemployment raising to extremely high levels:September 1928, 650,000 unemployed;September 1929, 1,320,000 unemployed;September 1930, 3,000,000 unemployed;September 1931, 4,350,000 unemployed;September 1932, 5,102,000 unemployed;January 1933, 6,100,000 unemployed.(see [...])So what does Mr. Evans mean, \\"the onset of the Depression\\" (and yes, it's Depression with a capital \\"D\\") in 1933?\\" Is this a typo? Does he mean that there was another sequence of events in 1933 that qualified to be labeled as \\"the Depression\\" (w/ a capital \\"D\\")?\\" Unlikely.So I ask you again. What kind of scholarship is this? (And what kind of editorial work by the publishing house?)Another example (Pg 401-2): \\"Hitler made generous subventions to a number of other aristocratic landowners to help them with their debts and keep them conspiring with the ex-Kaiser.\\" What?!? Hitler is giving aristocrats large sums of money to ENCOURAGE them to be \\"conspiring with the ex-Kaiser\\" (and overthrow him, Hitler)?? First of all, the statement goes against all logic, and secondly, it goes against everything I've read elsewhere about Hitler being very wary of the German aristocracy, and how he went out of his way to try to ensure their loyalty to him.Once again, I ask you, what kind of scholarship is this? (Or what kind of editorial work by the publishing house?)As a last example (Pg 576): \\"Heydrich's Security Service pointed out that it would be inadvisable for Berlin to go ahead on its own, even though fully a third of Germany's Jewish population now lived there; and in any case these measures were not linked to any coherent scheme of Jewish immigration. SO THEY WAS NOT ACTED UPON.\\" (Yes, that's the exact wording of that sentence.)When one encounters such an obvious lack of attention to detail with such an obvious lack of care taken in the compilation of the written text, and combines that with questionable scholarship, one must then start to question every statement and end note in the entirety of this three-volume set. How many more typos, mis-statements and poorly researched pronouncements are hidden throughout this book that we average readers (who are not experts in the field) would not realize were such?And mind you... the quotes above come from roughly 275 pages of text in a712-page book. Yes, I read the whole book. But after reading all the positive reviews about this book and strongly disagreeing with them, I only perused through about 275 pages to find examples of the types of things I remembered finding so questionable about the book.Personally, I find Joachim Fest's books about National Socialism and WWII to be much better written, grounded on much surer scholarship and far, far more insightful."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is the second volume (published in 2005) of Evans' trilogy. I read the first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich, on 9 Oct 2009. This volume extends from tthe summer of 1933 to Sep 3, 1939, and traces how the Nazis took over Germany, body and soul, during that time. It is not pleasant nor easy reading, at least until the final chapters when the way Hitler drove to war is set out , which reading while not pleasant expounds the way Hitler sought to have war, even though his brain-washed people still did not want such, in contrast to the giddy German joy in July 1914."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"In The Third Reich in Power, Professor Evans has produced one of the most insightful studies of the Nazi seizure and consolidation of power to date . His detailed analysis of just how completely the Nazi dictatorship infiltrated and dominated the social, economic, political and religious fabric of the German nation is chilling. The book is beautifully written and offers readers an engaging, as well as disturbing, window into this tragic period in European history."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"I bought all 3 of Richard Evans books on the Third Reich. I had wanted to know more about WWII and particularly how it came to be that a nation as evolved as Germany came to bring the Nazi to power. Like everyone else, I had read books, articles, seen movies but nothing so far as educated me as much as the Evans's trilogy on the Reich. The author has done exhaustive research and has given the reader a multi-faceted perspective on the pre-war and war periods. The books are well written but are not an easy read in the sense that the reader has to be prepared to be exposed to evidence-based facts. The author has gone through diaries, archives, reports, he has provided us with a high level of details, the trilogy is a brilliant example of historical research. The books also make you understand how fragile democracy can be and let you wonder whether the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich could reoccur."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"If you don't know much about WWII Germany then this is a great book. It's the second of a trio, which I can't wait for the third.If you already know a bit about WWII Germany then it's a nice reference book that adds a little more detail."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"A great continuation from Evans' earlier book, \\"The Coming of the Third Reich\\", and a much longer one. Evans' focus here, as in the previous book, is primarily on the social atmosphere within Germany. You won't find detailed studies of Nazi personalities, or intricate chronologies of events leading up to the war. Instead, the book offers a bounty of anecdotes and statistics on many aspects of life inside Germany from 1933 to 1939, focusing on how the Nazis tried to rebuild the human soul and mind through propaganda, music, architecture, art, education, and increasingly as the years went by, overt violence.It's hard for me as a layman to give a book like this a rating. Is the book accurate in its portrayal of Nazi society? You'd need an awful lot of knowledge to answer that question, knowledge that I, as relatively widely-read on the subject as I am, don't have. But the book certainly is engaging and fascinating, and the author knows how to relate anecdotes in a memorable way. Considering its length, I retained a lot of detail when I was finished, instead of remembering mostly a large blur as I do with so many very-long tomes.I'm really looking forward to the third volume, and I can only hope that Evans will then decide to write about the postwar Germanies."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Insightful, well documented, and very powerful! This book is a wonderful primer on the type of society the Nazis created, the lengths that they went to control their people, and the measures used to create the 3rd Reich."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"A highly detailed coverage of the Third Reich as it rose to and consolidated its power in Germany during the 1930 decade. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone interested in analysing events leading up to World War II.The Devil however is in the details. The author makes sweeping statements about the Versaille treaty that are neither logical or reasonable. He fails to place the beginnings of the practice of racial hygiene in Germany within the larger context of the worldwide movement in that area. When he mentions the Spanish civil war he quotes from some sources that are known to be inaccurate.These are just a few areas where the author has been less than thorough. Despite the foregoing I would gladly urge people interested in the history of the Twentieth century to read this book; always bearing in mind that this obviously vast subject is covered incompletely here."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The Evans' trilogy on the Third Reich is comprehensive and may well become the definitive general history of that period. An excellent bibliography for more detailed reading, too. With his public works projects and national work camps helping bring Germany out of the depression, you can readily see why Hitler was supported by much of the German populace. There are some frightening comparisons with the Obama administration's socialists tendencies in the latter's actions today."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Most people with an interest in history probably think they know quite a bit about Hitler's Germany. This book reveals quite a bit of new information and fills in the details in a picture more often described in broad brush strokes. The writing can be quite dry, and may contain too much detail (figures) for some readers but it is generally a readable yet credible book."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This is the middle volume of a Nazi trilogy. Part 1 is the way to power, part 3 is the war. The middle part covers the years 1933 to 1939. Evans has decided to arrange the vast material by subject matter rather than chronologically. This proves to be a wise choice. We have the option to choose individual chapters like independent shorter books. The book is highly recommended to anybody who has an interest in the subject. It serves as a myth buster in several interesting ways. My review will give a short summary of key points of the chapters.Chapter 1 is about fear and terror. Unruly internal competition is killed off early; opposition parties are banned, their leaders and activists arrested and many killed; growth of SS, Gestapo, special courts for \`crimes against the people'; denunciation as tool of control; block wardens; concentration camps; manipulation of plebiscites by intimidation and falsification. Never believe anybody who claims that Hitler unified the German people!Chapter 2 on propaganda addresses that question. Goebbels' aim was winning the mind of 100% of the people, not just the 37% who had voted for the Nazis at their peak. All media are brought under full control. Art is dealt with on a broad scale. Apart from the conflicts with artists, there was the internal struggle among the Nazis. We catch ourselves taking sides with Goebbels, who was willing to support some modernists. The boss himself was a pure square in art matters.Chapter 3 deals with education and religion. Very interesting: the narration on religious groups and the Nazis' attempts to replace allegiance to churches with something else. Simplified views of Nazism like to claim that it was atheist. In fact, the Nazis tried to unify German churches, which were split on a roughly 2:1 relation between Protestants and Catholics. Their power base was among Protestants. They tried to take over this church and then lure the Catholics into the fold. This failed, mainly due to resistance from inside the church. The Catholic Church first helped the Nazis to power (by the Center Party's refusal to resist), but then put up many small non-cooperation hurdles. In the end, the Nazis tried to develop their own neo-pagan style, which never fully succeeded. Sad truth: the only religious group that wholeheartedly resisted Nazism on all levels was Jehova's Witnesses.In the field of education, the 30s saw a steep decline in academic standards and also in student numbers. The drop in birth rates during WW1 plus the party's anti-intellectualism, anti-Semitism, anti-feminism combined towards creating a bleak outlook for Germany's academic future. Applied research was treated differently and especially militarily relevant subjects were lavishly funded, but outside universities.Chapter 4 on the economy shows how the myth of the end to unemployment was based on a combination of partly successful Keynesianism with fortunate trends of the time, plus statistical manipulations, and not to forget: the re-militarization of Germany, including conscription. All state interference was related to re-armament. The economy was initially left to run as a \`free market', but markets were manipulated and directed. Re-militarization was the overriding concern. By 1936 it became clear that the speed of the development was behind schedule, so the economy was more radically transformed into a war economy. Technocrats like \`economy czar' Schacht were sidelined.Chapter 5 deals with various fields of social engineering. A backbone of support for the regime was the so-called Mittelstand. That means, in a narrower sense, all independent small businesses, including land-owning farmers. In a larger sense it would include professionals, civil servants, and white collar workers. Enthusiasm and illusions were grand among these people. Reality clashed with the overriding re-armament policy, which damaged many small businesses.The living standards of the working classes had not improved over the pre-depression level by 39. Consolation prizes were given via the Strength through Joy program, which was widely recognized for what it was: eyewash, substitute for real improvements. At the same time the corruption level of the Nazi run labor organization was spectacular. Only Third World dictators can be that shameless.Chapter 6 is about \`racial hygiene'. Germany's laws favoring compulsory sterilization for carriers of inherited illnesses, and for other undesirables, were by no means unique in the international scenario. From here it would progress towards euthanasia in later years. Minorities were systematically harassed: Gypsies, homosexuals, mixed descendants of various combinations (like offspring of black French soldiers after the Rhineland occupation, or kids of German colonialists with African women), and then mainly Jews. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 introduced drastic interferences in personal lives by excluding Jews from social activities. After the 1936 Olympics, anti-Jewish violence grew towards the peak of Reichskristallnacht in 38, the \`night of broken glass'. \`Drive Jews out of Europe within 10 years' was the declared vision, before the goal shifted to annihilation.Chapter 7 describes war preparations. War had been Hitler's declared goal always, and all declarations to the contrary were just obfuscation, as was the peace agreement with Poland, the naval pact with Britain, the Hitler-Stalin-Pact. Step by step the thugs went forward: quitting the League of Nations, a triumph at the Saar plebiscite, diplomatic support for Italy's Ethiopia expansion, occupation of the demilitarized Rhineland, material support to Franco's insurrection in Spain, invasion and annexation of Austria, the invasion and annexation of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia, the annexation of the Lithuanian region of Memel. Britain and France watched. Then came the invasion of Poland... (to be continued).Superb organization of the huge subject make the book a brilliantly brief overview, despite it's over 700 pages. What is missing? I would have wished for a special chapter on the military and its reconstruction. There are aspects that are totally neglected, like the cooperation with the Chinese Nationalists."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"I came to this a few weeks after reading William Shirer's \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" When complete, Evans's three-volume history will be much longer, and it will benefit from an additional four decades of historical research that wasn't available to Shirer. Already it is being hailed as \\"the definitive English-language account.\\" But there are losses as well, and they aren't petty. For example, Evans gives a clearer picture of what the average German thought and did in the 1930s, even though Shirer was actually there and Evans wasn't. Evans also has more to say on the \\"coordination\\" (i.e., Nazification) of everyday life. But for foreign policy -- Hitler's plans for war, his conversations with his generals, his negotiations with Mussolini and his son-in-law, the diplomacy leading up to Austria and Czechoslavakia's annexation, the pact with Russia, and the invasion of Poland -- Shirer is much more informative, despite being 40 years out of date."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"Anyone who wants to know what it felt like to be a citizen of Hitler's **Reich** can find an answer in this excellent study. Covering both nationwide trends and homey details, this book covers virtually every aspect of life in a totalitarian state. Although slightly biased againt the Nazis--what Englishman could not be?--this volume is factual, superbly researched, sweeping in scope.I, for illustration, was unaware that Hitler became a wealthy man solely through sales of \\"Mein Kampf\\", which every German family was required to buy although a lot fewer ever got through its turgid prose. I did not know of such figures as Dr. Robert Ritter, young physician who compiled a master catalogue of every one of Germany's 20,000 Gypsies, or of Gertrud Baumer, leading German feminist in the 1920's who retreated from public life in the face of relentless state pressure, to be replaced by the improbably-named Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, who dedicated herself to turning German women to baby-making machines.You will come to know these and many, many others in this first-class study."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"still a highly readable, fact filled work on the Nazi's in power from 1933-39. The book is not chronological; rather, Evans breaks up the chapters to deal with individual topics. At times, this was frustrating because you may lose what else was going on at that time until 200 pages later. On the other hand, it was also good because it allowed the reader to focus on individual topics and learn more and more about them. The best details were the mini-biographies that Evans wrote about several key figures during this time. These were very informative and easy to read. Another great part was the details on the Strength Through Joy program. This write up was very fascinating. The last chapters on Hitler's attempts to prepare for war and acquire areas such as Austria was very well written and interesting as well. I would have given this book 5 stars based on sheer information, but I only give it 4 because some chapters were not all that interesting and the non-chronological aspect got in the way at times. Still, despite any negatives, the readability, research, and information is well worth the price and the time it takes to read a book this massive. Even the most well read student of WWII and/or Nazi Germany will find some interesting information in this book."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"If you're like me - you always wondered how the Nazi's came to be in power and to be able to exert such control over the German people. This trilogy covering, essentially, the rise and fall of the Third Reich, does a tremendous job of providing deep context for the Nazi power cycle.This is the second of the trilogy and the pace is relatively fast. At times, it reads a bit more like a text book than a history book as the author delves deeply into supporting his various theses about Nazism. But it's well worth the occasional reading slog to grasp the author's points. The effort to read (at times) is well rewarded with insights, deep back ground, and the birth of a greater understanding of the Nazi style."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"The second volume in Richard J. Evans Third Reich trilogy matches the first for breathtaking scope, attention to detail and truly fine writing. Evans successfully illustrates how the Nazi process of Gleichschaltung (coordination) allowed fascism to permeated every facet of German life. Propaganda, police terror, the Nazi war on the churches, the creation of the racial state, and the preparation for world war are all addressed in all their horrific wonder by the author. This is another important book in the pantheon of Third Reich histories and will no doubt educate the curious for years to come."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"I had read about the Third Reich but mainly through biographies of Hitler & other histories of the Second World War. Most of these concentrated on Hitler's foreign policies & his war making.Evans, in his second volume of this large history, has given me a priceless look inside the Third Reich & how the Nazi's took over all aspects of daily life in Germany & how they reordered German society in their image through \\"co-ordination\\". I never realized how complete the transformation (or the revolution) of Germany was until Evan's painted this stark portrait. It is a chilling tale.Now I finally have the answer to a question I have always had. Why was there no organized opposition to Hitler & the Nazis? The establishment of the police state was so thorough & so severe any opposition was quashed. But beyond the repression was the transformation of German society & it was complete.One of the better vignettes in the book answered another question I had. Why were the Jehovah's Witnesses prosecuted by the Nazis & sent to concentration camps. How could this harmless, little sect be any threat to the might of Third Reich? The answer is actually the key to understanding the basic philosophy of that Third Reich. To know the answer you must read the book.The book is tough sledding. There is a lot of information & some statistics. It is not necessarily a fun history to read. There is a lot of detail about a lot of different aspects of German life from religion to work to the arts but there must be so much in order for Evan's to paint this picture.Evan's The Third Reich In Power is the definitive look at the Third Reich for this generation & a long time to come. If you have any interest in the modern history of Germany then you owe it to yourself to read this series.And the moral or the story is this: be careful who you elect. If they say they are for change then change you could get. But it could be more change than you ever suspected. The German people made a deal with the Devil and the thugs took over. It is a fable of the Twentieth Century for us in the Twenty First."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"This integrates the already good William Shirer's \\"History of the Third Reich\\". Wonderfully written, very readable and full of historical details and facts. Absolutely recommendable to all History lovers."},{"Title":"The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939","review":"I reviewed the first volume in this trilogy here, and the second is just as gripping and informative. Volume two is chiefly remarkable for the way it answers the question of how and why the average German was able to go along with Hitler's bloodthirsty nationalism and antisemitism. Evans also manages to dispel the myth that the Nazi Party was somehow able to lift Germany out of the Depression.After WW II historians and sociologists spent a lot of time arguing about and commenting on the fact that Germany, in many respects one of the most civilized European countries prior to WW I, was able to become the most uncivilized in double-quick time. Evans shows that the economic battering and civil unrest that plagued Germany throughout the 1920s essentially created a punch drunk populace that was softened up for Hitler's message: the imminent return of a Germany both powerful and proud. His rabid nationalism also seemed like a strong antidote to the threat (as perceived by the middle and upper classes) of Marxism. Once in power, Hitler and the Nazis began the quick, brutal and ruthless suppression of all forms of dissent. Everyone from trade unionists to Catholics to boy scouts were bullied, jailed, exiled or killed in an effort to create a Nazi-centric state. Given the very high levels of intimidation the Nazis dealt out it becomes less surprising that the German people were reluctant to voice opposition to Hitler. That being said, Evans leaves us in no doubt that after 1933 most Germans were, to a point, supporters of Hitler. However, few of them could have anticipated how great his desire was for conquest and bloodshed.Evans doesn't delve much into the psychological and sociological reasons for antisemitism, but he shows us that Germany was far from alone in persecuting Jews. Throughout the '30s countries like Poland, Hungary and Romania enacted antisemitic legislation and regulations that often equaled what the Nazis were up to. For all the usual religious and scapegoat reasons, the '30s saw a huge rise in antisemitism across Europe. Where Germany differed was in the enormous propaganda effort the Nazis put into demonizing Jews. Books, movies, radio, newspapers, speeches, there was no form of communication the Nazis didn't use, and use often, to persuade Germans that Jews were a curse upon the land. Evans shows that even Germans who had no particular dislike for Jews prior to 1933 became enthusiastic antisemites after only a few years of non-stop Nazi propaganda.Popular opinion has often said that Hitler and the Nazis managed to turn the German economy around after they came to power. Not so. The Nazis reduced employment to a large degree by redefining who qualified as unemployed. Seasonal workers, for example, were no longer listed as unemployed when their jobs ended. Germany also began to simply print more money in order to pay for rearmament and public works projects. By 1939 the Germany economy was, in fact, nearing collapse; rationing was becoming commonplace and the consumer economy was disappearing. The Nazis needed a war in 1939 if only to prevent economic disaster. Their economy seemed vibrant but was, in reality, grossly deformed.If the third volume in this series is as good as the first two it will arguably have to stand as the best history of Germany and the Nazis that's been written.Read more of my reviews at JettisonCocoon dot com."},{"Title":"Free as in Speech and Beer: The Internet, Gift Economies and the Intellectual Property Crisis","review":"I bought this book a year ago and never really got into it but the other night I picked it out of my library and started to read. Weshler-Henry does an excellent job of explaining the legality, issues, opportunities, and dangers of p2p, open source, and intellectual property in a way that makes sense to the average consumer. It was a great book to read and one that more of us who use the web and care about those issues need to educate ourselves in. The author writes in a lively style and while the book is a little out of date now (iTunes and the RIAA's new strategy of sue everyone) hadn't happened yet, the basics of what he is getting at still hold true.He does a good job in documenting both the official response and the grassroots reaction (which aren't always the same) to the issues and engages both equally.

It doesn't address the \\"issue\\" of adoption as much as talking about how this family comes together and how the paths of their lives lead them together. (rather fate-based?) It also speaks to the diversity of many families (\\"No matter single or pairs. . .No matter the skin, we are all of us kin. . .\\") and, albeit briefly and generally, is very reassuring that families are made up in many different ways.The song is very nice and my daughter enjoys me singing it at the end of the book. Through the pictures, you can point out that one child has two mother's, or two children have just a father, and that one child has different eyes or skin from his parents. My husband and I love this book, but if you are ultra-conservative (one would hope any adoptive parent wouldn't be), it won't be for you.

I don't like how he repeatedly says, For out of a world so tattered and torn, You came to our house on that wonderful morn...\\". The entire world is messed up, and I don't like this \\"we saved you\\" mentality. Elsewhere John writes, \\"Some parents come different, some come the same...\\".

However, the reference that some parents 'come the same' and the picture of a lesbian couple walking with a little girl was very inappropriate for an adoption book. Why do homosexual references need to be in a CHILDREN'S book??? This only opens up the opportunity for a young child to ask an awful lot of questions about same sex relationships, perhaps BEFORE a parent is ready to discuss. I will not be reading this book again."},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"John McCutcheon, Happy Adoption Day! (Little, Brown, 1996)I have to start this review by admitting that I'm not the best sight-reader on the planet. In fact, I'm pretty awful at it. What do you want? I'm a drummer. I not only have a tin ear, I have one that was recycled at a cut-rate plant. So, okay, maybe I'm not qualified to be reviewing this book from a musical perspective. But even a drummer can recognize rhythm-- especially when it goes wrong. And there are some places in this book where it goes horribly, horribly wrong. (My nonmusical wife pointed out some of the same lapses in rhythm I had first wondered about.)And here I offer the same postulate I have been offering, usually unsuccessfully (no matter how right it may be) for years: how you say something is just as important, if not more, than what you say. The message of the book is all well and good, but present it in a clunky manner, and you're either teaching kids to resent the message overall or to enjoy really substandard music. (Doesn't Radio Disney do enough of that already?) Awkwardly-phrased lyrics: not confined to rap any more. **"},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"Nice child like illustrations.

My daughter loves the song and having images to associate with it is just wonderful."},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"After reading this book my husband and I were a little disheartened by some of the content. We are hesitant to be able to enjoy this book with our little one from China because of the words, &quot;For out of a world so tattered and torn, You came to our house on that wonderful morn...&quot; We don't want to make her feel like she came out of the ghetto to come to us and want her to feel good about her birth country. Anyway, there's no getting away from these words--they appear on 4 pages of this little book and of course the song also includes them. It sounds a little arrogant to us, sort of like, Good riddance to China... We were disappointed in the book for this reason."},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"As an adoption social worker, I like finding good adoption kids' books. This one celebrates adoption, which is great. It reminds me of a teenager I tutored years ago whose parents celebrated both his birthday and his \\"Gotcha\\" day. People used to keep adoptions secret -- that we now acknowledge and celebrate it is wonderful, and this book adds to that celebration. My one (quite large) reservation is that the book paints a really negative picture of the child's life before adoption; the chorus of the song repeats throughout the book, and refers to the child's previous life as \\"a world so tattered and torn.\\" Another reviewer of this book mentioned that the entire world is \\"tattered and torn.\\" I agree. I can see how this song could lead a child to view the adoptive parents as \\"saviors\\" and may create a sense of shame or indebtedness as the child reflects on their past life. This book might be OK for kids who were adopted after experiencing abuse or neglect in another place, but parents would still need to be careful to ensure that a child understands that whatever \\"tatteredness\\" was in the child's past life, it's not the child's fault."},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"Why does the reading level under \\"Product Details\\" say ages 4-8, when reviews by School Library Journal and others say that this a book for toddlers and kindergarteners?

The words of the book are also lyrics to a beautiful. This book is written from the perspective of a couple that is anxiously awaiting the child they have adopted and then what they want their child to know. It continues from the arrival of the child throughout when the child is getting older and reminds them that it does not matter what they decides to do in life or even what they look like compared to his/her parents that they still are happy that this child is in their life and they are a family. I found this book touching because it allows the families of adopted children to have a book that is specifically about adopting a child and the love that those parents have for their new child."},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"This book was given to me as a gift when we adopted, and I have loved it so much!

It is the day they officially have no recourse; no possibility to go back.As an adult adoptee, I can sympathize with the reasoning behind it; it does echo \\"acceptance.\\" but, what many adopted parents also need to acknowledge is that the loss many adoptees feel - can never be forgotten or even mended by acceptance."},{"Title":"Happy Adoption Day!","review":"I was a little disappointed this book only addressed going to another location for adoption.

A child joining a family should be celebrated whether through birth or adoption! There are a couple of spots where the wording is slightly awkward...but writing in verse, and still getting your desired message across, is quite difficult. The overall feeling of this book is warm and fuzzy, while the illustrations are bright and cheerful.

It is a one-note song, but that one note sings a joyful song. Made up of short stories commissioned for this anthology, they all share a theme, music. Within that theme, there are as many variations as the human mind can devise. Some stories are only tenuously connected with music, like the faintest hum. Others throb, resonate and pound into your brain like Sony's megabass. But all are worth reading, and some reading 2 or 3 or 4 times to capture all the rich nuances. For anyone who loves science fiction and music, Space Opera is a rare find and a thrilling melody. I particularly enjoyed the story contributed by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, and not just because we are both nurses. Anne Berson RN (bersonfamily@worldnet.att.net)"},{"Title":"Space Opera","review":"I liked these stories and thought they were well-chosen. Anne McCaffrey &amp; Elizabeth Ann Scarbourough make a good team. It was an interesting concept, mixing music and science fiction. This was a very good book for a collection, although I did prefer McCaffrey's Pern series."},{"Title":"Space Opera","review":"The book was enjoyable. Made for some light reading during lunch hours at the office. But it wasn't up to the standards that I expect from a collection like this. Perhaps someone with more of a musical background might enjoy it more than I did. A couple of the stories were very engrossing and entertaining, but overall it wasn't the best I have read."},{"Title":"Space Opera","review":"I had loaned my copy of this book to a friend, which is always a bad idea with your favorite books, right?So in looking for a replacement of this book, I was very sad to see it was out of print. Thank goodness for the used book market!If you lived through Chicago's traffic jam in this past year's horrible snow storm, the first story, Bluesberry Jam, will resonate the most for you.It's hard to pick out a favorite story from the anthology, all of them are so wonderfully written. I'm a life long fan of McCaffrey, but this anthology is just a recipient of her name. The music and the literature blend so well together. Yes, this may be a sci-fi/fantasy compilation, but it is true literature in how it speaks to us as a human being.Well worth the time to hunt down, and I assure you, this copy is going nowhere. Just wish we could also have a Kindle version as well."},{"Title":"Space Opera","review":"I am a fan of Anne McCaffery's Science fiction, and I just finished this (back in December, getting caught up here) anthology that she co-edited with Elizabeth Ann Scarborough. Ann Scarborough is new to me, and I am going to look up her first novel, Song of Sorcery, which is mentioned in the introduction, primarily because Sweet William, the name sake of one of my favorite flowers, is a significant character. I did enjoy Scarborough's story \\"Scarborough Fair.\\" The main character, Anne, is a writer, and I always enjoy these glimpses into other writer's lives. Anne is also a bit of a genealogist, and that interests me also, as I have been doing a little research on my family tree.My favorite stories in the collection are \\"Bluesberry Jam\\" by Gene Wolfe, \\"Ever After\\" by Paula Lalish, \\"The Last Song of Sirit Byar\\" by Peter S. Beagle, and \\"A Bird in the Hand\\" by Anne McCaffery.\\"Bluesberry Jam\\" is about a traffic jam that lasts so long that it develops a culture and social services. \\"Ever After\\" is a sort of a silly story, about making wishes and finding love; the ending has more truth in it than most \`true' stories. \\"The Last Song . . .\\" reminds us about the power of song, the power of our words--to create what is real in this life. \\"A Bird in the Hand\\" is a kind of who dunit in space . . . I like mysteries, and science fiction, so this is the perfect escape."},{"Title":"Space Opera","review":"Loving the editors' stand alone works as well as their collaborations, I expected this book to contain short stories that lived up to their title. Space Opera = Opera in Space. Yes, I know \\"space opera\\" is a viable subgenre of science fiction, but given the musical bent of the theme, I was hoping for a more traditional interpretation.Several of the stories made engrossing reads and held my attention. I found this to be quite the entertaining bunch of stories by authors familiar and new. I especially loved Peter S. Beagle's story, was surprised by the craft in Robin Wayne Bailey's story, and felt a little bittersweet (because of her passing) reading Marion Zimmer Bradley's story.As a fan of science fiction, I heartily endorse this anthology. Sadly, not all the stories lived up to my expectation, mostly because I felt too few of them weren't science fiction-y enough. A music lover, I loved the theme, just was hoping for a bit more music and science fiction.Still, well worth your read, especially for the masters' whose works appears within these pages."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"with this CD. And I will play it, and play it and play it over and over. One of the best CD's of the season or anytime, Vanessa has put together a Christmas classic. From the lovely &quot;Star Bright,&quot; to the playful duet with Bobby Caldwell, &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside,&quot; Vanessa sings with passion and conviction. She beautifully captures the spiritual essence of this time of year, while not ignoring the festiveness of the season. All the songs have their own, original feel, with Vanessa stamping them with her smooth, heartfelt vocals. A classic."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"Although I'm a collector of most of the older classic Christmas albums, this CD ranks high on my list of spiritual holiday music and is destined to become a treasured holiday classic in the years to come.Vanessa's interpretations of some classic spiritual Christmas songs such as \\"What Child is This\\", \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\", \\"Do You Hear What I Hear/Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"Angels We have Heard on High\\" and the \\"First Noel\\" are soulfully jazzy. A very upbeat medley of \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain/Mary had a Baby\\" produced by David Foster adds a somewhat contemporary gospel sound which will give you chills and also remarkebly illustrates her extended vocal range. Her solemn rendition of \\"Gracious Good Shepherd\\" features her daughter in a vocal solo and allows the listener to really feel the reason for the season.Every song beautifully captures true spirit of the Christmas season. This CD will warm your heart."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"I love the album and would love to know if there is a piano music book available or background recordings of the songs on the c.d that I could purchase and use to sing with.

There are just too many slow and quiet songs on 'Star Bright' and they begin to sound the same. I think she needed a better producer and arranger for 'Star Bright' as her voice is as beatuiful as ever. There is one track I truly love, and it's her gospel version of &quot;Mary Had A Baby/Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot; but it's also found on David Fosters 'The Christas Album' which I enjoy much more than this CD."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"I own many Christmas CD's and this is definitely my favorite. Vanessa injects her soulful spirit into each and every song, without taking away from the tradition and sacredness of the music. So much holiday music is the same, yet this R&amp;B treatment of some of the classics is unique, upbeat, and inspiring. She also includes 3 new compositions from songwriter Rob Mathes.Through all my years of growing up, I don't ever remember paying attention to the words of &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot; or &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; the way I do when my children and I are jamming along with Vanessa. It is obvious that her intention was to make an impact...and she does.On the lighter side, her duet with Bobby Caldwell on &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside&quot; is smooth, sweet, and jazzy.If you like to be uplifted by music, this CD is a must-have for Christmas!"},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"Vanessa Williams works magic on some classic Christmas music. Her restraint and her mature delivery are a blessing in this time of overhyped, over-the-top screaming divas. This album is perfect for tree-trimming or after Christmas dinner lounging. I'd venture to say it's my favorite of all my Christmas music cds from the past 10 years."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"Every year I buy Christmas music. I bought Star Bright when it was first released and have joyfully played it every year for the season.Vanessa's CD contains the same songs that everyone else's holiday CDs contain. But, the arrangements are so original that they sound completely different. This wasn't just thrown together--it is splendidly crafted. The light gospel touches are perfect, and her ballads are sweet without being annoyingly so. Vanessa's creation is the perfect background to a wondrous season."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"'Do you hear what I hear?'Star Bright is another one of my favorite Christmas albums.

If you like Vanessa Williams and X-mas music then therefore you would definitely enjoy this cd and this X-mas album!!!!"},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"This is definitely a Christmas CD the whole family can enjoy during the holiday season. Listening to _What_Child_Is_This_ takes me back to when I would hear this song during Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve as a child. All songs are updated, jazzy versions of the originals, so it feels like you are listening to new songs, rather than hearing what is sung in church during the holiday season.All in all, a good Christmas CD."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"Each year as my family and I drag our decorations out of the attack and start to decorate the house, we load the CD player with our favorite holiday tunes, and Vanessa Williams' &quot;Star Bright&quot; is always among them, and it is always the first one I put in the car too.There is no song on this CD that you have not heard before, but I'd be willing to wager that you haven't heard them in quite this way before. Vanessa brings a new, fresh, even fun approach to these holiday standards. From the jazzy &quot;What Child is This&quot; to the wonderfully light &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside&quot; you'll soon be caught up in the spirit of Christmas. My personal favorite is &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High&quot;. Every time I hear it I can't help but smile and sing along. If you're looking for something new to add to your holiday collection then you have got to get this CD. I have no problem giving it the highest rating."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"I felt as if I could see her performing her music even though I was listening to a CD.

The arrangements are fresh, jazzy and classically modern. I especially like the duet \\"It's Cold Outside\\" with Bobby Caldwell. It's a fresh new take on a timeless Christmas duet. I'm going to buy Vanessa's second Christmas Album and add it to my favorites. If you like your Christmas music to be classy and fun at the same time, Star Bright is for you."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"This happens to be the kind of an album you want to get cozy in well candle-lit bedroom on Christmas Eve. Vanessa's first Christmas Album(Which is also known as The 20th Century Christmas Collection) has the best Christmas music worth listening to. The Best time to listen is late at night. Her voice is very sexy and seductive and my personal favorite tracks on this album are 1,4,8,9, & 12. Track 9 & 11 were previously recorded on other albums. Track 9 was Recorded for \\"A Special Olympics Christmas 2\\"; and Track 11 was used in David Foster's Christmas Album. \\"Star Bright\\" remains one the best Christmas Albums that will eventually stand through the test of time."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"Along with Kenny G's Christmas Album, this one ranks up with it.

I'm not a big Vanessa Williams fan and had none of her secular music until I bought this CD some years ago. I'm not sure what the reviewers who gave it less than four stars were hoping for and didn't get but this is a very soothing and elegantly done collection of songs. Especially noteworthy is \\"Do You Hear What I Hear/Drummer Boy\\" arrangement. Her rendition is alone worth the cost of the CD.A knowledgeable buyer--and one who loves and knows Christmas music--will also pick up her Silver and Gold CD. As far as I'm concerned it has the best rendition of Little Drummer Boy I've heard--ever."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"Arrived within 4 days. This CD was in perfect condition, as was the cover.

I am so glad she put out a Christmas cd. This ranks as one of my favorite Christmas cds of all time.First she starts of with a slight combo of DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR AND THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY. This is a fantastic version of such a beautiful classic. Her voice is a gentle and beautiful as new fallen snow. Then STAR BRIGHT is about a woman talking to Jesus about shining down on her. Then she has a sexy duet with Bobby Caldwell called BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE. She sounded like she had so much fun with that song. It makes any man want to keep Vanessa right where she is, inside where it is warm. HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING is an upbeat version of this religious Christmas classic. I love the choir in the backgroud. It makes this song more powerful and fun to listen to. Another religious classic that gets a \\"face lift\\" is ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH. She creates a r&b; and jazzy version that you can actually grove to. The FIRST NOEL, according to Vanessa, is sweeping and lovely. I have heard versions of this song that sound to rigid. She smooths it all over with her angelic voice. WHAT CHILD IS THIS? is a Christmas standard that is usually sung in churches around the globe. Vanessa's version can be played at any local jazz club. This is without a doubt one of the finest versions of this song. She creates such a masterpiece with the jazz feel; and yet maintains the importance of the song.She rounds out such a diverse collection of songs with a charming version of I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. Just hearing her voice makes you wish she was coming to your house for Christmas.An excellent cd to have for the most beautiful time of the year."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"By far, this is the best holiday CD that I own.

I've always thought her Cd &quot;Comfort Zone&quot;was one of the best and most complete Cd I ever purchased and one that I'd take on a deserted island; however, I'd also take this one with me for the holidays.Purchase this CD, it's the best thing going."},{"Title":"Star Bright","review":"This is one of my favorite holiday compact discs.

Vanessa's voice is pleasant, but not the strongest in the world (sorry Vanessa) She does know how to sing, though, and not to strain and try to do too much.

While not always true, that philosophy is the foundation of \\"Broke! A College Student's Guide to Getting By on Less\\". The book consists primarily of quotes from college students who share their experience and advice. For each subject there are multiple student quotes that are selected for their applicability to that subject, some real advice on how to handle various situations, and even selected resources. You have to appreciate the fact that the book covers so many critical areas a college student needs to understand but does it in such a way that they are likely to actually take the advice instead of ignoring it because it came from a parent. Some of the important areas include budgeting, prioritizing, banking, credit cards, scholarships, loans, purchasing textbooks, dining, entertainment, travel, and housing.

He lived at a time when such political concepts such as Conservatism, Classical Liberalism, Socialism, and Nationalism gained such poltical traction which he predicted would lead to terrible wars and political oppression. On the other hand, Burckhardt made careful note of the achievements re Western Civilization which are now either trivialized or consigned to \\"the Orwellian Memory Hole.The beginning of the book has Alberto Coll's Forward which informs readers of what to expect in reading this book. Burckhardt was not optimistic about the political trends he noticed during his lifetime and some of the attempts of European monarchs who made such aggressive attempts to centralize power at the expense of the nobility and, in some instances, the middle class. Yet, the middle class usually supported the monarchs, but the French Revolution demonstrated that such support was beginning to wither. As an aside, Coll's introduction is well worth reading.The first section of Burckhardt's JUDGEMENTS explained how Western Civilization was influenced by the Ancient Persians, Egyptians, the people of India, etc. While Western Civilization is unigue, as are all civilizations, Burckhardt was clear that such influences did not overwhelm the people of Western Civilization. One of the tensions of Ancient Western Civilization was that of the civilized Ancient Greeks and Romans vs. the barbarians. Historical studies are often studies of extremes. One of the developments that Burckhardt should have emphasized was the invention of the alaphabet.Obviously, the status of the Ancient West was the threat of barbarians. Yet, many in the West were able to blunt barbarian threats. The slaves and the poor remained supportive because as bad as their status was, the very poor did not realize their misery. The achievements and cultural heritage survived via the Catholic Church which Burckhardt mentioned but should have emphasized more. Burckhardt wrote that historians too often glorify the \\"victors\\" during the demise of the Roman Empire but neglect the misery and tragedy of the losers. While Ancient Romans, Greeks and barbarians armed for future wars, Burckhardt perceptively noted that modern Europeans were getting armed for the future disasters that occured in the 20th. century.Burckhardt noted that while the history of Middle Ages had its share of war and political intrigue, such events appear puny compared to the 20th. century. One factor that helped Europeans to attain some stability and intellectual achievement was again the Catholic Church authorities. The Europeans were able to survive their own internal conflicts and the threat posed by Islam. Such concepts as settled creeds and a universal Church (Catholic means universal)helped the Europeans maintain Western Civilization at a time when grave dangers threatened Europe. One of the political consequences of the Middle Ages was the intense bitter conflict between the Papacy and the German emperors fom the 11th. through the 13th. centuries which ended in the fragmentation of the German Empire in 1273. Also the English faced similar problems in attempting to subjugate the Scottish until 1707 when the English and Scots agree to The Act of Union.Burckhardt, who was a Renaissance scholar par excellence, noted both the political problems and the great achievements of Renaissance art and thought. While the Italians were not united at the time, they attracted intervention from the Hapsburg Germans, the Spanish, and the French. When the Renaissance popes tried to create a semblence of peace or at least a balence of power, they failed. Yet, the Italian princes, especially the de Medici, patronized the arts whereby great work was produced. The Italian Renaissance influence spread to Northern Europe and England which helped Westerners to have access to great art, intellectual advancement, etc. Yet, modern men have marginalized and tried to relegate such achievement to nothing.Burckhardt's section on the Reformation was his best. He carefully explained that the Reformation was driven by economic greed and looting. He carefully explained that the Reformers were not driven by religious zeal but by pretexts to loot Catholic land, wealth, universities, hospitals, ect. The effort was such that while the secular rulers were not too intersted in religion, they feared a resugence of Catholicism to the point that simply being a Catholic was a capital crime. Gustavus Adolphus (1611-1632)was a good example. It was the secular rulers who dictated faith rather than the reformers. The rulers feared the diviions among the Protestants would lead to divisions which threatened their authortarian rule. Burckhardt made a good point that the last thing the Protestant reformers wanted was tolerance because they thought that tolerance would invite God's wrath. Burckhardt noted that what the \\"reformers\\" thought as God's wrath was actually their own useless hatred. Once Protestantism exhausted itself with pettiness, it became irrelative. Another fault that Burckhardt noticed was the Reformers shunned Church History which would logically undermine their views. In fact, they made themselves look foolish by their refusal to acknowledge Church History. The religious wars, especially The Thirty Years War (1618-1648), proved that the Europeans paid a ghastly price for \\"reform.\\" Again remember that the Catholic Church was/is a universal church, and secular rulers did not tolerate a church beyond their political borders.The events which followed the Reformation included the French Revolution and subsequent events. Napolean and his supporters ruined French \\"greatness.\\" While the French revolutionaries championed Nationalism, they failed to realize that they galvinized Nationalism against themelves. This was clearly shown among the Austrians, Prussians, the Russians, and the Spanish.A key question that Burckhard raised was if the Europeans were happier with modern industrialism, \\"democracy,\\" etc. Given the national and race hatreds imbred in such concepts, the answer is a resounding NO. Illusions of progress and \\"good times\\" were exploded by two world wars and other poltical oppression including concentration camp brutality.A seriousr historical problem that Burckhardt cited was that historical scholarship and other serious studies were corrupted by commercialism which pandered to false work which sold no matter how badly flawed it was. Serious honest work was shunned and at times criminalized to cater to bad tastes and the \\"deification of stupidity.\\" In other words, when political dreams crash against reality, escape literature posing as scholarship is in place as an escape of shattered dreams.Burckhardt's book was well done. However, he could have enhanced his comments re the Middle Ages by detailed mention of Scholasticism and the great Scholastics such as St. Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) etc. Burkhardt could have further cited Father Roger Bacon (1214-1294)whom some historians consider the Father of the Scientific Method. The insights that Burckhardt provided overcome the flaws in this book.James E. EgolfSeptember 19,2012"},{"Title":"Notes from the Future","review":"The hero of this book is flawed, committed to his work and loved, yet in some ways very selfish, very human. When he finds out he has leukemia he spends half the book to develop the technology and methods to freeze humans so they can be revived later. He is placed into this cold sleep and wakes up in 1991.The rest of the book is the exploration of the future (from the author's point of view). Things HAVE changed. Something like the internet, a system of two-way televisions linked to libraries, has been invented. Scientists try to cure murders with drugs and dream therapy based on the idea that people who carry out crimes are just sick or insane. They are not punished. A lot of machines have been made to make life simpler and Japan even made a thinking machine.The future, at least in this book, feels slightly uncomfortable. Even the hero feels that some things are wrong even when everybody is telling him things are better.Of course Communism and Socialism has spread through-out the world, forcing Capitalism to withdraw to a few nations. Yet, once again, the author doesn't show us a paradise. He shows us a Earth still working to improve itself, step by step. As troubled and as hopeful as the main character is.Humans are still humans, seems to be the main theme, even while working to make themselves perfect. Maybe the fact that we are always changing, trying to reach those ideals, is what makes us human? Immortality is a strong theme, but there seems to be a question on whether it is good for mankind or bad for mankind.Worth reading once, but don't go out of your way to get it."},{"Title":"The Darkest Day","review":"The third and last book of the iron tower trilogy is probably the best of the three.

Vita wrote a month by month column in a London paper about gardening, and this contains excerpts from these. It goes through the year, season by season, in her famous garden at Sissinghurst Castle in England, during the years immediately following WWII. She shares planting tips, planting mistakes, and offers her views on the style of gardening she made famous. For example, she recommends planting masses of one plant and one color in a defined area of a garden.In addition to her dry and witty remarks about gardening in general, she discusses the origins of some of the Latin names of plants, and she indirectly gives us a peek into some of the English culture of the &quot;country house&quot; at that time. The reader is superb! One can actually imagine that, had Vita read it for us herself, she would've used the same tone and inflection. I love this tape. I've given this as a gift to fellow-gardeners, and have listened to it myself over and over. It a real gem!"},{"Title":"Island in the Lake","review":"Finally, an author creates a bad guy that you can at the same time hate and feel very sorry for.

I thought this book was boring and I had difficulty finishing it. It was unrealistic to think a man from another area could come in and know more than the native people who lived in the swamp. I could not believe that the native people would allow their children to go and live with a crazy man in the swamp. Native Americans love and protect their children, and would never allow a man from another tribe to guide them in any way.

Aren't they supposed to stay themselves, the parent we knew, after age 30? Imagine figuring out your own religion or lack thereof, when your model keeps changing. Murray does a great job of making it clear just how strange it was to see his father's clarion call unfold, and remain a part of his new life. It ain't over 'til it's over, people."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"This story that documents a grandfather in depression, a distant strange father who eventually results in the family left behind is strange indeed. The book is quite short and does imply that that the father/priest lived a mentally troubled life leaving his family behind in the quest for his God. It is an interesting tale but short of an uplifting experience."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"The Father and the Son is a true and complicated story. Matt has done an extraordinary job sharing his father's singular life, portraying a loving but lonely man evolving over time. The writing is unique, blending a reporter's precision with a collection of voices, ranging from compassionate to sarcastic. Matt traces his father's path from childhood to priesthood, following him through a series of families. The story is often sad and poignant, as a loving son watches his father move on to a new, monastic family. The story is also uplifting, as we gradually appreciate that his father made the right choice, finding fulfillment and peace after a long journey.As an atheist, I was not prepared to appreciate Father James' calling. However, no religious conviction is required - the author himself has wavering beliefs. The portrayal of his father's struggle is compelling, and the resolution of his journey is gratifying, regardless of the reader's (or the author's) personal views. The final chapter is touching and remarkable.I believe this book will appeal to many people, regardless of faith or family history. However, it had special meaning for me. Matt and I became best friends in second grade, and we remain close today. For over a decade, I spent most every day (and many nights) in Jim Murray's house. He took us to countless movies, to amusement parks, and to far-away places. He took me on my first plane trip (to Disney World). He took us to Niagara Falls.I loved Jim Murray like my own father, and later found him equally baffling. Matt and I were best friends during his slow conversion. When Jim sold the house, I spent the day helping them move to a new apartment. When Matt was alone for his first Thanksgiving in college, I went to Evanston. We drove to the monastery to see his dad. The day that Matt's column appeared in the Wall Street Journal, first describing his father's life, Matt was an usher in my wedding. For me, this book was a bittersweet memoir. For other readers, I believe it will be a fascinating and moving story."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"I knew Matt Murray in graduate school through mutual friends and was vaguely aware at the time that his father had become a monk. I picked up his book mainly out of curiosity, and a little skepticism, to see if someone I'd known as a college kid could actually be a talented writer.Murray is, indeed, a talented writer, and &quot;The Father and the Son&quot; is a fascinating tale, well-told. It speaks to the relationship between all parents and children: to parents' daunting realization that properly nurturing a child demands almost total sacrifice of self; to children's need to wholly possess their parents in order to feel truly loved. Even in the best circumstances, we can never fully meet our own and our children's needs and can only hope for resilience and forgiveness. Add in a few layers of loss and disappointment, and the task becomes even more complicated. A deep but distant love can't erase all the old hurts, but it does at least beg their forgiveness. At the end of Murray's story, I could do nothing but weep.It is, perhaps, not surprising that this memoir reveals so much about its author and at the same time so little. A writer's skill, a lonely child's protective mechanism. Murray undoubtedly has other tales he could tell about himself and his family, but the one he has given us is a gem."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"My wife, a catholic, and me, a Jew, could not put this book down. The writing is simple and real, the story is on the surface hard to believe, yet as you understand both the Father and the son's motivation, you reach the end of the book before you want it to be over. This could be another Angela's Ashes."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"I'm writing through tears brought forth by Matt Murray's moving (and funny) exploration of his relationship with his father and of his father's decision to become a priest and enter a monastery. The inquiry is honest and direct and the writing is clear, precise, and witty. Anyone who wants to know how to approach a relationship with an adult parent can learn from this book. I know, because I am Matt's brother, and in reading this book, I discovered a whole new family for myself."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"The Father and the Son is a compelling, lively narrative that addresses universal issues of faith, self-discovery, and parent-child relationships. Through Murray's eyes, we see his father's journey from being a husband, father, and civil servant to becoming a monk and a priest. More important, we come to understand that transformation. Murray describes his reaction to that journey with humor, warmth, and, at times, a reporter's skepticism."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"I am an agnostic and usually don't have much patience for books about religion/faith. But Matt's book was wry, sad and well researched, making it a compelling read. The chapters about his mother were moving and honest. Actually honesty about memories that at times must have been painful is one of the most redeeming qualities of this book. I would strongly recommend this book as a vivid recollection/recreation of the changes that could happen in any American family.And in the interest of full disclosure I have known the author for about six years. He is a colleague at The Wall Street Journal and a very good friend."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"I could not put the book down. It was a great story, well written, and fascinating. Matt's writing is cameralike and I felt like I was there in many of the episodes he describes. I loved his honest portrayal of his bratty self as an adolescent, and his parlay back and forth of his take on things, and then the opinions of others. I liked it as a story alone, but it is a great study of family life, religious conversion, and the relationships of parent and child. I am a mother of four sons and I was especially moved by the journal entrys of Michele, and the person they evoked."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"This book survived my failure as a book store owner. It is the very last book I own, that was part of the original inventory. And I have just finished reading it for the first time.In putting it down, I am humbled, I am haunted, I am shaken to the very core, that someone outside the Church is capable of writing so profoundly, about what goes on within it, and within the heart and mind of a person who is contemplating (much less accomplishing) monasticism. This book will haunt me to the end of my days in a wonderfully and fearfully, created way. Written by a Wall Street Journalist, about his father, who suddenly decides one day to become a monk, this book is an honest, no-holds barred, no gloves allowed look, at the way in which God often enters people's lives: suddenly, abruptly, and with no apology. He is the Creator after all.This book is a memoir, a fond remembrance of a boy for his beloved father, who left worldly life to become a monk. In the Roman Catholic tradition. For us Orthodox, our immediate reaction is 'Oh. How theologically incomplete.'And that is an incomplete analysis of one man's journey of faith, as entangled as that is, and can be, without all the trappings of theology. Our theological differences aside: this is the story of a man's journey toward the Truth, which is not just an idea, or an abstract concept. Our Lord said, 'I am the Way, the Truth and the Life'. Our Lord, as theologically confounding as He is, is a Person! A Person who cares bottomlessly for human beings. This is an unforgettable book; a profound and heart wrenching story of one man's pain, and another man's joy. It is about loss, grief, hope, joy, all the things that make human life worth living.For the Orthodox and Roman Catholic alike, I invite you to 'lay aside all earthly cares' and enter in to a family that is torn apart, and healed, by Hope.If you read nothing else this year, I hope you will read this. Leave the theological wrangling at the door where it belongs with our bishops."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"This must have been a difficult book for Matt Murray to undertake and complete; nonetheless, I think he did a great job. The book appeared to be an honest account and was well-written, as well. Everyone has a story and Matt Murray told us about his Dad's rare journey. I'm glad that I read this compellingly-written book."},{"Title":"The Father and the Son: My Father's Journey into the Monastic Life","review":"The premise behind Murray's book is certainly a fascinating one. The problem I had is that he never bothers to dig very far into the psychology of the father, never offers us more than a hazy, opaque figure at the center of the story. The father's thoughts, feeling and motivations remain unexplored, as if the author were reluctant to poke around too much into the man's private world. He thus remains more an archetype than a fully rounded human being. I'm afraid I have to agree with the Boston Globe, which said of the book: \\"It's an awkward story, awkwardly told. Not only do the multiple viewpoints pose a problem, but so does Murray's palpable unease with the subject, and a cliche-soaked style that frequently plummets into bathos and self-dramatizing.\\""},{"Title":"Israel (Countries of the World (Gareth Stevens))","review":"This book gives the reader an excellent picture of Israel today including previous wars (except over the past year).

By reading this and understanding what is going on in his time period, it helps me to better understand what is going on in the Quran, in Islam, and why thing are the way they are. or what event is being discussed.There are some words, events, places, that are new to my non-arab ears. so this book also helped me introduce into some of those as well. I would imagine it would be difficult for some one who has never read the Bible to just pick it up and read it. all the names and places would be so foreign and confusing to some one who had not grown up in around the church and was raised with the stories.

The Panzer divisions of the Waffen-SS were among the elite of German military units. All were well-equipped, well-trained and battle-hardened. They were helmed by men of fanatical devotion like Sepp Dietrich, Kurt Panzer Meyer, and Papa Hausser. The Panzers were a formidable force to be reckoned with at Normandy.Seeing the battles retold from the German side offers insight to students of World War history in general, and provides valuable context for understanding the movements and engagement of Western Allies--American, British and Canadian. My great uncles who spearheaded the Allied invasion of Normandy stood against the tide of these devoted and fanatical Germans, such as the 2nd SS Das Reich at Normandy. To garner a fuller appreciation for American sacrifices, it helps to recognize the dedication, ferocity and lethal efficiency of the Germans in the Waffen-SS. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Germans still possessed a lethal arsenal of well-armored equipment and well-trained, battle-hardened troops--many fresh veterans from the Eastern Front.Ripley chronicles the 12th SS Panzer Division's zealous defense of Caen. Here the 34 year-old officer Kurt Meyer demonstrated his battlefield prowess. Boasting that he would crush the Allied bridgehead at Normandy, he avowed, \\"Little fish! We'll throw them back into the sea in the morning!\\" His arrogance was matched by his ferocity and strategic mind for combat. Herein, we see the boldness and daring of men like Meyer. Meyer knew the Allies possessed superior air power, and their bombers could easily decimate their Panzers. Rather than leave his men vulnerable to bomber attacks, he ordered his Panzers to intermingle with British and Canadian tanks and infantry, and lay down a fierce counter-assault. Turbulent yet possessed of a soldier's composure, Meyer was a force to be reckoned with. Upon detaining Canadian prisoners-of-war, the 12th SS Hitlerjugend gained notoriety for its cruel ferocity as it promptly executed them. Allegations of such cruelty flew back and forth from both sides.Ripley tells of the exploits of the infamous Panzer Ace Michael Whittmann who gained renown for his lethal efficiency at decimating Allied tanks. General Montgomery responded to the stalwart defense of Caen by the 12th SS with Operation Perch in an attempt to exploit the gaps in German lines. The Germans reacted by repositioning its troops. A \`Tiger Trap' had been set, and German Panzers were ambushed at Villers-Bocage. Whittman fled his disabled tank on foot, and ran back to the German operations center, were he personally commandeered a response force of 15 Panzer IV's and promptly ordered them to clear the town of all British troops. At the expense of 4 Panzers, he retook the village, and sent Montgomery into a panic, as he withdrew the British 7th Armoured Division. Whittman later fell at Caen on 8 August, 1944 where he died in combat.Another narrative chapter includes an account of Willi Bittrich's II SS Panzer Corps resounding defeat of Operation Market Garden, which humiliated Montgomery, and left the Americans to bail out their indecisive and feeble British ally. An account of Hitler's desperate counter-offensive in the West in December 1944 at the Ardennes is made. There Field marshal Gerd von Rundstedt announced: \\"Soldiers of the Western Front! Your great hour has arrived! Large attacking armies have started against the Anglo-Americans. I do not have to tell you anything more than that. You feel it four yourself. WE GAMBLE EVERYTHING!\\" And gamble, the Germans did. Initially, the German attack was fierce, but quickly lost steam, and the Allied counterattack pushed it back, and left momentum in the Allies' hands.All things considered, British historian Tim Ripley has put together a well-written, brilliantly crafted history of the German tank battalions in the Second World War's Western Front. Contrary to political correctness, reading German accounts of the war is no sleight-of-hand, nor neglect of American patriotism. Understanding the potency and ferocity of these Panzer divisions gives one a fuller appreciation of the sacrifices born by the Allies in defeating Nazi Germany. And there is no better way to understand them, then reading these narrative accounts extracted from the German's own battlefield reports and personal journals."},{"Title":"Ss-Steel Rain","review":"This book was well laid out.

It contains chapters that will appeal to all types of new investigators who will need to deal with computer-related incidents, including law enforcement, corporate investigators, internal audit teams, and corporate incident teams. A strong International overview of the legal issues are also given for the United States, Europe, and Australia.This book provides a good overview of tool techniques, but does not give many details on how the techniques would actually be done with any tool. A detailed overview of three tools are given, but two of them are available to law enforcement only. The reader will finish this book with a solid understanding of the process that occurs during a computer investigation, but will still need additional books or training to start performing an investigation.The chapter on fraud is very informative, as the topic is not covered in other digital forensic books and the skills will likely be helpful for most investigators in the future. The \\"Computer Forensics in Law Enforcement and National Security\\" chapter describes the investigation process that any investigator would find useful, not just law enforcement as the title suggests. The \\"Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Forensics\\" chapter gives an overview of Intrusion Detection Systems and Logging, but little is mentioned on how to confirm an intrusion while minimizing the amount of evidence that is modified.This book will be useful as a first book to a new investigator who is looking to learn about the digital forensic process. This book will also be useful for technical managers and supervisors who will need to understand what their investigators are doing."},{"Title":"You Must Relax: [Practical Methods for Reducing the Tensions of Modern Living]","review":"When I purchased this book it was out of print.

He justified every technical point with in depth psycho-physiological analysis. What people seemed to have forgotten is that he could only obtain in depth physiological relaxation (e.g., lowering high blood pressure) by requiring an alternation between a three minute tension of one part of the body and a three minute loosening of that tension. We are far from most professionals who teach that method by encouraging to relax most parts of the body in ten minutes. Physiological relaxation seems to have requirements which are not those of the market. Because this point is clinically important, this book is not out of date. What is our of date are all the more recent books who think that relaxation technique is just an easy market which only aims at producing a soft comfortable relaxation. (Michael C.

The title of the book is YOU MUST RELAX. This is simply absurd, because the \\"must\\" is against relaxation - but such books can only sell in America. \\"Must\\" means activity, it is an obsession. Whenever there is a \\"must\\" an obsession is hidden behind it.There are actions in life, but there is no \\"must,\\" otherwise the \\"must\\" will create madness. \\"You must relax\\" - now relaxation has become the obsession. You have to do this posture and that, and lie down, and suggest to your body from the toes to the head; tell the toes, \\"Relax!\\" and then go upwards.Why \\"must\\"? Relaxation comes only when there is no \\"must\\" in your life. Relaxation is not only of the body, it is not only of the mind, it is of your total being.You are too much in activity, of course tired, dissipated, dried up, frozen. The life-energy doesn't move. There are only blocks and blocks and blocks. And whenever you do something you do itin a madness. Of course the need to relax arises. That's why so many books are written every month about relaxation, and I have never seen a person who has become relaxed through reading a book about relaxation - he has become more hectic, because now his whole life of activity remainsuntouched. His obsession is there to be active, the disease is there, and he pretends to be in a relaxed state so he lies down. All turmoil within, a volcano ready to erupt, and he is relaxing, following the instructions from a book: how to relax.There is no book that can help you to relax - unless you read your own inner being, and then relaxation is not a must.

This book tells you. I took it with me on a recent trip to New York and discovered that one of the buildings in which I was doing business (The Hippodrome) was built on the site of the late Hippodrome theatre, where many spectacular productions, including Billy Rose's Jumbo, where staged. Morrison obviously is an expert in both theatrical history and architecture, making his essays on the individual theatres informative and lively. The play is what we go to see, but the house in which it's staged is often critical to a play's success--as Morrison demonstrates on page after page. Broadway Theatres: History and Architecture has made a great addition to my theatrical library."},{"Title":"Broadway Theatres: History and Architecture","review":"This book serves as a great photo album of the many legitimate theatres, which were constructed over the last century in New York. The style of this book is almost identical to Nicholas Van Hoogstraten's LOST BROAWAY THEATRES, which makes me question its necessity (some of the photos are duplicated). However, Morrison's book has some omissions that I feel are inexcusable. Two major theatres are missing: The CENTRAL, Broadway and 47th St and The ASTOR, Broadway and 45th ST, along with several minor ones. Also there are some errors in text such as when Morrison claims the ERLANGER became the ST JAMES in 1951, in fact the name change was decades earlier. Another error occurs when Morrison states the HOLLYWOOD (later HELLINGER) sealed its Broadway entrance in 1934, this actually occurred when the house went \\"legit\\" during late 40s. Never mentioned in any of these books is the PICADILLY (later WARNER, where sound movie were introduced in 1926) and COLUMBIA (later MAYFAIR and DEMILLE) Theatres, which started as stage houses but spent most of their existence as movie houses. I do not understand the continued emphasis being placed on NY's Broadway theaters without ever giving the great Times Square movie palaces (ROXY, PARAMOUNT, CAPITOL, etc) their due. Because of their vast size and popularity, the movie palaces, attracted more people to the Times Square area than the legitimate stage can ever hope to. New York's movie palaces were the largest, most expensive and arguably the finest ever built and I feel it's about time their place in Times Square's history is properly acknowledged. BROADWAY THEATRES by William Morrison offers a fine overview of its topic for those who are marginally interested. But for others expecting more insight and accuracy, Morrison's book should only be used as a starting point."},{"Title":"Broadway Theatres: History and Architecture","review":"William Morrison's book covers 74 theaters from 1873 to 1932, including those demolished as well as those still standing. Most theaters get two pages of coverage, consisting mostly of b&amp;w photos of both the exterior and interior. The accompanying text emphasizes noteworthy performances. This book is a nice overview of the topic, although I preferred van Hoogstraten's &quot;Lost Broadway Theaters,&quot; which gives more information about the interior layouts, but doesn't cover theaters that are still standing."},{"Title":"Broadway Theatres: History and Architecture","review":"What a terrific book!

Bill Coverdale, \\"her old friend,\\" is helping her get to the bottom of the case. It turns out Robin O'Hara was a spy before he disappeared, and was onto something big. Since his death is in question, she cannot collect on her meager inheritance, so she should fall back to her rich, reclusive uncle for money; she cannot take any from Coverdale. This is the first Patricia Wentworth book where I figured out the solution by about page 50. If they had called in Miss Silver, she would have solved the case in her sitting room. I think she would have coughed discretely and slapped Meg. \\"Perhaps you should wake up and smell the coffee!\\" The only surprise was a character from another of her stories. There is good action, and a lot of twists to the plot.

For the most part over the past few centuries, there is a peaceful coexistence, but at times conflict arises. Keeping the naive scientific-centric humans safe is the job of the ultra top secret City Knights.Eve the darkest sorceress in centuries wants to come out of the closet and take control starting with New York City. She casts a spell to awaken and bind a monster so evil that malevolent sprites have watched over it. Now the sprites leave their subterranean chamber to cause havoc on the streets of New York. Former marine and recent City Knight recruit Billie Stein leads the counterassault against dangerous foes.ALL EVES HALLOWS is a tongue in cheek fantasy that uses hyperbole to tell a good vs. evil tale. The story line is fun to follow though at times inane as Billie sees things like trolls, but wonders if the burger did her in until the Knights enlist her. Billie is a terrific heroine, kind of like an ex marine chick lit star stuck in a world filled with monsters that only she seems to see until she meets her peers. Fans who appreciate a kick butt female champion fighting insurmountable odds against powerful malevolent mythical cretins will enjoy this lighthearted urban fantasy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"All Eve's Hallows: A City Knights Novel","review":"Good premise.

Schmitz' work to print. From my perspective this has been a successful and welcome undertaking. This book is particularly welcome, not because it is the best (it is not, not by a long shot), but because it contains some of the most obscure of Schmitz' stories. Fans of Schmitz, like me, spent much time in used book stories finding his work before the recent reprint series -- and in that way it was relatively easy to collect most of the Telzey stories, the Trigger stories, and books like _Agent of Vega_ and _The Demon Breed_. But it was much harder to find stuff like \\"The Ties of Earth\\", a long novella only published as a two-part magazine serial, or \\"Captives of the Thieve-Star\\", a novelette which prefigures in some way Schmitz' later female characters, but which was only ever published in a 1951 issue of the classic pulp Planet Stories. But _Endless Frontier_ collects all of Schmitz' short fiction that had not previously been reprinted -- including some stories from mystery magazines. It also includes Schmitz last (and by far weakest) novel, _The Endless Frontiers_. My rating for the book is based more on its appeal to its intended audience -- Schmitz fans -- than on its intrinsic merits. It's fair to say that the earlier Baen reprints gathered the bulk of his best work -- it's easy to see why some of these stories haven't seen the light of day in a while. But for those of us who have learned to love his work, this is an invaluable way to get those tantalizing few stories we haven't yet found.That said, there are some very fine pieces here. The above-mentioned longer stories, \\"The Ties of Earth\\" and \\"Captives of the Thieve-Star\\", are both very uneven, but even if they don't work completely, they have some nice bits. And among the shorter stories are some first-rate pieces. Many of these are in the section the editors have called \\"Dark Visions\\" -- Schmitz usually went for fairly conventional happy endings, but in these stories the horrific implications of some of Schmitz' ideas are fully explored. Especially good is \\"We Don't Want Any Trouble\\", a very neat SF horror story about an alien invasion. Another fine alien invasion story is \\"These are the Arts\\". Schmitz wrote some crime fiction as well, often for the SF magazines, but also in mystery magazines. Stories like \\"Ham Sandwich\\", about a slick operator running a psi scam, and \\"Where the Time Went\\", about a very different SFnal crime, are clever and enjoyable.Even the lesser stories here are generally breezily enjoyable. This book probably isn't a good choice for your first Schmitz book, but if you try the more famous ones and find you like his stuff, it's a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Eternal Frontier","review":"This novel is one of my two favorite Schmitz titles (the other being The Demon Breed). I last read it back in the early 80's - my hometown public library had a copy, titled &quot;The Eternal Frontier&quot; - and have been looking for it ever since; I'm delighted to see it back in print.It's the story of a group of colonists on an unexplored world, who confront a mysterious and malevolent alien presence. My strongest memory of the book is the creeping sense of suspense the author builds throughout the novel.Unlike the huge majority of Schmitz stories, [The] Eternal Frontier is not part of the Federation of the Hub cycle, so you won't see these characters in any of his other work. Still, it's one of his very best."},{"Title":"Eternal Frontier","review":"This is a comprehensive collection of short works, written between the 40s and the 70s (but mostly in the 40s and 50s). Unlike many of the short stories from that period, these could have been written yesterday.Even the novel included in the book is very short by today's standards, and would be considered a modern &quot;novella&quot;.These are all non-Hub, non-Vega, non-Karres stories. Some are even not Science Fiction. But they are all great. As the co-editor Guy Gordon wrote in an earlier book, &quot;There's just something about a Schmitz story...&quot;This is the sixth of a seven-book reissue of all of Schmitz's work. Get it. Get two, in fact, if you even plan to loan it out. It probably won't come back to you if you let someone else get their hands on it!"},{"Title":"Eternal Frontier","review":"I think this one dates from 1973. It is a very good crime story. It has always been obscure and difficult to find but deserves more light of day. I couldn't put this down when I read it.

Particularly useful is the appendix which lists all of Schmitz's published works, along with the publication where they first appeared (and the volume # of the Baen re-issues in which they reappear). Baen did SF readers everywhere a great service by re-issuing ALL of Schmitz's work in this seven-volume series--except for one obscure collaboration with A. E. Van Vogt.That being said, if you have not read Schmitz before, this is not the place to start. The stories here are not his best, and his short novel Eternal Frontiers is his last and least charming. I recommend starting with one of his other novels, either the ever-popular The Witches of Karres or The Demon Breed, which makes my personal Ten Best list of SF novels."},{"Title":"10 Downing Street (Gamekeeper Series, Book 3) (Gamekeeper Trilogy)","review":"In book 3 of the Gamekeeper Series, Mr. Putnam really ups the pace. For all the readers who kept saying they were reading the same stories over and over again, and nothing truly new was being written, Mr. Putnam is what you asked for. The characters, both historical figures and new creations, have depth and personality far beyond those of most authors. The book abounds with imagination and highly interesting new concepts. The reading is smooth, fun, and impossible to put down. I highly recommend the series to those readers who are imaginative themselves."},{"Title":"10 Downing Street (Gamekeeper Series, Book 3) (Gamekeeper Trilogy)","review":"I had worried that by book three the brilliant Dave Putnam would have run out of steam in his Gamekeeper Series. I needn't have feared as 10 Downing Street continues with the English Commonwealth controlling most of the Earth and a communist conspiracy existing which builds toward a massive World War II. It is more than just capitalism against communism and Putnam reveals he can just as handily explore different economic systems as he has done so beautifully in dealing with politics, war, working with animals, and especially religion. The alternate world series continues with the addition of new characters and making excellent use of old ones from the first two books. Winston Churchill again reigns supreme, at least for a while as this book covers a great number of years. More time is spent with the most interesting Albert Einstein. You find Dwight D. Eisenhower, Rommel, and George Patton as well. Historical figures are dealt with in a way that will convince the reader that the author knows his history. The fictional ones are as real and alive as any you'll find in the very best of novels. He also doesn't make the mistake of bringing in characters that could not have been born after history took a major twist in the 1890's. The work is brilliant, there are twists and surprises and even the sometimes too long technical descriptions are interesting. The author also knows how to tell decent love stories and to treat women as human beings. Toward the end there is a touch of Asimov and Clement, however I don't want to be a spoiler. What I like best is that unlike Turtledove and some other science fiction authors, Putnam isn't afraid to make religion and the fact that God exists as a vital part of his universe as it is in our real universe. As a Christian I did not agree with all the views expressed, but I was not offended as the three books have the feel of being written with love. The best news is that a 4th book follows and I will order it just as soon as I post this review. Dave Putnam's novels deserve to be considered classics."},{"Title":"10 Downing Street (Gamekeeper Series, Book 3) (Gamekeeper Trilogy)","review":"This novel is by far Dave Putnam's best work. I was hopelessly drawn to the gripping plot, and was unable to put the book down.

It is an intriguing story of her personal ordeal over five long years, caught up in the sometimes faceless and inhumane global political conflicts of a dramatic time in world history, early in the Cold War era, and at the height of America's anti-communist McCarthy terrorism. Erica Wallach's vivid memories of her long ordeal provide a compelling portrayal of a critical period in the formation of America's current international political position, and of a very intimate battle for survival and personal integrity.

After beating the white man, the Hawaiian Homestead men retrieved the pup and killed it. They received a six-month jail sentence for cruelty to animals. When visiting Hawaii, remember: White man, don't let the sun go down on you around the Hawaiian Homestead lands."},{"Title":"Small Prices","review":"A few weeks after receiving a copy of Small Prices, the CEO of the bank that contained the vault with organized crime's jewelry robbery loot, the Murder for Hire Gang's police-cleansed firearms and other underworld trafficking items, suddenly sold over US $25 Million worth of his shares in the national bank.

He also did it as a Christian scholar in a non-Christian land during times of great change in Japanese society. It is a wonderful cross-cultural and cross-theological comparison between Christian and non-Christian belief systems. There's a saying about being able to explain things that are Zen. &quot;If you can explain it, it isn't Zen,&quot; if I may paraphrase. Zen and Bushido are inextricably linked and Mr. Nitobe managed to put it into some sort of framework that we could easily understand. Not all things will make sense to the first time reader. When you read it again and again, the things that are true for you, you will clearly understand. As with many discussions of Zen and/or Bushido, it has to become a part of you to be understandable. This doesn't mean you have to pick up a sword or take up calligraphy, it means that you have to see the truth of it in yourself, no matter what you do or where you are. There are universal truths here. Even when you understand, you may not be able to put into words your understanding. That is the time when this book will become most indispensible."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"Nitobe's book is an excellent read for anyone who wants a comprehensive look at the pulse of what drives the Japanese to produce and achieve in war and economics. His writing style is clean and practical rather than sophisticated or complicated. He emphasizes the virtues and concepts that make up the Bushido ethnic.This book is a superb companion piece to Ruth Benedict's sociological analysis on Japanese culture (The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, printed near or after the Second World War). I strongly encourage anyone interested in the formative aspects of Japanese thought to read this book."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"This book is great for those who are unfamiliar, with the way of life of the samurai, and the population as a whole in fuedal Japan. Siting similarities with other cultures great histories, it provides a contrast which brings better understanding to the subject. I would also suggest Zen and Japanese Culture by Daisetz T.Suzuki, for an even deeper look into the culture of Japan and its roots."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"No, really. Bushido is not a science and it's not easy to understand. It is made up of many parts, each designed to carefully balance each other. Justice, Courage and Loyalty are just some of the ingredients needed to be added in just the right amounts. Too much can be as bad as too little. A man worried just about Justice might forget about Benevolence and a man worried about Honor might forget about Politeness.Bushido is not like a coat, that you can put on and take off, but a way of life. A Master Chef does not just practice his art on the weekend - and neither does a Samurai."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"I picked this little gem up in Kyoto a few years back, and was glad I did. Nitobe attempts to describe to a Western mindset the essence of Bushido. He brings up many comparisons and parallels between the Japanese and Western culture, in an attempt to bridge the gap of understanding between them.However, with all due respect to this classic, it still falls short of actually DEFINING Bushido. Several examples and anecdotes are set fourth, and scenarios involving Bushido conduct are described. However, in the end, the reader is left with a somewhat vague feeling, as if something is still missing.This is not a book of code in a sense of providing the reader a set of rules, idioms, and behaviors to follow. If you approach this text with some pre-concevied notion of learning the ways of the warrior, you will find yourself disappointed.To get a clearer understanding of Bushido, should you be so inclined, I would recommend the Hagakure as supplementary reading."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"Quite a few studies of the samurai ethos floating about by now, but I would consider this one of the two or three must-reads in the field, along with Tsunetomo Yamamoto's book.Despite what the copyright date says, this was written in 1905 by a renowned scholar in the field (a Japanese Christian), originally in English. Unlike Yamamoto, the author is fluent with the history of Western philosophy and approaches his subject from that angle.Unlike other samurai books, it's not like this is a collection of advice on how to be an honorable samurai. The whole thing seems to be an attempt at a historical monograph addressed to a Western student. The author states his goals in chapter one: \\"My attempt is . . . to relate firstly, the origin and sources of our chivalry; secondly, its character and teaching; thirdly, its influence among the masses; and, fourthly, the continuity and permanence of its influence.\\"It is quite elegantly written. Take this, from the first paragraph:\\"Chivalry is a flower no less indigenous to the soil of Japan than its emblem, the cherry blossom; nor is it a dried-up specimen of an antique virtue preserved in the herbarium of our history. It is still a living object of power and beauty among us, and if it assumes no tangible shape or form, it none the less scents the moral atmosphere and makes us aware that we are still under its potent spell. The conditions of society which brought it forth and nourished it have long disappeared; but as those far-off stars which once were and are not, still continue to shed their rays upon us, so the light of chivalry, which was a child of feudalism, still illuminates our moral path, surviving its mother institution.\\"Fortunately, the whole thing isn't written in this vein, but it is carefully written.One thing worth nothing: the book came out in 1905, when a newly industrializing Japan had just bonked the Russian giant over the head. As a result of this, Nitobe takes quite the high tone with the samurai tradition, never really looking at its dark side. No, it is the source of everything great in Japanese culture.There are reports of American soldiers taking over villages in the Pacific during WWII, in which the women and children (their men having been killed), rather than submit to the dishonor of being captured in battle, hurled themselves and their infants over cliffs, to the astonishment of the American GIs.Things like this were also a by-product of bushido, are they not?However, if you feel that, in any meaningful discussion of a chivalric tradition, unsavory aspects such as this need to be addressed, then you won't find what you're looking for in Nitobe's book."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"This book was a laborious read. It was a century ago and the writing style is archaic and the formal logic in the arguments is flawed. I found it difficult and tedious and would not recommend it unless it is required reading for a class, as this was."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"What??? (review title quoted from p55)After reading all the poor quality reviews praising this book, do not assume it is even remotely on par with any of the great treaties on Bushido. If you Search Inside and look at the Table of Contents, most of the Bushido tenants are related with archaic western analogies, and it is really a giant stretch to argue that this book is great in any way. It is easily the worst and dullest warrior philosophy book I have ever read, and it is a slow and painful slog to the finish. For modern students of martial arts this book is worthless, and you will do a lot better with any of the recommendations I list at the bottom.On every other page bushido is polluted by the author's western religious views, as he tries to convey a very difficult concept (Bushido) to an ignorant 19th century western audience. I was looking for bushido, not religion; its unbearable. The Search Inside feature will demonstrate exactly what I am referring to. Is nothing sacred in this world? Here's the last paragraph of the intro:\\"Even in Japan, Christianity, unwrapped from its foreign mould and matting, will cease being an exotic and strike its roots deep in the soil on which Bushido has grown. Stripped alike of its swaddling bands and its foreign regimentals, the church of the founder will be as native as the air.\\"So in a book who's title suggests a tribute to bushido, the author is rejoicing in the arrival of western religion that will destroy it? This book kills me. I give it 2-stars simply because there is an occasional expression of Japanese thought or a small but very rare historical anecdote. Whether I liked it or not, the book has earned a place as a piece of history, but only because no one in the 19th century produced anything better that was widely distributed in the west. Mencius and Confucious are frequently quoted, but again, if that was what I was looking for I already have the primary sources. Here are the only 2 quality quotations that appears in the book:(p119) \\"I, and I alone, unwarrantably gave the order to fire on the foreigners at Kobe, and again as they tried to escape. For this crime I disembowel myself, and I beg you who are present to do me the honor of witnessing the act.\\"(p35)\\"Kenshin, who fought for 14-years with Shingen, when he heard of the latter's death, wept aloud at the loss of \\"the best of enemies.\\" He then recounts the \\"Salt\\" story which is told much more accurately in other sources.Also, for the record, the above quoted sentence was preceded by a tangential discourse relating the \\"sorrow\\" of Antony & Octavius on the news of the death of Brutus. How can the author relate the two? Antony and Octavius were determined to see Brutus dead. Shingen held kenshin in the highest esteem, and would gladly have welcomed defeating him on the battlefield, but he hardly could have felt good hearing of the mans passing. This is a terrible comparison. After the Salt story he then returns to Romans and ends in a Nietzsche.Other than the very short paragraph on Kenshin & Shingen, the only thing I found of value was a good description of the Seppuku ritual. Better bushido books include Hagakure, Ideals of the Samurai, Budoshoshinsu, Training the Samurai Mind, and Code of the Samurai. Great books that deal with Zen & the martial arts include The Life Giving Sword, The Demon's Sermon on the Martial Arts, and The Unfettered Mind.Spare yourself, and don't believe the hype."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"Bushido has become my way of life because of the author and this book.The author writes with such eloquence and descriptive style that I could only hope to oe day achieve what Dr. Nitobe has written. I beleive this book should be required reading for every young warrior because its didactic tone change my life and gave me an epifany on life. This is a book that is important to all aspects of life and gives a well rounded opinion of the contrast to western thought concerning Bushido. I fully recommend this book for all young upcoming warriors and intellects."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"Japan is a story full of beautiful lies. Likewise, Inazo Nitobe's \\"Bushido: the Soul of Japan\\" is all about beautification and cultural namedropping, far from a good scholarly work on samurai warrior ethic and aesthetic. Yet it was a timely romantic attempt to reshape samurai folklore into a state folklore, at a time when Japan was reinventing itself as a culturally sanctioned nation-state in emulation of Western imperial aspirations, in the midst of the age of invented traditions, which included Victorian morality and royalty, America's Manifest Destiny, Hindu Renaissance and the Meiji Restoration of Japan itself, where young samurai wonks recycled the long-forsaken imperial divinity by painting a halo over his head.Nitobe's \\"Bushido\\" gave birth to a samurai-faced knightly superior-man, whose existential priority was loyalty and duty, who practiced justice, decency and fairness, with high cultural sensibility as to care for mind-tuning tea ceremony, to rejoice at the seasonal view of cherry blossom and even to feel the inanimate spirit of the sword, and more important, with a heart of steel, well disciplined, well poised, to sacrifice himself for a cause larger than life, much like a Victorian gentleman who assumed the nobility of noblesse oblige.Too beautiful to believe, this Nitobe's samurai discourse reads more like a self-ingratiating Machiavellian scheme, ingratiating himself to Japan, while ingratiating Japan to the West, particularly the Anglo-Saxon West, then bent on reinventing itself with the romantic ideals of medieval knighthood, while exercising asymmetrical violence on colonial subjects in the name of civilizing mission, with much social Darwinian preoccupation with fitness and superiority, all of which Japan and Nitobe himself, as a scholar and a colonial planner, learned and emulated - with a great degree of craftiness and craftsmanship.Nitobe's samurai discourse was an illicit attempt, like matching a dovetail with a dog tail. He tried to match the unidimensional samurai principle with the multidimensional Western military culture and philosophy by stretching the samurai template thin and wide until it covered all aspects of Japanese tradition and society, ending up with a confusing message: that the bushido is about all the admirable things Japanese. To connect Japan and the West, his glue was the power of association, not necessarily scholarly insight, as in his comparison of the rose and the cherry blossom.Further, his method of textual reinforcement was an excessive, almost compulsory, use of namedropping, revoking more than 140 names of Western cultural eminence, plus 20 Japanese names, including government big wigs. The overall effect is the appearance of dazzling endorsement from Western intellect, contemporary and classical, over a decontextualized, dehistoricized discourse on samurai culture and philosophy - the genesis of a modern myth of samurai's international stature and his high moral sensibility, complete with a selfless, self-immolating resolution.In reality, samurai's moral history is one of self-deception and self-veneration, part of the larger millenniums-long history of contact and conquest, where hunter-gatherer prequel lost to soldier-farmer sequel. Their moral authority, first the emperor, later the shogunate, had never renounced its \\"barbarian-subduing\\" tradition. The worship of martial prowess, in the form of cultic veneration of bladed weapons, from archeological stone daggers to state of the art steel swords, was the core principle of a bloody-minded soldier-farmer society.Predatory warfare was the norm well into the medieval eras; head-hunting brutality overshadowed self-immolating nobility; tricky foul play prevailed over \\"fair play.\\" For the most part, beautiful samurai stories were later peace-time embellishment, through the mouths of samurai-turned storytellers. Similarly, the teachings of samurai philosophy and swordsmanship secrets were the morning-after sophistication through Zen-driven brainstorming, mind-emptying, mind-mastering, masterminding strategy.Confucian scholars would criticize samurai as lowlifes committed to robbery - a gangsta culture in today's language, while nativist ideologues, anti-Confucian and anti-Chinese, boosted the samurai ethos under the \\"Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians\\" slogan. For them, Japan with samurai macho was a true central kingdom to replace a meek culture-centric China. The Meiji Restoration refurbished the ancient imperium, while dismantling the samurai institution altogether. In the late 19th century, however, the old samurai idiosyncrasy came back, with a new face now challenging the West, under the generic name of bushido.The modern bushido was a culture mix of everything Japanese, from the imperial veneration to samurai's soldierly ethos to Buddhist and Confucian practices, with a singular emphasis on selfless self-immolation as Japanese spiritual tradition, which was skillfully posited against a so-called self-centric, materialistic Western civilization - a toxic pattern of binary thinking that continued to haunt the Japanese ever since, even after the defeat in World War II.Nitobe's \\"Bushido,\\" although written and published abroad, was apparently under the influence of the bushido \\"boom\\" of the time, which included not only the journal publication, but the publication of old samurai stories and the renewed interests in the old popular entertainment of samurai storytelling and theatricals. Nitobe's \\"Bushido\\" text reveals his subtextual use of the prevailing samurai narrative, when he recounts his favorite samurai saga, where the overall Victorian quality of orality disrupts to give way to some extraneous quality of Japanese storytelling orality.Nitobe's \\"Bushido\\" was indeed a romantic attempt to raise Japan's street-level folklore narrative to the heights of Western philosophical and theological discourse. The same audacity helped the wartime intellect to further ennoble and embolden the exercise of \\"utopian violence,\\" with their \\"world-class\\" theories of Japanese civilization, along with the gaga publication of samurai stories and dramas, most of which came down to us through endless remaking and recasting.Nitobe's \\"Bushido,\\" still celebrated with overt canonization and retro-publication, is a living evidence of the inner history of modern Japan, where the soul of a nation was invented more than once, on the hazy ground of semi-fiction, by reference to the past, by comparison with the West, to conform, not to history, but to the needs of the moment, with high ideals and aesthetic sophistication, but, alas, without serious soul-searching. This is a story of window shopping and window dressing, ending up yet again with a soulless nation still dreaming: We are Samurai Japan."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"I picked up a copy of this book a few months ago in part because I had just been employed by a Japanese company and I felt it was in my best interest to deepen my understanding of Bushido as it is still an important part of Japanese culture and more specifically corporate culture. Inazo Nitobe's treatment of Bushido is unfortunately shallow. He innumerates a number of \\"virtues\\" that are important in Bushido but does not dig very deeply into them. After reading about half of the book I feel that I do not have a deeper understanding of some of the peculiar quirks of Japanese culture.If one is looking to deepen their understanding of Bushido I would suggest Sir George Sansom's three volume set \\"A History of Japan\\", as it is yet the standard in Japanese historical studies. Also, \\"Training the Samurai Mind\\" is a wonderful collection of translated primary documents written by samurai who lived primarily during the Edo period. Also, Miyamoto Musashi's \\"Book of Five Rings\\" is another useful book for those interested in samurai and Bushido.If one is simply interested in depending their understanding of Japanese culture I suggest undertaking a study of Confucianism, Buddhism, Shinto, and of course Sansom's books. Nitobe's book is unfortunately a giant waste of time."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"It's a great work originally published in 1905. Mr. Nitobe describes the features of Bushido excellently, but his work would be much greater if he defined Bushido explicitly (for example, he could make a chapter titled like \\"What is Bushido?\\"). Nevertheless, this book is of high value as a gateway to understanding Bushido spirit."},{"Title":"Bushido: The soul of Japan","review":"The Bushido code was a death cult embued with a Zen like spiritof masochistic self-denial and repression of self in slavelike devotion to one's Master, usually a greedy, self-servingdaimyo who cared for nothing but personal power and the ruthlesscontrol of those under him. Women were mere chattel in theBushido tradition, objects for gratification. The trueSamurai consorted only with attractive boys and thought thathomosexual devotion was the greatest form of erotic pleasureand romantic involvement, similar to the Spartans of ancientGreece.When you strip away all the faux spiritualism you getthe age old need for domination and contempt for those whowere weaker. Japan had a long history of civil war whendifferent Bushido tribes fought for regional control, ultimatelyresulting in the Edo era when the Tokugawa family finallyunified the nation in what was a medieval straitjacket fromwhich no one would escape. It was an era of 'peace' andisolation during which the nation was held in a totalitariangrip of feudalistic hegemony. Pity that this system isgradually taking root in Japan again today!!"},{"Title":"Slow Coming Dark: A Novel of the Age of Clinton","review":"Intrigue, suspense, corruption, violence and strange bedfellows all make H.A. Covington's new novel &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; a delightful and gripping read.More than that, Covington delivers a shocking moral message as a bonus to readers who expect to read about good-guys versus bad-guys competing in a conventional shoot-'em-up action story.The lifelike characteristics of the protagonists and their life-experiences seem to echo from the shadowy corners of Covington's past. As the colorful and well-developed characters are unveiled, one gets the impression they at one time manifested themselves incarnate to torment and titillate the author and those around him.Covington digs deep into the psyche and psychosis of political correctness to weave a tale of people and events that smack more of reality than fiction. Evil is assigned to those who abuse power and wreak havoc with the delicate balance of nature and civilization, while the forces of justice and goodness issue from the dark caverns of organized crime and sullied law enforcement.Justified by the virtues of street ethics, loyalty and honor, and motivated by a common cause, disenfranchised cops and revenge-seeking Mafia gangsters team up to expose and topple a treasonous U.S. president, his vindictive, lesbian wife and their gun-toting minions.Covington skillfully develops multi-competing scenarios that entangle the reader in a web of breathtaking suspense. Unlike pulp fiction of the same genre, the author does not drag his readers through boring, insignificant sidebars to arrive at trivial intersections throughout the story. The story line flows rapidly and gingerly as the eye races ahead of itself in appreciation of poignant dialogue. At each turn the reader is rewarded with unexpected, fearful and gratifying conclusions.It's one of those novels you hate to put down. When you do your mind reels in anticipation of your next encounter with the characters. And when you finish the story you feel a sense of emptiness, coupled with gratification. You also feel as though you have just received an awakening slap in the face.Reality sets in at the conclusion of the story. &quot;This could happen,&quot; you'll mutter privately. And you'll doubt the world about you. &quot;Did it really happen, in perhaps another way?&quot; You'll know which parts are true to life. And you'll wonder which parts are fiction -- or worse yet, which ones merely haven't happened yet.As good as the story is, and as well as it is written, it brushes too close to the truth. Look for it to be denounced everywhere. It's just not politically correct to impugn the integrity, morals and ethics of William Jefferson Clinton, his wife Hillary and the absolute power and corruption they mutually wield in the story.The truth indeed makes strange bedfellows of us all:Perhaps those who read &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; before it is forever quashed by the forces of political correctness will see how very different mainstream Americans are from the Washington power brokers and the sanctioned purveyors of treachery and hate."},{"Title":"Slow Coming Dark: A Novel of the Age of Clinton","review":"I was a supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton through thick and thin, until about three weeks ago when they finally crossed my own personal bottom line by blatantly selling a pardon to a major white collar criminal for camnpaign cash, and then by their looting of our nation's White House like fleeing 18th-century monarchs one step ahead of the mob with pitchforks and torches. Their whole exit was just TACKY, if you get my drift, so it's possible that I was somehow spiritually ready to read H. A.

Covington's novel &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; quite favorably, as a book that gave me a great deal of personal pleasure. &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; is different. I will probably be accused of hyperbole, but it is my genuine belief that the time will come when &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; is recognized as an American classic, a thunderous and historic indictment of an entire epoch comparable to &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.The frightening thing about &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; is that it is so POSSIBLE. There is not one single episode in this book which we may not yet discover actually did take place in some similar form during the past eight years, when the White House has been occupied by the most manifestly morally unfit man ever to sit in the Oval Office.It is a book about desperate resistance to a tyranny which has become so intolerable that even the line between gangster and lawman becomes blurred in a ferocious attempt to thwart the will of a tyrant, made by angry men who each for their own reason have decided that the time has come to stand. This is very much a novel of black and white, of right and wrong, and I for one think we need to return at least some part of the way to such concepts. In &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, Matt Redmond was a fascinating and sympathetic protagonist: in &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; he is a hero. The plot moves like a river of fire and the action thrills.

One of the things I have always been afraid of about the Age of Clinton is that given the difficulty which dissenters have experienced in making the facts of this disgraceful administration known to the public even as they occurred, the thought of what will happen in future when the liberal elitist intellectual and academic establishment takes over the recounting is horrifying. We have been drowning in spin and moral relativism for the past eight years. Covington has insured that there will be at least one small island of divergent viewpoint to survive the massive tidal wave of liberal hogwash which will descend upon us over the next generation, as the establishment tries to re-write history and air-brush Clinton's high crimes and misdemanors out of the picture.But beyond that, &quot;Slow Coming Dark&quot; is just plain one hell of a riveting and enjoyable read. He puts it all together, plot and character and dialogue and the whole just flows down as smooth as Tennessee sipping whisky. You close this book wanting more; I'm about to start into &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; now and I know I won't be disappointed.

For the Conservative, this should be on the bookshelf somewhere near Barry Goldwater's The Conscience of the Conservative.While I'm no economist, the details about the economy and taxes were pretty detailed, and I really have no idea where these concepts are today, with regard to the numbers of the 2000's and not the 1970's. If you prefer to just read the good nuts and bolts of Conservative politics, pick up this book and just read Chapters 1, 3, and 10.

Why then do so many learners, especially those in the higher grades, have such trouble mastering and retaining new information? The answer is easy. The youth of today has known a world of \\"fast-impulse learning,\\" ie: computers, MTV, and rapid multi-messaged music. That pace is natural and comfortable to this new generation, and it has evolved that \\"solid learning\\" can only be done along new guidelines.How do we get schools to understand this dilemma? How do we help new teachers and uninformed teachers to help our future adults/parents? Mastering brain principle-based education takes substantial time, much effort, and considerable expense. These \\"costs\\" are so steep that by the very nature, overwhelmed teachers are repelled.Dr. Ron Fitzgerald has provided the world with a logical, effective, and critically important \\"first step.\\" To insure solid learning, \\"Smart Teaching,\\" written in a brain-compatible method, is the ideal vehicle for ANY teacher to redirect his/her methods to reach all learners with \\"no child left behind.\\"As an English teacher who has studied with Dr. Fitzgerald, researched brain-based learning/teaching, applied these strategies to business, literature, and basic English classes, I can state unequivocally that this system is THE MOST EFFECTIVE and brain-appropriate vehicle for learning that we have.Having mastered the lessons of \\"Smart Teaching,\\" ANY educator cansuccessfully accomplish the following:*Reach ALL learners*Address the Multiple Intelligences in a class*Address diverse Learning Modalities*Incorporate a repertoire of charts, graphs, and other visual tools to complement traditional vehicles*Build student self-esteem*Increase student reading abilities in document and quantitative styles as well as prose*Build solid writing skills in students who traditionally fear this art*Motivate students to use Statistical Analysis as a measuring tool*Model for learners the process of consistent self-improvement*Teach students to self-assess, self-adjust, and improve finished work*Develop an awareness of the \\"magic of literature\\"*Build an understanding in young people of their brain functions and how such activities affect their decisions*Prepare the youth of today for the unknown world of work of which they will soon be a part\\"Smart Teaching: Using Brain Research and Data to Continually Improve Learning\\" - the road to success!Sebastian R.

All too often, teachers today use the same methods that they used thirty or forty years ago; recognizing the need for flexibility, and the importance of taking a student's learning style into account, Smart Teaching promotes a system for improving student achievement with an emphasis on practical application. Built around fundamental principles such as \\"Instruction is more effective if well-planned to achieve specific purposes\\", \\"Students learn more if they are motivated first\\", and \\"Documented success encourages more success\\", Smart Teaching spells out methodical techniques for motivating students, preparing students, providing style choices, checking and adjusting student progress, and much more. A wealth of diagrams and figures succinctly illustrate key points, and an accompanying CD-ROM includes full-color PDF and PowerPoint slides ideal for in-service training.

None has been as comprehensive, informative, practical and useful as \\"Smart Teaching: Brain Research and Data to Continuously Improve Learning\\" by Ron Fitzgerald. Most books on assisting teachers that I have encountered are very theoretical, and in some cases not very pragmatic. What sets this book ahead of the rest is the fact that it offers a practical and comprehensive system for classroom teaching utilizing the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle used by world-class companies as a tool for continuous improvement. This system really works!As a high school teacher, a college professor, and an industry trainer, I have used the eight components outlined in this book and they have yield amazing quality results in the student learning. The system is divided into suggestion areas that can be worked on individually. SMART TEACHING provides concrete guidance in each area. It also contains useful hand-outs and a list of resources.This manual outlines processes that represent a very powerful tool for boosting student learning, and it is a manual that any K-12 teacher, college professor, and industry trainer can use with great ease to move from \\"good teaching\\" to \\"great teaching\\" in keeping with the theme of Quality in Education."},{"Title":"Oxford Reader's Companion to Dickens","review":"This is an essential reference book for any serious student or reader of Dickens, though I would strongly recommend that one take the extra effort to obtain a copy in hardcover rather than paper. The two editions are entirely different productions. If one had held both editions on one's hand, the differences are blatant, but merely reading about them will not reveal how profoundly they vary from one another. The paperback has a single virtue: price. It is cheaper by a considerable margin. Looking at the pagination, one might imagine that the paper edition contains everything found in the hardback. The paper edition runs to 675 pages, while the hardback runs to 654. The hardback, however, in addition to being a far more attractive volume and containing some sections in a larger, more easily read typeface, contains a host of photographs, illustrations, and maps that greatly enhance the value of the volume. I would like to point out that while the hardback lists for $55.00, it can persistently be found on Amazon for far less than that. I obtained my copy remaindered on Amazon for $16.95, which is the same as the list price for the paperback.I can't say enough about the quality of the articles in this volume. Top Dickens scholars from around the world have been recruited to write on a host of subjects, in particular on subjects that will cast light on the world in which Dickens lived and about which he wrote. Although his books are certainly not neglected, the emphasis is as much on Dickens and his world as on Dickens and his books. The goal of the book is clearly an understanding of Dickens in context, with the added belief that knowing his context will immeasurably deepen one's enjoyment and understanding of his works.My lone complaint with the book is the book does not contain a usable index or list of characters. There is an alphabetical list of all characters in Dickens's books at the end, but such a list only tells you what work a character appears in, not who they are. If you are dipping back into a novel of Dickens with the intent of enjoying a chapter or two (as opposed to rereading the entire work from beginning to end), one might not remember whom a particular individual is. It would have been nice to have a one or two line explanation of whom each character is, in addition to what work in which they appeared. I believe this would have enhanced the value of this as a reference work.The inherent problem of any reference work like this will be the degree to which it is usable. There is a host of information, but how can it be accessed and recovered? This volume suffers to some degree, but Paul Schlicke has gone to great lengths to multiply the number of aides to teasing out the book's information. The articles are organized alphabetically, but there is a wealth of indexes. There is, for instance, a &quot;Classified Contents List,&quot; that has headings such as &quot;Dickens's Reputation,&quot; and subheadings under that like &quot;Critics and scholars of Dickens&quot; and &quot;Scholarly and critical approaches to Dickens,&quot; with titles of articles under each. By reading those articles, one finds the information one needs. There is some overlap with the book's index (which tends to refer to article titles rather than page numbers--perhaps that was in order to accommodate both the hardback and paperback editions, which have different pagination) and the &quot;Classified Contents List,&quot; but these provide two different approaches to obtaining the information one needs.This is not the only book on Dickens that a reader of Dickens would want to own. One would certainly want to refer to a biography by someone like Peter Ackroyd or Edgar Johnson, or perhaps a critical appreciation like that of G. K. Chesterton. But I would definitely place it on the short list of books that one would like to own."},{"Title":"Oxford Reader's Companion to Dickens","review":"The Oxford Readers Companion to Charles Dickens serves as an alphabetical tour of the life of the greatest novelist of the Victorian Era.

But as Dr Lowen points out, excess comes from a real inability to experience pleasure, and a subsequent desperate attempt to force things.Like almost all of Lowen's books, this one is so full of understanding that it is worth reading over and over. However, it is also so well written that it does not require the rereading to be comprehended. This is also Lowen's first book that didn't include a lot Freudian psychology. Instead it relies on common sense everyday observation that the reader can verify for her or himself.Pleasure is simply the human experience when the living process is supported and not repressed. It used to be common knowledge but now is largely forgotten. Our culture implies that great pleasure comes after great effort and attainment. Lowen points out that pleasure comes more naturally, and that the consequence of the long delay of gratification is often the inability to experience gratification"},{"Title":"Pleasure: a creative approach to life","review":"Ah...\\"Pleasure\\"--a 251 page, 1970 book on the biology, emotions, beauty and truth of pleasure by American psychiatrist Alexander Lowen, M.D., 1910- . Lowen is a former Wilhelm Reich pupil and a founder of Bioenergetic Analysis, a psychotherapy involving rejuvenation of one's body through extensive exercising. The subtitle of this work is \\"A Creative Approach to Life\\" and in it he says, \\"Not only does pleasure provide the motive force for the creative process, it is also the product of that process.\\" It is, as well, interesting to note that British medical psychologist/sexologist Havelock Ellis, in his book, \\"On Life and Sex\\" (1922), stated, \\"...sexual pleasure, wisely used...may prove the stimulus and liberator of our...most exalted activities.\\"So, to the rudiments, we should know that the release of energy or current flow culminates in satisfaction from physiological tension, sending one into the subjective state of pleasure which is a polarity of feeling. This energy charge is always equivalent to the tension in any pleasurable experience. The authenticity of pleasure sustains a person in a self-possessed state without disquietude but may nevertheless create its own \\"cul de sac\\" if its means are subdued. It may, in such cases, deny immediate satisfaction, thus providing a more everlasting gratification. Pleasure must be understood not as the aim of life but as that which is concordant with any of man's virtuous activities. The pursuit of sexual pleasure is not merely something that is sought after by animals, but something all humans should crave for, being rooted in abundance and freedom of the sex act. It should never be confounded with joy or happiness, however, for the fruit of pleasure does not always bring joy, for example when this pleasure is irrational. Joy is that which accompanies any pleasurable act that is productive and free; it is, indeed, a union of many joys which combine with power to generate happiness, to create the harmonious espousing of one's inner self with the world and way of life he lives. Sexual pleasure is a good in itself in that it is usually conducive to the general health and wellbeing of an individual. Therefore pure licentious activity and not just Eros can result in sexual joy.A proper flow of energy is required for any pleasurable sexual experience. Energy, being the power to do work that causes motion, remains constant, conserved in that it can never be explained in a mechanistic manner, but rather as an occurrence and how it is related to its motility. Because of the unification of body and mind this energy must be of a biopsychic nature due to the psychic and biological identities that are retained. But sexual excitement entails more than the engorgement of blood vessels. Thus this vegetative current is also bioelectric in that it is found in charges of positive anions and negative kations that carry the potential to different areas of higher and lower potential in the body. This process arises from the functional antithesis of the parasympathetic nervous system which is passive and the sympathetic nervous system which is active. All human behaviour is propagated by emotion, that is the tendency to feel, usually expressed in bodily innervations at the moment the organism is stimulated. This occurs after the object has been perceived, estimated, and then the emotion is evinced and acted upon. The most pleasurable of all human emotions are the sexual, whose closest neurophysiological parallel is anger. The sexual emotions never spring from any one series of operations, and therefore we feel only part of this effect. All sexual, defensive, and hunger emotions are controlled under the sovereignty of the hypothalamus; and sexual emotions originate in a parasympathetic reaction when expansion of vegetative current from the centre of the organism to the periphery takes place. Anxiety is incident if this process is reversed, as when the body fluids are retarded and the energy moves from periphery to centre and an unpleasurable sympathetic contraction occurs. Here the heart has to overcome peripheral constriction of the blood vessels which are always inhibited. Here also the bioelectric current evolves, that is the centre, the heart and abdomen, but chiefly the solar, pelvic and hypogastric plexus. This energy becomes sexual when the appropriate reaction occurs between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, where all life processes oscillate.Peruse \\"Pleasure\\" by Alexander Lowen to ascertain the poetic psychology of pleasure, where rainbows tinkle in fields of azure warmth."},{"Title":"Mad as a Wet Hen!: And Other Funny Idioms","review":"Terban is one of the best in this genre, and this idiom book does not disappoint.

It's our go-to book for really delicious fare. We make some of the recipes for weekday meals, though most we cook on the weekend (they require a little more effort than typical throw-it-together meals).I highly recommend this book for entertaining, especially small dinner parties. The quality of the dishes approaches that of a fine restaurant, so your guests will be wowed and all palates will be happy. The recipes are also perfect for creating conversation at the dinner table, since the book is filled with L&C; lore. Your guests will no doubt rave about the recipes, and the book is so pretty you can pull it out and show it off! The pages are filled with period engravings and pictures of the flora and fauna that are featured in the food. At the bottom of each recipe page is a quote from the L&C; journals, in a font adapted from Thomas Jefferson's own handwriting.Our favorite recipe by far is the Buffalo and Forest Mushroom Shepherd's Pie.

It is a work of history as well as a work of literary analysis.\\" (p. vii) I was born at mid-20th century and, as a child, read many of the books discussed. This book explained my life. As a child I learned a democratic, egalitarian spirit from the Lyrical Left. \\"While school textbooks taught children to uphold the values of the Cold War, many of the trade books they checked out of the library or bought in bookstores taught them just the opposite.\\"As McCarthyism drove leftist writers and educators underground they entered \\"the hidden world\\" of children's literature.

They wanted to share their internationalist, cooperative, and democratic outlook and what they perceived as an ability to rationally evaluate aspects of an irrational society.\\" (p. 182)Learning from the Left offers one explanation of how and why the radicalism of the 1960s grew out of the placid (and repressive) 1950s and how and why some children of the South marched for Civil Rights although Mickenberg cautions, \\"It would be impossible (and far too reductive) to draw some kind of cause-and-effect link between childhood reading and the rebellions of the 1960s. Even so, the generational lines are not merely coincidental.\\" p. 276I highly recommend this Mickenberg's Learning from the Left, which I read in the Kindle edition, to anyone with an interest in literature, history, American culture, education, or who seeks to understand the roots of the sharp political divide and partisanism which is the bane of current U.S. politics."},{"Title":"The Everything Parent's Guide To Raising Boys: A Complete Handbook to Develop Confidence, Promote Self-esteem, And Improve Communication (Everything: Parenting and Family)","review":"It was suggested that my husband and I read this book by our family counselor.

I like these books because they are easy for my students to read and understand."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham shows himself to be a misogynist, and perhaps even a misanthropist given the lack of likeable characters (including the narrator) in this cerebral novel. Nevertheless, it holds one's interest from start to finish, like good gossip. The diverse stages of the painter's life, and the people he disrupts along the way, illustrate the power of obsession, for good and ill."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The most striking aspect of this novel, the one that remains in mind long after you close the book, is not the story itself but the psychology of the main character and the way he affects those around him. Lonely without ever realising that such a state exists, driven by an inner vision Charles Strickland has hardly a single endearing quality but like those that do not need others he draws people to his side. It is Maugham at his most cynical, but appealingly so."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The author has managed to skillfully combinefiction and fact in this wonderful book by one of thebest authors of early 20th century. He has extensivelyresearched the fascinating life of Paul Gauguin andwrote his interpretation of it.Very readable."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham begins this book, as he does 'Razor's Edge,' with an annoying fussiness ('I'm really not qualified to write about it..what's the point of a novel,'etc.). But once he gets down to the narrator's trying to understand the strange life of Strickland (a thinly-veiled portrait of 19th-century 'dumped his family for painting' French artist Paul Gaugain), the book takes on a lyrical beauty you won't soon forget. What drives the honest artist, his eyes on the stars while his mortal existence sinks into poverty? Maugham doesn't have an answer, but the asking is what will keep you involved."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham, as always, writes in a very easy to read style, the characters are crafted imaginatively and sensitively, and the story is interesting and progresses like a biography. In fact, I was to find out later that the story of Charles Strickland, who leaves his wife and family to pursue his own artistic ambitions is inspired by the story of a French impressionist painter Paul Gauguin (famous for painting Tahiti women).The novel is in a beautiful narrative, checkered by delightful moorings of the author, well-written dialogues and descriptions which are picturesque enough to be adapted by the reader into a sort of beautiful movie and documentary, which all human emotions coming into play. The novel is about passion, the intense passion that drives artists, helps them to achieve greatness at the cost of their own idiosyncracies, passion which drives as well as cuts, passion that propels a being beyond the commonplace. For admirers of Paul Gauguin, this novel represents a kind of biography, that presents a life-story in a very unobstrusive fashion, and sheds light into the elements in painter's mind and heart that must have influenced his art.Beyond Charles Strickland and the narrator, there are several characters worth mention. Strickland's wife is a woman who admires artists and writers (and fails to see the artist in his own husband), Dirk Stroeve is a painter who knows his limitations as well as he has the talent of seeing the genious in others and he is a human being who is wronged by his own zeal to be helpful and caring, Mrs Stroeve is (without revealing anything) a very interesting character, and there are many others. The novel benefits from Maugham's skill as writer of short stories and plays, for the novel consists of many chapters, each chapter tells of an incident or dialogue, and the story moves through smoothly and nicely.Another brilliant novel to read and like. If you liked Maugham's Razor's edge, this will endear Maugham further!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"&quot;To recognize it (Beauty) you must repeat the adventure of the artist. It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.&quot; And so the narrator's friend passes along a bit of wisdom early in this magnificent book. Of course, the narrator does not understand and must, on his own, develop knowledge, sensitivity and imagination around the life of the fictionalized-Paul Gauguin, Charles Strickland.The narration is cunning and subtle throughout. The narrator begins as a young novitiate of life, sides with convention, utters a few misogynistic statements (which are good for a laugh/is this how women were viewed by some in the early 1900's?) and, oh so slowly, develops into a person of sensitivity and imagination. The transformation is subtle and quiet, ending with a physical return to the place where it all started. Those characters, who he had originally thought so highly of, are still the same, mean and opportunistic. He sees their stasis and reflects on the greatness of the man that he himself once thought mean.With each new Maugham book I read, I gain a deeper appreciation for the wonder of his writing. The story is effortless and at the same time loaded with significant themes that give me pause for consideration."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Moon and Sixpence is the first Somerset Maugham bookI've read and I'd like to make a few comments, justbecause it was so interesting.As you may have read from other reviews, thisbook is based on the life of French painter, PaulGauguin. That, however, is not very intriguing. Evenif the story were based on Leonardo Da Vinci, it wouldnot have been intriguing either. The spark is providedby Charles Strickland, the stockbroker who turns painterin the novel. And what a fascinating character! Hequotes Nietchze feverishly, he loathes woman, he refusesto sell his precious art (his life), he practically goesmad. And that I may add, in the space of five years(which is the first problem in this novel).Maugham writes tough, and unlike many Englishnovelists of the past, use his words sparingly.He knows his strengths (which is not descriptive)and works extra hard into turning this dull stockbrokerinto an artistic maniac. The novel is short, but Icouldn't see it go any further. In fact, it could havedone with the whole lecture thing at the end.Strickland was the subject - not art.Maugham is witty, and in the end his comic outlook saves the novel. It won't change your life, but it's a page-turner, a good read, and at times, very funny."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Of course the book is brilliantly written. Of course Maugham is a splendid storyteller. Of course one could make a five star book out of &quot;Moon and Sixpence&quot;. Yet I do not think it earns more than three and half. I'll try to elucidate why but it's more a feeling and not a list of facts or mistakes I could rattle down. Charles Strickland, the rough, brute, indifferent-to-anything-and-everything artist - to me he seems untrue. He is not an artist, he's no person but is Maugham\`s projection of an artist. If you look at the life of W. Somerset Maugham you will soon realize that he was never that beastly God or godlike beast called Strickland\\" with the vision stuck to his heart like some divine dagger. He was a man of the world that wanted to be more, that wanted to be - Strickland - but either wasn't or couldn't. And while reading the book I always had that feeling that clung to Strickland, the smell of projection, the smell of a Maugham that wanted to be something he wasn't.Hesse once wrote something like &quot;The thought you do not act, or do not live are of no value&quot;. And Maugham didn't act Strickland, therefore... I wouldn't go so far as to say &quot;of no value&quot;, yet not of the value it claims to be."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I've read the reviews of this book and can only say this; You either &quot;get it&quot; or &quot;You don't&quot;.But if you do - the world is a much more vivid, bright, achingly beautiful place... and you can consider yourself blessed.An utter masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Though not his most famous novel, Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence is as much a literary accomplishment as better-known works such as Of Human Bondage and The Razor's Edge. From start to finish it is a powerful, moving, sometimes haunting portrait of a man obsessed with his art. Inspired by the events in the life of Paul Gauguin, this gem of a novel follows Charles Strickland, a seemingly normal, well-to-do, slightly dull Londoner as he abruptly abandons his family, friends, and career to pursue a personal odyssey of artistic creativity. With no advance notice and nothing more than a terse, post-departure note to his wife, Strickland moves to Paris where he abandons the luxuries of his comfortable London life to live and paint in a small, dingy apartment. With few friends, little money, and an often-ornery personal demeanor, he struggles to survive while he devotes himself slavishly to his artistic obsession.At first glance Charles Strickland wins little admiration from the reader. After all, how can one look up to a man who feels no obligation to his wife and children? How can the reader sympathize with a man who abandons a successful career in order to paint, a vocation for which he has previously demonstrated neither great talent nor great interest. Maugham makes no attempt to portray Strickland through rose-colored glasses. Strickland is a man completely devoted to his art, so obsessed that he completely ignores his family, welfare, and health. He lives his life as a semi-recluse, working prolifically in his studio yet neither showing nor selling his work to anyone. As with many artists, his true genius was not acknowledged until after his death.Despite these seemingly unsympathetic qualities, Strickland without doubt comes to be viewed as a hero of sorts. Here is a man bold enough to risk everything to pursue his dream, a man with sufficient character to disregard those who scoffed at him, and ultimately a man with true artistic genius. And yes, there is an element of tragic heroism in his sometimes self-destructive struggle against insurmountable odds.Maugham's writing is at its finest in this tightly crafted, elegantly written novel. As in many of his other works, we find here the first-person narrative so characteristic of Maugham. Our unnamed narrator, himself a writer, is a keen observer of events and emotions. And though he is a minor protagonist as well, he remains far enough removed from the central action of the novel that he never loses his sense of objectivity. The reader comes to rely on him as a trusted friend. And because of this relationship between narrator and reader, Maugham is able to paint a sympathetic portrait of his central character that the reader cannot help admiring."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Inspired by Paul Gauguin's life, this novel shows the reader the life of a man (Strickland) who's possessed by producing art. Late in his life he changes his normal life into an extraordinary, bohemian life and thus he leaves his wife and his two children to fulfil his life aim to become a painter. For that he moves to France and later on to Tahiti, where he suffers from poverty and eventual illness. Strickland is an extremely single-minded person even though he marries his second wife, who of course does everything for him and loves him dearly. In Tahiti he lives the last few years of his life, blind but still producing great works of art. Strickland just had the soul of a genius."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham wrote a masterpiece about Gauguin's life. Strickland is the pseudonym of the great painter in this novel. The author describes the story from a special point of view: He writes as if he knew or rather had known Strickland himself, asks other people about their opinions on Strickland's character. With what they say about him, the author tries to piece together a coherent picture of the artist. The description of Strickland's life is narrated in such an extraordinary way, that you can hardly imagine the whole story. Strickland, the main character, seems to be pretty rude and indifferent to all events and people around him. This might be somewhat unreal. Even if he was a genius, he still remains a human being with some remaining emotions. Why should Maugham have characterized him in such a way?"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"It's a fascinating novel about art and the art of living. The story of the painter Strickland proves that you should go your own path, even if you fail. Strickland is a victim of his inner urge, almost a beast that compels him to go his own way. He's indifferent to people and to any comfort and luxury, and he doesn't care other people's opinion. He doesn't want to sell his pictures, he despises fame and money. Mostly he paints in solitude. In this book art is more important than the person itself. Strickland dies in the middle of the book, and all the information is gathered by people who knew this special personality. It's peculiar too, that Strickland appears rarely personally, so the book consists mostly of the thoughts of the narrator."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This novel isn't one to be read just in one day, but it is an enrichment for life. Maugham is one of the best describers of situations, characters and environments. That makes the novel interesting but sometimes hard to read. Even the speciality of the characters doesn't really help the reader to feel with Maugham's main figures. What Maugham is well known for is the fact that he always makes the personalities in his novels experience a crisis in their lives and that has drastic consequences for their customary life style. In particaular that means that the evil and despicable characters are changed into good ones at the end or vice versa. The main topic of this novel is Strickland's obsession with art. Nothing but art really counts in his life. He doesn't care about anyone and anything, not even about his personal life and death. And that's also what Maugham wants to tell us: follow your path and don't let yourself be irritated by anything and anybody. If you have a bit of time to spare I can only recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"A must read for any fan of S. Maugham or serious fans of literature and art. Offers page after page of profound insight into human nature and the meaning of our lives. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"MOON AND SIXPENCE by W. Somerset Maugham is worthy on two levels, the insights into the cultural sea-change from the Victorian era to the war years and the craft the novel displays, particularly voice, character and perspective.Inspired by the life of painter Paul Gauguin, Maugham investigates what it takes at age 40 for a successful and respectable banker in Victorian London to walk away from the responsibilities of job, high social status and a family, and into poverty a world away for the sake of art. Briskly told from the vantage point of an acquaintance looking back, Charles Strickland is first encountered as a somewhat Philistine but prosperous, upright gentleman. Sent to retrieve Strickland after he precipitously deserts his family, the narrator, a young writer, finds an unrepentant man. Five years later, the narrator encounters him again in Paris where the artist has grown more monstrous though his art reveals a beguiling genius. Even the tragic recipient of the worst behavior unleashed by Strickland remains his champion in the art world.The narrator does not meet up with Strickland again, but to set the record straight he interviews those who knew him up to his death at age 53 in the remote South Pacific. The novel takes its power in well developed characters, even the most minor are fully realized. The very last chapter is brilliant in its sly revelations of the themes and cultural benchmarks articulated by Strickland's life, death and art.Maugam, once a prominent early 20th century writer, did not make many, if any, end of the century, end of the millennium \\"best of\\" lists. Now this relatively prolific British writer is beginning to show up on the radar of literary discourse again. Mostly the talk is of CAKES AND ALE and THE RAZOR'S EDGE, the latter last popular with adolescent baby boomers, but MOON AND SIXPENCE, only a little dated, is due consideration."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham wrote quite an interesting story with manifold aspects about art, finding your way in life, passion and devotion. Even though the book contains some interesting and difficult questions and opinions about life &amp; art the book is easy to read because of the fluidity of Maugham's writing style. It doesn't take you long to get into it and to be fascinated by the main characters of the book, mainly by Charles Strickland, whose indifference to the world is really extreme and unique. You feel your own life being questioned by Strickland's attitude, which makes the book even more interesting because you want to find out if he succeeds with his way of living."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I am facinated by this book. W. Somerset Maugham reaches into the character of Charles Strickland in a way that makes you want to read on and on. I missed witnessing an avalanch because of this book.......and I don't regret it one single bit!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This is very far from Maugham's best (to me, his short stories and novellas). The character, Strickland, genius painter perhaps based on Gauguin, is just not believable. Real great artists (such as Gauguin) may be odd in their personal lives, but they do spend time with other artists, they do discuss art; they don't seem to be the ignorant brutes this fellow is. The book feeds off a popular idea of the artist as outsider, and certainly there have been many who were. Yet even Van Gogh, exemplary nutter genius, talked to other painters, including Gauguin. Strickland's art comes out of a personal vacuum, which seems unrealistic.So unlikely is the main character that before the book ended I lost interest and stopped reading. For a better book by Maugham on the unexpected personal life of great artists, read Cakes and Ale instead."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I'm usually the kind of person to give a book either one or five stars. Time's too short to dilly-dally in the middle, I want people to know whether a book is WORTH reading or NOT WORTH reading. This book happens to be worth reading for most people, in particular those who are interested WSM's style, but may be a bit of a waste for those already familiar with WSM's other work.As everyone probably knows in this book WSM provides what is a fictionalized account of Gaugin's life - Gaugin replaced with Charles Strickland. There are moments of brilliance, it is very well-written and WSM's mastery of the English language is among the most notable.I removed a star and a half ( * 1/2* ) because, frankly, the characters are over-the-top one-dimensional. Without giving anything away, for example, Strickland is painted (no pun intended) as an inhuman, remorseless cur. A character by the name of Stroeve is similarly displayed in a single light: pure, unadulterated buffoonery. There are no shades to these characters - they are either this or that, and while WSM will occasionally discuss the manifestation of contradictory attributes residing in the same person (these make some of the prettier, more thoughtful passages), his own characters are blatantly one-dimensional.As a voracious reader (and a bit of a writer myself), I'm always keen on what the author is saying - what he's speaking to the reader - and what he's doing (i.e., the plot, the characters, etc.). While WSM's literary genius is undisputed, it's clear that he didn't mix the paints as thoroughly as he could have."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Of all the books I was forced to read for school, this one was by far the best. I just recently remembered the name of it while thinking on famous painters, and also remembered the vividness of the work. The places he writes of come to life with his words, helped along no doubt by Maugham's travels themselves. Maugham writes not only an engrossing read, but also the ideas he writes of in his book are fascinating in their own right. The book makes you wonder what exactly &quot;genius&quot; is, and how one gets to be accorded this title. Despite the general despicable-ness of the main character, you can still identify with him, and walk away amazed at the idea anyone can do the things he did. I even found myself expressing a certain envy of this man who was, first and foremost, himself."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The Moon and Sixpence has an adequate first act, a poorly structured second act, and a conclusion that somehow makes me forget the 270 ho-hum pages that preceded it. If you are looking for Maugham at his best, see Of Human Bondage first. If you're looking for further works by Maugham, pick up The Moon and Sixpence, but don't expect to be as thoroughly impressed. The story, however, is one with immense potential: the discovery of the internal artist. The main character of Charles Strickland is a unique and interesting one to say the least. Watching him respond and develop is something to at once appall, intrigue, and admire. By the conclusion, you'll see his journey full circle, and not feel the least regret for having read the novel.But it was with a peculiar displeasure that I journey the first few hundred pages. Part One is an episodic narritive in which the narrator meets the society of London and Paris, and more particularly Charles Strickland. This style of writing I have always found most appealing, but nonetheless Maugham seems in a desperate rush to go through it all. There are so few episodes, and indeed they all go by in such a flourish, that one doesn't find the story and its characters as sufficiently developed as a longer tale might have accomplished. Part Two adorns the more appropriate, leisurely pace, but the plot is recounted through sundry interviews from negligable characters. Maugham's intention was no doubt to show Strickland's effect on people, but every time fiction assumes such a story-telling strategy, it comes across as impersonal and unsatisfactory. And The Moon and Sixpence is no exception. Because different characters are recounting and reminiscing, the tone varies too frequently, and as soon as you begin to comprehend one character, he is quickly abandoned for another.What comes as an ultimate surprise, however, is that Maugham was able to pull me back in during the final few pages. Indeed, that shows the true strength of the narrative. The fact that I could be somewhat disappointed with the first part, exceedingly disappointed with the second part, and still come around to applaud the book on the last pages is a true feat. As the closing events occur, and Strickland comes to his ultimate fate, one can't help but view the life and sacrifices of an artist with a whole new outlook, a whole new respect and appreciation. Yes, perhaps Strickland takes the eccentricities of art to an absurd degree, but the character is so well developed and understood by his author that one cannot help but feel a greater fondness for the misunderstood Strickland, the initially lackluster book, and the literary skills of W. Somerset Maugham. And so, I can't help but conclude with the statement that this is a widely successful book in its most grand artistic attempt. Could it have been organized, structured, paced any better? --Yes! But on the whole, I'll take what I can get: a good story, with an interesting character, who has an incalculable gift."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I don't like Maugham's attitudes about life and art, but it's still a good read necause Maugham is a very good storyteller, the book is haunting, it was interesting to read it, but some values he transmits I really can't support at all. His descriptions about women are absolutely disgusting, and his pigeon-holing them into mother figures or bad women I think, is really too shallow, onesided and crude. Another thing is that this book for me is again a story about a suffering, inhuman person, who wants to live only for art's sake. I think there are too many stories about that same topic,which are recommended by so many so-called well educated readers. Or it's possible that I had to read too much about almost the same topic in the last few years so that I would have given more stars to that book if I had read it some time ago. A good thing is that the story has various settings like London, Paris, Tahiti, which make it interesting, above all the scenes on Tahiti."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham writes a first-person narrative about an English painter / artist named Charles Strickland. The narrator is a struggling playwright who is in association with many artist types. During his various meetings, he becomes acquaintances with the wife of Charles Strickland. The Strickland's are a comfortable family until (at the age of forty-seven) Charles decides to throw away his marriage, his kids, and his career to paint. Strickland moves to Paris where he does odd jobs for money, plays chess, and paints when he is able to. According to the narrator, his pictures aren't any good, but Strickland is happy doing what he loves and doesn't care about the consequences. However, Strickland, is actually a genius and he leaves behind a trail of priceless masterpieces. The narrator has many interludes with Strickland while he lives in Paris and when he loses track of Strickland, he learns about Strickland's painting life on the island of Haiti. Strickland is not a likeable character. He doesn't care what people think about him and is pretty much self-centered and is synical. However, he is open about and will candidly point out that most people are self-centered. Strickland even steals the wife of a friend who helped him during one of his low times. Somehow, the narrator and Strickland form a friendly bond and the reader gets a chance to know Strickland personally. The book was interesting. The story's primary message is that about art and happiness: that one should be doing it for themselves and not for glory or money. In addition, that when one is doing what truly makes one happy that it is priceless."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"If Gauguin, the painter, had been an Englishman, his life could very well have been as reconstructed by Maugham in this famous novel. The main characters are few: the author cast as minor English writer, Strickland or the \\"Gauguin character\\", his first wife, a Dutch painter in Paris and his English wife. A number of minor characters give intense color to much of the book and are very skillfully drawn. Not just a biographical novel, which could have been interesting in itself, THE MOON AND SIXPENCE attempts to be a psychological study of an unusual person, a genius perhaps. And there is no doubt---it succeeds. Not only is a fascinating novel that will grip you for as long as it takes to read, it is a major work on the relationship of art, psychology and society. The novel is one of the greatest of a very talented writer. Maugham's overarching question is \\"what kind of person suddenly leaves a very mediocre, average life as a stockbroker---having shown absolutely no inclination for art---throws over his wife, his relatives, and everything he has ever known, to go to Paris to become an artist in the utmost poverty ?\\" What makes a man do that ? And how strange it is that he succeeds beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Along the road of explanation, Maugham introduces many an interesting argument between humanism and cold rationality, between those who feel for others and those who only act for themselves.I like seashells, the treasures of the ocean, but I prefer to find them myself, buried in the sand or lying in a mess of seaweed. I clean them off and they're mine. I never buy them, polished and sterile, from a shop shelf. That is, I don't like getting repeated \\"nuggets of wisdom\\", polished and presented to me by an author. I prefer to stumble on them myself, pondering as I go. What I do not particularly care for in this novel, which may put off readers (or, sure, may attract them) is the didactic, hectoring tone (leaving aside the rather misogynistic view of women). Maugham insists on hitting the reader over the head, again and again, with his views... \\"Suffering for the most part, makes men petty and vindicative\\" (p.64). \\"There is no cruelty greater than a woman's to a man who loves her and whom she does not love; she has no kindness then, no tolerance even...\\" (p.114) \\"...Man in moments of emotion expresses himself naturally in the terms of a novelette.\\" (p.135). I can provide a lot more examples. Maugham writes a tremendous story, a sensitive psychological portrait of a man who was contrary to what everyone had supposed him to be, a man possessed for years by a secret devil---Art. The author insists that it is impossible to know exactly what a person will do, that it is impossible to fathom human nature. He then fills his novel with endless little lectures, innumerable aphorisms, about human nature, thereby contradicting his own core theme.It is still a great novel."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This was my first attempt at reading W. Somerset Maugham. The man can definitely write. But the story told here is somber. A writer becomes fascinated with a man who gave up everything in order to become an artist. This artist is a brute of a man whom we today might call a sociopath. He cares nothing for the feelings of others. In fact, he is so unlikeable, that it was hard for me to finish reading this book. I don't buy into the theory that \\"genius\\" is an excuse for appalling behavior. This book left me depressed. I don't think I will be reading any more novels by Maugham."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The plot of the story is quite interesting, there are many nice descriptions about houses and some of the people. But since I gave only two stars, there must be some criticism: the description of the various characters is extreamly different, Strickland seems to be of an unreal cruelty, much too strong expression of only one part of his character while the rest is left untold. Instead the characters of some other characters (e.g. the women ) aren't reported sufficently, only superficially. And then, another thing I was missing, is Maugham's lack of knowledge of real culture, or at least the lack of the influence from the Tahitian customs and live style (which is quite different from the English) on Strickland's life. The novel concentrates too much on Strickland's problems and thoughts till it's almost unbearable."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I became interested in Maugham's work after seeing the remake of &quot;The Razor's Edge&quot; film. I then read the book and was enamored with his descriptive capability. Just by chance I picked up this volume and it's even better than &quot;Razor&quot;!The novel is loosely based on an account of the life of French artist Paul Gauguin. While there are historical inaccuracies, e.g., the real Gauguin died of heart failure unlike Strickland, the novel's main character, who died of leprosy, one expects such dramatic effect from a novel. Most important in the book are the assumptions people made of Gauguin/Strickland. When he left his presumably comfortable home, for instance, his wife, as well as her friends and acquaintances, assumed it was another woman who'd led him astray, not his passion for something he hadn't yet figured out. To that assumption, Strickland was contemptuous to say the least.Of other observations Maugham made of Strickland's observers, many are posterworthy. I have, indeed, made graphic posters of some of them for example of the observation that &quot;some men are born out of their due place,&quot; or another on those who like the feel they're &quot;unconventional,&quot; how that's most often a facade.It's a wonderful book and I recommend it particularly to those who feel alien to the world in which they're stuck. I recommend it too to those who are bored to tears with &quot;English lit.&quot; This could rejuvenate your interest in the masterpieces and in good writing in general."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"(side note - i actually was interested in reading this book after reading bag of bones by stephen king. in that book the main character mentions that this book was a favorite of both he and his wife's and that led me to amazon and do i really need to explain further?) i would probably give this a 3.5. the first couple of chapters were a bit tedious to get through but sticking to it i found the rest of the book to be interesting enough. i don't know if or who i would recommend it to, i think you'd need to be in a certain frame of mind to read this book, which i just happened to be this weekend. i can't really explain it any better than that. overall as i said it was an interesting read and i'm not sorry that i finally bought and read it though i'm not sure it's one that i'll ever read again either."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"What makes the book so unbearably boring is precisely its insight: In the recesses of Strickland (a stand-in for Paul Gauguin), far beneath his brutish public trace and gamut of personae, far beneath anything observable, lies an artistic genius that, for most of the characters, isn't even manifest in the artist's work. How's that? It's hard to tell whether Maugham is circuitously disdaining the posthumous and arbitrary obsession we all have with artists or with boyish persistence reaching for that which, though veritable, none of us are great enough to discern and appreciate, a kind of absurd communion with inspiration that necessarily morally outcasts the inspired. Either way, even when Strickland is biographically tethered to history, it's hard to find him compelling, as a man (or madman) or symbol."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"It has been noted many times that artists are usually not the most pleasant human beings to be around; Maugham's novel is, among other things, a compelling examination of why this is so. The obsessed artist who dominates this book, Charles Strickland (based on the notorious Paul Gauguin), walks away from his cushy middle-class existence in England to pursue his dream to paint, amid frightful poverty, in France. Strickland is an unforgettable character, an inarticulate, brutishly sensual creature, callously indifferent to his fellow man and even his own health, who lives only to record his private visions on canvas.It would be a mistake to read this novel as an inspiring tale of the triumph of the spirit. Strickland is an appalling human being--but the world itself, Maugham seems to say, is a cruel, forbidding place. The author toys with the (strongly Nietzschean) idea that men like Charles Strickland may somehow be closer to the mad pulse of life, and cannot therefore be dismissed as mere egotists. The moralists among us, the book suggests, are simply shrinking violets if not outright hypocrites. It is not a very cheery conception of humanity (and arguably not an accurate one), but the questions Maugham raises are fascinating. Aside from that, he's a wonderful storyteller. This book is a real page turner."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"When he first meets Charles Strickland, a London stockbroker, the young narrator of this novel thinks of him as \\"good, honest, dull, and plain.\\" When Strickland suddenly abandons his wife and children and takes off for Paris, however, the narrator decides he is a cad. Though he has had no training, Strickland has decided to become an artist, a drive so strong that he is willing to sacrifice everything toward that end. Anti-social, and feeling no obligation to observe even the smallest social decencies, Strickland becomes increasingly boorish as he practices his art. Eventually, he makes his way to Tahiti, where he \\"marries,\\" moves to a remote cottage, and spends the rest of his life devoted to his painting.Basing the novel loosely on the life of Paul Gauguin, Maugham creates an involving and often exciting story. His narrator is a writer who feels impelled, after Strickland's death and posthumous success, to set down his memories of his early interactions with Strickland in London and Paris. Because the narrator never saw Strickland after he left Paris, he depends on his meetings with a ship captain and a woman in Papeete for information about Strickland after Strickland's arrival in Tahiti. The ship captain is described as a story-teller who may be spinning tall tales, a constant reminder to the reader that this is fiction, and not a biography of Gauguin.By depicting Strickland as a \\"dull, plain\\" man suddenly gripped by an obsession so overwhelming that nothing else matters to him, Maugham involves the reader in his actions, which even the narrator claims not to understand. The least convincing aspect of Strickland's characterization is the narrator's observation that Strickland is completely indifferent to his wife of seventeen years and his children. No confrontation between Strickland and his wife appears, and one wonders if perhaps Maugham found himself unable to depict such an abandonment realistically. The story moves quickly, however, and whatever is sacrificed in the characterization is more than recouped in the plot and its development.Straightforward in its story line, the novel is romantic in its depiction of the artist in the grip of an obsession, his subsequent abandonment of civilization and return to nature, his suffering of a long and terminal illness (during which he paints his masterpiece), and the fate of this creation. Good, old-fashioned story-telling at its best, this uncomplicated story, written in 1919, still has broad appeal. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham takes a fascinating look into the life of Charles Strickland, a man who gives up his comfortable life as a stock broker, breaks the social contract, abandons his family, and takes up painting. These changes condemn him to a life of poverty and disdain by most who know him. The story is related by an aspiring writer who never seems to be able to quite get the painter to admit he is either remorseful of all the human wreckage he's left in his wake, or so uncomfortable in this new life that he's sorry for having made such a hash of his it. Despite his lack of satisfactory answers, the writer continues to be fascinated by Strickland, who has found a means of expression that transcends language. Strickland understands the writer well enough, having lived in his culture. The writer, on the other hand, cannot possibly understand Strickland, having never been so passionate about anything in his short life. It is this passion that both draws others to Strickland, and causes him to reject outright everything they hold dear. The book raises several intersting questions: Who makes the social contract anyway, and did Strickland knowingly sign on, or was he simply incorporated into it by society? Would it have been acceptable for Strickland to abandon his family to become a priest, missionary, or some other more acceptable form of aesthete? While the book is loosely based on the life of Paul Gaugin, it is really more about W. Somerset Maugham and his search for beauty and truth. In his fictionalized account of that search, Maugham shows us that while the search may be noble, the journey is not necessarily beautiful to everyone, especially those not involved. Strickland's single-minded search is especially ugly to those who at one time meant something to him, as they are informed dispassionately and without malice they mean nothing to the painter except a meal or a small loan. As he draws ever nearer his language of painting, Strickland gradually sheds even these occasional interactions, to a point where even his very life has no meaning except in the context of his art. This book is a must-read for anyone contemplating a life in the arts. While Strickland is a thoroughly dislikable character, he is one without artifice, totally lacking the ability to say anything other than what is true to him. He is a man consumed by his passion, completely lacking the need for approval. Maugham as usual creates a work that is both powerful and thought-provoking. &quot;Moon and Sixpence&quot; satisfys on at least two levels; as a cracking good story, and as a philosophical treatise on art, beauty and passion."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The Moon and Sixpence is a character study of Charles Strickland, a forty-ish London investment banker who leaves his wife and two children to be a painter. Strickland leaves his family cruelly: without notice and completely on their own, with no financial or emotional support. He moves to Paris where he lives in squalor and yet again displays callous behavior by running over the lives of another painter, Dirk Stroeve, the only person who can spot his talent and who is constantly trying to help Strickland despite Strickland's obvious hatred of him, and Dirk's wife, Blanche, who Strickland steals away from Stroeve and then drops once he's done with her, causing her to commit suicide. Strickland eventually ends up in Tahiti through Marseilles, and, finding the paternalistic social construct of the island more to his liking, settles down with another wife and child. He eventually dies there of leprosy after painting his magnum opus on the walls of his hut, which is duly burnt down on his dying instructions by his wife. It is only after his death that Strickland's work is appreciated.This novel is well-known for being inspired by the story of Paul Gauguin, but Maugham isn't as concerned here about telling Gauguin's life, of which he only knew a rough outline anyway, as he is in exploring the nature of someone who could be driven to leave the comfort of society by an obsession to create art. Strickland is essentially a sociopath. He cares for no one or nothing other than painting. He lives with hunger and illness to achieve this end, and despises anyone who tries to help him. When Blanche commits suicide, he bears no responsibility for it, instead telling the narrator: \\"I told her that when I'd had enough of her she'd have to go, and she said she'd risk that.\\" Maugham has created something akin to a monster to show us the detachment required to live such a life.The Moon and Sixpence has no proper plot, but it is gripping nonetheless. We are witness to the various episodes the narrator, a writer with a bio not too far afield from Maugham's, lays out for us, and we pay attention both because the subject is so intriguing and because the narrator's (Maugham's) voice is so smooth. Like the narrator, we are at times conflicted. We are disgusted with Strickland, but compelled to read on, and occasionally even laugh out loud at his sometimes comic attitude towards life.The novel invites us to consider the question, is the creation of art and the commitment to love mutually exclusive? Does one have to be free of all social constraints to create \`true' art? Maugham seems to be saying that they do. He contrasts Strickland- the London banker who leaves the social compact so far as to become almost a wild beast, but creates transcendent art- with the narrator- a popular but common writer who is well-connected in society but follows the trails of others rather than blazing them himself. Maugham's stuffy portrayal of London social life and its inability to understand Strickland's art (his wife goes so far as to call his paintings \`decorative art' even after his genius has been acknowledged) also seem to point us in that direction.Whichever side you come out on, this novel is worth reading more than once just to make sure. And if you're someone in a profession you don't love and feel the fire to create, this book may even change your life."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I always chafe when I hear people downplay the talent and importance of Somerset Maugham. He happens to be one of my favorite writers and The Moon and Sixpence is by far--in my opinion--his best book. I reread it yesterday and continue to be moved by its emotion. No other novel describes the passion which motivates the artist in such intricate detail. With Strickland, our neo-Gauguin, we see that the force that drives is absolute even though it may not be noble or life-affirming. As a man, Strickland treats people the way most of us treat parking places--we enter them, leave them and then never give their existence a second thought; yet, the one thing he undoubtedly has is artistic integrity. The middle third of the book is the strongest and here, as elsewhere, Mr. Maugham tells an amazing story. Also of note, are his impressions of women which may be as sound as those of anybody else I have ever encountered. Overall, this is a vastly underrated novelist and a vastly underrated book."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"There are many good books out there and none of us have time to read them all. Here is one that you should make the time to read. For much labor, thought, and (dare I say it) love went into the writing of this classic biography of the artistic genius, stockbroker turned painter, Paul Gauguin. Much love, and some imagination, and a ton of research including visits to the haunts of the man himself -- Paris and Tahiti and Taravao, the home of Ata, Paul's woman in the islands. Add to this the sympathetic outlook of a humanist and the craftsmanship of a great novelist and you get one of the great books of our time and probably of all time. This is a book written by a genius about a genius who made pictures that were and are still stupendous and overwhelming. Charles Strickland's (Gauguin's alter ego and the protagonist of this story) last picture, the Polynesian garden of the Hesperides, with its quivering purple and red lusters that suggested the palpitation of something mysterious and terrible with the possibilities of the Unknown, possessed a somber passion previously unknown in the history of art. It was his best and most complete work, done a year after the artist had gone blind from leprosy. By his command it was burned soon after his death. When you visit Taravao, you will see a replica which still has tremendous power. After you read this book, you will understand that power and you will have an appreciation for Gauguin's art that you never had before. You will have an appreciation for beauty and truth that succinctly demonstrates the redemptive quality of great art."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"There is a common stereotype in the arts of the artist as somehow divorced from the realities of life. Such an artist is misogynistic, hermetic, dispassionate, and generally unable to relate to his fellow man even as he creates monuments of art that suggest otherwise. In THE MOON AND SIXPENCE, Somerset Maugham tells the tale of Charles Strickland, an Englishman, who at age forty seems thoroughly conventional and unremarkable. He is a stockbroker, married, with two children, and reasonably affluent. Then one day, out of the blue, he tells his wife that he is leaving her. He gives no reason and off he goes. His wife is sure there is another woman who has twisted his reason, so she asks the narrator to hunt her husband down and demand the truth. This the narrator does. Strickland tells him that there is no woman. Instead, he left his wife to be free to paint. The narrator is astounded and he cannot believe that any rational man would use painting as a pretext for the end of a marriage. Most readers comment on the surface callousness of Strickland, a man who shows no concern for the fate of his family. Indeed, Strickland goes to great lengths to articulate this lack of concern, the result of which is to convince both narrator and reader that Strickland is worse than a cad and a bounder. The reality is less prosaic. Strickland is neither. Maugham has created a two dimensional portrait of a walking cliche. If such a person like Strickland has ever trod the earth and left his family in dire straits for the reason given, then he is surely the only one to have done so. Maugham was careful to portray a man who was clearly callous, insensitive, and totally self-centered, but evil? Certainly not. Strickland is a man consumed with a Vision. Everything else in life, including his own, is subservient to his goal of creating beauty from the sordidness of the world. It does not even matter to him if no one else sees his paintings. He sees them, and that is all that matters. Other readers view the book in the context of sociology. Does Strickland violate the implied social contract that mature men establish between themselves and family and friends? If any contract exists, it is of the internal sort, between one who works to live and one who lives to work. In the former case, Strickland often cares not a fig about keeping his body together. In the latter, his life has no meaning except to sanctify his work. There is at least one other character in the novel who can see this even if the narrator cannot. Dirk Stroeve, an expatriat Englishman, is a total fool and incompetent in life. He dabbles in painting all the while realizing that he has no talent with brush or easel. He opens his door to welcome a homeless Strickland, who promptly repays him by carrying on an affair with Dirk's wife. But even after this, Dirk cannot hold a grudge for he recognizes that Strickland's genius transcends such mere mortal foilbles as jealousy. If Strickland is willing to lay his life on the line for his art, then clods like Dirk must be willing to do no less. Later in the novel, a world full of art lovers slowly realize that genius is a gift from the gods that demands that the artist-genius must pay a high price for a fame that is as often rejected as sought. In THE MOON AND SIXPENCE, Maugham allows his readers to glimpse that behind the mask of genius lies a soul in torment that does not even recognize that it is in torment. This, then, is the paradox of the book."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Based in outline on the life of post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, The Moon and Sixpence makes for an at times dark, at times lighthearted tale with a predictable ending. The fun is in the getting there and the brilliant characters and anecdotes that we find along the way.In a disarming style successfully conveying that neither the narrator nor the author takes himself terribly seriously, W. Somerset Maugham opens The Moon and Sixpence in an academic tone, with the narrator disparaging the novel as a literary form, and using frequent footnotes to convey that academic sense of non-fiction that is ostensibly so much more respectable. With characteristic phrases like \\"blackheart\\", \\"dash it all\\", and Robert Strickland's favorite, \\"go to hell\\", we are guided from Strickland's family life in England to his impoverished Paris years and finally on his trail to Tahiti where he spends his final days toiling away at his magnum opus in an idyllic but ultimately tragic setting.My favorite character was Dirk Stroeve, a Dutch painter living in Paris, with very little talent of his own but with the ability to recognize its expression--notably in the genius of Strickland's painting. Stroeve's kindness and generosity, both of which he lavishes on others to a ludicrous degree, act as an almost perfect foil for contrasting with Strickland's boorish contempt, even for those who help nurse him through a life-threatening illness. The stark disparity with Stroeve humanizes and better defines Strickland.In the course of relating Strickland's story, Maugham reveals a keen sense of observation and ponders some of the fundamental questions of what it means to be human. Strickland's character encompasses both the contradiction between and the synthesis of opposing ideas--of how, for example, pursuit of the creative impulse can be destructive, and destruction of social bonds can lead to creativity. In the way he writes of Strickland's genius, some of Maugham's own is revealed."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"so goes the personality of charles strickland, the hero of \\"moon and sixpence\\".based loosely on the life of the great french painter paul gaguin, the story is of an english banker who suddenly abandons his middle class existence in england and moves to paris to paint. fired by his passion for his art, he's so absorbed in it at the cost of being indifferent (often misinterpreted as ruthless) to everything else - even his own well being.such is the personality of creativity (often at odds with normal perceptions of morality, ethics etc) and maugham in his own classic way (loaded with keen psychological insights) brings out the complexities of such a character and the effect it has on those who come into contact with him.it is a one-of-a-kind book. get it!a more mellow though adorable telling of a similar tale can be found in a.j.cronin's 'a thing of beauty' aka 'crusader's tomb'. that's a fantastic read too."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I first read The Moon and Sixpence in my early 20s--my &quot;British period&quot;--and it immediately entered my personal literary hall of fame. I was carried away by its exoticism, romance, and theme of hope and renewal, balanced by plenty of Maugham's trademark cynical observation. Then I would have given it 5 stars; I recently re-read it and downgraded it to 4. Maugham has the tendency of many of his peers to overly soliloquize, which irritates modern readers, and his misogyny is amply evident. Still it is a wonderful well-written book capable of imbuing an awe for life and limitless possibility and inspiring the feeling that &quot;it ain't over til it's over.&quot; The character of Charles Strickland as misanthropic artist is fascinating. Sick of your job and your current situation? Read this short novel on a lonely rainy day and you'll find yourself transported, maybe even uplifted."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The novel, based on the life of the French painter Paul Gauguin, is a very absorbing and easy read. Maugham's style has such fluidity that you can read the entire book with great interest in a single day. The main character, Charles Strickland, gives up a comfortable life of a financier to pursue his passsion for painting. Strickland is a man possessed, who is willing to sacrifice his well being and that of his family to fulfill the call of his inner voice to paint his vision of the world.I like the novel and highly recommend it, but I do have a few criticisms. First, Strickland is portrayed as too inhuman, which makes the character unrealistic. Many artists are driven and single-minded, but Maugham is so concerned in making his Strickland appear a hard and uncompromising creator that he makes him crude. Strickland is taciturn, though he occasionally spouts Nietzshean phrases and tries to project Nietzschean haughty indifference to everything except his art. Not surprisingly, Strickland is condescending toward women and does not hesitate to let us know about it in his rare but obnoxious commentary. If the real Gauguin, or any artitst of significance, were as incensitive as Strickland, he would not be able to feel and to paint what he did. And this, in a nutshell, is the problem with Maugham's novel. He started from a stereotype and ended with the main character who was not particularly compelling."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Most of us give lip service to the value of human connection. We cite our families, friends, mindful human interaction as the meaningful centers of our lives. Many are engaged in altruistic endeavors that define their values and benefit mankind. Few renounce marriage, family and human society. At the same time, few people exist without the constant expression of the ego. To a large extent our egos define us, whether we wish to acknowledge that or not. One could argue that most artists are driven by the ego's need to be recognized and legitimized. Paintings are to admire, after all. They are meant to be hung in houses, palaces, civic offices, and museums. Success as a painter suggests the possibility of the ego immortalized, forever displayed and discussed. Thus, it startles and amazes most of us when we encounter a person so driven by his daemon that he would readily surrender his soul or his mundane pleasures to render his artistic vision. That any artist would utterly renounce the world for that purpose astonishes and perplexes us, but that is how Charles Strickland in Maugham's masterpiece, \\"The Moon and Sixpence,\\" chose to live. Driven by the need to create, Maugham's protagonist, modeled after Paul Gaughin, the post-impressionist painter, relinquished his family, his profession and his social status to express the daemon of his crippled soul. One has to ask how healthy is it for one to allow that demon of the subconscious to drive man on and on to artistic achievement, and why would anyone surrender his happiness and comfort to such a goal unless he were driven by impulses beyond his control? Unless he was mad?I think it can be argued that the pursuit of art at such a cost is indeed madness. Nevertheless, we cannot help but admire the genius of such a seeker, no matter how inhuman and possibly demonic or possessed he appeared to be. And finally we have to admire the confidence, the unbelievable faith a man such as Strickland possessed in his abilities, especially, if during his life they were not even acknowledged and, particularly, if he never sold the art for which he sacrificed his humanity and his health. It is simply fascinating to glimpse into such a character as Charles Strickland and to recognize the inordinate dedication such a life involved and to recognize that one can be so utterly seized by such an extraordinary impulse that its essence defies explanation. What does such a man see when his eyes fasten on truth beyond the veil - truth so precise and so necessary - that he can not rest until his canvas is finished and the image is rendered once and for all? Such accomplishment, such energy and dedication are miracles, some of us would argue, but we are still helpless to understand either the process or the sacrifice. The finished canvas is the mad painter laid bare for all of us to see, the soul equally exposed but still elusive. Such, I suppose, is the nature of truth. It is always fleeting and incomprehensible, but it is still worth the search to the bitter end. But was Strickland's rejection of human ties and physical comfort worth the goal of profound artistic achievement? Some of us cannot accept that big a price to be an artist.Maugham describes an ordinary man, a stockbroker and father, married to a generous benefactor of the art community, a man who indulged his habits of playing cards and visiting his club. Not only had he never expressed a desire to be an artist, he'd not indicated dissatisfaction with his bourgeois life either. Maugham describes him as totally unremarkable, paling next to his more impressive wife. However, if one reads between the lines, it is clear from the beginning of the novel that the man was authentic and that although he does not initially reveal signs of genius or even yearnings beyond his accomplishments to date, he quietly, doggedly indulges his own caprices. When in fact he consummates a relationship with a tea shop worker, he appears simply self-centered, not possessed of a driven nature or even a compulsive one. Similar to his own personality, his work \\"disturbs\\" and \\"arrests.\\" For sure, this is the mark of the true artist, this capacity to arouse attention and invite a response; likewise it is apparent, as Maugham describes the seeds of Strickland's personality before he left England and went to France to learn how to paint.Maugham describes Stickland as \\"just a good, dull, honest, plain man.\\" The narrator claims there \\"was no reason to waste one's time over him.\\" The narrator does not see what is coming, but the astute reader sees the hints of Strickland's authenticity in that there is \\"something amiss,\\" and \\"a vague sense of uneasiness\\" on the narrator's part that signals momentous change in the Strickland household. The narrator owns that the Strickland's were shadowy figures, and he doesn't know why that is so. Perhaps this is because the narrator himself has difficulty fathoming the deeper impulses that propel the genius from his sleeping, banal world into the inferno of his vision. Later the narrator wonders that he didn't see the unusualness of Strickland, but the reader may have noticed how quiet Strickland is in the presence of others talking at the dinner party his wife hosted, as if bored himself or unwilling to participate in inane discourse. And his implacability suggests he bored the guests next to him by his lack of engagement.When still incredulous at what Strickland is giving up in the name of art and why, the narrator presses until Strickland explains, \\"I want to paint.\\" He assures the narrator that there is no woman who could tempt him to leave his familiy; that decision was based on his commitment to painting. \\"I've got to paint,\\" he claims, almost desperately. \\"I can't help myself,\\" he says by way of explanation. It is then there is a subtle reference to what also motivates Strickland. He confides that he needs to get out (of his marriage and life) or \\"he'll drown.\\" Thus it's implied that his life as a stockbroker, father and husband feels like his self or his artistic impulses are drowning. They are so submerged that his life is too oppressive to endure any longer. The narrator notes that Strickland \\"seemed really to be possessed of the devil.\\" The conversation between the two men is heavy and disconcerting. At one point Strickland says \\"She (his wife) can go to the devil.\\" Then without losing a beat, Strickland suggests the two of them go to dinner; he is nonplussed about his behavior toward his family and business partner.Strickland acknowledges that he is no ordinary man and that most men would do the right thing in regard to their domestic ties. However, he doesn't care what others think of him. Conversely, the narrator observes, \\"I take it that conscience is the guardian in the individual of the rules which the community has evolved for its own preservation. It is the policeman in all our hearts...\\" When the narrator concludes that \\"Strickland was really indifferent to the blame his conduct must excite, I could only draw back in horror as from a monster of hardly human shape,\\" the reader realizes the extent to which Strickland has surrendered his humanity and how repulsive that revelation is to the narrator. Later when at her husband's bidding Blanche Stroeve nurses the ill Strickland back to health,\\" she has warned Dirk that she sees the man as a monster. Still, she falls desperately in love with him and subsequently commits suicide when he rejects her. Thus has Strickland broken up the marriage and destroyed his two friends for the sole purpose of making a painting of the reclining Blanche Stroeve's nude body, a picture, which incidentally, he leaves behind in Stroeve's studio -- either as a memento of his vagaries to torment Stroeve or a dismissal of its merit as a painting.Most astonishing in Maugham's vision of the authentic artist, is his portrayal of Dirk Stroeve, a clumsy artist who not only has exquisite compassion for Strickland, but who is so committed to Strickland's artistic genius that he could forgive the interloper in the name of art. In this sense, it is as if Maugham perceives in the artist and the connoisseur of true art a saintliness most of us do not recognize or accept.This idea of the sacredness of genius might be palatable if Strickland weren't so hateful in his behavior. Strickland notes that Blanche Stroeve merely \\"wanted to bring me down to her level; she cared nothing for me, she only wanted me to be hers. She was willing to do everything in the world for me except the one thing I wanted: to leave me alone.\\" Strickland is absolutely and irrevocably blind to human need because he has none. He is also the consummate misogynist, calling women stupid and asking of the narrator, \\"Do you really care a twopenny damn if Blanche Stroeve is alive or dead?\\" Strickland further notes that \\"Life has no value.\\" And that her life was unimportant, that she was in fact, a silly woman. The narrator notes of Strickland, \\"I had an inkling of a fiery, tortured spirit, aiming at something greater than could be conceived by anything that was bound up with the flesh. I had a fleeting glimpse of a pursuit of the ineffable.\\" He regards Strickland as \\"a disembodied spirit.\\" This is the essence and the genius of Maugham's book: the glimpse into the mysterious, miraculous daemon of human artistic achievement. Maugham goes on to note of the artist, Strickland: \\"It was as though he found in the chaos of the universe a new pattern, and were attempting clumsily, with anguish of soul, to set it down. I saw a tormented spirit striving for the release of expression.\\" Later Maugham says of Strickland, \\"he was passionately striving for liberation from some power that held him.\\"As Maugham wisely implies, the artist as well as all people is alone in the world. Human communication is vague and uncertain, attempting to convey \\"the treasures of the heart\\" and is thus doomed to failure, So man's condition is destined to be lonely. The brain is seething with ideas but there is no way to communicate them except through art, and for the artist, as was true of Strickland, he \\"had become aware of the soul of the universe and [was] compelled to express it.\\" The narrator suggests that what happened with Blanche Stroeve was that Strickland needed her for a moment in time to release his daemon or satisfy his lust, but when he failed to gain satisfaction from that temporary release, he killed her emotionally out of fear because he realized he'd barely escaped his need for her. Strickland's truthful response to the narrator's contention is, \\"You are a dreadful sentimentalist, my poor friend.\\" Strickland denies his humanity; he simply has no feelings.Yet in the end we are left with the distinct impression that Strickland was the consummate idealist, seizing upon the truths beyond the shadows of existence, the Absolutes that only the most arduous seeker could ever fathom, and only after complete dedication on his part. In that sense it doesn't matter if he sold a single painting or was recognized by the art world he scorned. It was the truth of his vision that mattered and that only. Heedless of his own health, he dies from Leprosy after being blinded by the disease, but his pursuit of his vision continues to the bitter end. And finally the most baffling aspect of the book is his ordering his wife to burn every one of his paintings. So high were his own standards that even in his monomaniacal quest for truth and its artistic expression, he could not accept anything short of perfection.When the narrator later views the few surviving works of the deceased Charles Strickland, he notes \\"It was the work of a man who had delved into the hidden depths of nature and had discovered secrets which were beautiful and fearful too. It was the work of a man who knew things it is unholy for men to know. There was something primeval there and terrible. It was not human.\\" Thus did Strickland inadvertently achieve fame and status as an artist in the eyes of the community, but considering what the quest meant and his own contempt for his efforts, one wonders if on his deathbed, he considered the sorry ordeal worth it.Sixpence is an amount of money that is traditionally conferred at wedding celebrations. How strange that Maugham would employ this usage in his title to describe Strickland, who scorned human commitment. The moon symbol might suggest the lofty goal Strickland set for himself, like \\"reaching for the moon,\\" and his willingness to sacrifice a life of comfort and human connection for that goal. Alas, to some of us the price doesn't seem worth it. In the end he failed to achieve his vision or he wouldn't have ordered his paintings burned and he certainly failed to benefit from the love and devotion of family, friends and colleagues, the sort of attachments he forever scorned. One has to ask how meaningful was all that? Of course if you're an artist you might have a different opinion. Maugham's powerful insight suggests it is indeed insanity that drives the likes of Paul Gaughin.This is an intelligent book dealing with the intangibles of artistic pursuit and its effects on the human community. Maugham relentlessly probes the psychological terrain of a gifted artist for the purpose of capturing that Promethean fire in the soul that propels the artist and at the same time spells his doom in terms of human connection and peace.Marjorie MeyerleColorado WriterAuthor: Bread of Shame"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"What The Moon and Sixpence lacks in length, it more than makes up for in substance. Although Maugham has changed much of Gauguin's history, both substantive and trivial, he has given us an amazingly poignant fictional novel that sheds light on what made the enigmatic genius tick. As we explore the eclectic subtleties and bizarre idiosyncrasies of Charles Strickland, we feel magically transported back to a time and place that is so unlike today's world, yet somehow vividly alive and real.Seeing as it is written in 1st person narrative from a fictional author's point of view, we see England, France, and Tahiti from a unique firsthand perspective - all the while watching Strickland engage in his capriciously self-destructive, yet fastidiously predictable, behavior. While Strickland is far from endearing and likeable, I nonetheless admire him for his resolve and unwavering tenacity which drove him to achieve greatness through art - on his own terms.\\"Sometimes people carry to such perfection the mask they have assumed that in due course they actually become the person they seem.\\"- W.

But it's not a boring biography which contains each detail of Paul Gauguin's life, a lot of the events in the book didn't happen in his real life at all. I really enjoyed reading this book and Ican recommend to read it to everyone."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This story reminds us all that it is never to late to change your life and follow the inner passion that guides you. Charles Strickland was 35 years old when he left his financially comfortable life and family to paint. It is remarkable to experience the power, the struggles and the ramifications of someone who is committed to living life only for himself. It is a strong reminder for those of us who do heed that call, that living for yourself and your own happiness is possible and that many others before us have followed the same path in spirit.I've read the novel several times in the past 8 years...it is interesting to mark my own personal growth and reaction to Maugham's inspiring characters."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"One of his best works. Maugham uses the first person to tell this tale (as he does with most of his other stories) and there is a sense that most if not all of his writings contain many autobiographical parts. This book is one of them. It is the story of how the life of the writer and that of a painter criss-cross until the death of the artist. The artist is based on the life of Paul Gauguin (the painters name is different in the book, but the similarities are too compelling). If you enjoy 19th century art history, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"For fans of Maughum's work, this book does not vere too far from the style and substance of his others. As always, he writes in a tight and lucid manner that suggests more of a conversation with an old--albeit very &#34;old World&#34; proper--friend. There's no rocket launches, or car crashes, or DNA mutations...simply a well written tale which, as an added bonus, provides for the reader a glimpse of an era gone-bye."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Not a book I would recommend. As far as literature goes, I guess it is ok, but the subject matter is frustrating from beginning to end. Nice guys finish last kind of plot. In other words, beat your girlfriend and have no compassion, and your girl will love you till you die and everyone else will treat you like a god. (I am a nice guy, so that is why it irks me so much.) By the end, I just wanted to take a gun and put it to my head. It just struck me on a personal level. (Keeping in mind the year in which it was written helped a bit.) Reading it on the Kindle Paperwhite was fantastic, however."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I ordered this book to replace the one I'd lost- a library book. I was very pleased with the price I paid and the condition of the book. Very gently used and in BETTER condition than the one i'd borrowed from the library."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"In the Holmes (Oliver Wendell, Jr. the jurist) - Einstein (Lewis, American diplomat) letters both express their pleasure in reading this 1919 book by Maugham. It has been 60 years since I read \\"Rain\\" and nothing since then by Maugham. So I decided to give it a try. The central character is a painter, who the other reviewers tell me is patterned after Paul Gauguin, but I do not know how closely. By the time the story reaches Tahiti I suspected as much. Why do we read books that are this old? Holmes wondered the same and for a time stated that he would read nothing written more than 25 years prior. The reviewers stir the pot of inner character beyond my capabilities. Let me say that I enjoyed this novel's observations and descriptions of people, a many of whom including the central character seem Dickensian; the clever aphorisms (is clever redundant?)and the twists and turns that bring surprises at certain points. It is not a long book and I think readers will get the same pleasure from it as did I."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The subject was of utmost interest, a selfish man who is thoroughly and well portrayed in this biopic of a novel. I will re-read it one of these days. One of Maugham's best for sure and haunting in that you remember it when you see a Gaughan hanging in the museum."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The only serious criticism I have of this novel is that it starts a bit slowly, with the London literary scene and boring dinner parties.But when the lightning strikes (\\"Charles Strickland has abandoned his wife and children!\\"), the story suddenly becomes much more interesting, especially because Strickland has been seen and portrayed as the Ultimately Dull English stockbroker.When Strickland chucks it all and goes to Paris, everyone assumes that he has a new girl-friend. In fact, other characters make up the details: \\"He's staying in the best Parisian hotels with his chippie, and dining at the finest restaurants,\\" etc. etc. and so forth.When the young narrator is sent to Paris to try and bring Strickland back, we quickly discover that this is all nonsense. There is no chippie, and Strickland is staying in a very cheap fleabag hotel. When he is asked \\"Why?\\" he only gives one answer, \\"I have to paint.\\"Maugham thus offers a portrait of man enslaved by his Muse, who quite literally does not give a pin for the opinion of others. He is also the most selfish of men, a genuine sociopath in the modern jargon, who is perhaps best captured in the following exchange:Narrator: Well, I must tell you that I find you the most hateful cad I have ever known.Strickland: I'm glad you got that off your chest. Shall we have dinner now?As you may be able to gather from the above, Strickland cares about his painting and about NOTHING ELSE. He can live in a flophouse, wearing the same clothes for five years, and be totally indifferent to all that. Money means nothing to him. Food and drink mean nothing.Well, I won't spoil it for you, but I would offer a warning to young wannabe artists: please do not emulate Charles Strickland's behavior because you think it makes you more \\"artistic.\\" That would really be a case of putting the cart before the horse.Is Strickland Gauguin? In a sense. I suspect that the case of Gauguin got Maugham to thinking, and making notes. But in the end, Strickland and his story wound up being entirely original."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"A portrayal of an artist who lived purely to paint....A difficult task to narrate his life without romantically glorifying his genuis, or morally judging his apathy to anything/anybody else. Also a hard thing to justify the opposite tendency in ordinary people--us then, and now--to care so much about the opinions of others which \\"throws shadows of insincerity over the deeply felt emotions\\". Characters in this book represent various degrees of human relationships with art, beauty and passion brilliantly. Another wonderfully complex and sophisticated book by Maugham."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This story is set at some time around the turn of the twentieth century, before World War 1. The story opens in London, England. The unnamed narrator is a young man who has just written his first successful novel. Gingerly negotiating his way around the \`literati' of England he attends a party at which he meets Mrs. Strickland. She is not herself an author but has a deep interest in meeting talented people. She gives parties at her house where food and drink is laid on, and where various members of the world of the arts and literature are invited. Eventually the narrator is invited to dinner at Mrs. Strickland's, though on arriving he finds that it is not a literary function, but a small private affair. It is here that the narrator meets for the first time Mr. Charles Strickland, who's life-story this book follows. Charles Strickland strikes the narrator as \\"... just a good, dull, honest, plain man.\\" It is therefore with some surprise that the narrators later hears that Mr. Strickland has suddenly abandoned his wife and gone to Paris, apparently in the company of a young woman who worked at a tea-shop in the city. The narrator feels with some excitement that he has just entered the exciting, unseemly world of his own novel. The narrator's life-path crosses several time with that of Charles Strickland. Gradually as the story progresses we come to see Strickland as a markedly talented, yet severely flawed man.This novel, first published in 1919, \\"... confirmed Maugham's reputation as a novelist and is probably his best-known book.\\" This being said it should be noted that the book has moments of greatness, but is also partly flawed.The plot is based on the life of the \`post-impressionist' painter Paul Gauguin. It is, however, primarily a fiction and varies from that artist's real biography. Gauguin was for example French, not English. The points of similarity include:An uneventful first half of life, with a career as a stockbroker,A sudden break with his family,Lack of recognition from the contemporary critics and general public,Recognition of talent from some fellow painters,Living in poverty,A biting, sardonic personality,Leaving Europe to live \`close to nature' in Tahiti,A non-representational art style in which, for example, color represented the emotions.Rather interestingly Strickland physically resembles Vincent van Gogh, with his red hair and beard. Van Gogh was rather a different man to Strickland, though he too painted non-representationally, using color to express emotion. Strickland, like van Gogh spent a short time at an art academy where his efforts were viewed quite askance. Also like van Gogh, Strickland had an unseemly affair that resulted in the painting of a famous reclining nude.The book is roughly divided into three even sections. The first section covers Strickland's unexpected departure to Paris. Here Maugham quite competently sets the scene, introducing us to Strickland's personality. The second section covers life in Paris, concentrating on the relationship with the Strove family. This part of the story is the most conventional segment and is rather uninteresting, at least plot wise. I was reminded of Emily Bronte's &lt;Wuthering Heights> and her sister Charlotte Bronte's &lt;Jane Eyre>, though those books are much more successful than Maugham's. The third section revolves around the trip to Tahiti and it is here that the book truly shines. There seems to be something about the idea of \`getting back to nature' that appeals to the psyche of modern man.It should be noted that Maugham's narrator freely admits his own lack of knowledge of human nature and the motivations of the people he meets. The all-knowing narrator, so standard in many books, is gone, and instead we have am essentially modern device. The reader himself must decide what he believes about particular people. How much, we ask, can we know anyone other than ourselves?Of course the novel has the theme of the genius. We are shows how unconscious forces drive such people, and how all else falls to the wayside on the road to the chosen goal. The novel also explores the theme of the artificiality of \`civilized' society, and the retreat to a more \`real' nature. This idea goes back at least as far as the Eighteenth Century Romantics, though it should be noted that Maugham has his own spin on the topic. Nature, for example, is not always the \`pleasant mother' of the Romantics.Strickland is adequately drawn as a terse, abrasive man with a monomania for his art. His name suggests the \`strict land' he has chosen to dwell in, where everything is rejected except his calling. His name also perhaps suggests \\"strychnine' as he is poison to just about all who he meets. After his initial \`conversion' to the path of art Strickland there is at first some humor arising from his candor about his rejection of social norms. Soon, however, a monomaniac becomes predictably dull, and Maugham has achieved the unusual task of writing about a central character by highlighting the people around him. The second section accents the Stroves, particularly Dirk, a good-natured man with perhaps more heart than sense. Interestingly Dirk may be Maugham's comment on the Romantics. The third section reveals to us a whole procession of characters, many of them eccentric, who encountered Strickland in various situations. These portraits greatly enhance the novel.All in all this is certainly not a bad book, but not a great one either. The second section, as I have noted, mars the book to some degree.

The pleasing fluidity that is a salient characteristic of his prose is omnipresent here as well, making this as fast a read as one of John Grisham's earlier works. Somerset is one of those writers who could expound on fluff and yet make a charming discourse out of it. And yet, while reading his candidly autobiographical \`The Summing Up,' he almost convinces you that he is an untalented, hardworking writer who has to labor at his writing, with his one shortcoming being that he could never be as fluent as the writers he idolized - I might say that his one shortcoming seems to have been unbecoming modesty.Coming to the book itself, it is loosely based on the life and work of Paul Gauguin. One of the things I found rather interesting about this narrative is how Somerset decided to name his protagonist Strickland, rather than just Paul Gauguin. While I do agree that Somerset did not have enough first-hand material to call his account a true-to-life account, he had more than his share of literary license to fall back upon to make it past that. I wonder if it was his artistic integrity or a fear of some repercussion from Gauguin's surviving family members that caused him to take this decision (since most of what Somerset had to relate about Strickland was less than flattering, and given the chameleon like nature of Strickland's wife, such an expectation might not be unfounded). Either way, he did not adopt the same style of writing as Irving Stone did in \\"Lust For Life.\\"The one lasting impression I came away with was the constant reminder from Somerset that though he admitted Strickland's genius, and admired his labor for his art, he certainly did not like him, or respect him as a human being, which is a juxtaposition of emotions that I don't come across normally in a book that is meant to be biographical in nature.Another pleasing aspect about the book was the plenitude of quotable quotes issuing forth from Somerset's pen, some of them bordering on the Wildean, in my opinion. I remember one of them being to the effect that a woman is ready to forgive a man for the harm he has done her, but is never willing to forgive a man for the sacrifices he makes for her - the apparent irony of that really tickled me for a while.I."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The book revisits a theme that Maugham took up severaltimes - that of an artist completely devoted to his art.Interestingly, there is no attempt to look for the causesof the destructive behavior of the main character, or evento pass judgment on it. Strickland's life and actionsare examined, sometimes in great detail. However, after the author'sinitial disapprobation, he comes to some sort of acceptance ofStrickland strange way of life.W. Somerset Maugham is best when he writes aboutrelationships. While this book seems a bit forced at times,Maugham had such a unique view of the topic that always makeshis writing interesting."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"When he first meets Charles Strickland, a London stockbroker, the young narrator of this novel thinks of him as \\"good, honest, dull, and plain.\\" When Strickland suddenly abandons his wife and children and takes off for Paris, however, the narrator decides he is a cad. Though he has had no training, Strickland has decided to become an artist, a drive so strong that he is willing to sacrifice everything toward that end. Anti-social, and feeling no obligation to observe even the smallest social decencies, Strickland becomes increasingly boorish as he practices his art. Eventually, he makes his way to Tahiti, where he \\"marries,\\" moves to a remote cottage, and spends the rest of his life devoted to his art.Basing the novel loosely on the life of Paul Gauguin, Maugham creates an involving and often exciting story. His narrator is a writer who feels impelled to set down his memories of his early interactions with Strickland in London and Paris after Strickland's death and posthumous success. Because the narrator never saw Strickland after he left Paris, he depends on his meetings with a ship captain and a woman in Papeete for information about Strickland after Strickland arrived in Tahiti. The ship captain is described as a story-teller who may be spinning tall tales, a constant reminder to the reader that this is fiction, and not a biography of Gauguin.By depicting Strickland as a \\"dull, plain\\" man suddenly gripped by an obsession so overwhelming that nothing else matters to him, Maugham involves the reader in his actions, which even the narrator claims not to understand. The least convincing aspect of Strickland's characterization is the narrator's observation that Strickland is completely indifferent to his wife of seventeen years and his children. No confrontation between Strickland and his wife appears, and one wonders if perhaps Maugham found himself unable to depict such an abandonment realistically. The story moves quickly, however, and whatever is sacrificed in the characterization is more than recouped in the plot and its development.Straightforward in its story line, the novel is romantic in its depiction of the artist in the grip of an obsession, his subsequent abandonment of civilization and return to nature, his suffering of a long terminal illness (during which he paints his masterpiece), and the fate of this creation further develop the romantic themes. Good, old-fashioned story-telling at its best, this uncomplicated story, written in 1919, still has broad appeal. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The characters in this book are well chosen and with the death of Strickland Maugham shows the unimportance of man's existence. The thing Strickland did was more important than himself as a person. Yet sometimes Strickland gets a bit unrealistic, because he seems to be so selfish and really doesn't care about anything else but his inner urge to paint. The story describes the life of the great painter Gauguin although he is not mentioned by name but there are a lot of similarities between the two. Exotic places are also an important part in the novel, which makes it interesting and easy to read to read. On the whole it's a well written story."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Obviously the book tells a story based on the life of the famous painter Paul Gauguin but it is also a projection of Maugham's thoughts and desires. In fact his main character, Charles Strickland, is exactly like Maugham would like to be because he sacrifies everyone and everything just to follow his inner vision, which is to paint. He doesn't care about society he doesn't care about material things, he just lives for ideas and is indifferent to everything else. That's according to some philosophers, the true and only way to be an artist and I think that it is also Maugham's opinion about it. Therefore he created a figure who is nothing but his ideal picture of himself, as he did not have the courage and the force to live it in reality, probably due to his constant fear of losing all social relations. It's a really good book which could give you, the reader, the force to realize yourself and to do only what you really like and give up everything else to reach your aim."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"In The Moon and Sixpence, Maugham introduces the artist Charles Stickland, whom we wish never to meet outside these pages. He is a thoughtless and irrational genius, wholly unconcerned about any opinion of his painting other than his own. In fact he is throughly unconcerned about any type of disapprobation. Without using the phrase, Maugham interprets Strickland as an \\"idiot savant,\\" who is blissfully unaware of any other person's feelings. He abandons his wife and children, he induces a suicide in a lover, and is unaccountably remorseless for these and other trespasses against human decency. It is Strickland's ostentatious remorselessness which turns the reader against him, and his genius isn't sufficient to mitigate our, well, disapprobation. We already knew that great artists don't always have to be great people; what Maugham does, however, is take us to the extremes of both. Therein lies the creative tension, and it remains with us for a very long time after we turn the last page."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"The Moon and Sixpence is a short, intelligent, well-written, sophisticated, episodic piece of second-class literature written by a first-class (though not genius-level) writer.It is not featured on the MLA's list of the hundred best novels of the 20th century, and I can see why--withal its superiority to inferior works that ARE on the list.Maugham has a very pleasing (though not dumbed-down) style, which makes for swift and pleasurable reading. This book is not as good as The Razor's Edge or Of Human Bondage, but it is not something one would be ashamed to have on the resume either. It's a book that can be read in a day, and which probably won't change your life...but it should enhance you nonetheless."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham has put in a lot of effort in an attempt to delve into the mind of an artist, tortured by his artistic impuses, impervious to the ordinary needs of normal people and to the moral codes that are made to secure and safeguard the needs.But his choice of an english stockbroker to represent the very gaelic gauguin is flawed. Perhaps I was prejudiced, but an englishman in colonial times, in my mind was strictly bound to ideas of fair play and social morals. He's not, unlike his french counterpart able to disregard, convention and give in to powerful artistic impulses.The depiction of the burst of creativity, in tahiti, the tropicalness, the simplicity of natives, who lead their lives governed by instinct rather than complex social norms wasn't powerful or impressive, not in the same was that irving stone impressed with his depiction van gogh's achivements in arles."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Beautiful writing. Somerset Maugham wrote with so much feeling it's hard not to fall in love with his stories or himself. Romantic and practical, the author narrates his personal journey with well-known painter \\"Charles Strickland\\", Maugham's stories feature their early lives in England, Paris and later Tahiti. Described as a \\"selfish\\" man (depending on how you view him), Strickland suffers isolation and no recognition during his lifetime. His advanced art vision set the base for a post impressionist movement, raised Strickland to fame posthumously. I really think Maugham has done an incredibly super job in describing the complexity of the characters in the book (Strickland, Dirk Stroeve, Tarie among others). Thorough and subtle, his characters are believable and alive. Maugham also includes stories of Tahitian natives whom Strickland has made his acquaintances. His dreamy description of Tahitian lives make me want to live there and experience the island's beauty for myself."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Fair delivery but poor quality. I choose the 'used-very good' but got a 'used-unacceptable'. I can tell that this book must be very very old version. The cover is different from the one I saw online and it's a half-naked female. The back cover and other pages are almost leaving the spine. I love the article and appreciate the opportunity to buy a used book. But the lie about the quality is not acceptable. The only reason I would not to return it is the cost. Other buyer's should be aware of the 'real' quality."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I really liked reading this book, although sometimes I was a bit bored by the monologues of the narrator. Also the way the characters of the women are described, disappointed me a bit, because it seems that they mostly live to serve men. I was absolutely fascinated by the character of Strickland. Even if he seemed almost evil because of his indifference, there was something about him that made him mysterious. At the beginning you'd never guess what type of man Strickland really is, because he seems to be absolutely normal. I would have been glad, if he lived a bit longer in the book, because I wanted to know more about him. But perhaps it is exactly this that makes the story so interesting. Most of the information you need you get to know out of the dialogues between the narrator and somebody who knew Strickland and that makes him particularly mysterious. You learn a lot about art and artists and their way to live. I can really recommend this book, it will not disappoint you!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I enjoyed reading the book a lot, first started I was always excited to read on to know what would happen next. It is quite hard to believe, that someone could care so little about other people's opinions and feelings as Strickland does, still it gives you another point of view, it shows you the way of someone who followed his obsession entirely and was faithful up to the end at least to himself. Strickland is not the only interesting character in the book though. Strickland's wife, the narrator's friend Stroeve , as well as Blanche, are very special and radical in their way, all of them leave you with a sad picture."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I liked the story. Not only Strickland himself, but also the other characters and their own little stories (for example Dirk Stroeve's) were really interesting. But the most interesting was of course Charles Strickland and his way from a stockbroker to an extremely creative but also obsessed artist. Maugham describes his character very accurately but not in a too detailed way. So the story is very fluent and never boring. Besides that, the language level of the story is, I think, quite high and so the book demands some reading skills as long as you are not a native speaker and is not just a nice, simple story about a famous artist. I also liked very much that I as a reader was like travelling with the author and could always find out new things about Strickland's life."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I had to read this book in school and I was really positivly surprised. Maugham tells the story of anbusiness and family man called Strickland who is obsessed by art and who decides to become a painter. Maugham tells this story in a very interesting way and you can read it almost in a day. Personallly I like the beginning and the end most. There you get a good view of the different persons and characters and he tries to explain what art can do. In the middle is a long stretch of narration where Strickland lives in Paris, which is really too long and I wonder why Maugham did it because you don't really get much insight into Strickland's character at all. The end of the novel is very well written. Maugham tells the story indirectly by introducing a narrator who interviews various people who met Strickland during his life in Tahiti. I can recommend this book to everyone that likes fluent language and an interesting plot."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This book is incredible. Maugham's delicious descriptive sense and writing ability are a delight. For anyone who feels like no one understands them (and don't we all?) will enjoy this urge. It will also give all readers an overwhelming urge to create somethig with passion. I suggest you read it and decide for yourself, but you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"OK, so the author's storytelling talent is great, he told a counterintuitive story and Paul Gauguin's works continue to inspire a broad swath of humanity a century later .... The novel is not that interesting. The artist is an ass. He cares for nothing. Even his commitment to art, beauty and truth is nothing more than an obsession. The obsession is not well described. The third party commentator approach becomes boring. The characterization of four potentially inspiring locations is weak, almost bleached out. There may have been a time when the artist's courage to provide a countervailing perspective, running against the inertia of the culture, was a heroic act, worthy of praise. Today it seems pedestrian, self-serving, even formulaic. I appreciate many of Maugham's other works, but this one fell flat."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"\\"You know,\\" my Iranian boyfriend said one evening as we lay squished together on his twin bed. \\"I don't think I'm the kind of man who could ever marry an American.

We moved to his country. Had a couple of kids. And before too long had passed, I realized I was in way over my head. He was a conservative Iranian. A practicing Muslim. I was a liberal American. A Born Again Nothing. The two opposing mindsets clashed like a paisley print with florals.The marriage went up in smoke. Because I was who I was, regardless of the show. He was who he was, the man he'd declared himself to be.Years after I divorced, I joined the dating site [...]. Sifting through member profiles, I discovered a bevy of interesting men. Some claimed to like baseball, others Harley Davidsons. Some fancied themselves intellectuals, others thrived on yoga.I clicked on a candidate with an interesting description. An independent businessman who flew planes, studied in Hawaii, an expert on the stock market. Before too long, we began a relationship.\\"You know,\\" he said over dinner one evening, \\"My therapist is nothing short of a miracle worker. Everyone claims narcissim can't be cured. But she's convinced we've got mine beat.\\"Flipping through Webster's later that night, I studied the definition of his \\"former\\" personaity disorder. Narcissism: the inordinate fascination with oneself; excessive self-love: vanity.Worrisome.....But wait! He was a compelling man, despite his aloofness. He led a fascinating life, even if it was fictitious. He'd been hurt in a divorce. No wonder he was skittish.Once he realized I was different, he'd relax with me.I'd play it cool.I'd pretend I didn't care if he were seeing nine other women.I was falsely casual, he was grandiose, think for a minute, what a fabulous team that would make.Two years later I cut my losses. He was, after all, what he and Webster's defined him to be.In between boyfriends, I needed a lift. So, I decided to read my way through a long list of classics. I'd always liked Somerset Maugham, having read The Razor's Edge, but it was his 1919 short novel, Moon and Sixpence, that sent alarm bells off in my head.Buried within the tale of Charles Strickland-- a middle aged English stock broker who abandons his wife and children to pursue his desire to become an artist-- I discovered a treasure trove of insight into human nature:\\"I had not yet learnt how contradictory is human nature; I did not know how much pose there is in the sincere, how much baseness in the noble, nor how much goodness in the reprobate... When people say they do not care what others think of them, for the most part they decieve themselves. Generally they mean only that they will do as they choose, in the confidence that no one will know their vagaries; and at the utmost only that they are willing to act contrary to the opinion of the majority because they are supported by the approval of their neighbors.\\"So willing to alter myself to win a man over, I was thrilled by Strickland, a character who cares nothing for others. Not their feelings, nor their opinions, not their companionship. Unusual for a sociopath, he takes ownership of his nature. When his lover commits suicide after their affair goes belly up, Strickland disavows all sense of responsibility: \\"I told her that when I'd had enough of her she'd have to go, and she'd have to go, and she said she'd risk that.\\"But more precisely, it was Maughm's exploration of Strickland's women, their refusal to acknowledge his ugly self-description, that really hit home for me as my truth.\\"When a woman loves you she's not satisfied until she possesses your soul...I saw Blanche little by little trying all her tricks with infinite patience...she cared nothing for me, she only wanted me to be hers...But the blindess of love led her to believe what she wanted to be true, and her love was so great that it seemed impossible to her that it should not in return awake an equal love.\\"For someone like me-- a bit of a floater, unsure of her own opinions or goals-- a confident man was like the shining North Star.I was sure I'd be all right as long as I followed his course. My willingness to hang on, to ignore distancing statements, was never about love. It was purely navigational.But, really what I was seeking had nothing to do with confidence. What I liked to label self-assurance was frank ambivalence. And the more a man wavered, the deeper I bit in. Because to win over the indifferent was to prove my own worth.When a person proclaims something bad about themselves, believe them. Or don't be surprised at the end result."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"I really enjoyed this book.It stands out in my memory.Some classic books can be boring, but not this one! What is amazing to me is that I actually felt some sympathy for Charles despite his immense selfishness. People should not overlook this book."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"When I first picked up this book, I took it merely as an entertainment novel that helps me to kill an idle evening. I read it. I read it again. I read on and on. All of a sudden, the world around me disappeared totally. Everything around me, the trees, the people, the strawberry in a bowl, were clothed with a dim and unspeakable color. I felt the power that Maugham tried to convey to the readers. I felt that struggling pain, but in an exultance. I came to love Maugham since then and decided to focus on him on my graduation thesis. Maugham is not a very serious writer that can be found easily in any A-level writer list. However, there is something extremely unique about him: He saw life and wrote it down not only as what it is, but as what it will be. Who said Strickland is an inhuman painter? Didn't he see the tears that he shed for the faithful tears of Ata? In my eyes, Strickland IS detestable, for he wants too much. Isn't there always a strickland in our hearts? Ignorance doesn't mean overlooking it. Philip in \\"Of Human Bondage\\" walked all the path taht Maugham walked on, but strickland went through a spiritual prigrimage that only rehearsed in Maugham's mind. Maugham is a pathetic guy throughout. He is one of a few who remain somber, therefore, he is painful. Read this book in a room of your own, you'll find a room with a view."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Painting, even if it uses codes, is the art of showing, whereas the writer, limited to words, can only proceed by allusion, by tickling images from the minds of his public. This was the challenge in Maugham's novel-length portrait of the cursed painter, loosely based on Gauguin's life. The result is a powerful and haunting depiction, as directly powerful as any painting.The story follows the downward spiral of Charles Strickland from the moment he decides to leave his stockbroking job and conventional English family, or rather his upward spiral, towards artistic zenith. The victims fall one after the other around him as he sacrifices everything to painting, not just wealth and security, but all regard for fellow humans and decency physical and moral. Yet this is no stereotype of the crazed genius. Strickland is coldly conscious of his choices, pragmatic in his idolatry, clear-eyed in his determination on a ride to hell; this is what makes The Moon and Sixpence so convincing and so creepily fascinating.Maugham avoids delving into the unknowable reasons for his protagonist's change of life. Neither does he waste time in ponderous commentary on painting or the nature of genius. At the same time, the narrator's tale, with its inevitable hearsay and conjecture, contrasts the ambiguity of storytelling with the absolutes of pictorial art. But this is essentially a white-knuckle ride from London to Paris, on to the dodgier suburbs of Marseille, and destruction in the Tahitian jungle. Almost as obsessive as Strickland's own passion."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Maugham's fictionalized biography of French ImpressionistPaul Gaughin presents a stark attempt to recreate the bizarre life of this amoral painter. Despite the action-less first two chapters (which seem to lead nowhere) this riveting novel dares portray the protagonist as an Englishman; the passive narrator attempts to reconstruct the history of a genius who remained unrecognized in his long-suffering lifetime. Shocked by the callous way this \\"unmitigated cad\\" treats his devoted, law-abiding wife, the narrator is both nauseated and appalled by Strickland's flagrant disregard for social proprieties-even to repaying the most generous hospitality with crass betrayal. Yet the unnamed narrator is gradually, reluctantly, drawn into a web of admiration for the passion of the iconoclastic Artist, who seems possessed by demons in his search for the ideal of Beauty.Slowly but inexorably readers are introduced to the private actions and misanthropic attitude of an artist-in-training, oneCharles Strickland. Related by a decent observer/narrator the novel retraces the violent birth of genius: from his sudden inexplicable desertion of his wife, his flight to a meager garret in Paris; there the former stockbroker sacrifices all to learn a new, soul-driven craft. Long after Strtickland's death of Leprosy in Tahiti, the narrator interviews various persons who knew and/or loved him, thus piecing together a posthumous biographical patchwork of the tortured painter. Regardless of Maugham's adherence to (or deviation from) strict biographical detail, this novel mesmerizes readers as it spotlights the tormented life of a man who insists on metamorphosing into true Genius by sheer will power. The character of Strickland,condemned as shameless and scandalous by polite Society, will fascinate generations of readers who appreciate the passion of a literary artist who proves Gaughin's equal. Judge him for yourself!"},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"This book is cynicism without any pomp. The protagonist, an aspiring artist named Charles Strickland, drops all links with humanity including himself. With social and ethical obligations and even all but the most minimal attention to his own comfort disgarded, he pursues creating raw beauty. Severing these connections results in a personal indifference to marketing his work or providing a context of understanding, his art is not appreciated until after his death. This novel is about sacraficing everything including one's virtue for a singular achievement.This book is appealing as an expression of this idea and is especially of interest to those with a fascination with art or art history. People who understand cynicism deeply will appreciate the lack of unsubstantiated motivation in the protagonist, he can be seen as a champion of truth if one has a jaded view on human motivation and morality."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Inspired by the life of Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; is the story of a bourgeois, seemingly philistine man who completely transforms his life with the inexorable urge to be an artist. The man is Charles Strickland, a middle-class London stockbroker with a wife and two children, and the story is told in the first person by a nameless narrator who happens to make Strickland's acquaintance. One day, Strickland abandons his family and runs off to Paris, leaving no suitable explanation. The narrator, on Strickland's wife's entreaty, trails him to a seedy hotel, where he reveals a somewhat rude disposition and explains that he's always wanted to be a painter but was forced into business by his father. He plans to live in Paris and paint and has no intention to return to his family and his old life.In Paris a few years later, the narrator introduces us to a friend of his, a Dutch painter named Dirk Stroeve who happens to have made Strickland's acquaintance. Stroeve is a comical, pathetic figure who is not much of a talent himself, but he tells the narrator that Strickland has some real genius that nobody seems to recognize. Strickland, in the meantime, has isolated himself in poverty and self-absorption and become a surly, insufferable, misogynistic boor who repays Stroeve's kindness and friendship by insulting his work, seducing his wife, and kicking him out of his own home.Strickland later moves to Marseilles and eventually to Tahiti where he lives the rest of his short life, afflicted with leprosy and inspired to create his most profound and beautiful works of art. The narrator goes there years after Strickland's death and collects stories about his final years on the picturesque tropical island from various people who came into contact with him. It turns out that Strickland's paintings, once generally considered junk, are now priceless masterpieces.Maugham has been one of my favorite writers since I read &quot;Of Human Bondage,&quot; and this novel offers more of his straightforward, thoughtful prose with regard to describing the life and experiences of a man who realizes he doesn't quite fit in with the world and strives to make his life meaningful to himself, if not to others. Charles Strickland's life exemplifies the theme of many existentialist novels that were to be written throughout the 20th Century -- living your life doing what you truly want to do rather than vainly pursuing what will make you the most money or please your family or impress your friends. The culmination of Strickland's life in Tahiti symbolizes man's return to the Garden of Eden, the return to innocence, the rejection of materialism; which may have been Gauguin's ideal for humanity."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"W. Somerset Maugham's _The Moon and Sixpence_ (1919) poses two principal questions. First, what responsibility does the individual have to the rules of the society in which he or she lives? And more specifically, what responsibility does the person of genuis--whether it be in the arts, science, or spirituality, etc.--have to society? While the artist and anithero Charles Strickland is not in the strictest sense a law breaker--although he does have, at least, technically a bigamous relationship--he breaks social conventions relentlessly.The narrator of the novel, a writer and artist himself who attempts to write Strickland's biography, cannot resolve these questions. A search for answers impels him to write the biography. The narrator suspects throughout his writing that his underlying disapproval of Strickland's life is based on sentimentality rather than pure morality, yet he can neither adopt nor accept Strickland's way of life.Early in the book, the narrator asks Strickland about his views on German philosopher Emmanuel Kant's categorical imperative: \\"Act so that every one of your actions is capable of being made into a universal rule.\\" Kant's statement, a classic dictum in Western ethical philosophy, does not register with Strickland. He replies, \\"I never heard it before, but it's rotten nonsense.\\" Adopting the inverse of this in which the individual is the measure of what is right and his self-expression preeminent, Strickland follows his own impulses in pursuit of perfection in art without concern for others' feelings or well-being.Arguably, the results are mixed. Strickland creates brilliant, original art, authentic to his primal existence, yet the cost is profound suffering for himself and those close to him.All of the secondary characters, whether the artisit Dirk Stroeve and his wife, Blanche, the enterprising Captain Brunot, or the scientific Dr. Coutras, shed light on Strickland's personality. We see Strickland through these characters. As a result, Strickland is as many identities as there are people to comprehend his life and his art. For example, Strickland's estranged son Robert, a minister, has even written his biography arguing for the deep morality of his father. While the facts utterly contradict this, on a deeper level, the novel even holds this out as a possibility. Faced with the challenge to understand, the narrator admits that if this were a novel he could impute a range of motives to explain logically Strickland's behavior. The man, however, defies such characterizations.The narrator's ultimate view, and I would argue the philosophical perspective of the novel, is stated early in the book: \\"The greatness of Charles Strickland was authentic.\\" In other words, the narrator feels that Charles, whatever his faults, has lived life on his terms, not subect to hollow social conventions, and in this he has attained greatness.Connected with this, Maugham explores the idea that the artist can achieve liberation in art if the artist \\"seeks his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of his thoughts\\" without concern for public acceptance. Paradoxically, Strickland does achieve fame, and it is primarily because of his celebrity that he is remembered and is a curiosity to the narrator. His greatness is very much tied to his fame.One weakness of the work, I feel, is the unproblematic depiction of Tahiti as the mythic hesperides--that is, a fecund garden at the end of the world where golden apples bloom. The notion that Charles Strickland was one those men who are \\"born out of their place\\" and that his raw attitude toward life is in some way fundamentally Tahitian seems very shaky. It is too naive an answer to the questions the novel raises, simplifying Tahitian society and Strickland.In my opinion, the novel's main strength is that it demands that readers come to terms with their own views about Strickland and his life. Maugham also deals very frankly with what would be controversial life choices today in 2005, much less in 1919 when the book was published."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Enjoyed reading this book.

Loosely based on the life of Paul Gaugin, the French painter, the book explores how strong desires and yearnings can be repressed until they become uncontrollable and burst forth with unforseen consequences.Charles Strickland works in the financial district of London. His wife seems more interested in the visual arts than he does. She is involved in the social side of this world whilst he is portrayed as a distant and boring figure. He has two children,is financially secure and his life is as unremarkable as the majority.In is forties he suddenly disappears and is found by the narrator in Paris living in poverty and learning to paint. He has no previous training and is beginning the process from scratch. He is not just a late developer who wishes to become a competant artist but a driven man who aims for imortality.The book is written in the first person and the narrator, an observant writer, is varioualy an associate, a friend and a living concience to Strickland. This allows Maugham to present his own views on the meaning of life and genious.Strickland and all the characters he interacts with are beautifully drawn as are the settings (1900's) of London,Paris and Tahiti. This is a fine novel which can be savoured and it might just change your perspective on what really matters."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"Of course well written (W.Somerst Maugham).A bit tedious and stilted.

Strickland seems inhuman, nevertheless he can be a model for everybody even today because he does what he wants - he just goes his way straight in his later years and he doesn't care about other people's opinions. I can't accept some statements made by the author about women though. Probably Maugham wants to provoke or to make people think about them, but I think that's not the right way to do it. I liked Maugh's style of narration because he mostly uses simple sentences, which often contain a lot of interesting ideas. Maugham writes a lot of dialogues, and they aren't superficial. On the contrary, they are very unusual because of the Strickland's way of always speaking his mind even if it hurts people around him."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"&quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; proves that the brilliant insight into the human psyche displayed by W.S. Maugham in his first book (&quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;) was no fluke. In &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; Maugham violently reveals the strength and depth of our relationships with our passions, and with those we live among and meet along the way to where we are going. W.S. Maugham has a tremedous grasp of human emotion and character, and his printed revelations are soothing in that I know I am not alone in my way of thinking and feeling. Outstanding literature.

Not at the level of the brilliant \\"Of Human Bondage.\\""},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"In \\"Moon and Six Pences\\", Willian Somerset Maugham created fiction beyond the shadows of the reality. It's widely known that the life of the main character, Charles Strickland, is based on some events of the life of the painter Paul Gaugin. However, it's not closely to be a byographical work, actually, it is good work of fiction.The narrative can be divided in three distinguishing parts. In the first one, we are introduced to narrator, Strickland and his family, and some friends. In this section of the novel, the painter is not a painter yet, and he has an ordinary and boring life with his wife and kids. Although we can notice he is not a happy man, we never got a slightest clue of he is about to do. Charlie appears only in a couple of paragraphs of this part, and we learn much more about him through other people's comments. The second part stars with a surprise when he escapes to Paris and his wife ask the narrator to help her. That's when we see much more about Charlie. It's discovered that all he wants is to get down to painting. It's the largest part of the novel and this when the most important events of Strckland's life happen, and this will influence his art forever. The last part is very interesting, because it is when the narrator is no longer in touch with the painter and everything he learns about him -- and so do we -- is through the people who had lived with Charlie in the Tahiti.This novel may not be Maugahm's masterpice, but on the other hand it is a very good reading. I think the the whole novel comes down to following a dream. Many times near the end, the writer makes it very clear. Mainly when he tells a woman a story of a doctor who could have got everything he wanted but he chose living in a far and poor place, because it satisfied hismelf much more. This is the same thing that happens to our hero. He spent most his time in a tasteless and senless family life in London. He was almost 40 when he gave everthing up in order to fullfill his feelings. Nobody understand why he did so, but as he said all the time, he didn't give a damn to what people thought or said about him.All in all, this novel I had the feeling that Charles Strickland was a desperate soul in search of rendemption, and he only got it after quiting his meaningless life and seaching for his own sense of life."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"SOBERBIAWilliam Somerset Maugham\\"Cada uno de nosotros vive solo en el mundo, encerrado en una torre de bronce, y nos comunicamos con los dem&aacute;s por medio de signos; pero como esos signos no tienen un valor com&uacute;n, su sentido es incierto.

Su padre era un periodista liberal y tuvo que emigrar, en 1852, con toda su familia a Per&uacute; tras el golpe de estado de Napole&oacute;n III. En Lima, hu&eacute;rfano de padre, residi&oacute; la familia Gauguin hasta el oto&ntilde;o de 1854, fecha en la que regresan a Francia, instal&aacute;ndose en Orl&eacute;ans. En 1861 se trasladan a Par&iacute;s donde la madre trabaja como modista para sacar a la familia adelante. Paul se prepara para ingresar en la Escuela de N&aacute;utica, pero suspende y se enrola en la marina con 17 a&ntilde;os, hasta 1871. A su regreso a Par&iacute;s en 1872 se convierte, gracias a un amigo de la familia, en agente de Bolsa, trabajo en el que se desenvuelve muy bien, obteniendo buenos ingresos que le permiten coleccionar pinturas, empezar a pintar y contraer matrimonio con la joven danesa Mette Gad, con la que tendr&aacute; cinco hijos. Su primer maestro art&iacute;stico ser&aacute; Camille Pissarro de cuya mano entra en el grupo impresionista, participando con ellos en varias exposiciones. Tambi&eacute;n le llamar&aacute; la atenci&oacute;n Edgar Degas. En 1882 numerosos agentes de Bolsa son despedidos, entre ellos Gauguin, que empieza a pensar en vivir de su pintura. Las dificultades econ&oacute;micas, problema con el que convivir&aacute; siempre, motivan el traslado en 1883 a Rouen porque la vida all&iacute; era m&aacute;s barata. Pasan dos a&ntilde;os en los que no sabe muy bien qu&eacute; hacer, llegando a trabajar como representante de toldos, viajando entre Rouen, Par&iacute;s y Copenhague hasta que en 1886 decide instalarse en Par&iacute;s junto a su hijo mayor, dejando al resto de la familia en Dinamarca. Ese mismo a&ntilde;o se traslada a Pont-Aven, en la Breta&ntilde;a francesa, donde su pintura cambiar&aacute; radicalmente, abandonando el Impresionismo e iniciando un camino m&aacute;s personal con un colorido m&aacute;s intenso y un mayor simbolismo. Pero Gauguin es el eterno viajero que desea huir desde su infancia por lo que se traslada a Panam&aacute;, donde trabaja en el Canal que se est&aacute; construyendo, y a Martinica, lugar en el que se relaciona por primera vez con el exotismo que caracterizar&aacute; su pintura. De regreso a Francia y tras un breve paso por Par&iacute;s, se instala de nuevo en Breta&ntilde;a, concretamente en Le Pouldu. Aqu&iacute; experimenta de nuevo un cambio en su forma de pintar gracias a la influencia del arte oriental, que le llevar&aacute; a un mayor sintetismo. En esos momentos pinta obras como La visi&oacute;n despu&eacute;s del serm&oacute;n, El Cristo amarillo o La bella Angela. La estancia bretona se vio interrumpida por una breve temporada con Vincent van Gogh en Arles, relaci&oacute;n de la que ambos salieron mal parados, aunque conservaron la amistad. Su nuevo sue&ntilde;o es marcharse a Tahit&iacute;, llegando a Papeete en 1891. Piensa ganarse la vida haciendo retratos pero decide retirarse de la civilizaci&oacute;n y vivir con una joven mestiza. El primitivismo y el simbolismo marcan su pintura, como se observa en Yo te saludo, Mar&iacute;a, La mujer con la flor, Tierra deliciosa o Diversiones. En septiembre de 1893 regresa a Par&iacute;s, donde espera el reconocimiento de su talento y el &eacute;xito econ&oacute;mico, pero ocurre lo contrario por lo que en junio de 1895 se traslada de nuevo a Ocean&iacute;a, desesperado, enfermo, alcoh&oacute;lico y solo. Las Marquesas ser&aacute; su nuevo destino y all&iacute; har&aacute; sus obras m&aacute;s famosas: Never more, Los jinetes, Joven con el abanico, Cuentos b&aacute;rbaros, &iquest;De d&oacute;nde venimos?, &iquest;Qu&eacute; somos?, &iquest;Ad&oacute;nde vamos? o Y el oro de sus cuerpos, obras en las que pone de manifiesto su intenci&oacute;n de romper absolutamente con la tradici&oacute;n realista. Gauguin empieza una importante campa&ntilde;a a favor de los ind&iacute;genas y al tener dificultades con las autoridades de Tahit&iacute;, abandona la isla y se traslada a Atuana, donde intenta aislarse lo m&aacute;s posible con una muchachita muy joven y en una caba&ntilde;a confortable; morir&aacute;, al parecer de un ataque card&iacute;aco, el 8 de mayo de 1903, so&ntilde;ando con regresar a Europa y volver a empezar, esta vez en Espa&ntilde;a."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"An enchanting novel about the life of the English painter Charles Strickland (based on Paul Gauguin - but not entirely biographic). Strickland leaves his familiy to devote himself to painting. He goes to Paris, where he lives in poverty and does nothing but paint. He does not care about his fellow-painters and often offenses them in rather cruel ways. He's totally indifferent to any comfort and relationship. He finally dies on the island of Tahiti, where he had been married a second time. Maugham lets the narrator's character (which is omnipresent during every episode of Strickland's life) act in the background as to give more importance to the painter's action and generally to his own ideas. Nevertheless, I do not consider Strickland the most important thing in the novel, but his way of living, on one hand the &quot;prison&quot; of an artist, which is created by his own desire to do nothing but (in Strickland's case) paint - it's not an option, it's rather a compulsion. Maugham shows Stricklands indifference to everything and everyone very well and his desire to be like Gauguin seems obvious and very marked. In the end, Strickland dies and Maugham lets the reader feel that he was content and somehow fulfilled. I especially liked Maugham's description of Strickland's canvas on Tahiti. He lets the reader feel every perception he obviously felt observing his canvas... a wealth of observations. What I didn't like was a part of Strickland's life in Paris where everything seemed a bit predictable."},{"Title":"Moon and Sixpence","review":"When we decided to read this novel in class, and we were told that it was inspired by the life of Gauguin I was a bit prejudiced against it, because I didn't like most of the pictures that Gaugin had painted.

In fact the story is inspired by Gauguin, there are parallels, but it's not the real story of Gauguin's life anyway Maugham's descriptions are absolutely convincing, and the end of the novel is... just great! I mean, a man who tells the others before what a great time he had at the front then quotes the Bible, which is so conrary to the main message of the book, which is NOT revenge: Do what you are called to do, live your life according to your inner voice, don't care about society and what people might say and think about your work of art whatever that may be. One piece of advice: I recommend to every reader to study the Maugham biography while reading the novel. You will discover a lot of parallels, similarities and projections (e.g. between Maugham and Strickland)."},{"Title":"Voltron Volume 2: Paradise Lost (Voltron: Defender of the Universe)","review":"This Volume 2 trade paperback seems to be in Black and White. Volume 1 was in FULL COLOR, so why did they produce this in BLACK AND WHITE?! The story is GREAT, but the lack of color really takes away from the entire piece.Also, the book is in digest size which is the size of a Reader's Digest, about 5\\" x 7\\". This book is not the size of a comic book. You are better off buying the separate comic books if you can find them."},{"Title":"Voltron Volume 2: Paradise Lost (Voltron: Defender of the Universe)","review":"Voltron was probably the first Japanese giant transforming robot cartoon that many Americans first saw, predating Gobots and Transformers by a couple of years. Volume 2 of the manga-style book collects issues #1 - 5 of the standard comic series into one volume. In the first volume, five pilots had been sent to the planet Arus to find the legendary weapon known as Voltron to use in their war versus the alien Drule Supremacy. When the Supremacy attacks with one of their dreaded Robeasts, the pilots must use the separate Lion robots form Voltron and due battle. When Sven's robot rejects him, Princess Allura takes his place and Voltron wins the day.As volume two opens, the pilots are helping to rebuild Arus which has been devastated several years earlier by Prince Lotor, son of King Zarkon, Ruler of the 9th kingdom of the Supremacy. They want to rebuild Arus' defenses and learn more about Voltron. But others have designs on the giant robots. Troops from Earth's Galactic Union come to Arus and seize the Voltron lions to return them to Earth for study where scientists hope to duplicate the technology and build their own robots to battle the Drule. Allura contends that Voltron belongs to Arus and she, and the four pilots led by Keith journey to earth and undertake a daring plot to steal Voltron and return to Arus, defying orders in the process. They are shocked to learn that already the scientists have been able to replicate much of the technology and built their own robot. Meanwhile, we find that there is another, insidious reason that Voltron was returned to Earth as a plot is revealed about a high-placed officer conspiring with the evil Drule Supremacy to steal the technology. The pilots must now battle guards, and the rival robot to make their escape off Earth and return Voltron home. Meanwhile, Prince Lotor and his Robeasts are waiting for their chance to attack.Manga is so huge these days and there is such a tremendous and eclectic amount of material out there it's difficult to choose a title sometimes. But with Voltron, you get a character that has been around for 25 years and has a well-known history and following. Marvel did a short run of Voltron back in the mid 1980's but Devil's Due has brought Voltron back to a place of prominence among the most well-known Japanese creations. Paradise Lost was briskly paced, exciting, and layered with many sub-plots that make you want to see much more. The art by E.J. Su, Clint Hilinski, and Clayton Brown was first-rate. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Voltron Volume 2: Paradise Lost (Voltron: Defender of the Universe)","review":"no good, its all in black and white.

It's often very hard to find good a Scots Dictionary or a Good Gaelic Dictionary. This one is VERY good. 820 pages worth, not a little pocket size. It has meanings, spelling variants, pronunciation guide, information on when and were words are used denoting area and districts, grammatical information, and idioms & phrases. What I like best about it - entomologies of the words. So many dictionaries leave off the origins of words, which is so very important when writing history and historical fiction.It's painstakingly edited and without flaws from start to finish.

With a little tutoring from an experienced and successful science fiction Author this young man could go on to write extraordinary masterpieces of fiction. The rawly talented way he speeds you through a story packed with creatures and planets is astounding. The emotion of the characters literally jumps off the page at you. However, errors in the print and editing take away from a cleverly written play/story-style that Gill-Branion has ear-marked as his own."},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"Gill-Branion places women on the Front and in Leadership positions in this sci-fi thriller. He makes it seem logical for us to be there and we are strong, we are invincible, we are humanity's last HOPE. Hurray! The story is great and people who have preconceptions and prejudices may find it difficult to read. Take your time because an abundance of information is thrown at you in a short period of time with a wild pace. The Amanda &amp; Tiffany sex scene is to die for!-Raven"},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"Gill-Branion uses an unorthodox writing style to tell a fantastic story. His approach of having the main character Tiffany tell the story through flashbacks from other characters past perspectives is sort of hard to follow, but by the middle of the story it all starts to make sense. I believe there are many other ways to relay this type of story to the reader. Perhaps Gill-Branion should've considered some of them.The way the story is written makes it uncanny &amp; original. No one else could've thought of this stuff. I found several typO's. I guess what stays in my mind the most is the fact that you have to look past the way it's written in order to see the story. The plot, which is the heart of the story, is brilliant once you get there."},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"GillBranion understands what women want out of life and that's why it's so enjoyable to read this boundary breaking story. We want to be understood and we want to share life not go around causing wars or starting chaos because of a macho stigma placed upon every male.I believe that in order for the Earth to be a better place it will take the women of the planet to unite and bring Utopia to a world filled with discord. I think \\"Paradox\\" isn't far off the mark when it implies it will take the Mothers and the children of the future to save Humanity.I've read the reviews about this book and it seems that the Male Reviewers always have something negative to say about it and that's a shame when you consider that this story represents a strong female perspective of our speculative future.I think this illustrates how far apart the human sexes (Men and Women) have grown. I don't usually read science fiction but, liked the story because it was one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. I hope this story becomes famous enough to be made into a movie someday."},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"I'm a creative writer who's been working on a story for years. I'm trying to make sure what I write is profound, well researched and original. I was told to purchase this story because of some of the new ideas the Author establishes.The rule of thumb is &quot;One can not copyright an idea&quot;. This is wonderful for those who seek something different and want to call it their own. It absolutely stinks for those who came up with the idea inthe first place.After reading the story I dug out an old vhs tape where I recorded the 100th episode of Star Trek Voyager. Then I checked the date and I watched the episode again. Ironically the episode was named PARADOX and there were some similar themes in the episode also found in the story. Slipstreams, Ships Crashing, Prisms vs. Crystals oh my! Too much of a coincidence!I quickly thumbed to the front of the story Paradox by Michael A. Gill-Branion and I see that he has 2 copyrights. One in 1997 and the other in 2001. He says he wrote the story in 1996, which would make sense because it takes some time to get a copyright certificate. I recorded the Star Trek Voyager episode in 1998. There are other instances where you can find some of this story in other stories. Like the part in the movie Matrix where the bad guy claims humanity is a virus. The whole premise of the Paradox story is based on this fact. The movie was released well after Gill-Branion wrote this story.I know that it is possible for 2 different people to have the same idea, but in this case both individuals would have to be in the same room. This Author is very original and may be way ahead of his time or he was there when the Star Trek Voyager episode and the Matrix were being filmed.I just want to know was Paradox the book 1st or 2nd?"},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"Splendid! Unlike Lucas, Gill-Branion is able to keep one enthralled the whole trip across the Galaxy and his characters aren't weak and innocent trying to develop strength and courage along the way.

I highly recommend this book; NOTE - the style is a bit unusual, but give it a chance, once you immerse yourself in the book it really grows on you, and lends a sense of urgency and purpose to the story. I look forward to the next book by this promising young author!"},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"If the purpose of Art is to examine the human condition, then \`Paradox' accomplishes the goal with flying colors. Though only 120 pages (with a few too many typos), this novella is surprisingly dense in the number of isses the author deftly handles. Ranging from themes of gender roles/expectations to faith/religion to personal/societal responsibility, this text makes the reader think. Perhaps that is the ultimate testament of any creative work.As a male reader, it was fascinating to take a step back and realize the harm of a testosterone-soaked social structure. Would we be better off in the wings of a female-driven structure? Gill-Branion doesn't force an answer, but allows the reader to formulate his/her own opinion. How do we accept personal responsibility for the sum total of human actions throughout history? Again, the reader is allowed the breadth to come to a personal decision. Are we cloaked in the protection of (a) God(s)? These are all issues brought to the forefront of this book.To be honest, I am not a particularly avid fan of the science-fiction/fantasy genre. I don't even know if this could be classified as such, but the alien life forms are surprisingly realistic and add to the validity of the tale. The cinematic pacing and structure of the story adds a wholly unique dimension, and almost creates a genre unto itself. It's as if the reader and author are exploring new ground together. Even after a second and third reading, I keep picking up strands that I had missed the previous time around. In that way, it's a story that grows each time--a very unique talent, indeed.Hopefully a cinematic rendering will be adapted one day, allowing for a new medium for this story to weave its magic. And, a word to the wise, if you are offended by risque or explicit scenes, then this novella may not be for you. But if you are willing to open your mind and question the universe around you, then delve into this story as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"This writer is a personal friend of mine, so when he told me his book was finished i could not wait to read it. Suffice it to say i have not been disappointed so far- i am only on the first chapter and i usually know by then if a book is worth my time.This is worth it, the characters are well developed, the storyline is impressive and the books premise is quite astounding. Finally this book gives the genre of science fiction a much needed boost. Well Done!"},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"It's very different and refreshingly so! It reads as a book or play, but I wonder how difficult it would be to try and perform onstage. It has it all; steamy sex scenes, gender preference/difference, Politics vs. Ethics, The Blame Game, Right vs. Wrong, Good vs. Evil...etc.Aliens respectfully sentient, Humanity guilty of ignorance, Starships and Sunskip, oh my! It's enjoyable and I became especially fond of Tiffany in the story. Women will love the ending."},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"You will not be judged individually, Humanity will be judged as a whole! A premise many religious fanatics will not agree with.

At first, I told myself, what the hell am I reading as I started to get lost after Tiffany's initial conversation to Adam & Eve.Soon, it all starts to make sense and it really doesn't matter who's talking because the issues raised are so compelling and the results so foretelling of Humanity's future.I discovered the book at the DreamWorks SKG Fansite... So, look for this one at a theater near you soon.The book is cheaper if you buy it as an Rocket E-book. Plus, you can digitally get the cover that way, and use it for wallpaper or a screen saver. I imagine this extremely original raw work will soon be taken off the market and re-released before a movie is done."},{"Title":"Paradox","review":"It takes guts to write a sci-fi book with the sole purpose of turning it into a movie. Obviously, this is what GillBranion has done and you can tell because it's written as a screenplay when the characters in the story talk.

Every character part would be important (would actually mean something) and you would have a lot of lines. :-)I live in Hollywood and this unusual little book is becoming an underground cult classic among my clan of unemployed actors.It's not cheap, but interesting.

Having never been abroad before, I had a lot to learn and didn't even know it. I'm going to have to get a copy of this book for myself, especially for the checklists of &quot;Basic Wardrobe Options for Women,&quot; ditto for men, and what to put into a first aid kit, laundry kit, sewing kit, toiletries kit, etc. I read the sections on packing for cruises, mountain trips, hot and cold weather, and adventure trips even though I wasn't going to use them for this vacation, just because they were interesting and I kept picking up the stray tip. (Thank goodness I don't have to use their advice on traveling with children!)The sections on what to wear on the plane, what to pack in one's carry-on (as well as reminders of what NOT to pack), food for the journey, and how to pack luggage that will be checked in were extremely useful. Who would have thought to pack clothes in those plastic bags from dry cleaners to keep items from wrinkling?? I'm trying it and will let you know how it works out. They also talk about the different philosophies of packing -- the &quot;roll&quot; style that is especially good for duffel bags, vs. the &quot;interlock&quot; style where you stack layers and then fold them all together to decrease wrinkling.On the down side, the book seemed padded and too chatty, when, being the procrastinator that I am, I needed to get the information right away. But I was able to find it, and someone could just use the many helpful checklists and be way ahead of the game, as I was. And there were things I never thought about, such as compiling a &quot;personal documents&quot; file to put in my carry-on, with a copy of my passport and driver's license and a photo of my luggage in case it got lost.Altogether I found this a must-read for either the procrastinator or the unseasoned traveler such as yours truly.

Reading through this on a plane ride I felt agreeably overwhelmed by all of the advice.However, this book was last published in 2003 and badly needs an update--a noticeable amount of information concerning carry-on rules and airline policies is no longer correct. For example, you can't buy water in advance or fill water bottles at home and expect to carry liquids on board, because of the \\"three-ounce\\" rule. Nor should you lock your checked baggage, likewise for security reasons. I caught other instances of advice that is currently invalid, though rules could very well change again in the future.

This work of art has many unique features. Though the story is short and the synopsis sounds child-like, the layers of meaning are clearly meant for more comprehensive readers. The vocabulary displayed also betrays the mature audience the book was written for. The end struck me as particularly profound. It is the sort of literature that leaves you numb in your chair after finishing. Thinking about it for hours without tire has led me to the conclusion that this book that appears to be for a mere child is truly magnificent, and meant for all. I would recommend that children, if you read it, pick it up again when you have grown older. You will uncover more treasures with each pasing year. ( I persinally am only thirteen, but I have read numerous amounts of literature and ahve considered myslef to be a valid critic of age level and such."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Don't be fooled by the simple appearance of this book; there is some really deep material between the covers. I've pondered whether to call this book a fable or a parable. Ultimately, I've decided it's some form of both. As the Little Prince travels through the universe he meets many different people (and animals) that teach him great lessons about life.The story begins with the Little Prince leaving his small planet because he is not happy. As he travels the universe he stops on other planets and talks to the inhabitants. Most of the people that he meets on these planets are adults and represent the worst of human behavior and foolishness. My favorites are the Vain Man who \\"cannot hear anything but praise\\" and the drunkard that drinks because he feels guilty about drinking. While these characters are not meant to be likeable, they represent many of the problems that we face in society (i.e. the need for applause and constant praise and the drunkard's guilt cycle).Eventually the Little Prince makes his way to earth, which is where he meets the narrator of the story--a pilot who has become stranded in the middle of the Sahara Desert because his plane crashed. Before meeting the pilot, the Little Prince meets a snake and a fox. The Prince's time with the fox turns out to be a life changing moment. Through his interactions with the fox he learns a great secret: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" With this knowledge the Prince realizes that his life is special and he decides to make the hard journey back to his small planet and the precious flower that lives there.I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this book. As a small child I remember watching the cartoon adaptation of Nickelodeon. Of course, I didn't realize there was a book at that time. In high school we had to read this book in our French class. That was the first time I read it, and I instantly fell in love. As an adult it has an even deeper hold on me. The author of the book wrote this story after his town in France had been overrun by the Nazis during World War 2. Knowing that information gives this book an even deeper illumination of the human spirit--both good and bad. The content is both deep and moving, while funny and simple at the same time. You can find humor in the generalizations about adults and children, and I'm sure we can all see a little of ourselves in some of the characters. As a whole, the story is beautifully written and immensely thought provoking. You cannot read this book and not ponder life's greatest questions. It's impossible.If you have not read this charming children's book, you are missing one of the greatest stories ever written! It's a quick and easy read, but it will linger in your thoughts well after you have finished reading."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"this book is a wonderful experience for everyone who allows him or herself the find the deeper meaning in it . this book is an amazing work writen from the veiw of a child . every time i read the book i get something new out of it . this book is not just about a boy its a philosophy on life ."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"Excellent book.

I bought a copy of this translation, but was so disappointed by the translation that I gave it away soon after. Allie Jones's example for the translation of \\"L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux\\" is exactly what I was thinking of; and as perhaps the most important lessons / most quoted lines from the book, it qualifies as a touchstone to the quality of translation. And yes, this one line alone shows the superiority of Katherine Woods's.Somewhere in the foreword I remember the translator (or is that a reviewer?) claiming the need for a new translation to keep up with the time -- WRONG. Katherine Woods's work is so beautiful that upon reading and re-reading, I have never found anything that needs to be updated for the modern reader. The definition of good English has not changed so in the past 60 years.So really, get the Katherine Woods translation. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"Pedants may find the book scientifically ridiculous; serious readers will find it erudite. Cynics may find its precepts hackneyed; fans will find them transcendental and relevant. By interweaving the ludicrous with the sagacious, the old-fashioned with the ethereal, this book accentuates life's ironies and irrationality in a fresh, poignant way. The Little Prince may also have played a very shabby trick on its critics. He has, after all, suggested that we live among grown-ups and people who do not see with the heart, and that \`we' should show great forbearance towards them. This, is his distinction.The Little Prince nourishes the mind; refreshes the soul; and, yet, wrings and wrenches the heart.

The Little Prince heals with beauty and love."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"This is just a note to say beware of the new translation if you've previously read and enjoyed the Katherine Woods version. Mr. Howard makes the argument in his \\"translator's note\\" that the language has changed since the 1940's and that a new translation is needed. I couldn't disagree more. And I [do] speak with some experience on this subject: I read this title at school in the original French language for three different classes, as well as numerous times in English (the Woods version). Katherine Woods beautifully captured the feel of the French original. The new, Howard translation is in a more modern English which mostly succeeds at removing the poetry that previously existed and little else that I can find. It does not make the story any more clear or nuanced than it previously was, rather less so. I find the arguments for a new translation indefencible.Three stars is not a review of the book, but of the translation. This title is beyond excellent, but you might do yourself a favor and find a used copy with the Woods translation (there are many copies out there). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"NOTE: The \\"blue\\" cover is from the Howard \\"new\\" translation, the \\"white\\" is the Woods so beware. Katherine Woods' simple and beautiful translation is the only one that does justice to The Little Prince. Published by Harcourt in 1943 and 1971, her translation is the essential --- the translation loved and quoted by English-speaking people around the world, even by members of (need I say it) English- and French-speaking Canadian Parliament! But hers is OUT OF PRINT exepct in the UK (http://www.amazon.co.uk), so snatch up used copies while you may or do some Amazon.co.uk shopping!WARNING: there is a \\"new translation\\" out by Richard Howard, and I accidentally got one. Ouch! His \\"New\\" translation purges meaning, and is not worth the money. It gives a falseness to one of the most sincere stories ever written.Howard's lacks beauty, and is at times unintelligible: It simply does not make sense. Since Howard has no apparent understanding of the truths expressed in The Little Prince, it is not to be wondered at. One important example says it all: The fox's \\"secret\\" told to the little prince in parting ---Wood's translation reads: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" She uses the beautiful rhetorical mode: \\"What is essential...\\" Compare, if you know French, Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry's original French text: \\"...on ne voit bien qu'avec le caeur. L'essentiel est invsible pour les yeux.\\" \\"L'essentiel\\" is in the same mode as is \\"Les Mis&eacute;rables\\" -- neither translate exactly into English. \\"Les Mis&eacute;rables\\" may be translated as \\"The Miserable Ones,\\" with less poetic effect. Likewise, \\"L'essentiel\\" might be rendered literally \\"The essential things\\" or put in the rhetorical form \\"What is essential...\\"If Richard Howard wanted to make the statement \\"clearer\\" it would have to read: \\"That which is essential is invisible to the eye\\" --- wordy, and prosy, but it keeps the meaning. But Howard doesn't do that; his \\"new\\" translation of the same line read: \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" Huh? \\"Anything essential is invisible to the eyes\\"? Far from expressing Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry's meaning, this generalization means, in effect, nothing. And it is obviously not true: Water is essential, and you can see it.Katherine Woods' exquisite translation captures the essence of this line for the English reader. \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" Quintessential, no line in the book is more important. It epitomizes her entire translation. It is ironic that, in translating The Little Prince, Howard should lose \\"that which is essential,\\" and that he should be unable to \\"see with his heart.\\" You can tell the difference between the two by the covers. Woods' shows the little prince on a white background; Howard's is on midnight blue. But check the ISBNs!Amazon.com's Editorial Review on Howard's translation says that \\"Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect.\\" This would have been better written thus:\\"Katherine Woods uses poetic devices and a didactic accent to wonderful effect, capturing the essence and meaning of Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry's classic in a timeless translation. Unhappily and unfortunately, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified in a words-only translation, and he wanders off the mark, obscuring what were otherwise truths both simple and profound, giving the text a slightly wooden effect.\\"To get the Katherine Woods' translation, make sure her name is listed as translator! are buying hers. As for Howard's translation, \\"NEW\\" is not better; it's just \\"new.\\" Woods' translation is the one I read, and helped me to understand why I grieved so when my great grandmother died. We'd spent so much time with her. And, as the fox says to the little prince in explaining why HIS rose is so important to him, \\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\" It also helps me keep in mind what I'm doing with my time, and why. If I watch T.V. the most, then T.V. becomes the most important. If I pass time with my family, they become the most important.Another always-to-be-remembered example of a passage from Woods' translation dealing with the interaction of the little prince and the fox. When the little prince has to say goodbye to the fox, the fox says, \\"Ah, I shall cry.\\"\\"It's your own fault,\\" said the little prince. \\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...\\"\\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.\\"But now you are going to cry!\\" said the little prince.\\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.\\"Then it has done you no good at all!\\"\\"It has done me good,\\" said the fox, \\"because of the color of the wheat fields.\\"Before the little prince tamed the fox, the wheat field had \\"nothing to say to\\" the fox. \\"But,\\" he had said to the little prince, \\"you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...\\"I used to dislike giant sunflowers. Then I discovered that someone I love like them very much. So we planted some and cared for them together. Now, when I see giant sunflowers, I remember him and my heart is happy. I understand. Because I read, and re-read, Wood's translation of The Little Prince since I was a child. It is as beautiful today as it was 40 years ago.--------------SOURCES:Katherine Woods' superior translation: NY: Harvest/HBJ Book, Harcourt, 1971, pp. 83, 86, 87.

The version I bought doesn't say who did the translation. I was printed in India in 2007. It doesn't have the same quality illustrations and the translation lacks some of the emotional power of the Woods interpretation of the book. I recommend you find the version that has Katharine Woods name on the cover. The new book is cheaper but it is NOT as good as her version. Eventually I paid three times as much for a used copy of her translation but I think it was worth it. Yes it is that much better."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"This book comes in two guises. It is a wonderful tale that children will love, just like I did when I read it for the first time at the age of 6. But it is also an enchanting view of our world and life that you best appreciate when you are an adult. This little book is worth thick volumes of learned philosophy. It offers a glimpse into the heart of its author, a man who could still see the world with star-filled eyes of a growing child. No matter how old you are, read this book; it will stay with you for the rest of your life.Only later I learned that the book was written in the middle of the most horrible war the world has known. A year after the book was published, its author was shot down in action over Mediterranean, fighting for the freedom of his country. He left behind a great gift for the whole mankind."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"I've Grown up reading this story. It runs in our family and I buy copies for friends as presents. It looks like a fairy tale with it's very simple picture book style but in fact it is a story and poetic prose of the deep philosophy. While not heavy handed so it remains fresh and the prince loveable. I think it should be in every library. I myself often refer bact to it to remind myself not to take myself too seriously but to take responciablty and to look at things from all angles."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"This is, almost without a doubt, one of the finest books I have ever read. I am an avid reader, I eat through a lot of poetry and big thick novels as well as \\"children's\\" stories like this one, comic books, etc. There is something to be said for the brevity of this book. There are thousands of other books that punch around in the dark for hundreds of pages, never equaling the sheer mass and grandure of this bold-fonted, tactfully-illustrated novella. It clocks in at just over 90 pages, and manages to sum of some of the most important life wisdom that has ever been put into print. Exupery's other efforts fall dramatically short of this work, but one can hardly let that disassemble his status as a man of not only literary, but of honest human brilliance. For me, this book is what it is to be a man; to be a person. I don't have any real heros from a perspective beyond reverence for artistic skill in the art & letters world, except perhaps The Little Prince.I remember my 6th grade teacher calling me stupid for reading this book in class. That it was a children's book, and what happened to me reading all those NOVELS I was reading before. I don't expect everyone to understand this book. I think it is truly an individual experience, and as a result, some will find it uncomfortable. Still I urge anyone to read this book, of really any age. I urge you to read it five years later. And again, and again. You will watch yourself grow.This is probably the most stunningly beautiful thing I have ever read. Its beauty is immense and often overpowering. It's like standing at the foot of the reddest sunset, a giant glowing ball towering thousands of feet above you as you crane your neck to see how far it goes. Yes, despite how much I hate a metaphor involving a sunset, it's that good.I've read the new translation, and it's lacking. It's been dumbed-down. My personal copy is from Harcourt Brace & Company, copywrite 1943 and again in 1971. This, trust me, is the one you want. It will most likely be in hardcover, with a library binding, possibly. It is available used, and will cost you half of what the new and inferior paperback will. Trust me, it IS an important destinction. Otherwise I wouldn't mention it.Anyway, thanks for reading. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"On the surface, this book, The Little Prince, may simply be thought of as just another children's book. However, if one allows himself or herself to, it is a book that trancends the age of the reader. It is a book for everyone, except for those who will not allow themselves to be &quot;tamed&quot;. As one who first read it as a sophomore in high school in my French class, and now, twelve years later, I try to read it at least once a month, while discovering something new every time I do. On a side note, there is a Little Prince (Le Petit Prince) watch available be warned, however, that there are two thousand of these made worldwide (in two styles...with a red band and a blue one).

The Little Prince is comfortable to read without taking your imagination or your analytical reasoning. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Little Prince","review":"Without doubt this is (for me) the most beautiful, and perhaps the saddest book ever written.

Whilst the opportunities to visit any warplane underwater are extreme rare, I have visited hundreds of ships which met their fate at the hands of such aircraft and this book has yet to let me down as I search for the detailed knowledge I seek to complete the entire story of each such shipwreck.Just as there are different makes, models and special editions with the motor cars of yesterday and today, so there were many variants of the different aircraft - not only because those aircraft evolved as they were improved, but also because some were converted to undertake a more specialist role. For example, there are over 9 pages devoted to just the Heinkel HE111 and all it's variants so, it does seem reasonable to assume all that modifications for the many other aircraft are also all there.As one might expect, the bulk of the book is taken up with Fixed Wing Aircraft (as was the bulk of the German Luftwaffe) after which are sections on Rotary Wing Aircraft (helicopters), Fixed Wing Aircraft Projects and Missiles.

The last decade has seen a greater appreciation of this hard-to-categorize set thanks to excellent theatrical performances and more scholarly attention. Dr. Nutt's &quot;Introduction&quot; is an enjoyable, stimulating contribution to the latter category, although it is not intended to be a stand-alone introduction for a first-time viewer/reader of these plays.Taking these plays as a group is a very effective way to appreciate the artistic, humanistic, and spiritual directions that Shakespeare took in the last third of his playwriting career. The plays are comedies only in the sense of superficial distinction of &quot;tragedies end in death; comedies end in marriage.&quot; In a Shakespeare Romance we are treated to stories noble characters struggling with tragic flaws, often in medieval settings with mythological processes of grace and redemption helping them through heart-wrenching failure and loss, along a path of determined courage in the face of life-threatening challenges or paralyzing emotional pain, and finally to a point of reunion and reclamation. Only in providing at least one marriage at the close of the play are these comedies; the humor is usually provided by clowns and rogues as in the sub-plots of the Tragedies.The fanciful as well as tragi-comic story lines are often alien to modern readers, and Dr. Nutt's introduction helps us appreciate the grandeur of their artistic achievement and the perspective they offer for a modernity that still reels with emotional disasters that mingle family disruption, intrigue, and international politics.Dr. Nutt's insightful comparative presentation also gives the lie to two misperceiving rejections of Shakespeare: 1) that his works are amoral [usually referring to his great tragedies], and 2) that his &quot;Late Works&quot;'s were of lower quality and probably reflected 'his fatigue with playwriting.' These are extreme dramas where triumphant joys are achieved only after enormous tragedy, with &quot;people enduring shocking extremes of suffering, wrong and ill fortune yet responding with courage, patience, fidelity, determination and constancy.&quot; As Dr. Nutt says, one of the most distinguishing features in these creations is that they &quot;appear determined to exhibit humanity at it most admirable.&quot;If you appreciate Shakespeare, drama, or questions of human struggle, the little volume is to be enjoyed and pleasurably digested. One final easy shot is due the publisher: yes, you have produced a fine work in an appropriately high-quality paperback edition; your list price, however, will assure poor sales in both the general and student populations. What a shame. Fortunately, this online service offers used sales to the reader's rescue.

Sixty percent of American parents&#8217; marriages end indivorce today, subjecting kids to unbelievable conflicts. American adults and parents are,by far, the most violent, drug-abusing, criminally arrested, imprisoned, obese, andunstable of any Western nation, and all of these adult crises have skyrocketed in the lastfour decades.Today, 20 million teens have been subjected to their parents&#8217; family breakup, 10million young people grow up with parents who are heavy drinkers or dug addicts, morethan 1 million youths suffer parents arrested for felonies every year (several hundredthousand of whose parents are imprisoned), and hundreds of thousands of youths areconfirmed victims of violent and sexual abuses in their homes every year. Compared toparents in other Western countries. Americans are far more likely to use psychiatrists,Ritalin, forced institutionalization, police interventions, harsh restrictions such as curfewsand drug tests, violent punishments, and lengthy imprisonments on children andteens--and we complain we STILL can't control our kids!Strauch&#8217;s book, of course, sticks safely to abstract theories and pleasing anecdotesand touches on none of these disturbing realities. She gushes over pompous claims by afew self-praising bio-researchers that their overblown, post-1996 notions invalidate allthe thousands of practical research studies on adolescents and adults that came before.Unfortunately, neurobiological research is notoriously inconclusive--conscientiousexperts (not numbered among the ones Strauch interviews) readily admit that ourknowledge of how brain organization processes affect real-world behavior is woefullyprimitive.What counts is that decades of practical research tests involving real-life decisionmaking have shown that teenagers and adults think very much alike. In fact, teenage ratesof violent crime, homicide, suicide, unplanned pregnancy, HIV infection, heavy drinking,drunken driving accidents, smoking, obesity, and so forth, closely follow thecorresponding rates among adults of their families and communities--a fact that isimpossible to explain if teenage and adult brains are fundamentally different.The reason Strauch&#8217;s book has no &#8220;practical advice&#8221; for parents is because thisbook has no relevance to practical, real-life situations beyond the self-serving anecdotesshe chooses.

Between these two admonitions, Barbara Strauch vividly relates how old ideas of brain development have been overthrown by recent research. Her judgement of \\"recent\\" is expressed with the dismissive comment that any source found prior to 1996 was \\"too old\\". She thus adds another brick to the edifice being constructed in cognitive sciences. The studies have gone beyond research in human cognitive studies to include other primates - chimpanzees and monkeys in demonstrating the roots of human behaviour. These findings are providing a wealth of new insights into our evolutionary roots. Strauch has contributed much in our knowledge of who we are in the animal kingdom. Although the studies are new, and further research is necessary, Strauch explains the patterns that are emerging. Further work can only provide more enlightenment.Although her research covers many fields and countless workers, the key source is Jay Giedd. Giedd was prompted by data showing how adolescent brains exhibited unexpected changes. \\"Gray matter\\", that term we so often blithely use to indicate the brain and mind, was expanding in teens. It actually grows beyond that of the average adult, then \\"dramatically thinning down\\" some time later. This find suggested many changes are occurring in teen brains - making them, in Strauch's estimate, \\"a bit crazy . . . but crazy by design\\". She reminds us throughout the book that while teenagers may appear physically mature in stature, what is going on in their brains is unfinished. They may look like us, but their behaviour is generally radically different. Incomplete brain development is the root cause of these departures from what we consider \\"normal\\". It was Giedd's research that sought to provide a baseline of what is \\"normal\\" for our children in those tumultuous years.With the wide-ranging sources she uses, Strauch takes us through all the problems parents face in trying to comprehend the vagaries of teen behaviour. Sex, bizarre sleeping patterns, drugs and alcohol use by teens all have come under new scrutiny by various research teams. They stress the vulnerability of the teen brain to nicotine, alcohol and other toxins. While this may seem obvious, the mechanics of why teens engage in heavy drinking bouts, for example, show how important parental knowledge of the background and impact of these events can be to teen health. Parents shouldn't dismiss such behaviour as \\"something they'll grow out of\\" since damage to brain structure can be permanent. Although the evolutionary roots are becoming clear, parental concern remains a major factor in assuring teens don't stumble into damaging behaviour.As one of the first \\"popular\\" books in this emerging field, Strauch's sources are almost entirely academic journals. We rely on her reputation as a New York Times health section columnist to have \\"done her homework\\" and there's little doubt she's done so. However, her own role as a mother of teens provides additional enhancement to her reliability. If she has an axe to grind, it is purely one of informing us on topics of concern to us as parents. While this book may be a \\"first\\" and may be modified by later studies, the information presented is far too important to ignore. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"The strength of the book is in its message: teenager's brain undergoes a tremendous change, and realizing this would greatly help parents, teachers and others dealing with teens. The book's weakness is in the details: the science is muddled and the narrative often confused, leaving many of the open questions on the table.The book's central point is that during teen years kids develop the part of the brain, prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for putting the brake mechanism in their decision making system. Without this part well developed, kids seem to have no way of restraining and analyzing their free-ranging emotions. Hence attitude problems, blow-ups and other unfortunate trademarks of the age.This process of brain development helps better understand the behavioral peculiarities of teens (aloofness, thrill seeking, even drinking and smoking). The prefrontal cortex, which is under construction throughout the teen years, requires large amounts of dopamine, the neurotransmitter instrumental in our feeling of wellbeing. Because of this, during these years there is much less dopamine in other parts of the brain. So, to feel good teenagers need to bombard their brain with much stronger stimuli. Hence drugs, alcohol etc. Immediately, though, Strauch contradicts herself: she claims that teenagers are awash in dopamine, the \\"reds are redder\\" for them, they see the world in much accentuated colors. On top of that, estrogen, the hormone produced in women, and to a lesser extent in men, revs up dopamine as well. The author never comes to a conclusion on whether teenagers have dopamine in excess or lack it. For practical purposes, if much of teenage brain is lacking in dopamine and they are naturally looking for stimuli we should provide them with the ways to take safe risks (if they take a rock climbing class they may not want to drag race that car). If, instead, teenagers were swimming in dopamine, this strategy wouldn't be as insightful.Smoking girls are found to loose 10% of their memory aptitude. But on the same page (186) nicotine is claimed to improve memory and learning. The score is never tallied: does nicotine enhance or inhibit brain functionality?The gender differences are jumbled as well. The author reassures that women's brains, although smaller than men's, run \\"hotter\\". So the size does matter? No supporting evidence is offered. Estrogen, responsible for increase in dopamine, is much more abundant in woman's brain than in man's. But whether it contributes to age-specific differences between genders during teen years is never explored.The book mentions, importantly, that good family relationships would outweigh the chemical and neurological imbalance of teenager's brain. This surprising fact should have been given much more attention in the book, since it may reinforce an action plan for a family of a teenager.A good practical point is \\"ask for one thing at a time\\", since teenagers often seem incapable of keeping track of more than one task.On balance, the heart of the book is in the right place, its mind - not quite. The main message - pay attention to this kid's brain development, you will understand much more of her - is fully deserving. The book's topic is important, and more coherent popular literature on it is needed. I hope that someone would pick up the slack."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"I don't have children, but I do have an interest in mind and the brain, so when an on-line friend, Steven Haines, recommended it I decided to read The Primal Teen. As catchy as the title may sound, the book is actually quite serious about the subject of the developing teenage brain. Although the author is not herself a neurologist or neuroscientist, she is a skillful journalist (New York Times and Newsday). The topic is well researched with primary sources taken from prestigious professional journals like Nature Neuroscience, Brain Research, Journal of Comparative Neurology, Cerebral Cortex, Annals of Neurology, etc. While some of those articles cited are late 1980s, most are 1997 to 2002 (the book was published in 2003). Ms Strauch also interviewed some of the researchers personally for their input on what the scientific data are likely to mean and how it impacts teens and their families. Topics covered are: where the new data are coming from; teens and impulsive behavior; the whens, wheres, and whys of changes in the structure of the brain; what animal studies have to say about development of the brain in adolescents; why teens take risks; why teens seem to keep late hours and sleep late in the day; the chemistry of the brain and puberty; and the effects of drugs, tobacco and alcohol on growing brains.I was a little frustrated with the lack of actual suggestions for parents on how to cope with their changing teen. To some extent the anecdotal stories of some of the researchers who had teenaged children and those from the author herself provided insight into possible approaches, but on the whole very little by the way of helpful problem solving was offered. This may well be because too little has yet been done to make definite statements. The book at least helps a parent understand that their teenagers are &quot;normal&quot; despite the apparent erratic behavior they exhibit, that patience is the most likely route to a successful rite of passage, and most importantly that &quot;this too will pass.&quot;An interesting and reassuring book."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"Why do teen-aqers shoplift, vandalize, argue illogically, indulge in high-risk activities, pierce their bodies, and exude obnoxious behavior (feel free to add items to this list)?MRI studies of brain component size and activity document that adolescents' brains are unfinished, are chock full of neurological and hormonal changes, and work differently than the brains of adults.In 1997, neuroscience made a surprising discovery. In early adolescence, the brain's gray matter - its outer layer - thickens, then dramatically thins out. In brain thickening, tiny branches of cells bloom madly, a process called \\"exuberance.\\" This is followed by \\"pruning.\\" As adolescence progresses, \\"there is an enormous loss of gray matter...a wholesale slashing of cell branches & synapses...a massive synaptic re-organization.\\" This is very much like what happens at birth through late childhood, but scientist didn't realize that it happens again in adolescence.\\"The frontal lobes, the very area that helps teen-agers make the right decisions, are the very last areas to reach stability...When shown fear producing images, teen-age brains 'lit up' in the amygdala, a key area for instinctual reactions such as fight or flight, anger, or 'I hate you, Mom.' When adults were shown the same stimulus, they 'lit up' in the frontal lobes...What can we expect if that inhibition machinery, the pre-frontal cortex, is not yet fully formed?\\"This book tells us to maintain vigilance, appropriate consequences for behavior, and some influence over that all-important peer group.

What she showed, in essence, is that groups of people that show different behavioural responses show different brain activity. This is exactly what we should expect.These studies, which are based entirely on a US population, completely ignore all the cultures around the world and throughout history who's teenagers are considered adults, treated as such, and behave exactly like adults. For the argument that teenage brains are underdeveloped &lt;I&gt;biologically&lt;/I&gt; you would have to see the same trends in every human culture, and we simply don't.Worse, claiming that anti-social behaviour is cause by biological facters gives license to teens to not take responsibility for their own actions, and really belittles them."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"Barbara Strauch has offered us a beautifully written account of her journey to understand the cutting edge of knowledge and modern scientific exploration of the adolescent brain. Through her clear and accessible writing, we are given the chance to hear the voices of scientists focusing their current work on imaging the changes in the teen's brain: insights into changes that help us (as parents, as professionals, as former teens ourselves) to understand the wild and confusing time of adolescent turmoil and transformation. As a parent, I found the book extremely entertaining, illuminating, and reassuring. As a child and adolescent psychiatrist who writes about the brain, the mind, and human relationships, I found the book to be an extremely useful resource for the teens and parents in my practice and seminars. Barbara Strauch has succeeded in helping us to understand our teenagers in a more compassionate light, opening the door to possibilities for improved relationships, and even a deeper understanding of ourselves. A wonderful treat for anyone interested in knowing more about how we transition from childhood to adulthood."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"This is a must read book for all parents! Author Barbara Strauch presents the latest scientific findings regarding the teenage brain in a highly readable, even enjoyable layperson's format. This book gives incredible insight into why our teenagers act and think the way they do. It also allows us a view into the latest medicial thinking--including the vast amounts learned only recently and how much is still to be discovered. I think parents will find this book enormously useful, as well as comforting, in their everyday interactions with their kids. Kudos to author Strauch for bringing us new insights and for dispelling some long held myths."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"I loved this book. The \`Primal Teen' is funny, superbly written, and packed with the latest science of brain development. The author explains how the brain develops in childhood, in the teenage years, and beyond, and how this provides insights into the inner workings of the teenage mind. An award winning science and medical Editor for the New York Times, Barbara Strauch makes the latest scientific findings on the teenage brain come to life. The \`Primal Teen' distils a year long personal enquiry into an action packed journey. Based on insightful interviews of experts in the science of brain development, the author shows how their findings can be relevant and exciting for parents. She brings together a fascinating array of findings, and a good measure of common sense, to help explain why teens are the way they are, and how to better understand the teenage years. The book is extraordinarily well researched; as its chapters unfold, the author beautifully conveys the excitement and bewildering implications of current research on brain development. Recent years have seen a revolution in this field. Biological changes in the teenage brain tie in with the complex behavioral changes as well, and underlie many aspects of cognitive, emotional and social maturation in early and late adolescence. The author combines cameos of the researchers she interviewed with carefully explained summaries of their findings and why they are relevant. As a researcher in the field, I think this book is a treasure; it's very difficult to put down once you start reading it. My wife loved it as well. This book shows how the science of teenage development is surprising, perplexing, and fascinating. The \`Primal Teen' will be an instant classic. It fills a gap that no academic book could fill: it's a whirlwind introduction to what makes teenagers tick."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"This was a good read for parents of teens or pre-adolescents who are not in the medical field or some related field. The author is not a researcher but a journalist putting together what they've learned about the topic. (Some parents may have already done this for themselves.) It's not as detailed as someone well-read on the topic may hope, but for someone just becoming interested, perhaps someone experiencing shocking episodes in their own home with their own primal teen, it's a good starter book! Glad she put it together. Hopefully there's more to come with more neurological detail."},{"Title":"The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us about Our Kids","review":"As parents of teens, we tend to think that--by now--we have pretty much figured out what makes our kids tick...hormones, immaturity, psicological issues...right? Well, maybe that is only part of the picture. This books does a wonderful job of going beyond that, to the neurological foundation of behavior itself. It clearly explains the ramifications of the changes that are going on at a neurological level in the brain of teens and how that, consequently, translates into \\"teen behavior\\".Your kid is not \\"crazy\\"...their frontal cortex just needs more time to develop! A reassuring read for every parent!"},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"While \\"Piece of Work\\" has some entertaining aspects to it, such as its look at the world of celebrity publicity, it strikes me as a draft, not a completed manuscript. I found a surprising number of awkward sentences and passages that didn't make sense. It needs a good edit.It also suffers from a disease many contemporary writers have: the tendency to elaborately over-describe material objects, magazines, food, etc. but gloss over the internal world of the characters themselves.I was particularly struck by the way the mother/Leo relationship was written: the detailed way Zigman described how they touched each other was a little creepy (poor husband Peter got no touching at all!)It was great fun to encounter David Cassidy but the concept that the lead character publicist would melt into a puddle around him--given how ultra-professional she is--didn't fly for me. I also found the constant nursery-rhyme references (particularly about Jack) very tiresome. This is a good airplane book but I wouldn't keep it in my collection."},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"Julie Einstein has enjoyed all the joys of motherhood too briefly. After giving birth to Leo she left her high power public relations job to be a stay-at-home Mom. It's now three years later and, surprise, surprise, she's thoroughly enjoyed it. After all the stress and struggle she's happy to watch daytime TV, accommodate a few more pounds, and watch Leo grow.Unfortunately, this state of maternal and domestic bliss comes to a quick halt when her husband, Peter, is laid off. Time to switch places: she must go back to work and Peter will be a stay-at-home Dad.Julie reluctantly returns to the workaday world with the John Glom Agency, a PR firm whose specialty is in resurrecting careers. She may have seen her share of has-beens and a few never-weres, but no one quite like Mary Ford. Once a queen of the silver screen Mary is now a royal pain. Julie longs to look after her own three-year-old, but she's stuck with childish Mary who pilfers expensive clothing from a photo shoot and has a litany of nigh on impossible demands.Nonetheless, Julie must persevere and this she does by trying a comeback for Mary by launching a signature perfume (think Elizabeth Taylor). One slight problem: perfume is supposed to smell good, this perfume is odoriferous to the nth.Meanwhile, back at the house Peter is running a smooth ship. Sometimes life does throw us a few curves and Zigman charts them with gusto.Stage actress Emily Durante narrates this story impeccably. She has a pleasant voice and clear diction which makes listening a pleasure, whether longing to be at home with Leo or kvetching about the impossible Mary.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"A little too cutesy for me, at times.-Calling the boss \\"Jack DeWack\\".-Calling the child \\"The Scoob\\".

That changes when her spouse Peter loses his job; Julia is forced to find work in her expertise.The John Glom Public Relations form hires Julia. Her client is a desperate has-been like all those who employ John Glom. However, as actress Mary Ford finds her fame rapidly abating to where she is a notch above an obscure trivia question, she correspondently abuses those hired to help her especially her public relations specialist. The PR crowd at John Glom understands that the Mary's of the world pay to bring others down with them especially those they employ. Though she loathes the customer Julia tries finding a solution to turn around Mary's rapidly vanishing name.Though readers know early on how successful Julia will be with Mary, the key to this amusing and acerbic satire is Ford. Whereas the lead focus is Julia as she adjusts to returning to the workplace, she, her spouse, and her PR peers are sympathetic characters. Mary, on the other hand, is a nasty PIECE OF WORK who is at her best is frosty and aloof and at her worst is hostile and cruel; yet beneath her surface repugnance of everyone, vulnerability often surfaces. Thus she keeps the tale from exorbitant sweetening and ultra excessive cuteness, as there is a bit too much of both already. Julia to the rescue is a humorous entertaining tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"Terribly, Terribly, terrible book. The characters are so broadly drawn, it read more like an outline for a book or a manuscript , not a finished piece of work. It touches on so many themes and characters, the diva, the no-so struggling new stay at home dad, the playground mummys who hate, the work frenemies, and follows up on none of them.

It had such a great premise -- a stay-at-home mom is forced to return to her previous profession as a celebrity publicist when her husband loses his job, and she has to deal with the challenges of work re-entry, becoming the sole breadwinner, and babysitting a grumpy has-been.But the story soon peters out. None of the various storylines ever is fully fleshed out. The relationship with her husband -- who is doing a better job of being a stay-at-home mom than she ever did -- suffers little in the way of stress. The guilt she feels as a working mom is glossed over. And the testy has-been actress never gets the dressing-down she so richly deserves.All in all, this was a well-written, though lukewarm, book. I never felt empathy for Julia, instead I wanted to give her a swift kick for being such a doormat."},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"This is a story about a woman who \\"must\\" return to work while leaving her husband to care for the baby and home.

Julia's husband, a management consultant, with a flair for organizaing, turns out to be the uber Martha Stewart, helping playgroup moms navigate the Container Store, and baking a gingerbread castle to rival all others.

The cover art would have generated a pass-over in addition to one of the selling points is that it is \`hilarious.' I don't have a sense of humor and haven gotten \`hilarious' since James Herriott. All that aside, Laura Zigman's new novel Piece of Work is a well-written novel that makes for easy and light reading.Julia Einstein left the high-stress world of celebrity PR in Manhattan after a three-month maternity leave resulted in her falling irrevocably in love with her son, Leo. It's three years later and while the Einsteins have moved to the \`burbs, Julia still isn't a fabulous housekeeper or cook. She is a devoted mother who adores her son and answers his every demand.Then her organizational-expert husband gets fired. It's never clear why, but Peter is the only casualty in the corporate re-organization. As the months roll by and Peter has little interest in finding a new job, Julia realizes she must go back to work. Forget the fact that she can no longer fit into those size 6 tailored suits she has in the back closet, she's been out of the loop for too long so she winds up at the John Glom Public Relations, a firm for celebrity has-beens.Julia is given the assignment, \\"The Return of a Legend,\\" where she is to promote a new fragrance, Legend, and then create the comeback of a long-forgotten movie star, Mary Ford. It sounds easy until Julia learns that none of the top-tier department stores will carry the fragrance; the manufacturer cut corners on the production, and Legend truly stinks; her boss has leaked bad press (like telling PETA that the manufacturer uses animals for testing), and everyone is trying to get as far as possible from the mere association of Legend and Mary Ford. Then there is Mary, a total witch who has a little larceny in her, like not returning clothes on loan for a photo shoot.Julia manages to learn the art of home, family, and kids. It's helpful that Peter has become the best stay-at-home dad ever. Piece of Work did elicit a chuckle or two from me, an old PR hound.

So maybe that isn't the way we think of most husband but my girlfriend has one she says is a better wife than she will ever be! So it CAN happen! I enjoyed this, it was a quick easy read.

Sadly, halfway through, I totally changed my mind and found the book tedious to read. The story starts out with tension and drama as a father and breadwinner loses his job and, four months later, the mother is forced to re-start her career as a celebrity publicist. The grand parents have great roles and the father as a failed job hunter is very sympathetic. Mom turns into a hero as she starts to earn the family income. During work she jots humorous notes about her much loathed new boss and the clients she is meeting with. Then comes Mary Ford, a has been Faye Dunnaway type star whose light burned out long ago, trying to launch her career and a new perfume. Mary turns out to be a handful and needs as much attention as Mom's four year old son. The first publicity tour is a disaster and Mom wants to quit. In the background the failed father is now turning into Mister Mom of the first rate. Up to here the plot is interesting but it seems that the author just quit on the story and went to the \\"Great Book of Novel Cliches\\" and had a college student finish up. Character's sympathies do u-turns. Father and son go from being three dimentional characters to cardboard cut out addons without any personality. The worst turn is Mary's realization (with Mom's help) that she has been an awful mother herself and reconciles with her attention seeking adult daughter.

Sure to be a major motion picture."},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"Reviewed by Danielle Feleciano for Reader Views (2/08)In \\"Piece of Work,\\" Laura Zigman somehow manages to write a chic-lit genre book that is completely anti-chic lit. This book is not a light and fluffy read. It does not have a load of superficial characters who are so enamored with themselves you just can't keep reading. Rather, this is a book with real people as the characters. A couple, Julia and Peter, suddenly lose all of their stability when Peter is laid off of his job. After months of unemployment on his end, Julia realizes she has to leave her current life as a stay-at-home mom and return to her past life as a celebrity publicist.Julia and Peter both struggle with the same insecurities most of us do. He loses the sense of identity that comes with being the main financial support to his family. She goes back and forth with questioning her ability to be a good mom and wife and whether she's doing the right thing going back to work. And once she goes back to work, she questions her ability to do that job as well.We get glimpses into their relationship with Julia's parents; a relationship which seems to have been strained in the past but has been mended with the birth of a grandchild. Those and other characters do fall flat and could have been better developed. The moms at the preschool and Julia's relationship with Patricia and Lisa all could have given more meat to the story.Julia is desperate to work and takes the only thing she can find in her field, which is as a celebrity publicist to has-beens who don't even realize they are has-beens. Her boss is a selfish jerk who does everything he can to sabotage Julia's client, Mary Ford. Ms. Ford may deserve the sabotage for the pain and suffering she puts everyone through, but Ms. Zigman allows just enough vulnerability to show through that we find ourselves slowly rooting for Mary's success.The end of \\"Piece of Work\\" did seem a bit far-fetched and a bit too neatly tied up, but that's the beauty of fiction sometimes. Julia, Peter, and even Mary have been through enough. They all deserved to have a happy ending, even if it doesn't last forever.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Piece of Work","review":"I loved Laura Zigman's first three novels, so I eagerly awaited the release of Piece of Work.

Writers don't write like this anymore. Barney wrote in a 17th century style of French, so the writing is formal but as well, poetic."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"True to the subtitle \\"My Life as a Woman\\", the book reports only about those aspects of and events in the life of the author, Hedy Lamarr, in which the fact that she was a woman played a major role: marriages, sex, and movies, in about equal parts and in considerable detail. Her achievements and her patent in electronics are not mentioned at all, not even hinted at.Although the over-all story is roughly chonological, there are many flash-forwards and flash-backs. Whether the narrative can hold up agianst these, is a matter of opinion; I could have done with a little less. The main time line starts with her birth and shows repeatedly how here life was influenced by the movie \\"Extasy\\" she made when she was 18 years old (hence the title). It ends with the infamous shoplifting affair, of which she gives a vague account, clearly unwilling to tell the whole truth, but equally clearly unwilling to lie. This tension is, to a lesser extend, discernable throughout the entire book. The book ends with about eighty small paragraphs of personal wisdom and advice.Not high literature but definitely a good read, if you are interested in H.L. or in the Hollywood movie industry of 1935-1965."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"This book was ghost-written for her by Leo Guild without her input. He got so many facts wrong, and took so many liberties, that she ended up suing the publisher over them.There are much better books written about Hedy Lamarr, truly a remarkable woman worth reading about, but sadly she never wrote one herself."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":".....Miss Lamarr sued the publisher for inserting false assertions by her ghost writer that she claimed were not true. So how much of the book is fact and how much fiction is up for grabs. One thing is certain, if only one half of the book is factual then Miss Lamarr had a serious problem with her sexuality. She claims that she was over sexed and was under the care of psychiratists for many years. The word nymphomaniac was never used but most certainly must have been the case......I think Miss Lamarr's world class beauty turned out to be a curse instead of a blessing and kept her from ever realizing true contentment or happiness. She admitted as much in her book ...\\"My face has been my misfortune. It has attracted six unsuccessful marriage partners. It has attracted all the wrong people into my boudior and brought me tragedy and heartache for five decades. My face is a mask I cannot remove: I must always live with it. I curse it.\\" ........I was disappointed that the book did not discuss her patent for frequency hopping which today is called Spread Spectrum Technology and is one of the foundations for modern wireless communications. This to me was the most interesting part of her life. That such a great mind could be smothered and hidden behind a beautiful face is a tragedy......I believe that Miss Lamarr was used and exploited by Hollywood for the money her beauty would generate but I also belive that she was a willing accomplice."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"The history of the book itself is somewhat mysterious, as is the life of its subject. The bulk of the book's material came from lengthy interviews with Hedy Lamarr by the ghost-writer and model Nancy Bacon, beginning in the late 50's. Ms. Bacon then turned the material over to Leo Guild. While it is true that Ms. Lamarr sued the publisher when the book was released, and it's also true that Leo Guild may have taken liberties with the content, one can confidently say that Ms. Lamarr directly contributed most of it and even many of the &#34;embellishments&#34; were her own doing. All her biographers have generally agreed with this and quote &#34;Ecstasy and Me&#34; extensively.Hedy's inventions were completely left out of this book, I suspect this was due to the publisher's assessment that the readership would be more interested in her private life than her intellectual pursuits. In retrospect this was probably a mistake, but not an uncommon one for the genre."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"This book is very poorly written beginning with an incorrect date of birth, the lady goes on and on and never talks about her scientific accomplishments but harps on her sexual conquests which appears to me more timid than some stories that we know of from our personal experiences. May be it was torrid when it first appeared but now it seems pretty tame."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"The book was in very bad shape, dirty, and very used. Very expensive for its quality. Extremely disappointed with the real product compared with its description."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"Aside from being one of the most beautiful woman in her era of the screen, and a totally unappreciated fine actress in her own right -- she also had brains, coinventing an electronic item, far ahead of it's time, but is in use today by both military and commerical sources in our world of today."},{"Title":"Ecstasy and Me: My Life As A Woman","review":"She's not all that beautiful to me. I've seen better. I think Linda Darnell and Gene Tierney were more beautiful. Since black actresses didn't get a chance back then because of racism, there were many who could compete with Hedy's, Ava Gardner, and Elizabeth Taylor's beauty, but since back then white beauty was suppose to be the most beautiful, black women didn't have a chance to compete. You should see actress Hilda Simms, Edna Mae Holly - Cotton Club dancer/Sugar Ray Robinson wife, Francine Everett - actress/singer, Ethel Moses - Oscar Micheaux actress/Cotton Club dancer, Model Pauline Green who could beat out Hedy Lamarr in the looks department, Pat Rainey - singer, Josephine Edwards - singer/actress, Hazel Scott - singer/pianist, Emily Santos - model, Dorothy Van Engle - model/Oscar Micheaux actress, Marion Egbert - Cotton Club dancer, Sheila Guyse - singer/actress, Ida James - singer, Savannah Churchill - singer, Rita Thomas - dancer, Millie Monroe - dancer/actress, Lonette McKee - actress, Marilyn McCoo - singer, Freda Payne - singer, Tammi Terrell - singer, Judy Pace - actress, Barbara McNair - actress, Diahann Carroll - actress, Sarah Lou Harris - model, Carrolle Drake, model Lulu Guerrero, and many others, they would make Hedy Lamarr look like nothing. All these black women, including Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, would definitely give Hedy Lamarr and any other beautiful white actress a run for for their money. Lena Horne was called the black version of Hedy Lamarr, but I think Lena was more beautiful and obviously more talented. Check this video out at Youtube of unsung black beauties who also had talent, just copy and paste the link to see the video and I bet you can't deny that these women were just as beautiful as Hedy Lamarr -[...]Hedy is gorgeous but not the most beautiful, to me pretty is pretty, beauty is beauty, no such thing as most beautiful, but it all boils down to what's your taste and preference, some may find Hedy the most beautiful, others won't, I would pick Rita Hayworth, Gene Tierney, Dolores del Rio, Linda Darnell, Kathryn Grayson, Lena Horne, and Dorothy Dandridge over Hedy anyday. I doubt any man would turn down those ladies, cause they've been called the most beautiful too. Everytime a new chick came around back then, she was called \\"the most beautiful.\\" God didn't make Hedy so-called beautiful, its called genes. I'm sure God don't go around with a magic wand saying he's going to make one beautiful and another ugly. God isn't partial he would make everyone beautiful. Looks aren't everything, obviously she had a lot of troubles in her life, so her looks didn't give her a perfect life. She suffered like any other woman, probably more so, because she thought cause of her looks all the men and everyone would treat her right. She was too stupid to know when your an attractive woman, all the men want you, but to use you, then when they get done with you, they move on to the next pretty face and that's what happen to Hedy. She's not the only beauty. She allowed herself to be exploited. I hate reading about how much of a whore some of these white Hollywood women were, didn't they have any morals? They go to bed with anyone, just cause you a sex symbol, don't mean you actually have to live up to it. Most of all these women ended up old and alone, the men used them then left them. Beautiful women like Hedy thought all the men would treat her right cause she's a beauty, yeah they'll treat you right in the beginning until they get what they want, then their gone, she should have been smarter.Since Hedy had no talent, all people can talk about is her looks. Maybe she would have been looked at as a great actress, if she would have worked hard and studied at acting, and stop just looking and being beautiful. She should have showed she was more than just a pretty face by working hard at some talent, whether it be acting, singing, or dancing. If you just sit and look beautiful, you'll be be treated as such, so don't complain. Hedy brought it upon herself if people just wanted her just to be beautiful or just liked her for her looks, if she would have showed talent they would have like her for that too. Charlize Theron is a beauty, but she showed she was a great actress and looked rough in the film she won an Academy for. There were beautiful women who were great actresses, Hedy just didn't have the talent, so of course she was just liked for her looks. Rita Hayworth, Gene Tienery, Garbo, and Linda Darnell were beauties who could act, Rita was multi-talented, she could dance as well. Elizabeth Taylor was a beauty who could act real good. I pick them any day over Hedy. Hedy just seem cold, like a lot of beautiful women, nice face, but ugly and cold on the inside because they feel cause they look good, they can treat people any kind of way or act any kind of way. Hedy was good looking but she looked like a mannequin, no life in her face, no spark. I've seen photos where she looked not so hot. When you got good lightning and a good photographer and a good makeup artist anyone can look good in Hollywood. Its a matter of opinion who thinks she's the most beautiful in the world, but I don't, and since black women weren't given a chance in films, well you can't say she was the most beautiful, cause you haven't seen the other beauties. Its all a matter of opinion who's the most beautiful. Oh there was another called the most beautiful woman, and that was actress Dolores del Rio, and I believe Greta Garbo was called the most beautiful in the early 30's, and an obscure actress named Anna Sten was called the most beautiful in the 30's too, so it wasn't just Hedy called the most beautiful. I pick Dolores del Rio, Garbo, Anna Sten, Rita Hayworth, Linda Darnell, Kathryn Grayson, Gene Tierney, Lana Turner, Lena Horne, Eartha Kitt, Ellen Holly, Diahanna Carroll, Hilda Simms, and Dorothy Dandridge over Hedy Lamarr anyday. All these women are in the same category of beauty as Hedy.I bet no man can't deny any of these women's beauty, if they wanted any man, no man would turn them down. I bet all these beauties could make any woman jealous too.I'm sick of these Hollywood women saying their beauty is a curse when they life go wrong, you brought it on yourself by the decisions you made, your looks had nothing to do with it.Beauty isn't a curse, its how you handle it, if you use it negative or let people in your life to use it negative, your life experience will be negative, if you do good things, surround yourself about good people, you'll have a positive life. There are a lot of women that had beauty and did well, the ones who didn't are the ones who thought people should hand things to them on a silver platter, they were selfish, cold, didn't have much of a personality, because they would use their looks to attract people, and thought every man was going to treat them like a queen cause of their beauty, and they found men only use them, abuse them, and then moved on to the next beauty. When your an attractive woman, you have to be careful beautiful the more beautiful you are, the more men want you to use you, every woman should know. I think Hedy was dumb in a lot of ways.Most women who are beautiful, don't have inner beauty, and that's why their beauty is a curse, and that's why they can't keep a man. Most Hollywood beauties have many love affairs and husbands, because they can't keep a man because they don't have inner beauty, they can get any man they want with outer beauty, but the lack of inner beauty is what caused them many failed love affairs and many upsets in life. Hedy's the perfect example of perfect on the outside, but messed up on the inside, I guess you can't have it all!!!! If people perfected inner beauty as much as they do outer beauty, the world would be a better place and everyone would be perfect. Anyways, Hedy proved she was just like any other human being. She got old, wrinkled, and ugly like everyone else, even her son said she aged badly and tried to fix it with plastic surgery, but ended up looking worse, then she hid from the public cause she didn't look like she did when she was young. HA! Looks don't last forever, so always have something to fall back on like smarts or talents.If she had anything to do with Hitler, I really don't like her now!!"},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"Few works of contemporary non-fiction have had more lasting impact on the social consciousness of the overall society from which it arose than \\"The Other America\\", Michael Harrington's now classic tome on the egregious conditions under which what we would now call the \\"underclass\\" lived in mid-20th century American society. With an uncommon verve and uncanny precision, Harrington painstakingly detailed the disgusting and shocking realities of life for those many millions of Americans of both color and ethnicity living lives of desperate poverty in the midst of the affluent society. Millions of readers, myself included, were shocked to discover the extent to which this world coexisted with our own, and many of the social action programs that arose in the 1960s and thereafter used this book as a kind of reference guide to the realities of poverty in contemporary society. Indeed, what is most disturbing about anyone re-reading the book is the discovery of how little conditions have changed for those who through the accident of birth, color, and ethnic origin, find themselves inexorably trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty.Sadly, for all the glad-handing of politicians and the proclamations by global corporations of the new and more widespread prosperity of the 1990s, the sobering truth is that very little progress has been made. Indeed, in more recent books such as William Finnegan's excellent \\"Cold New World\\", Harrington's basic thesis of the co-existence of a starker, poorer, and powerless populace left stranded to live lives of quiet desperation is reconfirmed, putting the lie to the many proclamations of universal opportunity and promise that politicians now ballyhoo. The book, which was first published in the early 1960s, was required reading for most introductory sociology and contemporary history courses, and millions of young academics first learned of the extent of the national problem through a reading of this book. It is, in that sense at least, a modern classic. Harrington's basic thesis is incontrovertible; poverty is extensive and endemic, and is usually hidden from the view of most affluent Americans due to the ways in which the two subcultures coexist in modern society. Through the de-facto residential segregation of the two elements of the society, there is little meaningful contact, and the media tends to ignore the facts of the existence of the underclass, portraying arch-types which conform more to the sensibilities of the more affluent segments of the society that regularly view its programming and enforcing unrealistic images of what exists. As a previous reviewer commented, we no longer habituate the same environments, and we tend to avoid all unnecessary contact with anything to do with this other world of poverty and want. What Harrington originally described in such anguished and inflammatory terms, hoping to purposefully ignite America's slumbering conscience, has instead become a permanent feature of our conscienceless socio-cultural landscape.It is a sad truth that Harrington's book is as timely and as shocking today as it was some forty years ago. His account of the fate of millions of impoverished people of color and ethnicity remains as cogent and as relevant as it was then. Despite the long and tortured history of the social legislation that attempted to rework this problem in the decades since, the reality of the situation seems to be that nothing much has changed in terms of the life-chances and hopes of the members of the underclass. It remains a mainstay of introductory courses in social stratification, providing an excellent overview of the myriad of the sociological, political, and economic issues surrounding the underclass, and is a wonderful example of just how important one man's vision of the truth can be in orienting others meaningfully toward rectifying a social problem. Poverty may remain, as they say, always with us, but the shocking truths found in this book still sheds the light of day into an unappetizing aspect of contemporary society we all should be aware of."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"The Other America was first published in 1962, before Johnson's &quot;Great Society&quot; and &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; before Vietnam, before the urban riots of the late 60s, before the Civil Rights legislation, and before the formation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As such, it may well seem a dinosaur to apply the revelations and ideas proposed by author Michael Harrington to a society that has advanced so far. Or has it? Harrington develops his thesis on the central premise that poverty in America is both there and widespread. More importantly, however, is the fact that it is hidden. People no longer have day-to-day contact with the urban poor. Before the mass exodus of the middle class, the majority of Americans lived in or near areas inhabited by the poor. Even if they did not, they walked through or drove through the rows of tenements on their way to work downtown. They saw the conditions the poor lived in and saw the faces of the poor. When Harrington wrote, as is true today, the &quot;ghetto&quot; is a place to avoid. We have successfully severed all economic use of the poor from our daily lives and are able to drive into downtown from the suburban fringe without even having to stop to see the lives of the poor. Even today's trend toward reconstructing highways below-grade so as to have less impact on the poor neighborhoods they divide further removes the lives of the poor from our daily routine-we don't even have to see the buildings pass by anymore. They are safely beyond the highway wall. Harrington differentiates between the poverty existing today and that of previous urban centers. The old ethnic ghettos were indeed permeated by poverty, had miserable living conditions, and were centers of disease and urban mischief. They did have one thing, however, that is lacking in today's ghettos: aspiration. The ghettos of yesterday melded the old world with the new, and served as stepping-stones toward the American dream. Those who form today's ghettos, primarily African-Americans, do not have an &quot;old world.&quot; They come from within our society but are not part of it. Generations of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination, and despair have disenchanted many, so much so that most of America is foreign to them and they are said to have a &quot;twisted spirit.&quot; Harrington discusses the various classes of poverty, ranging from that of blacks to the elderly to the rural farmer and many in between. Curiously, however, he only mentions poverty of children, a major issue of modern times, in passing. Public housing is discussed in some detail, and looking back from the failures we have witnessed in public housing projects, much could have been avoided had we paid attention to Harrington's thoughts. He condemns the towering projects as instant ghettos, providing poverty with a simple facelift, detached from surrounding neighborhoods. As early as 1962, an argument was being made against the demolition and removal of entire neighborhoods for the construction of high-rise towers and in favor of dispersed public housing. Only recently have HUD programs such as Section 8 vouchers and HOPE VI project grants implemented this ideology. Overall, Harrington's account of poverty in America has, unfortunately, remained a very viable account. Even after Johnson's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; the civil rights legislation, urban riots, and the longest peacetime economic expansion ever, Harrington's book might as well have been written today. It provides a good summary of the sociological and economic issues concerning poverty, and would be a good introductory book before expanding on specific aspects of poverty by contemporary sociologists such as William Julius Wilson. A reader today may question his persistent call for a federal solution, given the miserable track record of federal programs and the increasing focus on local solutions. Harrington does, however, shed light and provide a realistic picture of a large portion of American's that most never see."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"What is most amazing about Harrington's book is how accurately it describes today's society. The impact of this book, first published in the early 60s, is testament to the power that a single book can have on a nation and its people. It directly affected the thoughts and actions of President Johnson's \\"war on poverty\\". Unfortunately, this \\"war on poverty\\" may never come to a conclusion, even in the richest country in the world.The book itself contains a good introduction by Howe, who puts the impact of Harrington's work in context. Filled with statistics, which are unfortunately not well referenced, the case is made that the scale of poverty in the US is a travesty and an outrage. Harrington himself lived amongst the poor and disenfranchised members of New York's society for a brief period of time and he writes about their general hopelessness and lack of purpose in life. The descriptions and analysis of this book allow you to view the world through the 'lens' of poverty, to know (on a superficial level) the crippling and depressing lives of our society's poorest members. Harrington was perhaps the leading American socialist of his time, so be warned that his views and crituqes have a liberal/leftist stance and that much of the book disparages the efforts of the US government (perhaps, rightly so).As an added bonus, this edition of the book includes some insightful afterwords by Harrington about poverty in the 70s and 80s. Overall, an important and powerful work that is a must-read for anyone concerned with the issue of poverty in the US (which should be everyone, shouldn't it?)."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"Not being an American, I cannot judge whether the poverty situation described in this book is still as prevalent as it was in the early 1960's.I found the book to be a good and easy read, the author was able to get his point across and made some good suggestions. An important book that I am glad I read."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"White poor, black poor, urban poor, rural poor are included. This book was one of the driving forces behind the &quot;War on Poverty&quot; of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Now conservatives more than liberals see that we have a culture of poverty with generations of welfare families. Help is needed, but it has to be a workable solution. Liberals, conservatives and radicals seem not to really understand this culture. Perhaps help will come from a revived labor movement."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"During the 1950s, the poor were invisible; during the 1960s & 70s they were to be pulled up by the Great Society programs; during the 1980s they became the enemy of President Reagan and the middle class; during the 1990s and 2000s the poor have become clowns to laugh at on the \\"Jerry Springer Show\\".This book lends significant and valuable insight into poverty; not just economic poverty but \\"psychological\\" poverty. Although this book was written over forty years ago, much of the main ideas still seem to hold true. Instead of looking at today's poor Americans as \\"lazy welfare bums\\" we must look at the deep psychological and sociological subculture that is their situation. Harrington makes many interesting observations in this regard. The book is also very well written and researched.Please do not dismiss this book because of the author's liberal and socialistic political leanings. Take it for what it is. In any case, it will give you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"The Other America has been around for a very long time. I read it when it first came out in 1962, and did not like it at all, because its basic thesis is that poverty is the result of cultural pathology (except in the case of the elderly). At the time I was a radical SDS anti-poverty and anti-war activist, and our ideology was that the poor were exploited and discriminated against, and simply lacked money. We had nothing but contempt for the notion of a \\"culture of poverty,\\" because that implied that the poor were responsible for their own fate.Well, I and my friends were very wrong. There is a culture of poverty and it accounts for much poverty, and this does not mean that we should ignore it because it's the poor's own fault. There but for the Grace of God go I, and you, dear reader, as well.The deep accuracy and sensitivity with which Harrington portrays cultures of poverty ring as true today as a half century ago. The tragedy is that the War on Poverty and other anti-poverty measures of the last third of the Twentieth Century did not understand Harrington's analysis, and treated poverty as the simple lack of material resources. How could the Federal Government have build public housing complexes, true breeding grounds of social pathologies, after reading Harrington's depiction of urban poverty. What an unmitigated tragedy.Many years ago I changed from criticizing the \\"blame the victim\\" mentality to embracing the notion that the victims should always blame themselves, because they are the only one who have the combined power and will to change things. When I am oppressed it is my fault and I better damn well figure out how to change the situation. Poverty in America will only be overcome when the culture of poverty is attacked, with vengeance and steadfastness, by the communities that are exploited by their pathological cultures of apathy and ignorance."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs.

Harrington who understood society better than most of his day shunned such discrimination based on race, class, economic standing, or national origin and these honorable views resound very highly in the pages of \\"The Other America. The book is a study of poverty and its underlying factors in the United States during the fifties and sixties, Harrington who would often move into and work in the neighborhoods and communities he was studying presents a dignified and unbiased case for the inhumanity that existed and still exists in the slums and poor towns of the United States.Harrington takes the gloves off for his analysis of the evolution of poverty. The writer explores the factors of racial discrimination, economic and socioeconomic discrimination, family structural instability, the effect of recessions and hard times on poor communities, and the gap in education that propagates the extension and survival of poverty into the future. One important factor that Harrington continuously brings up in \\"The Other America\\" is the views and feelings of indifference that the middle class and well off feel towards the poor and lower classes of the other America. Harrington exposes the inefficient and dastardly laws, mindsets, and societal norms that ensured the survival of poverty into the twentieth century (and surprisingly they ring true for the present day as well). The writer exposes the stories and faces behind the suffering of the other America but also presents ways in which the suffering could be alleviated or poverty stamped out completely in the United States.The socioeconomic analysis that is \\"The Other America can seem quite statistical to the reader with its constant use of numerical studies and figures to illuminate the problem of poverty, but these bothersome details can be overcome and even appreciated by understanding that \\"The Other America\\" was written during a time of rising economic and sociological disparities, and was brought forth to energize and push the country towards creating solutions to these problems in the course of attempting to create a more equal and humility-minded society. A great read nonetheless for it highlights to those willing to listen the need both then and now for a war on poverty."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs.

It is explained the poor are invisible because they dress as the rest of us do. Staying on interstates does not disclose the impoverished hamlets. The poor inhabit geographical areas of beauty. The poor are increasingly isolated in specific areas of the cities. They are invisible politically. (Note the discussion in the last election of helping the middle class.) Powerful political organizations not longer focus on the slums.Sometimes poverty is a matter of unintended consequences. For instance, a pension scheme may fetter mobility. In addition to pensions, home-owning and credit outlays may impede mobility, (the ability to move to where the work is). A technological revolution in agriculture produces rural poverty. The alcoholic poor come from every social class. Aged poverty is described. (This is a topic that has changed since the introduction of Medicare.) The prevalence of mental illness among the poor is covered and it is truly telling.This book mobilized public opinion in the sixties to create remedies for poverty and it remains relevant today. Its breadth, its formulations, its visions are remarkable."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"This book is a subjective analysis of the USA regarding poverty.

Nonetheless, This book opened my eyes to the poverty in America not only in the past, but at its' present state."},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"This is a classic for sure but a classic of what? Most of the people Harrington writes about have created their own worlds and then populated them. Yes, we do feel sorry for the underprivileged but most people in America have the privilege of a free education, free libraries and free charity. If they fail, whose fault is it?"},{"Title":"THE OTHER AMERICA","review":"I was bored. I want real stories and examples. I read &quot;There are no Children here&quot; and loved it!!! I read somewhere that the author was inspired by this book, so I couldn't wait to get it. My guess is this author is a liberal, and not objective. The information was boring and one sided. I would have probably liked it more if the time frame was more current. I want to know more about today, not the 60's."},{"Title":"My Very Own Baby Book","review":"I love this book. It is a board book with a great story on each page to read to your child. He/she can then open the flap on each page to reveal a picture of him or her doing what the story on the page is about as a baby (at the hospital, sleeping, bathtime, favorite toy, first walk, etc.) Not too long, not too short. I can't wait till my son is old enough for me to read to him his own story with pictures of him on each page. Picture sizes are 4x4 so it's easy to trim a 4x6 picture to fit on the cover and each page."},{"Title":"My Very Own Baby Book","review":"This book is so adorable!

It is a picture book with common household items and themes that you can personalize with pictures of your child.

Book is organized very nicely and contains unusual photographs. Those living in canal areas will like to compare scenes of then with now. This book gets its point across that at one time (early 19th century) canals were the best thing going for shipping goods and for transportation."},{"Title":"A Photo Album of Ohio's Canal Era: 1825-1913","review":"This is a profusely illustrated \\"coffee table book\\".A Photo Album of Ohio's Canal Era, 1825-1913 (Ohio)is a discussion and photo-history of the numerous feeder lakes and transportation canals (for both supplies and passengers) which were spread like stitch-work across the Buckeye State in the 19th and early 20th centuries, before the railroads nullified their utility and viable existence.The remnants of many of these intriguing canals can still be viewed at various locations, including a number of the brilliantly conceived sandstone-constructed locks and aqueducts. A few have even been restored to their original magnificence. Most of the original canal feeder lakes (e.g., Buckeye Lake) have since been designated as state parks, all of which allow boating, fishing, and camping in addition to other outdoor recreational pursuits.The original photographs in this book are exceptional. Of course they are rendered in black-and-white. The documentation of each canal has been well-researched and many folks will be surprised to learn that the hamlets in which they live are actually named for a particular lock such as [Lock] Seventeen, Ohio on U.S. Route 36.For well over 50 years, I've lived within a mile of the Ohio-Erie Canal which generally parallels U.S. Route 23 and State Route 104 between Columbus (the state's contemporary Capital) and Portsmouth, the latter community marking the southern terminus of the canal which ultimately dumped into the Ohio River, (about 1/2 mile west of the Scioto River's current confluence with the Ohio).The renowned English novelist, Charles Dickens (1812-1870), actually traveled to Portsmouth on one of the old canal boats during an historic trip that he once made to Appalachia's western foothills! In commemoration of that singular event, the city of Portsmouth still sponsors an annual \\"Dickens of a Christmas\\" festival. While more and more of this particular canal disappears every year in the face of the ongoing construction of homes and highways, visitors to the region can still see a good bit of it including the original \\"towpath\\" (now mostly clogged with old trees of every regional species) where the mules, driven by men on foot, endlessly pulled the canal boats and their cargo along these lengthy sojourns.Many of the construction workers died during the advent of the monumental project of canal building and it's fairly easy to find cemeteries here and there, often within a few yards of the old canal beds. I used to trap muskrats out of sections of the old State Route 104 canal during my youth (1960s) and in those days I located a significant number of these mostly unmarked gravesites.Getting back to the book, the quality of the paper (pages), the binding, and the dust jacket is quite excellent.A Photo Album of Ohio's Canal Era, 1825-1913 (Ohio)would make a fine gift for amateur historians who live east of the Mississippi and north of Kentucky (similar canals also existed in other states such as New York); or, for anyone who lives within ten miles or so of one of these amazing monuments of Ohio's rich history.My highest recommendation."},{"Title":"A Photo Album of Ohio's Canal Era: 1825-1913","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend a few weeks ago. For those just beginning an interest in Ohio's canals, this is a grand book you'll find difficult to put down. If you are already versed in the Ohio canals' history, this is a very good book to have for a reference. The introductory chapter on the history of photography was, in itself, an education. Why? Because it examined that technology as it progressed through time. And since the book is made up of hundreds of canal photos through time, it is important to put the status of photographers into the overall understanding (and appreciation) of this era."},{"Title":"Building a Better Data Warehouse","review":"Reasonable overview of the process required to build a data warehouse...however, most topics are given only light treatment. There are better books than this on data warehousing."},{"Title":"Observational Astrophysics","review":"Very broad in its scope with enough depth to deal with the fundamentals while pointing the reader in the right direction for a more detailed treatment of the subject matter. Could be used as a text or reference book, or simply read as I chose, to broaden ones knowledge. Contains a good overview of the tools and techniques of radio astronomy. A fair bit of math employed, but not overwhelming to the educated reader. Reading level is geared toward a 3rd or 4th year undergrad in physics/astronomy but would also be useful as a primer for graduate level students or the serious amateur. Good book at a good price!"},{"Title":"Observational Astrophysics","review":"This book is the perfect first text for astronomy students that are just getting beyond descriptive astronomy and are venturing into more mmathematically rigorous depths. From the first chapter to the last what has often been accepted in descriptive courses is now plumbed with the tools of basic calculus and statistics.Students are given the opportunity to see how the various formulas used in observational astronomy are derived, leading to a greater understanding when these formulas are applied in daily use. The mathematics is of little difficulty to anyone with a basic knowledge of calculus and many of the problems presented would serve as exceptional real-world problems for sophomore level mathematics courses.The text is best suited to advanced undergraduate students and may be adapted for use in introductory graduate courses. The problems and ideas presented have immediate applications in the observatory and transition from lecture to lab is remarkably easy.This book truly is a gem!"},{"Title":"The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime","review":"Professor Marcello Truzzi believed that one should be skeptical about everything, including skepticism. Although he was a founder of the skeptical society CSICOP, he quit that group when it became clear that his fellows were interested only in debunking, rather than in seriously investigating pros and cons of paranormal issues. Truzzi coined the term \\"pseudoskeptic\\" for people interested only in debunking the paranormal.In Blue Sense, Truzzi turned his openminded brand of skepticism to the subject of psychic crimesolving, and the result is the best book ever written on the subject. He investigated various psychic crimesolvers in depth, and discovered that the truth is very elusive. Truzzi and co-author Arthur Lyons discuss many claims of psychic successes, but they cannot find a single well-documented case that proves psychic crimesolving power, but not for lack of trying. Although the authors can come to no definite conclusions about psychic powers, their in-depth investigations of the work of many famous psychics (Peter Hurkos, Gerard Croiset, Dorothy Allsion, and others) are very interesting.The authors detail the stumbling blocks to rigorous evaluation of psychic cases, including faulty memories (including those of police detectives), using known facts to tell police what they already know or to make shrewd guesses, making vague predictions (\\"near water\\"), and \\"shotgunning\\" (making many predictions, often contradictory, then afterward remembering only those that came true). These problems are common evaluating many claims of psychic powers, and makes this book of wider interest to anyone interested in psychic phenomena."},{"Title":"QUEST FOR THE WELL OF SOULS","review":"This is a direct continuation of events begun in the second book of this series, Exiles at the Well of Souls. These two books, together, are called the War of the Well World.It is difficult to describe the events of this book without substantially spoiling much of Exiles.Essentially, the second phase of the war gets under way, and I can't say any more than that.As the author puts it in his note in both books, \\"In an ideal world, Exiles should be read first.\\"If you have read Exiles, and found it a good book, this one is a must (it's really the second half).Vol. 1: Midnight at the Well of SoulsVol. 2: Exiles at the Well of Souls (Part 1: War of the Well World)Vol. 3: Quest for the Well of Souls (Part 2: War of the Well World)Vol. 4: The Return of Nathan BrazilVol. 5: Twilight at the Well of Souls"},{"Title":"QUEST FOR THE WELL OF SOULS","review":"To fully enjoy this book requires the reading of the prior books in sequence. The writer has an extraordinary ability to weave a complex tale that keeps the reader's interest from the first to last page."},{"Title":"QUEST FOR THE WELL OF SOULS","review":"I loved the series years ago, and have re-read them a few times, each book was captivating. Being drawn into such a diverse world with what what could be less far fetched ideas in today's age, is such fun. If you like sci-fi that is a little more sci than fi, this is the series for you. It takes the basic ideas we know in science and stretches them just to the breaking point, while mixing some philosophy in. The main characters are quick to at least identify with, making the story that much more captivating."},{"Title":"QUEST FOR THE WELL OF SOULS","review":"Well War 2.Or, if you haven't read the second book in the Well World series, Exiles at the Well of Souls this book may not make anywhere near as much sense, as it follows on directly from that one to continue the conflict and problems that Mavra Chang and company find themsleves in because of the experiment in the earlier novel.This one is still just as entertaining as the first part though."},{"Title":"QUEST FOR THE WELL OF SOULS","review":"This author has done it again, once you start reading you can not put it down. this is the 3rd. book in a series and if you have not read the others, I would recomend them, starting with midnight at the well of souls and then ghost of the well of souls."},{"Title":"Great American Air Battles of World War II","review":"I found it amazing that no one has read or reviewed this fantastic book until now. I guess I should be happy I am the first person to write a review of this book on Amazon. Sadly, it seems that today most people are not interested in anything to do with history. This may the reason why we keep repeating the same mistakes we have made in the past. Even though I was a baby during World War 11, I am familiar with a few of these air battles that became the important turning point in the war.This very interesting and informative 154 page hardcover book covers the great American air battles which occurred during World War 11. The 12 chapters cover the following air battle: (1) The battle of the Coral Sea. (2) The battle of Midway. (3) Wildcats and Corsairs Versus Zeros. (4) To Hell and Back. (5) Double strike. (6) Black Thursday. (7) The Marianas \\"Turkey Shoot.\\" (8) Battles of the Big League. (9) Misburg. (10)The big day. (11) The shooting down of Vice-Admiral Yamagata. (12) The battle of Kagoshima Bay.Each chapter provides details about the pilots and planes who participated in these air battles. There are also numerous photographs of the planes and pilots whose bravery during World War 11 should never be forgotten.In conclusion, if you have an interest in an important part of our World War 11 history, this book is for you. The price is a real bargain for this excellent history book on important American air battles.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir)"},{"Title":"Raw 101: Better Images with Photoshop Elements and Photoshop","review":"More and more advanced digital cameras offer a number of file formats for capturing the digital image, including JPG, TIF and RAW. None of these formats, because of the limitations of the camera mechanism, captures as much information about the scene being photographed as the human eye. For example, a photograph that shows detail in bright light will usually show less detail in shadows than the human eye would see. Some of these file formats actually delete some of the data. Serious photographers agree that the RAW format captures the most data from the scene.When the Adobe Company first came out with Adobe Camera Raw (ACR), the software aimed at extracting the maximum data from the RAW file, there was little information about how to use it. But since Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, which are the most widely used digital imaging programs, both include ACR as part of the package, the knowledge base has continued to increase.\\"Camera Raw 101\\" is a manual, aimed at the relatively inexperienced ACR user, that covers its use in both Photoshop CS2 (the current version of Photoshop) and Photoshop Elements 3 (the reduced capability, but much cheaper version of Photoshop.). After describing the techniques for getting images from the camera to the computer, Canfield describes each of the functions offered in ACR and then tells how to use those functions to get pictures that contain as much information in possible. He finishes up by summarizing the steps that should be taken in Photoshop and Elements after RAW processing. His instructions are simple, clear and easy to follow.ACR includes several functions that are also available in the main body of Photoshop and Elements. Canfield believes there are functions to usually apply in ACR and others after ACR conversion, but also describes situations where one might process in the opposite fashion.This is by no means a description of the entire process of moving a picture from camera to print. The emphasis is on the use of ACR. The book's publisher, Sybex, offers several other books that focus on other aspects of image processing like \\"Photoshop CS2 Workflow\\" by Tim Grey and \\"Photo Finish\\" by Canfield and Grey.Although the book is aimed at ACR novices, experienced users may still find information about the capability of ACR with which they were not acquainted. I know I did. At the very least, it would provide a useful review of the process.This book will appeal to those who learn best by lecture. Photographers who like tutorials might want to consider the \\"Photoshop Artistry\\" series by Barry Haynes.I have one complaint about the book. Many of the illustrations are screen grabs from the computer monitor. Unfortunately they are printed so that the size of the image itself is only about 2 and one-half inches square. In the illustrations of digital noise I was unable to see the noise pattern, even with the use of a magnifying glass.In summary, this is excellent instruction in the use of ACR. Although aimed at the beginner, experienced Photoshop users will probably also derive some benefit."},{"Title":"Raw 101: Better Images with Photoshop Elements and Photoshop","review":"I purchased a Canon 20D about three months ago. Because this was the first camera I have owned capable of writing to raw, I searched the internet and read articles on the Adobe website (I use CS2) to get an idea about what it was all about. I played around with raw files, but I was not getting anywhere. Then I purchased Raw 101.First, it is a fairly easy read relative to reading Adobe manuals and Class Room in a Book, so I just took a couple of hours and read it. Then I went to my computer and went chapter by chapter while actually working with my own raw files. I have to say that by the end of the second reading, I felt very comfortable with Adobe Camera Raw and I now use it fairly regularly.The book is a great way to get a feel for the process. The problem that I have had with other training materials is that you are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material, much of which covers stuff that you will rarely if ever use. On the other hand Raw 101 gets right to the point and teaches you to quickly understand the how to gain the optimum use of raw processing. I also agree with the other reviewer that this book would be helpful to all users whether a beginner or an experienced user.Although I have used Photoshop for several years, I consider myself a beginner when it comes to Adobe Camera Raw and I found this book invaluable. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Raw 101: Better Images with Photoshop Elements and Photoshop","review":"This book is very well written.

This is a great step-by-step guide that you can work through using your own images to see immediate results from the easy-to-follow workflow. It gives clear, understandable, explanations of all of the tabs and sliders in Adobe Camera Raw. It's simple: if you want to take better digital images shoot in RAW and RAW 101 will guide you through the processing steps to make your images better than you ever expected.

How can I not recommend a book that comes with tech support?"},{"Title":"Raw 101: Better Images with Photoshop Elements and Photoshop","review":"I am not unexperienced in Photoshop and I must say this book is difficult to follow at best. It is disjointed in it's layout, moving from Photoshop to Photoshop Elements willy nilly. Plus it does not give a lot real and useful information.

The cover was not as pictured."},{"Title":"The Greatest thing in the world (Little blue book)","review":"By the time I had read this book, I'd already read countless books and essays on religion and truth and love. This book offered me something extra - and opened my eyes to a wonderful new truth - mainly this - that love is enough.Never having been trained in the social graces, I always felt like a bit of a clutz in social settings such as dinner parties and even simple get-togethers.Drummond makes the point that if you have love - if you can feel and express love - you have it all. So instead of focusing on which fork to use for the shrimp and salad, I started focusing on how much God loved me and everyone around me.And that little simple truth enabled me to feel more at ease in every circumstance and in every situation.Drummond's book is about grace, love, truth, Universal spiritual laws - it's got it all. From little things (like social graces) to big things (like loving our fellow man - irrespective of his lot in life) this book will change your life.This should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"The Greatest thing in the world (Little blue book)","review":"In response to the person who said this book was dangerous because it downplayed faith when compared to Love. Does he/she truly believe Faith is greater than Love??? Think about that! I would say that for once the author of this book had a real grasp on what Jesus stood for and if more people lived their life with the values in this book the world would be a much, much more peaceful and loving place.Too many people get side tracked with worrying about their faith and thinking everyone else needs a strong faith rather than practicing what really matters in life. What really matters to Jesus. In my opinion it's been too much emphasis on faith that has caused most of the problems in this world and not enough emphasis on simply loving your neighbor. The book teaches that it's not just about doing good deeds, but practicing love until it comes natural. In order to know God you must truly feel love flowing through you as a force so powerful you can't help but be profoundly moved.Drummond emphasizes that it takes an incredible amount of effort and time to truly learn how to love in a mature way. In the way God loves. If you practice Love and begin to truly feel Love and see the good you are doing in the world then most certainly a strong faith will follow. The only way to truly know God is to feel love, for God is love. Love comes first and faith second for without love as Paul's said &quot;...if I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love I am nothing.&quot;In my humble opinion this book truly is a masterpiece and perhaps the most powerful and beautiful book ever written. Jesus' teachings were simple not complex and if you own this book and follow it's simple teachings you will never need to open your Bible again. Yes, this book is more powerful than the Bible because the church did not corrupt it, and it expresses the simple teachings of Jesus to perfection.To have love in your heart is by far the greatest complement to God for God is love. The only problem is that if everyone had this book and followed its simple teachings it would put the TV evangelists and powerful churches out of business. The teachings of Jesus were simple and they are all you need."},{"Title":"The Greatest thing in the world (Little blue book)","review":"I read this book at least once a year to keep me focused on what's important in my life.

I am reading it again this year before school starts to get my head in the right place. Love is more important than being right. Love is more important than believing the right things. Love is more important than anything you say. Love is the message that people will remember about you."},{"Title":"The Greatest thing in the world (Little blue book)","review":"I have always been told that faith is the greatest thing a Christian can have.

Drummond, a nineteenth century Christian missionary, lays out his case that Love is the key ingredient to a successful life with precision, logic and eloquence. Usually a logical approach fails to stir one's soul but his writing is as beautiful as it is persuasive. It is also an urgent message for us as individuals and as a society. We cannot call ourselves Christians if Love is subsumed by self-righteousness, hatred and judgement.

The information in this book, presented chronologically, will shock many people who think that revelations about recent presidents are scandalous and that past presidents were all either faithful husbands (some were) or sexless paragons of virtue. Not only is this untrue, but Bill Clinton's pecadilloes will seem small in comparison to those of some of his predecessors in the Oval Office. From the early experiences of the mythic George Washington to the charges of bigamy which haunted the wife of Andrew Jackson to the musical beds during FDR's administration, this book will raise eyebrows.Not that it should, mind you; it proves that Presidents are just as human as anyone else. We are actually better off for that.Also worth owning for the photo inside of JFK shaking hands with a very young Bill Clinton."},{"Title":"Sex Lives of the U.S. Presidents","review":"This book ought to stay in print, not just because of Bill Clinton's escapades (or because of recent revelations about Thomas Jefferson) but because it is very entertaining.

The title refers to the cry of a young street urchin begging from American soldiers, \\"Give me the hammon and the beans!\\" Roughly half of the stories are set in Brownsville, Texas (which Paredes refers to as \\"Jonesville on the Grande\\"), in the aftermath of an historical Mexican-American uprising which was put down by Texas rangers in the early part of the century. The other portion of stories deal with racial relations among GIs in occupied Japan after WWII (where Paredes was in fact stationed.)\\"Hammon and the Beans\\" belongs to the genre of \\"rediscovered fiction\\", similar in some respects to the Harlem Renaissance (although Paredes literary skills hardly compare with those of Jean Toomer or Zora Neale Hurston.)Paredes did offer a uniquely Mexican-American perspective on institutionalized racism, alternating in tone between genuine outrage (particularly at the fate of innocent children) and bemused mockery of hierarchies in which stupidity inevitably rises to the top.As noted by the Publisher's Weekly review above, the stories are often not much more than sketches, simply told in a folkish manner. The irony is heavyhanded and sometimes bathetic. The stories are more enjoyable when Paredes pessimism lifts a little bit, as in \\"Revenge\\", \\"Brothers\\", and \\"Rebecca\\". On the whole, the WWII stories are the better, with Paredes exhibiting a keen understanding of military life.One cautionary note: although the opening essay by Ramon Saldivar provides useful historical context, it is so heavily laced with postmodernist cliches that you might want to skip it altogether."},{"Title":"How Do I Love You? / Como te amo?

She is immensely courageous in showing us why, what is commonly viewed as &quot;a tragedy caused by terrorism&quot; cannot be explained as simply as that. Every thinking person realizes that our world is changing dramatically, and searching for understanding and NEW solutions -- not the customary call for vengeance -- is vital for the survival of civilization! History is proof that violence cures nothing -- it only breeds more violence, never peace or harmony, so surely it is time that we ask not only why hatred and hostility abound, but how we can overcome this. This book lets us know why we MUST heal those wounds of the spirit that lead to inhuman ways of treating each other and shows that the pathway to this is through the soul, through love replacing the self-perpetuating hatred born of vengefulness. Except for the visionaries such as Lauren Tratar, we are slow to recognize and slower still to accept the need for change. It takes something as powerful as 9/11 to jar us from apathy into committed action to making a &quot;better world.&quot; Bravo to this author for her wise and spiritually sound suggestions for how we can -- and why we MUST! -- create that world."},{"Title":"September 11: A Case for the Higher Purpose","review":"This is a book that bestows great comfort and helps the reader to \\"make sense\\" out of what appears such a senseless tragedy.

Buy all three and hold lots of book discussions, and then go out and make little changes, ones that will grow into big changes.While this book works with passages and segments that are brought together from other thinkers, it is a very good synopsis of all \\"that day\\" must mean to all of us if we are to heal within and without.

As she points out, we can no longer afford the luxury of relinquishing personal responsibility for the thoughts and words that we transmit to the world. Reminding us that our thoughts shape our reality, Ms. Tratar also provides great hope for the future. If 9/11 truly is a &quot;wake-up call,&quot; anyone who reads this book with an open mind, will be encouraged to view their own life from a more enlightened perspective.

The book starts out a little slow but grabs your attention little by little and at least by a third of the way through I wanted to read ahead for the next class. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I love this book. I read it in a world women's literature class in undergrad. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Like the well-known Austen plot of a parentless young girl negotiating her way into the wider world of adulthood, Burney's novel follows Evelina as she leave her secluded country life for the cunning and manipulative world of eighteenth-century London society. Austen obviously drew great inspiration from Burney's host of amusing, despicable and/or outlandish characters, but she toned down Burney's burlesque style, using a subtler, more subversive voice to critique her society. Although Burney's novel lacks the polish and sparkle of an Austen novel, it is well worth reading for its comic characters, interesting plot turns and compelling narrative voice. Of course the ending is predictable and like Austen, it pairs everyone off neatly and succinctly, but that is not without revealing the many dangers and difficulties for young women in a patriarchal society along the way. Although the beautiful Evelina appears to have every eligible bachelor falling at her feet, she is coerced from all angles into following other peoples desires for her future.The claustrophobia of Evelina's position highlights the lack of autonomy for women in the eighteenth-century and the worth Burney invested in her female character's morals and perception, signalled the beginning of a female writing tradition that attempted to subtly elevate the moral status and intelligence of women to that of their male counterparts, through literature. An important novel for anyone interested in Austen or in a female writing tradition, it offers an interesting portrayal of eighteenth-century society from a female perspective."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I haven't finished yet but this is one of the funniest laugh-out-loud novels I've read in ages. What could be better than \\"proper society types\\" being rude to each other? Plus it's a pretty good depiction of London at the time, as far as theater, museums, and things to do. Looking forward to the rest!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Reading that Burney was influential in the life of Austen made her more interesting to read. Evelina, written of life in the 18th century, lacks depth of characters which Austen mastered beautifully. Yet, the epistolary form which Burney used added delight to the read.In modern day, Evelina and the women surrounding her would infuriate most females one knows. Some of the prissy behaviors seemed contrived. The revelry of the men gave the impression that the males of the time were soft headed, careless and foppish.Some of the rules and behaviors surprised me as the note that Lord Orville sends Evelina which makes her fly out of London in a tizzy. It seemed harmless, yet Burney intimates that it was not to be done at her time.On the whole it was an enjoyable read and made me want to look further into her writing."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I very personal in depth view to the life and times of a charming young girl coming in to her own in the 1700's. The Story of the Author as well as our heroine, Evelina are unforgettable. The kind of book to go back and re-visit again and again. A true treasure!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"So what is to like, it was good and funny, but at the same time, it is like sitting through a (modern day) soap opera when I thought myself as living in the dark ages on feminism. Such stuff exist, and it was strange to have a relationship with a book years after. Granted, it was not something written by a grown woman, but the ideas are there for every female or want to be female 20s. I tend to think the author might hold a tinge of regret over the treatment of women in general, but in general, kept the character down to earth and surrounded with domestics things. There are not overly dwelling on particular feelings explored when a person passes through high school in Western Society, but the idea of seeing which type of women could survive is very real and very cold, to myself at the time. It is also very real and somehow really french, the idea on Western men think of women wrestling each other, but also distinctly Chinese in origin to myself. Particularly, when it is written by LaoTze and every other other philosopher life is challenging or made so by the women or the ignoble soul. Either way, the trials faced by the young women in the books are nothing to laugh off, but the young \\"heroine\\" is made to feel worse to read. The passages are brutal about every actions person and there are not really kind treatment towards the more feminist set of men, who may be homosexuals but not clearly said. In the end, it is about love being there, always, but being able to treat life kindly and truly kind to the wounds sprayed by others and self at the same time. There maybe versions online to read, but the hardcover is what I read for high school and college as part of refreshing my written english, and it is part of English literature class reading list."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"This is a wonderfully funny and interesting read.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"The mention of Ms. Burney in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey is what originally drew me to this book and it has, without a doubt, become a personal favorite.Evelina is our heroine, sent to town by her guardian to enter society. Her guardian, who raised her after her mother faced an unfortunate early demise, is a country parson. Evelina's father, of noble blood, is guilty of denying his legal marriage to her mother and essentially putting her out on the streets, and has refused to acknowledge or support Evelina through the years. She has now grown to a great beauty and has been raised with a very innocent and gentle disposition.When thrown into the midst of a worldly London society, she faces one embarrassing circumstance after another. Surrounded by nothing less than idiots, she is faced with many situations which require wisdom and guts. Not unlike Bridget Jones's Diary, Evelina's story is told through letters, which may make this period novel easier to read for some, but may also at times be confusing if you forget who is writing to whom. This letter format can also seem unrealistic at moments but is forgiven as easily as we forgive some of the unrealistic format of &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;. Another note, there are so many passes in this book that singletons could almost use it as a field guide to the world of men.There are some twists throughout to keep your mind turning and your heart flying and sinking. At times, this lighthearted novel is incredibly moving (i.e. Evelina's reunion with her father)and of course, the ending is sweet and satisfying.Overall, Jane Austen's inspiration is a marvelous, lovely, and surprisingly modern read."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Fanny Burney was a big influence on Jane Austen, but she has significant differences. Burney was an urban sophisticate, sexually aware, and with a taste for slapstick humor--and far less sentimental.The beginning of Evelina is a little hard to get through, but once the title character appears it will have been worth it. Evelina is a country girl who comes to the big city and makes every possible faux pas. Along the way she faces near incest, a bitch of a grandmother, other embarrassing relatives, near rape, clinging prostitutes, and a mischievous monkey. The book is full of unforgettable scenes that stick with you long after you close the cover.But for all the humor, the book is also moving as Evelina it traces Evelina's moral growth."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"As part of a group read, I picked up a week late&quot;Evelina&quot; from my local library. I wasn't quite sure whatto expect - certainly this would be no Tom Jones, but it wouldn't be Austen either - however what I found was a pleasant epistolary jaunt through a young girl's first season out. A jaunt, which, although begun a week late was quickly finished two weeks early! Customary to 18th century novels, Evelina's history is somewhat romantic, both her guardian and the hero impossibly good (a refreshing novelty, if a little sappy in places. They were apparently active members in the Mutual Admiration Society), and the secondary characters ridiculously vulgar. As Burney's first novel, the work shows some awkwardness in construction, but is otherwise excellent. Readers of modern romances may find the heros a bit formal, and fans of Jane Austen may find the epistlotary form unbelievable, but both they and lovers of historical fiction would do well to invest in this book, which provides an excellent glance into the end of an era, and one charming heroine's attempt to muddle through it. END"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"When I heard that Jane Austen read the novels of Fanny Burney, I had to see what could inspire the genius behind &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.Burney does a wonderful job in dispelling the myth that there ever was a time called &quot;the good old days&quot;. Immorality, bigotry, and sexual hijinks were just as prevalent then as they are now (it was just better written back then!)Evelina, the pure and morally upright heroine of the piece, writes about her &quot;coming out&quot; period in London Society. Having grown up in the pastoral seclusion of Berry Hill, Evelina must defend her virtue against a cast of characters as amoral, vapid and ridiculous as any in modern Soapland.There are raves (minus the drugs); acts of racism; narrowly averted incest (and, subsequently, a whole passel of long-lost relatives who come out of the woodwork); encounters with prostitutes; more come-ons than you could tally at a frat party; and even an indirect comment on transvestitism. Through it all, Evelina's behavior goes from sweet refusals, moral outrage, to nearly having a fit of vapors.However, she isn't completely bereft of allies. There are Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, two gentle creatures who serve in contrast to the drunken buffoonery of the patriarch, Captain Mirvan. Then there is Mrs. Selwyn, the epitome of all that an Eighteenth Century lady was NOT supposed to be--intelligent, wry, outspoken, and possessed of a rapier-like sense of humor.Of course, there's the hero (whom I won't mention because he makes himself pretty well known early on).While the writing is not nearly as tight as Austen's, Burney does a great job in styling each piece of correspondese into a mini-vignette of Society's shallowness and vulgarity.In all, a very fun little book."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Like another reviewer, I too was introduced to \\"Evelina\\" through a college course. Naturally I recommend this book to those who enjoy the novels of Jane Austen, though I'd imagine her fans would already be familiar with Burney since she was Austen's predecessor and inspiration. But specifically, as a male reader, I'd like to point out what men could gain from reading a novel about \\"a Young Lady's Entrance into the World.\\"First, the novel is written as a collection of letters--mostly Evelina's, though we do get to read many of the replies--which allows us to experience the story through the mind of a young woman in a personal, intimate way. Male readers, both in Burney's time and ours, are given a vivid picture of how women experienced the social world of eighteenth-century England. I must admit that at several points in the novel I was embarassed to witness things I have said and done to \\"court\\" a woman today done pretty much the same way toward Evelina--and realized how ridiculous it looks from the other end. The experience has been educational, to say the least.Secondly, the plot is well-developed and keeps your interest throughout. The two big mysteries of the novel are whether Evelina will be officially acknowledged by her biological father and be reunited with him (he refused to raise her, and her mother died during childbirth), and which of her suitors she will end up with. A note on the two principal suitors: one could be seen as Burney's picture of a man who knows how to treat women right, and the other is quite the opposite. I certainly learned much from both examples.Thirdly, Burney was one intellectually sharp lady and no man should think this novel is a sappy romance. Far from it. Her exposure of the hypocrisy and contradictions of society are cleverly woven throughout the novel, though of course with careful subtlety since as a female author she was in a vulnerable position (she wrote in secret and didn't even tell her father, with whom she was very close, that she had the book published until well after the fact).Lastly, the book is just one damn good read. Burney has a wonderful mastery of language and characterization, and everything sparkles with life and vigor.I'm hesitant to give anything a full score; but this novel not only hooked for me for days but made me want to move onto Burney's other novels, such as \\"Cecilia,\\" \\"Camilla,\\" and \\"The Wanderer.\\" In short, Frances Burney is one of the great British writers and deserves a place on every bookshelf as one of the founding mothers of the English novel. Her first book \\"Evelina\\" is the perfect place to begin enjoying her work."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Francis Burney was a favorite author of Jane Austen's, and in Evelina we see Burney's sly wit and sharp eye for the ridiculous in her society (and ours!). The novel is about a shy young girl's first visit to London society in the 1780s. In the background is the fact that her mother's first exposure to society went horribly wrong, leaving Evelina orphaned and penniless. As Evelina moves throughout high and low life in the capital, she learns the difference between snobbery and good manners, opportunism and personal honor, and selfishness and love. Will she be acknowledged by her absentee father? Will she escape her embarrassing cousins? Will she elude the seductive Sir Clement or catch the eye of dashing Lord Orville? This is a funny, touching, satisfying read. It will make you squirm with embarrassment, laugh out loud, and cheer."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"EVELINA by Fanny Burney was an immensely popular novel in its day (1778). Published as an epistolary novel, it built upon the tradition of Richardson and Fielding, both of whom wrote of their respective heroes learning to make their way into a hostile world to make their mark. The world as Fanny saw it was one inhabited exclusively by the upper middle class and full of rules that strictly delineated one's place on the social pecking order. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's relentless focus on formal balls, flouncy bouncy dresses, and quests for marriage with suitably wealthy men will feel quite at home with Fanny. However, where Austen would have Elizabeth Bennett question the propriety of one rule or another, Fanny would have Evelina accept the underlying ideology that upheld the legitimacy of the heavy-handed patriarchy. As Evelina leaves the security of the home of Reverend Villars, who cares for her as his ward, she learns that she may be the daughter of the wealthy and high-born Sir John Belmont. At the beginning of the novel, as at the end, Evelina is the pure innocent. If one denies her flatness of character, it is only because her goodness is heavily diluted with a priggish sense of righteousness. The bulk of the book lies in her quest to find her identity, but the enduring appeal lies in the satiric peeks and pokes that Fanny Burney took along the way. With the exception of the Reverend Villars, nearly everyone else is flawed to one degree. Madam Duval, Evelina's grandmother, is a perpetual victim of ridicule by others, which goes a long way toward explaining her odious character. Her biological father, Sir John, is a pompous oaf who acknowledges his kinship only after he has no choice but to do so. Lord Orville, whom Evelina eventually marries as the supposed hero, is about as full of life as Evelina is of any trait other than her annoying goodness. The lessons that Evelina learns about life from the start to finish are superficial. She learns only how to move about in circles sufficiently well enough to climb that social ladder. Inwardly, she is more knowledgeable, but hardly wiser. Contemporary readers loved EVELINA because they could see that it was a rich vein of oafs, fools, and prigs, all of whom were ready victims, like Madam Duval, to be taken down a peg or two. Modern readers generally read it for the descriptions of a society that are so tightly wound in social caste that they resemble the nonsense world of the cartoon. There might not be such a big difference between the two after all."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I found Evelina thoroughly enjoyable. Much like a Jane Austen novel in its plot (the heroine faces and overcomes countless difficulties and by doing so matures and moves toward marriage with the hero) Burney's novel has a darker side that Austen doesn't seem to explore. Evelina is often in dire situations in which men make very improper adavances. Because of the manners required of polite young women, she is powerless to extricate herself; yet because she does not extricate herself, her postition as a member of polite society is threatened. The trials and ultimate triumph of Evelina make for a very enjoyable book - one I would strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Fanny Burney had written a novel while still in her teens in which her heroine, Lady Evelyn, makes a journey to Paris and becomes entangled in an unfortunate set of circumstances that end in her death shortly after giving birth to her first child. Lady Belmont, nee Evelyn predicts that she will die soon and asks the noble and compassionate Reverend Villars to take care of her child till its eighteenth year.Fanny Burney burned this novel and years later wrote Evelina which begins on a winter day when the child of Lady Belmont (Evelina) is in her sixteenth year. The Rev. Villars receives the news that Evelina's grandmother, Madame Duval, wishes to have her granddaughter sent to Paris to live with her. During the course of this story Evelina never travels to Paris but she does begin her journey to adulthood.This novel explores the dark side of life but never loses its light-hearted, comical tone. Evelina Anville grows up to resemble her beautiful mother but her beauty which is described as angelic is only a shadow of her great inner beauty. Unfortunately Evelina's physical beauty is the cause of much of the trouble that she encounters in this novel; troubles that first begin in London when she frizzles her hair, puts on a party gown, and goes to her first ball.A few months later while preparing to leave London Evelina writes, &quot;I shall be very glad to quit this town.&quot; She travels back to her native Berry Hill thinking that her problems will go away once she is back home. But she finds that even in Berry Hill - an idealic land of happiness and innocence - her problems have followed her. The Rev. Villars saddened by the change he observes in Evelina states &quot;I see but too plainly, that though Evelina is returned, -- I have lost my child!&quot; And he attempts to end Evelina's distress by prophesying &quot;...doubt not but that time will stand your friend, and all will end well.&quot;Evelina has more adventures before the conclusion of this story. Part of the difficulties she encounters are due to the fact that her background is kept secret. Her father, Sir John Belmont, abandoned his wife and denied ever having been married to her. Evelina lives under a false last name and has all her life been &quot;dependent, even for subsistence&quot; on charity. So, though she is of noble birth she has suffered the indignities of the lower classes. In one of the saddest parts of the book when Evelina reveals her past to the man she loves she describes herself as an &quot;outcast.&quot;This novel is both a fairy tale and a black comedy.Evelina was written in the eighteenth century and is very much a period piece. Part of the charm of this novel is that it is written as a series of letters - all ending with closings like &quot;Your most obedient and most humble servant.&quot; The author's brilliant use of dialogue enlivens the characters. This novel is populated by many fascinating characters ranging from the motherly Rev. Villars, the virago Madame Duval, the sadistic Captain Mirvan, the two-faced Sir Clement Willoughby, the sardonic Mrs. Selwyn, and the noble hero Lord Orville.Like a lively breeze that has survived for over two hundred years this masterpiece remains as fresh and vigorous today as it was when it was first published."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Evelina details the coming of age of a young girl and her introduction into late eighteenth century London society. The entirety of the story is told through a series of letters, generally between Evelina and her father. This epistolary format makes the work very reminiscent of the conduct books which were in vogue in the period and taught young girls how they \`ought' to conduct themselves. Indeed the book may have been regarded as an appetizing format of moral instruction for its readers as it delivers the same message as conduct books but in a more appealing and palatable format.Evelina may be somewhat frustrating to the modern female reader (as I found her at times) due to her tendency to have a bit too much of that \`feminine delicacy' which was all the rage in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. There are many instances when she is \`overcome' and faint of heart or to put it colloquially cannot stand on her own two feet. Evelina whilst endearing, often falls upon the assistance of the eligible (and naturally dashing and good looking) Lord Orville instead of relying on her own intuition, she is certainly no Elizabeth Bennet (from Austen's Pride and Prejudice).When making my way through this novel I sometimes questioned just how innocent Evelina is as her \`delicacy' seems to fade considerably when it comes to interations with her cousins and grandmother, people who she for the most part disowns in favour of a higher class set of acquaintances. It seems to be more socially convenient and indeed attractive for her not to be associated with those who are her real relations. However I am not sure if my contempt for her disregard of her family is the influence of my own contemporary perspective on the novel.I found Evelina to be a nice love story, full of misunderstanding, tender feelings and of course a few scoundrels to be saved from. I am sure to the adept reader, there is probably much more to this novel, I always worry when I am reading books such as Evelina which are from a time so removed from my own, that I am missing huge contextual witticisms or ironies which make the book so much cleverer or give it additional layers of meaning, however, even in the absence of a deeper understanding of the late eighteenth century this is still a good read."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I was very disappointed when I first discovered Jane Austen and quickly devoured all her books. I enjoyed them so much and suddenly, there was nothing new left to read. Some modern authors have tried to write books about her characters, but we're too far away from her world to really capture the wit and nuance of her stories. So I was really excited when I picked up Evelina. The story had all the charm and excitement of the Austen stories - but set in a world so far removed from our own that it's like taking a time travel vacation. I look forward to reading more of Miss Burney's work."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"A wonderful story written in satire of the upperclass life in the 18th century.

I am a big Jane Austen fan, but I have to say this was even more entertaining than my favorite Austen works. I usually read to relax, but this book kept me on the edge of the couch page after page wondering what crazy event would take place next.

I've finished this book with a big smile on my face."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Although not in the class of Jane Austen, the earlier writings of Fanny Burney contributed a great deal to the evolution of the novel. No mere romance, Fanny Burney's Evelina gives us a surprisingly modern heroine--modern both in her proto-feminist awareness of the world and in her \\"mixed\\" character. Evelina is not a paragon, and Burney's writings are neither mere pleasant fantasies of romance, nor cumbersome stories of impossible virtue. Like Richardson, Fanny Burnery was creating something very new in the 18th century: a psychological novel. Unlike Richardson (whose best-loved novel, Clarissa, has been described--by fans of his, mind you!--as \\"That long, still book.\\") Fanny Burney's books withstand the time travel down to our day. Evelina is--thus far, at least!--my favorite of her books."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I have to say that I 'enjoyed' this novel more than I usually enjoy Jane Austen, but in terms of raw literary merit, Austen is probably superior.

This book made me laugh out loud and I was really sorry to finish it!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"If you are wondering whether you would like eighteenth-century novels, this is a good one to try.

It is easy to see why Jane Austen considered Fanny Burney among her favorite authors.

I read Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice this summer and thought I would try Burney since she influenced Austin. It was a good read! That Captain was so incredibly ornery!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Frances Burney's first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine's entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina's innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions--as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Fanny Burney can be considered the mother of most Nineteenth Century woman writers and a great example for all women writers. She manages to combine humour and criticism in such a way that Evelina is both an exemplary novel which exploits the conventions of its time, and a strong criticism of women's condition in eighteenth century society. Evelina is a woman who manages to get her way and expose the vices and virtues of those also great characters who surround her."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I was introduced to Frances Burney via a college course on 18th century literature. I found her longer novels, &quot;Cecilia&quot; and &quot;Camilla&quot; to be very enjoyable; ironically, her most famous work was a bit less so. She has a charming writing style, and has a voice all her own, but it doesn't seem to sparkle as much here. Written completely as a series of letters (the correct term is &quot;epistolary novel&quot;) the story is about a young woman's emergence into society in eighteenth century England. Her encounters with various characters are entertaining and amusing, especially the episodes between Madame Duval and the Captain. However, the novel dips into redundancy when Evelina constantly explains to her beloved guardian, Rev. Villars, about her embarassments. True, this has to do with Burney's intent, but for a modern reader it can grow repetitive. One can see the influence Burney had on Jane Austen's writing. A good read if you are interested in this period, early women writers, or Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"When I read novels from the past, I am often struck by how similar the people are with people today in terms of motivation and character although different in how they think and act. As I read this book, I kept being frustrated at how passive and helpless Evelina was. It's clear that she is not wimpy, but just accepts the reality that she is totally powerless in her society. This book really brings out how corrosive the rules of that society were for both men and women. What is the same in the eighteenth century as in ours is the problem of how people with good manners keep from being run over by people with bad manners without resorting to using bad manners themselves.I enjoyed this book a great deal better than I had expected to. You do have to skim past some real melodrama. But the characters ring true and it makes you think."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Fanny Burney lived from 1752 - 1840. Evelina was the first book she wrote when she was twenty-five. The first publication had to be published under the name of a man before the publishers would look at it, but it didn't take long for Fanny to claim ownership. The book was wildly successful, even though it didn't' make much money for Fanny. She wrote three more books after this one, but none of these really remains readable today. Evelina stands alone in this regard. The book is another one that is written as a series of letters. Evelina is not your usual heroine. She is bashful and somewhat deficient in charm. But she is beautiful and young, and because of this there is a lot of optimism in the novel that things will turn out alright for her. That is why the book is so enjoyable. The reader sees all the difficulties in her path in her quest for a brilliant marriage, but somehow we know she'll make it and things will be OK. This is quite a readable book, and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I thought this was a fabulous novel. When I first got it; I did not imagine it would be very good. That it was done in letters was one of the major thing that discouraged me. However, when I started reading it it was a very good book with an equal amount of drama, romance, suspense and humor. But, my only small disapointment was that in some scenes it repeated itself. Like someone is always falling in love with her, taking her hand, or begging at her feet. It can get a bit annoying. Al in all, however, the ending is very pleasing and happy.The characters are wonderfully done in a way that intently know them. Mrs. Sewlyn, Madame Duval, the Braghtons were all done wonderfully. This is a gret thing to read."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a sweet and sentimental classic. All in all an enjoyable read, but the writing style never dares equal the skill of Jane Austen.It has an interesting plot which, once you get wrapped up in it, is hard to disentangle yourself. Yet, I feel the plot could have been better developed by a more skilled novelist. Due to the fact that the book is written in passive letters (most of them Evalina's), the characters are often flat, and real active emotion is lacking. Several excellent opportunities for dramatic events are glazed over in a \\"re-telling\\".However what the book lacks can be overlooked, and take the tale at its face value: a gentle love story."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Anyone who loves Jane Austen (and don't we all?) will certainly enjoy Fanny Burney's Evelina. Burney is really a precursor of Austen, but has unfortunately been completely overshadowed by the later novelist. In its time (1778) Evelina was a tremendous hit and shy Fanny Burney a celebrated author overnight. She was invited into the literary circle of Samuel Johnson, became a reluctant lady-in-waiting to Queen Charlotte because of her celebrity and at age 41 married a refugee from the French Revolution, thus becoming Madame D'Arblay (check out her interesting diaries). The subtitle of Evelina (The History of A Young Lady's Entrance into the World) says it all: Evelina is an innocent and naive young girl, who suddenly finds herself in unfamiliar London society, surrounded by suitable and not so suitable suitors and a host of other characters. Lots of misunderstandings and perilous situations block Evelina's road, but don't be surprised to find humour and suspense as well, for the continuing question is of course whether Evelina will survive Society unscathed. Even though the pace of a novel more than 2 centuries old may be a bit slow for some, this is something you get used to soon enough: the novel contains far too much life, fun and social commentary too be dull."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"\\"We are the slaves of custom, the dupes of prejudice, and dare not stem the torrent of an opposing world, even though our judgments condemn our compliance!\\"Beautiful Miss Evelina doesn't know just how true her guardian's observations are until she is forced to be right smack in the middle of them. Evelina is a young orphan. Her mother died after giving birth and her father, a French baronet, wants nothing to do with her. And so, she has grown up with a kind reverend, a man who goes out of his way to protect his ward from the cruelties of the world. But when Lady Howard invites Evelina to stay for a short while at Howard Grove, Mr. Villars agrees to let her go. After all, he cannot protect her forever. Sooner or later she will have to get acquainted with the ways of the world. But neither Mr. Villars nor Evelina anticipated the things that occur once she leaves her small Dorchester village. In a series of letters, Evelina gives her guardian a blow by blow of everything that happens. A short in stay in London, requests Lady Howard? Might as well, responds Mr. Villars. In the midst of attending assemblies, the opera, theatres and balls, Evelina becomes the object of admiration among the opposite sex. Among her many suitors are the gentlemanly Lord Orville and the persistent Sir Clement Willoughby. But more pressing matters occur. Her paternal grandmother, Madam Duvall, wants to get close to Evelina. In her acquaintance, she meets some hitherto unknown relatives, the exceedingly vulgar Branghtons, and among them several unwanted suitors. How will Evelina react when Madam Duvall insists on taking her to Paris?First published in 1778, Evelina is a revelation to me. I hadn't heard of this novel or its author -- Frances Burney -- until now. Who would've thought that my city library would contain such hidden treasure? Evelina is a comedy of manners, a satire of fashionable London and the hypocrisies hidden in \\"polite society.\\" I've learned that Jane Austen admired this author. In fact, Burney was a big influence on Austen. You will notice similarities in their writing. (Mr. Darcy springs to mind when you read about Lord Orville's first impressions of Evelina.) Burney, however, is bolder, edgier, more to the point. Irony is big in this novel -- and so is its focus on vulgarity. The bickering between Madam Duvall and Captain Mirvan are hilarious. And the Branghtons are the rudest people in the world. Sir Clement Willoughby is practically a stalker. The carriage incident leaves a bad taste in my mouth. One thing I did not like about this novel is the fact that Evelina seems to gain admiration from every man she encounters. The only thing that keeps them from making a formal marriage proposal is her somewhat ambiguous background. After all, they wouldn't dream of marrying the bastard child of a nobleman! But, of course, that wouldn't stop them from seeking her for other purposes. Like I said, this is a direct attack to the customs and ways of its time. Some might say that Burney's views were ahead of her time. And that is why I love reading classics. It's the genuine article. You don't have to wonder if such and such occurrences were possible during that era like with historical fiction. And that is why these will always have more advantage to me than modern work. This Oxford World's Classics edition contains a glossary. I finally know exactly what a \\"ridotto\\" is. If you've never heard of Fanny Burney, then I suggest you look up this novel. A true Georgian classic, this is more obscure and not nearly as popular as Austen, but it's definitely worth reading. I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I can't begin to say how much I loved this book and how I regret that it had to come to an end. I never though any writer would come close to Jane Austen in my heart, but FB is now on the same playing field. Such a wonderful twisting little tale with a nice surprise ending!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"&quot;Evelina, or The History of a Young Lady's Entrance Into the World&quot; is an entertaining story of a girl's 'coming-out' into society as well as a fascinating record of the genteel and not so genteel diversions of the middle and upper classes in Georgian England. Frances Burney published it anonymously in 1778, setting a precedent for Jane Austen both by this anonymity and by making writing a respectable pastime for women, thus allowing women to turn the novel into a medium of their own. The extent to which writing was considered improper for respectable women during this time is revealed in the author's own life: when Fanny was 15, her stepmother made her burn her writings, which consisted of odes, plays, songs, farces, and poems as well as a story about the character Evelina's mother. And while writing &quot;Evelina,&quot; Fanny had to keep her work private, writing at night and even disguising her handwriting so that it would not be recognized at the printer's, who would certainly have been a man familiar with her father, a renowned music historian.How very fortunate we are that this did not keep her from writing, and how very fortunate too that &quot;Evelina&quot; was so well received by everyone from common readers to Dr. Johnson! Burney continued to write fiction, setting a precedent for Jane Austen and the female novelists of the 19th century, and continuing to entertain her readers.Although I came to &quot;Evelina&quot; with some lamentably negative preconceptions, expecting it to be inferior to Austen and, worst of all, tedious for every purpose but the literary historian's, I have found the book fascinating, fun, and refreshing. The story centers around the eponymous heroine, a beautiful 17-year-old girl who has grown up in the country under the guidance of her parson guardian, Mr. Villars. Her family background is less than spotless. Evelina's mother, pressured by her own vulgar and ill-bred mother into a distasteful marriage, eloped with a highborn rake who subsequently deserted her and burned the proofs of their marriage. Evelina's mother died in misery, leaving an infant daughter unclaimed by her own father.Evelina grows up provincially, and when an unprecedented series of events brings her into London with some friends, away from the company of her guardian Mr. Villars, she is launched into an unfamiliar world of dances, balls, operas, and outings. Evelina, though uncertain and uncomfortable in this new and flashy world, is not merely na?ve, but a young woman of understanding and feeling, so that it's a pleasure to read what she thinks of the places and people she sees. As a modern reader, I loved to encounter references to the places where people would enjoy themselves in Georgian London, like Vauxhall Gardens and museums of mechanical curios.Evelina has the misfortune to become acquainted with many vulgar and persistent personalities, some of the most repulsive of whom are her very own relatives, like her grandmother Madame Duval. This is the very same embarrassing and insensitive figure who tried to bully her own daughter (Evelina's mother) into an unwanted marriage years before, who suddenly wants to become reconciled with Evelina and foist from the girl's father an acknowledgement of her position-as well as a hefty estate. On top of Madame Duval, there are Evelina's lowly cousins, the Branghtons, who live in the commercial area of London (gasp!), and even a repulsive and shameless suitor that plagues the poor young woman to no end. Oh yes, there's also the xenophobic and graceless Captain Mirvan, father of Evelina's friend, who enjoys nothing more than tormenting Madame Duval (often brutally); and the satirical and witty Mrs. Selwyn, one of the best characters in the book, who always has something pertinent to say to the fops and fools around Evelina -- and even to Evelina herselfBut it's not that poor Evelina has only the troubles and setbacks of relatives and rude acquaintances. Since this is a comedy of manners, one of its ends is, like in Austen's books, marriage. The relationship between Evelina and her love interest is very interesting and sweet, and one can see the way that Evelina grows and develops as a character. I won't spoil the story anymore; I will only add that there are some other interesting subplots along the way, one of which deals with a mysterious and depressed Scotsman, so the story in no way merely hinges on marriage.I would recommend &quot;Evelina&quot; to anyone, but most especially to those who consider themselves fans of Jane Austen, or who are at least patient with unfamiliar styles of writing. It is an epistolary novel, a kind that was very popular in the 18th century, meaning it is written in a series of letters between the characters. This takes a little bit of acclimatizing to enjoy thoroughly, but I found that after I was about 20 pages in, it came naturally, and became, for all practical purposes, a first person narrative from the engaging point-of-view of a pleasant young heroine to whom I could relate, with her candor and good breeding. Whenever I was unfamiliar with some of the details of late 18th-century life, my Signet edition of the book provided some helpful footnotes. And I must say that Burney's writing style really grows on me. Like the best 18th century writing, it has an elegance and beautifully organized lucidity that is such a pleasure to read after the postmodern crap modern authors churn out. Furthermore, Burney uses paragraphs like a modern, so you don't have to plod through long dreary passages or unbearable run-on sentences."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"This story, although seeming to take the shape of a soap opera with the many twists and turns of society, was spellbinding in its wonderful protrayal of decorum under usually wild circumstances. The young Evelina is thrust into society and into the hands of wolves, mostly because she is so beautiful. The most wonderful thing about her is NOT her beauty, but her elegant and ignomious education and charm. She a beauty to the core and always wishing to do the right thing. To share her difficulties is almost heart wrenching. To share her delight is heart warming. Evelina will steal your heart as she did Lord Orville's. Wait and see."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Evelina, Frances Burney's first novel, was a best-seller in the 18th century and an important precursor to the romance genre. Evelina was a demure girl with a noble but complicated background brought up in the country by a kindly Reverend Villars. The story, told through a series of letters, evolves around her introduction into London society.Burney's fame being quite buried in modern times, I didn't know what to expect at first. But I was pleasantly surprised by her refreshing style and good humor. Of course, our heroine is a dazzlingly beautiful ing&eacute;nue with the cutest ignorance of social convention, and by the appearance of the nth ardent admirer, this reader started to feel impatient. Fortunately, the epistolary form helped curb further annoyance; as most letters were written by Evelina herself to Mr. Villars, her maiden modesty saved readers from excessive praise of the heroine. It is true that all characters were two-dimensional, but Evelina was such a sweet girl, and Lord Orville was such a nice gentleman, that the reader can only smile upon them with an understanding indulgence. And Lord Orville's early comment of Evelina being \\"a poor weak girl\\" sets a shining example for his famous successor in Pride and Prejudice.The story was well-paced and flowed with ease, proving the strength of Burney's literary muscles. Despite writing light, she was able to embed witty social satire into the story. You get humorous caricatures of various human archetypes universal to any society, all mixed together with good chemistry: the ugly fop, the vulgar captain, the cunning rake, the embarrassing relatives... Burney knew the world. I was surprised by how daring she was in incorporating some \\"shocking\\" elements and how she managed to accomplish it without feeling out of place. Evelina certainly went through much crazier adventures than Elizabeth Bennet or other romantic heroines: a near-rape, a frightful robbery, a lone encounter with rascals and \\"indecent women\\"... all went to show how helpless a young lady was back then. Evelina displayed endearing mental independence for her age, but Burney was wise enough not to go overboard - the girl did make social blunders, show unconscious signs of infatuation, and suffer coming-of-age confusion. The ending wrapped up loose strings neatly and our heroine lived happily ever after, but you knew all along everything will be okay, right?All in all, Evelina is an effortless delight that deserves wider popularity. I wonder why there has been no screen adaption of this charming novel."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The book is in epistolary form, in letters. Evelina encounters the social nuances and emotional changes that a young lady experiences in being first introduced to London society. She makes some mistakes as a naive lady would. Surprisingly, her views on what she sees whether \\"coarse\\" or \\"correct\\" reveals her to be astute in most ways. The moral tone of her guardian Mr. Anville seemed stifling at times, but I could not help but give him justice since Evelina herself respected him so much. Evelina is not without suitors, of course, since she is described to be very lovely, but I will not spoil it for anyone...happy ending. Watch out for Madame Duval and the Captain, two characters that I have not come across before. They provide both the \\"coarseness\\" and if you read beyond their un-genteel talk, you may find some value. Some parts were very funny, a twisted sense of humor helps; especially with that primate at the end...I did not know whether to laugh forever or be angry! Read this."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Maybe debutante isn't the best way to sterotype Evelina, but she is a young, but very sensible girl leaving her country home for the first time. She arrives in London and thus, begins the terribly entertaining story of her adventures. She meets many people, most of who misunderstand her country ways, goes to operas and to dances. She is soon declared the most beautiful of all the ladies. She causes a bit of a stir everywhere she goes. She doesn't like this attention and is very annoyed with the men who stalk her. This is a tale of coming of age, of silly London society, of love, and a little mystery. I am very sad that this is among the long list of forgotten classics."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"i looked for and bought this book, because i read somewhere that Frances Burney was the author that chiefly influenced Jane Austen's writing. indeed i found this to be true while i was reading. but, on top of it all, i loved this book even more than Jane Austen's, if it is possible.first of all it is all written in form of letters, so there was little or no tiresome (for me) description of places, etc. second, it was so sweetly and passionately romantic, that it surpassed even Elisabeth and Darcy's story! (in some ways only, of course. there can be no other mrDarcy). it was also full of satire, humour, adventure, damsels in distress being rescued.... everything you expect from a modern historical novel, sprinkled with subtle social criticism and filled with the most realistic sparkling characters. i didn't want it to end, but thankfully, i can reread it as many times i want (and i will).for a while, after finishing this book, everything else i tried to read seemed insipid. if you read it, i hope you'll see what i mean.p.s. the explanatory notes at the back of this edition were really helpfull,too."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Just a delight from beginning to end. Burney was one of the first professional writers--pre-dating Austen, who modeled \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" on Evalina. Evalina has more raw attraction and the social criticism is sharper. And funnier when Evalina is constantly driven off course in her romance. This book is about two generations before the Victorians, who tried to push the sex genie back in the bottle by erecting churches, registering prostitutes and punishing them for venereal diseases, sodomy laws, etc. This book is set in a freer, more sexual time--closer to 2009 than 1880 in spirit. Evalina is much closer to Tristam Shandy than to Dickens. And funny. You'll like it. Evalina is long, but it keeps up the pace with incident after incident that can crack you up. It would make a lovely funny Merchant Ivory-type movie. Lord Orville is a hunk!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time.

Evelina was a silly and mindless heroine I could not become interested in, much less in her quest for marriage. I was tired, by page 20, of hearing how beautiful she was. Stay away from this book."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Evelina is a great romp through London society and the manners and mores of the late 18th century. The characters are well developed, but may be a little pale compared to real life (not much, but a little)(although some may not believe this, I suggest &quot;Memoirs of a Georgian Rake&quot; by William Hickey as a reference for the times, places and characters (and humour) of Evelina).At one time I was going to give only 4 stars for Evelina, as I thought the ending felt tacked on. But on reflection, (and reading Hickey again) I think that her introduction as a Lady into society - by watching a monkey chewing a fop's ear while members of the Ton are betting on it's outcome - is so apt, it's priceless."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"Like Jane Austen, this book is filled with detail about the period--late 18th century England. The language is much the same as Jane Austen, though the plot and characters are slightly more lively. The details about London life at the time are fascinating. The introduction says the J.A. was a fan of Frances Burney, which is apparent. I highly recommend this book to J.A. fans."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I liked this book for the most part. I liked the romance and the story, and how it all came together in the end was very interesting; but some of the characters were annoying, and why could these people not just say what they were thinking, especially Evelina. It was annoying that every man that saw her fell madly in love with her, and many of the situations made me cringe."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I got thrown off in the beginning because I had never read this book before and didn't know that in was in an epistolary form. Other than that, it was amazing! I haven't laughed from a book in such a long time, it was really great. The jokes Captain Mirvan plays and all of the things that happen in the book up until the very end just make it a great read. It's a bit long for most people, but definitely worth it!"},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"This is a Kindle book and consequently was cheap enough to read just for the curiosity of finding out how exactly Jane Austen was influenced by Fanny Burney. It really does have many of the plot lines Jane Austen has used, but with a very different style of writing. Fanny Burney puts her heroines in much more difficult positions than J. Austen ever did, and their predicaments have a very strong bent toward coercion by the people in the plot. Fanny has a tendency to put more people from different social stratas in the plot line and then puts them in conflict with each other. The book is well worth reading if you enjoy Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"16-year-old Evelina Anville doesn't have a clue as to how late 18th century London works, but she's about to. Raised by the Reverend Villars after her mother died during childbirth and her noble father abandoned her, Evelina has been brought up in the countryside as a fine young woman and is as \\"innocent as an angel and artless as purity itself\\". Villars has seen to her education and to social connections with the local nobility. Anville is not Evelina's real last name. In fact, she is the daughter of Lord Belmont, a wealthy lord who eloped with her mother 16 years prior. Being a bit of a rake, he had primarily married Evelina's mom for her fortune. But when Evelina's grandmother found out about the elopement, she promptly disinherited Evelina's mother. Belmont, seeing his greed foiled, tore up the marriage certificate and subsequently denied ever being married to her! Letters have been written to Belmont about Evelina but he has never responded. Villars has raised Evelina as his own daughter and given her a good education and also serves as her best friend.Lady Howard, the martriarch of the Mirvan family that lives near the Villars home invites Evelina to come with her and her family to London for a stay of around 2-3 months. Villars is torn between knowing that Evelina needs to see the world and meet other people besides himself and the need to protect her. He is worried that once she samples all the fine things of the city, she will never be satisfied with the simple life she leads with him. He also knows the kind of con artists, rakes, and money chasers that reside in London, and worries about her falling into corruption like her mother. Nevertheless, he accedes to the request, mostly because he knows Evelina wants to go.In London, she enters an entirely new world of balls, promenades, parks, operas, and other amusements that almost overwhelm her. She is also approached by buffoons, libertines, and other less than scrupulous characters looking to seduce her. She does meet a guy she's interested in, the much older Lord Orville. Even though she's attracted to him she hears that he doesn't have much opinion of her, probably seeing as how she gets tongue tied everytime he addresses her directly. Evelina is afraid he must think her quite the foolish little girl. One of his acquaintances, Sir Clement Willoughby, on the other hand, seems QUITE interested in Evelina, even to the point of putting her in compromising situations.Things get more complicated as Evelina's grandmother, Ms. Duval, arrives in a surprise visit from France to take Evelina back to the Continent, even though Evelina doesn't want to go. It doesn't help matters that Mrs. Mirvan's husband, Captain Mirvan, being a miltary man, absolutely HATES French people! The Captain spends most of his time figuring out how to make Ms. Duval angry, whether with his words, or through practical jokes. He finds Sir Clement an able accomplice in his fun and games.When I think about this book, I am just amazed that a 16-year-old girl had to go thru these experiences back then. This book was first published in 1778, so I'm sure the average life expectancy was in the 40s so people married a lot younger. While the Mirvan family helps her and serves as a kind of buffer between Evelina and London, it doesn't seem like they put all their heart into protecting her from cads like Willoughby or even of Ms. Duval, who has a violent temper when crossed. But really, I guess Duval does have the law behind her since she is the legal guardian even though she has never even met Evelina. Villars and the Mirvans probably know that the only way Evelina can gain the knowledge on how to deal with this milieu is to experience it and learn the hard way.Evelina is living on the edge almost the entire novel, because, in reality, she has no prospects or money of her own. She has been living a lie by taking the name Anville. Everyone in London just assumes she has money since she's hanging out with the Mirvans, but really she is freeloading off them. No man of means would even look at her if they knew that truth. Ms. Duval promises to make her the heir to her sizable estate, but only on condition that Evelina says \\"yes\\" to all her commands, starting with moving to France. So Evelina is always worried about being exposed to the nobility as a fraud. She also has to make her way quite catiously in order to have some freewill without upsetting her grandmother too much.One of the coolest aspects of the novel was the grand tour we get of London in 1778. Evelina and her group visit most of the major attractions of the time, most of which no longer exist. You really get the ambiance of the city in this work.Seeing these characters interact, you also get a feel for how rich people thought back in those times. There's a scene in the book where two nobles want to race their carriages against each other and bet money on the winner. After being persuaded by another character that it would be too dangerous, they decide to recruit 2 old women off the street to run a footrace against each other to settle the bet. Yeah, this is how rich people think. Actually, this is STILL how rich people think. That one scene made me decide how to vote in this year's presidential election. It was really bizarre. When these two women raced, none of the characters, even Evelina, or the supposedly moral Lord Orville, raised much of an objection. The common people of London are pretty much a non-factor in this novel. I do find strains of Dickens in Burney though. Mostly in its comedy. Even though Evelina might seem familiar as a Jane Austen type tale, Burney is so much funnier than Austen.An overall entertaining work and a special treat for those interested in London's history."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"This book is charming and sexy.

Evelina turned out to be a satisfying read both for the sake of entertainment and as a comentary on the times. Even more so than Miss Austen, Miss Burney uses her wit to comment on the complicated and, at times, ridiculous manners of the times. Evelina herself stands out in stark contrast to the artificiality and shallowness around her."},{"Title":"Evelina","review":"I have read a great deal of literature from this time period, and this rises above a large majority of them as one of my favorites. Burney's style is refreshing and flows beautifully, and the ease of transition between the letters do not encumber the plot. Evelina herself and both charming and enchanting. Sometimes I really wanted her to just stand up for herself, but the way Burney sticks to her characterization shows a real maturity of writing.I can see a lot of Fanny from Austen's Mansfield Park in Evelina, although Burney's character is much less whiney and insipid.This is truly a classic love story as well as a beautifully crafted look into aristocratic England during the time period. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Workbook : Study Guide for The GodSelf","review":"This book helped me go deeper into the Godself Book.

It is quite wonderful, even better than I had thought. With our present level of frankness on the web it is interesting to look back at the seminal works that forged our rights to free speech, freer than our parents wanted us to have.This play is no longer in print. Publishing is driven by marketing people, bean counters as I think of them. What can we do, the bean counter asks, to make this product more marketable? This is not a literary question. Management by MBAs is not very satisfactory to the needs of art and free speech. Popular mediocrity is the standard of the present.

The two characters in the play are Billy the Kid - fabled outlaw of American folklore - &amp; Jean Harlow - cinema star &amp; uber-Marilyn Monroe. The entire play I gather is a meeting between these two in the blue velvet Eternity. Eternity like where Jack &amp; Rose meet in the end of Titanic (&amp; the boat sinks for those who haven't seen it). This play is just sort of conversation like &amp; not to pretentious like you might imagine the blue velvet Eternity to be.

I recommend reading the book, it transports you into another world for a few hours :)"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"SO- if you're any kind of Sci Fi nerd, as I am, you know this story. I mean, KNOW this story. Not only have you read the book, you've seen the old movie starring Rod Taylor and you've also seen that glowy, gadgety, steam punky, levered, whirling time machine guest star on a recent TV show which shall remain nameless, because it's become a fixture in nerd culture worldwide.But here's a recap in case you aren't as aware of it: Around the turn of the century, a guy makes a time machine. He travels to the distant future and makes it back with a story to tell. Apparently in the future the human race has evolved into two sub-species: The shiny, happy Eloi who live above the ground with nothing to do but eat, play and indolently make love. Below ground it is a different story. Hairy, with subterranean eyes accustomed to the dark, the Morlocks are a brutish, threatening lot which the traveler surmises descended from the lower class of people who's jobs it were to \\"get their hands dirty\\", i.e. the laborers of our culture. (Not as much a point for Socialism as I guess Wells intended as coming off slightly snotty and academically elitist.)Because he's sure the Morlocks are treating the Eloi as cattle on which to feed, and partly I'd say because he had taken the lovely Eloi, Weena, to bed, the traveler decides to take it on himself to smoke the Morlocks out of their subterranean homes. Plus... they had his Time Machine. His plan works beyond his imaginations and when waking the next day, he finds his Time Machine- all set up like bait in a trap. But he knows something the Morlocks do not- he can escape the trap with ease. And escape he does- but not without a tense confrontation with the white haired, red-eyed creatures.Farther into the future he goes, watching the sun grow red and huge and then wane, till only darkness and stars permanently fill the skies. And then he comes home- to the exact moment he left- a little distance away, because, after all, the Morlocks had moved his machine, and though time had changed, distance had not.The end of the tale leaves those listening, not believing a word of the travelers supposed flight of fancy- but one friend comes back days later because he's just not sure. He of course sees the traveler disappear in his machine. He's still waiting for the his return.The story doesn't really get good till about the time the scary Morlocks show up... but, quite honestly, the tiny smooth-skinned Eloi creep me out more. With scientific touches- classic to his stories- H. G. Wells plays a game of \\"what if?\\" with the future that still feels unique even as it spawned an entire genre and thousands of similar stories. I wish Wells had a time machine to take him to today so he could see how beloved his stories were and still remain. I wonder if he would have changed his future world to be a little more happier, a little less dystopian? Then again, maybe not- he seemed to have been an excellent judge of human nature, if misguided by what would fix it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is one of the few books by H. G. Wells that I actually liked. Most of his novels aren't as....shall I say, daring? In his other sci-fi stories, the plots just don't seem to really take you off the edge of your seat. This novel does. Full of drama and action, it really almost freaks you out. (Unlike most classics, save Jules Verne) I'm a teenager, and I've read a lot of Ted Dekker thrillers; this novel has ALMOST the same amount of suspense, not thrill. The descriptions were clear, but not too deep (as in James Fenimore Cooper). I reccommend this book ESPECIALLY for fans of Jules Verne, like myself."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Having read this book years ago, I decided to have this book read itself to me.

I have decided to \\"read\\" more free Kindle classics this way -- books I've been putting off for years!As the Product Information section revealed, this was H. G. Wells first published novel. As a debut novel, it is quite impressive. The story has been told and retold in these reviews, so no need to repeat them. I looked at the 1 and 2 Star reviews out of curiosity. Oddly enough, there are a lot bad \\"kids reviews\\" for this book. My guess is they saw the movie and didn't think the \\"novelization\\" lived up to the thrilling action sequences in the movie.

The Traveler creates a time machine and has a number of his equally unnamed friends (The Editor, The Medical Man, and so on) come over a few days after showing them a miniature model of his time machine to prove that he actually can travel in time. One of these is the unnamed narrator, who is writing down all that the Traveler is saying. I like to think this person is Wells himself, but that's just me and my idealistic nature.It turns out the Time Traveler goes forward to the year 802,701 AD. Yeah. That's really far in the future. There he finds the fair and small Eloi, who live in a seemingly perfect world without disease. However, they fear the dark -- and rightly so. The other race living at that time are the subterranean Morlocks. When the Traveler's machine goes missing, he is forced to realize some dystopian-esque ideas about human nature as well as figure out the secrets the Eloi's world holds.I really loved this little novella, and it was the perfect sized book to read on an iPhone. For people who don't read books with larger vocabulary words (AKA: not literary fiction, classics, or required college reading), you might have some difficulty. Keep that in mind if you're looking to read this for entertainment on the Twilight or Harry Potter level -- you will find the reading level very hard to get over.Pacing is also an issue. For being so short a story, Wells tends to ramble in length on about things that, really, are of no importance to the story, though they add a certain depth to the dystopian reality. Still, certain moments are misleading. More than once I found myself thinking the story would go one way and then it'd make a U-turn in a totally opposite direction -- which was fine enough once I adjusted, but it might be something a different person might struggle to overcome in order to enjoy the novella.All in all, I'd gladly give this 4 out of 5 stars. Being a classic, it's worth the read, despite some language differences and pacing issues."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Length:: 0:56 Mins"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is a classic .

Wells is a classic science fiction/fantasy novel. It is based in England around the late 1800's and also thousands of years into the future. It is an epic tale of a journey through time. Every one of the Time Traveler's friends and colleagues doubted him. They didn't believe that he had gone into the future. But he did. He visited a gentle breed called the Eloi. They were all alike. They dressed the same, walked the same, looked the same, and even reacted to life's conflicts in the same way. These identical \\"people\\" served him gratefully, giving him all the fruit he could ever want. He tried to learn the Eloi language, but their short attention spans caused him to not learn very much. The Time Traveler began to dream as to why this race of people was so alike. He couldn't figure it out. He decided that he had found himself in a utopian society, where neither reason nor strength was needed. He didn't find the real reason out, until he had discovered his time machine to be missing. Night fell and all he could do was search. When he found it he also discovered a horrifying secret about the reason as to why the Eloi were so perfect. It was a terrible secret, one that you will only know if you read this book. Believe me, it's quite a twist. All in all, I would have to recommend this book to anyone. It has elements of every genre in it: horror, science fiction, fantasy, drama, and comedy. It is just a really well rounded book that all can enjoy."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine, by H.G. Wells is an unconventional book, which is both intriguing and entertaining. When I read the book I expected a short novel about various insignificant complications of time travel, but was given a tale full of theories and speculations about the evolution of human beings.In The Time Machine the time traveler is recounting his adventure into the unknown that we call the future. Thousands of years in the future he discovers that the human race has evolved into two different kinds, the Morlocks and the Eloi. The Morlocks are nocturnal creatures who live underground and surface during the night, only to prey on the defenseless Eloi. The Eloi, once living comfortably as the ruling race, have degenerated into a simple group of beings that live life effortlessly and without substance. The time traveler describes his interactions with the Morlocks and the Eloi in a thought-provoking manner, creating a highly enjoyable novel.The Time Machine suggests many controversial ideas such as the extreme degeneration of the human race. Not only is it interesting to learn Wells' theories, but his writing caused me to create some of my own thoughts about the possibility of evolution. The open ending to the book also leaves a story for the mind to explore. Facts are not forced upon the reader, but rather he is left to make his own assumptions of the ending of the book. The story is left somewhat unfinished, yet it comes to adequate closure, so that the reader does not feel a lack of conclusion in the novel.I was thoroughly impressed by the concise yet engaging writing by Wells, and believe that this classic would be a necessity in the personal library of any fan of good literature."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells' timeless classic, The Time Machine, was a great read. I thought it was well worth my \\"TIME.\\" I gave this book, **** (4 stars).The story is about a time traveling scientist who studies the 4th dimension...Time. He builds this incredible machine, (the time machine) in order to travel through time forwards or backwards. He moves forward about 800,000 years from now in only a matter of minutes! He meets mystical young people named the Eloi. They were humans, but have evolved over time into smaller, gentler people. The story follows him on his journey through this brave new world, where he suffers many hardships. I thought this book was very imaginative and creative. The book made me pull out my rusty old imagination and made me feel like I was literally back in the third grade! For example, when the time traveler lands in the new world, H.G. Wells describes the Eloi people and their surroundings. He does a great job using imagery and colorful details.Another reason I gave this book 4 stars was because it was suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I read this book. I wished the book never ended. H.G. Wells builds up a lot of suspense and then just when you would think its over...he hits you with another suspenseful event! He does that many times throughout the story, yet, it never gets old. This book can almost be considered a \\"suspenseful, yet colorful, thriller,\\" from my point of view. That is why I gave this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"OK, we've all seen at least one of the movie versions of H.G. Well's The Time Machine, but none of them truly compare with the oringinal Sci-Fi classic. The book tells the story of the Time Traveler's journey nearly a million years into the future and the very unexpected and disturbing society he finds there. The Time Traveler formulates various theories based on what he observes of the society, which each, in turn, prove to be oh, so wrong! [Warning: mild spoiler] In the end, his realization of the future is especially terrifying considering it is the result of our current social structure (or H.G. Well's, anyway).I especially recommend this book for those of us with short attention spans - it's only 140 pages (and that's the large print version). But don't get the wrong idea, this book still has more depth and creativity than most 500 page books i've read and is a great read, even compared with today's science fiction standards.This book has to be considered a classic considering it spawned a whole genre of time traveling books, movies, and tv shows whcih imitated it.

The resonance of this story is the eye opening cut-and-dried behaviour of the futuristic society we visit. Eye opening because it's such an obvious and timeless description of class struggle. This story is excellent old school sci-fi, and top notch social commentary. H.G. Wells' mind still packs a punch after all these years."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I found this book somewhat awkward to read. The story was easy enough to follow, but it was written from the perspective of one man writing down the speech of another. 90% of the book is one run-on speech so every paragraph opens with a quotation. Combined with the god-awful formatting of this Kindle edition, it made this feel very awkward. Beyond this, I found the beginning and the ending of the book to be rather compelling (the middle drags). This is especially effective when you know much of the ending at the beginning, and we as the reader are left to guess as to how they get to that point. Because of the poor formatting, I am glad this came to me at no price."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Anyone unfamiliar with the work of H.G. Wells (1866-1946) should take a ride with his 1895 bestselling sensation, The Time Machine. This is the perfect introduction into the work of an amazing author. Relatively short and easy to follow, this story has the power to make a dead man dream. Who hasn't imagined what the future might be like? Well's shows us. Who hasn't worried that we may destroy civilization one day? Well's warns us. Have you ever wondered what the Earth will be like long after we are gone and the sun dies? Wells takes us there.The Time Machine launched a remarkable career for Wells who went on to write several brilliant books, including: The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), and The First Men in the Moon (1901). His greatness as a writer is not found so much in the specific words he chose or the way he structured sentences as it is in the originality and power of his ideas. Many of his works, like The Time Machine, remain relevant and entertaining because the ideas are as provocative today as they were 100 years ago--if not more so thanks to advances in science. The Island of Dr. Moreau, for example, is an astonishing preview of the issues we now face with genetic engineering and cloning. The Time Machine is amplified today thanks to astonishing developments in theoretical physics.There are many fine versions of The Time Machine available today. One of the best I've seen is the Signet Classic edition (2002). It's an inexpensive paperback and includes an excellent introduction by science-fiction author Greg Bear. Even more valuable, it includes an extended version of the chapter in which the time traveler visits Earth's extreme future. It's a thrilling mental trip. Seeing what becomes of our civilization several thousand years from now is one thing. Glimpsing a future so far ahead that humans are extinct and the sun is dead takes it to an entirely new level. Why the two films based on the book (1960 and 2002) chose to omit this portion of the story is a mystery to me. I believe it would have been a highpoint of the films. Imagine Europe, Africa, North America or the Cayman Islands a few billion years from now. Imagine all buildings, roads, and every other human creation erased by time.A final point about The Time Machine is that this idea of time travel may turn out to be far more relevant than most readers imagine. In my lifetime I have seen the idea of time travel move from purely science fiction to respectable science. Believe it or not, time travel is no longer far-fetched nonsense in the minds of real scientists. Very serious thought is now given to the possibility that something--or someone--might be sent on a trip through time. A few years ago, for example, I interviewed Dr. Ronald Mallet, a University of Connecticut physics professor who hopes to send a sub-atomic particle back in time. If he pulls that off, launching a human on a similar voyage will likely be nothing more than a matter of time.--Guy P.

In \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" Martian invaders assault imperial Britain and slaughter the inhabitants like bushmen in the Kalahari desert. In \\"The Time Machine,\\" Wells sketched a world where capitalist social relations have led to grotesque evolutionary changes. Both books are throught-provoking and superbly written. They belong to the science fiction canon.\\"The Time Machine\\" tells the story of a Londoner of 1895 who travels 800,000 years into the future, to an age when mankind has split into two separate species. One group, the spawn of capitalist ease and affluence, has been reduced to the mental and physical level of children; the other group has become feral after eons of industrial toil. Neither group is human any longer; culture and intelligence have died out forever. In fact, with the social tables turned, the \\"lower\\" orders now use their \\"betters\\" as a food source!Wells' vision of human decline was subversive and eloquent, and offered a wry counterpoint to the Victorian cult of progress. The penultimate chapter -- in which the time traveler voyages 30 million years into the future, to an era when the sun is dying, humanity is long-extinct, and lichens have inherited the earth -- is heartbreaking.

It starts off with a man inventing a traveling system. From there he traveled to 802,701 AD. Then he finds a whole other world where everything is different. There are friendly (but strange) creatures called Eloi, and even more mysterious creatures called Morlocks who live underground and only come out at night. The Eloi fear the Morlocks because they capture them and eat them, so they all sleep together and only come out during the day. Time passes and he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning. The time traveler is interested in the underground \\"world\\" and to get his machine back. He and Weena explore the underground world which he calls \\"The Palace of Green Porcelain\\", which is also a museum. He camps out for the night at the place with Weena until he can find his time machine. He later woke up to the fire he had built, burning around him. He never found Weena (who died) and is captured the Morlocks. The Morlocks think they have him trapped, but he runs to the time machine and eventually travels 3 million years later where the world is ending. There are no signs of life and only giant crabs and a planet eclipse the sun. He falls back into the past, with no signs that he has ever been anywhere.

It's mostly an interesting book with old english. To summarize, it's about a man who tells a story to important men about him time traveling about 800,000 years into the future and discovers how the world turns into. The Time Traveller, in which H. G. Wells calls him, adapts to the 800,000 life style of the Eloi's, the little future human race, and its peaceful and carefree world.

The ending is shocking and leaves you thinking."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a interesting book about a man who decides to do the unexpected and go against all odds into the future. At first the future seems perfect but we soon find out things are not what they seem. In this classic, HG Wells shows us what the futre will be like if we continue to take the road that we are taking and i have to say, this book made me think. it is interesting to follow the time travelers adventures in the future and see what he sees and go where he goes.

The book begins with an intelligent discussion about the possibility of time travel, seen throught the eyes of one of the guests at the discussion. The Time Traveller,the host of the dinner, boggles the guests as he shows them the model of a time machine, and later the real one. The rest of the book revolves around the Time Traveller's account of his adventure when he actually travels into the year 803,701. In this year, he finds that humanity has regressed into two frail creatures, Eloi and Morlocks. Then, he loses his time machine and must find his way back to the present."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is the classic story you know, but it's not just science fiction. If you haven't read the original, give it a try. It's about courage, it's about social order, science, ecology. The descriptions are very visual.

Can't find it in book stores!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book, The Time Machine, was originally a book to get done for the sake of getting a novel project done. When I started to read the first few pages, I thought that this would be quite boring, with the discussion of the 4th dimension of mathematics, something which I haven't a clue about. As I read, the book became more and more interesting and when the Time Traveler finally reaches his destination 800,000 years from home, is when I became interested. It is intriguing to think that humans will not become as advanced as we believe. Advancement over time seems inevitable, though Wells suggests not. I do criticize his pessimistic thinking in the two races he chose. The Morlocks should not be portrayed as such vile, evil creatures. Though they may eat the Eloi, it is nature after all, and it is odd to think that you never read about how the Eloi are captured. Overall, the novel is quite well written, as Wells' books should be. I would not recommend this read to younger children though since some of the vocabulary may be a bit advanced for them. I give it a 4/5 stars and my approval as an excellent read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is ok, but might be a little hard for younger readers to follow. The story is presented in a factual manner, which reduces the excitement a bit. If you are looking for an older science fiction book that will invoke some thinking, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book that you have to think about to understand, this is the book for you. The ending isn't all that great, but the story itself is interesting and suspenceful. Overall this is a good read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I read this book, for the first time, when I was about 13. Now, almost 25 years later, I've read it to my two sons who found it dead boring and absolutely too wordy. Sadly, I must agree with them. As I was reading it, I was wondering when it would end.

Other than that this is a great book."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book has been required reading in High Schools for years. My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics including The Time Machine are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"...but your imagination will fill in the rest.

At the time this book was written, many of the common place ideas used in today's science fiction couldn't even be thought of by the author. And yet, this book is not and will never be out of date. It is a great tale of a man that travels far far into the future of mankind and horrifies you by what mankind has become.

He has outdone himself this time. Working for several years on an experiment he has finally completed his invention. The only thing left is the testing of the machine. This is not something easily done. Without manpower the invention can't be proven to work. The scientist is the only one that knows enough about the machine to operate it. One Thursday night, at a gathering with educated peers the young scientist proceeds to explain the past three years of work to his guests. Looks of impossibility, and questions echoed around the room. At this point the young scientist asked for everyone to finish their meals, and that he had a surprise for them in the smoking room. They soon sat anticipating the words of the young scientist. Finally he was ready to speak. He explained how he had worked for three years on an experiment that was now ready. He also brought out a model of this experiment so perfect in scale, and it actually works. Some of the colleges thought it was a trick, others thought it couldn't be true, but it was. It was simply amazing if this mechanism had truly gone into the past, future, or unknown, what else could possibly happen? It was at this point that the young scientist invited them back to his laboratory to show them the full-size version of .......... \\"The Time Machine\\" From this time on in the story the Time Traveler experiences future events. It is the time machine and he together, in the unknown. Landing in the year 802,701 AD Surrounding familiar, yet unknown, buildings familiar, yet unknown. Although he didn't know it this weird experience would become an even weirder discovery. Leaving the Time Machine behind he saw a White Sphinx building, structures of abundant design all broken down appearance. Then they're the little ones. \\"Men? Woman?\\" Children seemed slightly smaller with many similarities between the genders. They seemed not violent, and yet he couldn't understand their words but their actions connected them. He headed back to the machine as it started to get dark, only to find the Time Machine Gone!!! What would become of the Time Traveler? Would he ever gain the trust of the people of this time? Would he find out about the secrets of the darkness? Who exactly are the demons of the night, and why were there well shaped passages leading down hundreds of feet below the surface of the earth? What are the Morlocks, and what is their purpose for the people that live in the daylight? What are the secrets of the Morlocks that link them to the human creatures above the darkness? Yet, very important how or will the Time Traveler retrieve his machine? The Time Traveler, and this incredible book can only answer these questions. The more you like science fiction the more you will appreciate this book. The direction that it brings us in the future worlds allow our imaginations to run wild as you read each passage of this entertaining novel."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells was a modern utopian socialist. This sci-fi suspense is not only about the possibility of time travel, but a warning about the bleak future of mankind, created by extreme class divisions. Workers develop into nocturnal humanoid creatures who pray on defenseless and simple Eloi, also humanoid creatures and descendants of the 19th century upper classes. A decade after this book was written, Einstein's theory of relativity suggested that time travel was perhaps more than a mere sci-fi idea. But that evolution follows class lines in an unlikely, although interesting and original, idea."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"HG Wells' Sci Fi classic, about a Victorian scientist's trip forward in Time, differs greatly from the movie version, so if you don't recognize the details of the story in this review, it's because I am referring the original. The tale is narrated at the beginng and very end by a good friend of the Time Traveler--whose name we never learn. Nor in fact are his skeptical dinner guests named, for the emphasis sis Not on the present. Ninety percent of the short novel, however, is a direct narration by the Time Traveler himself, of his incredible journey into the future. The year is hard to credit: 208,701!Wells loses no opportunity to expound on his theories of Mankind's self-destructive and degenerative &quot;progress.&quot; He launches into fervid warnings about the separation of diametrically opposed yet critically enmeshed aspects of human nature--both vital while openly at war--which result in the total Human Being. Yet he never considers what Right his hero has to go back the Future, in a vain, foolish and risky attempt to alter the bovine existence of the beautiful people called ELOI or to reduce the subterranean population of the hideous MORLOCKS who repel us with their bestial behavior? (No Prime Directives here about not meddling with the Past or the Future!) We can only guess at Weena's grim fate, but why did Wells include an eerie chapter with the TT contemplating the primoridal tide at the end of Time itself? Still spell-binding despite the intervening years, The Time Machine enthralls us with its daring concepts of futuristic invention and social speculation. Despite uneven literary pacing, these pages offer great Sci Fi reading for all ages!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a wonderfully written book.

I thought this part was really cool with the sun dying and all.Now, for the 12 year-old reviewers. I am somewhat disappointed in you. This book is NOT boring. I am 14 and I can identify with the first reviewer in that, as I mentioned before, there were a lot of hard words. I had to go to the dictionary more than once. But you second reviewer.

Faced with over eight hundred thousand years of evolution the time traveller is greatly surprised when he encounters mankind in a state of intellectual and physical decay. Despite this fact the 'Eloi' seem to live a utopian like existence, but as the time traveller eventually discovers a dark and unsettling presence exists which casts an evil shadow on proceedings. The story which unfolds is at once horrofic and deeply prophetic - all that remains to be seen is whether or not H.G.

The Elois are very childish and ignorant, so the Morlocks are able to walk all over, and take advantage of them. Some places in the world today are like this. One specific group is inferior to another, simply because their kindness is mistaken for weakness. The future in the book is also different from the future that is reality, because there is some cannibalism in the story, and the Morlocks being big, hairy creatures who live under ground. The similarities and differences in this book are what make thhis book unique. It gives the reader many different interpritations, and ways they can look at the story. H.G.

I haven't read the story (owing to the farce that was the film version with Guy Pearce). But I decided that since it was free and rather short, I would go ahead and take an afternoon to read it. I am glad I did.If you are a fan of classic British literature, then the language and flow are nothing new. Wells adapts the rather sparse and concise British style very well to a sort of science fiction story. I say sort of because it is science fiction, but it goes rather beyond science fiction to a sort of dystopian style that is a metaphor for the modern world (of the late 19th century).Wells was a visionary. The Time Traveller goes 800,000 years in the future and beyond, witnessing the beginning of the end of the earth. It is remarkable that even in his time, he was able to utilize realistic predictions, such as the sun growing larger, redder, and cooler as time progressed. He also makes note of the 800,000 year future and the lifeforms stating that perhaps overpopulation was a factor in the next stage of evolution. Also of note is that the planet is warmer in the future than in the present. Despite 800,000 years being a bit far in the future, there is still a subtle warning buried in Wells' novel.I highly recommend this book for anyone and everyone. It is one of those stories that I feel should be read by most folks. It is classic and very interesting even today."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Two parts I liked was when the Time Traveller went down into the well and met the Morlocks and I liked the part where the Time Traveller went into the Spinx and was almost trapped by the Morlocks.

He just hits a lever and goes. Doesn't he think there might be a little danger? And if he did why didn't he bring a weapon? There are somethings in the book that don't make sense. Don't get me wrong the book is fine exept for these parts. For example, in the far future he encounters giant crabs. Thats it. Only crabs. It makes me sad to think that the future will be ruled by giant crabs.Considering the guy has a time machine, there are only three settings. The story starts out in old London when they still have horse pulled carriages (He invents the machine before cars, t.v., and the lightbulb. Yeah, thats belivable.). But the story really starts to get going when he goes into the future and meets the two races that inhabit it. The Eloi, and the Morlocks. The Eloi: three foot tall bald people that aren't very smart. The MOrlocks: carnivourous underground creatures that breed the Eloi for food like cattle. Then of course there's the super far future with the crabs.The problem of the story was that oringanally his time machine gets stolen by the morlocks, but soon evplves into tasks like to protect the eloi and, to find shelter. He soon ends up solving the problem when the morlocks set a trap for the Time Traveler by luring him to the time machine.

The first setting was in England, late 1800's, in his house. The next setting was in the future, then in the Palace of Green Porcelin, then inside the wells (where the Morlocks live),then the last setting was even more far, far, far into the future.The main problem of the story is that the Time Machine gets stolen by the Morlocks. It was resolved because the Morlocks set a trap for the Time Traveller by setting the Time Machine outside so he could see it and come to it. When he went to get it, the Morlocks tried to get him, hut he escaped in the Time Machine. -S.J."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"One part about the book that I liked is when the Time Traveler saved Weena.

The second plot is in the year 802701 with the Eloi. The last setting is even farther in the future on a beachThe main conflict in the story is that the Time Traveler lost his Time Machine and needs to get out of the year 802701.

I had not, I said to myself, come to the future to carry on a miniature flirtation.\\" (the t-t, 53)fix er up: it was really weird not knowing the characters names, only their description as the time traveller or the editor or whatever. but, i might deduce that this was so we, the reader, could insert characters from our own experience into those roles."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I was looking for a good audio book for my commute and found this on a list with decent reviews. I realized that I have never read this book, even though I have read much of H.G. Wells and older science fiction. I have even seen two movies based on the book. I watched the Robert Taylor version a few months ago.The audio book was very good. The reader, Scott Brick, did and excellent job and was pleasant to listen to. It was relatively short (under 4 hours), and sounded just like I imagined a gentleman to sound like from that time frame and location.Since I had recently finished the movie, it was interesting to compare it with the book. The general outline was similar, but as always, the details were different.Since I am a history and philosophy buff, it was fascinating to see the philosophy of the time written into this book. Wells did a good job relating to the theory of evolution that was the center of scientific thought at the time. The character expostulated on the changes he saw in the future using that world view. I also found the episode in the museum of the future where it highlighted the gigantic mechanical machines of the late 19th century and didn't anticipate any of the electronics and miniaturization that characterizes our age.Overall, I recommend this audio book. It was an enjoyable way to spend my commute and a fun look at how the distant future was envisioned over 100 years ago."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"THE TIME MACHINE, despite certain obvious faults of imagination and style, is a brilliant fantasy: and it affords a valuable picture of the young Wells looking at the world, with his normal eyes, and finding it, more particularly, incomplete. At the age of twenty-seven or so, he has freed himself very completely from the bonds of conventional thought, and is prepared to examine, and to present life from the detached standpoint of one who views it all from a respectable distance; but who is able, nevertheless -- an essential qualification -- to enter life with all the passion and generosity of his own humanity."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I first read \\"The Time Machine\\" when I was in high school and that was some time ago. Since then, I've read it two or three more times. After an absence, I always seem to find it refreshing.Set at the end of end of the nineteenth century, the time traveller has indeed found the answer to travelling in the fourth dimension. He attempts to explain this to some of his friends but with mixed fortune. Some are quizzical, others just think him to be a polite fraud. How wrong they are! The time traveller has truly mastered time. He travels some eight hundred thousand years into the future where the world is inhabited by two races of beings. The Eloi who are near human but very small and weak; and the Morlocks who are a conniving subterranean people. The Eloi are a frivolous people. They have no industry, no desire to learn. They seem only interested in light hearted play. By way of contrast, the Morlocks are strong and dangerous. They are nocturnal and spend their days below the earth's surface. Their obvious challenge to the Eloi is that they are predators. The Eloi live in fear of the night.The time traveller does his best to help the Eloi and upon his return to Victorian England, he regales his dinner guests with a long narrative about the future. Failing to gain their credulous support, the time traveller goes away once more. On this occasion, however, he never returns. One is left speculating as to what becomes of him.In many respects, H.G. Wells is presenting a vision of a dystopia. He does this beautifully. The reader should be entranced by the story. It is truly a modern classic."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I'm surprised I didn't read this book sooner. I've been a big fan of sci-fi since I was a child, and this book was right up my alley. I absolutely loved Wells' writing style, and the story was such a vastly different take on time traveling compared to most stories that we see that involve the same concept. I liked the fact that he went thousands of years into the future, as opposed to just a hundred or so. This was a very lovely little novella, and I'm definitely going to have to pick up more H.G.Wells in the future."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I think that The Time Machine is a great novel by H.G. Wells that everyone can understand. The book consists of action, like when the time traveler entered the underground caves for the first time, or romance, as in the relationship between Weena and the time traveler, and most importantly, mystery, like how humanity had come from the great marvels it once was to the current predicament that the time traveler had entered into. The novel also has a great use of vocabulary with ingenious words used perfectly with each other to form the story.I think that H.G. Wells is a great author who really knows how to write a story and the way that he wrote The Time Machine is incredible. He used a touch of science-fiction, a hint of fantasy, and a prediction of the future to come. All of these ingredients come together to create a unique combination of words, that help you get lost in the fantasy of traveling through time. It is an easy book to lose yourself in and spend hours curled up by the fireplace reading. Unfortunately, there are those that might not appreciate what H.G. Wells wrote about, but I do, and am glad I had the chance to read the book for a high school project.I'm glad that I got to read this great novel, and am proud to say that I enjoyed it fully. I hope that other people will be able to experience the full beauty of what H.G. Wells wrote and can relate it to their own life.

But as an adult (with too much time on planes and trains) I have had the opportunity to revisit the classics and so far (and by far) The Time Machine is my favorite book.There are three areas in which this book excels that I feel are worthwhile:1. Style. I often found myself reading and re-reading the same pages over and over again to take in what Wells was saying. The words on the page come alive in a way that many others fail to accomplish. The book isn't the easiest to get through at times but whizzes by in other sections.2. The Story. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. While Wells does not develop the characters deeply you instantly feel like you know them, understand their motivations, and want them to find happiness. For such a short tale with little backstory the characters really come alive.3. The birth of sci-fi. Wells may not have been the very first author of science fiction but the concept of time travel as epitomized with this book has become legend of itself. Wells did not have endless Hollywood fare or other literature to draw upon but found a creative way to express such a compelling concept. Kudos to Wells.Overall, I highly recommend this book. It may not be for everyone because Wells has a unique style so if you're looking for a quick read to kill time this may not be for you. But if you want a book that provides an experience and takes you to another place this is a great read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"this is a good story that is different than most. It is written by HG Wells so you know that you wont be disappointed"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is a classic for a number of reasons. First and foremost it makes ingenious use of the scientific ideas of its time (published 1895) and playfully explores their long term results. The book* is a strong critique of humanity's desire to control the world around us, as well a social commentary on the class-divisions of early industrialized societies. It makes use of historical and scientific models of understanding human development and projects a future based on these concepts, to a surprisingly depressing &#34;Utopian&#34; world. Despite the complexity of these themes, the author cleverly wraps them in an exciting, easy to follow story, where setting and plot support each other to maintain an immersive narrative. The length of the book is, in contrast to what my review signals, quite short, just over 100 pages, and hints at its themes rather than blurt them out. The author challenges the reader to think, and his 19th century vocabulary encourages those who are less than fully proficient in the English language to develop theirs further.*the film recently made was not only very detached from the themes of the book, it lacked all social relevance, and can only be described as rubbish."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Written in the Victorian Era, this was an entertaining critique of the times in which Wells lived. A time traveler returns to his own time (late 1890's) to relate the tale to a group of guests his experience traveling 800,000+ years into the future. Without giving too much away the time traveler believes the world and time he travels to are populated by the evolved descendants of the two classes of Victorian England: The idle aristocratic ruling class and the poor toiling working class. One group is vegetarian, timid and dumb, fearful of the dark of night, while the other group is a carnivorous predatory group that only comes out at night to stalk the other group.I really liked this book and the author's perspective of 19th century English society.

It could have been alot more interesting if the events would have been expanded on."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"\\"The Time Machine\\" was the first of several times H.G. Wells used a tale of fantasy to discuss truths about the human condition. This book isn't so much about space/time as it is about morality. I suspect reading \\"War of the Worlds\\" will involve Wells bringing us backstage in \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\" articulated by Samuel Huntington.Science definitely impacts culture, especially increasing the desire for a less physically demanding life. Wells is a rare man in asking what's at the end of this techno-rainbow. Answer: \\"Only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back and destroy its makers in the end\\" (p.125, Airmont Classic paperback edition).Ironic that this master of science fiction's greatest contribution is questioning the ascendency of science, similar to how Immanuel Kant's books on reason are at heart about reason's limits. Wells punches a hole in the growing web of theorizing - \\"very simple was my explanation and plausible enough - as most wrong theories are!\\" (p. 49).Wells brilliantly sketches how the spread of professionalism and title-seeking was and is cutting men off from each other and making us increasingly afraid to seek truth as whole men (see Russell Kirk's study of Edmund Burke's moral imagination for more about this). Our author accomplishes this by not using the men's names just their professional labels - \\"the medical man,\\" \\"the editor\\" etc.Those of us trying to remain whole men, thus being interested in physics and religion simultaneously, can't help being awed by Wells' descriptions of time travel. He gets as close to Ezekiel-type magnificence and incomprehension as any English language writer. At the end you scratch your head and wonder if time and space are the same thing (as a great Prague/Czech rabbi once wrote) or are they two different things as Rashi comments on Deuteronomy 11:30? Kant held that time and space are transcendental, meaning they are part of how we view things in the world but not that they are necessarily things in the world (see the fine Blackstone Audio \\"Giants of Philosophy\\" CD narrated by Charlton Heston). My inner Ernest Mach tells me that space is the easier concept to understand (Mach taught that space and time are relative) in terms of travel. It's easy to see movement forward and backward in geometric space. Less easy to detect forward movement in time but we all feel it in our bodies if we live long enough. That leaves backward movement in time - this is the big puzzle for me. I venture to say that it's possible poetically but not physically - the essence of conservatism is taking the best of the past and applying it constructively to the present and future. But our actual bodies or other objects going back in time? I'll need the machine ride to make me believe it.Had Wells understood that non-governmental conservatism is what keeps the milk of human kindness flowing he wouldn't have wasted a lot of breath, paper and years stumping for one-world government. Nations are different, making the one-world thing in this time before the Messiah a dead letter. While some characteristics undergird all of humanity, cultures are different and cultures are decisive. Well-meaning socialists like Wells sometimes lose sight of this critical point.And let's not forget that the nature of government is compulsion and coercion and these things, especially when directed from outside and/or a top-down manner, usually don't bring out the best in people although some good things may eventually result.\\"The Time Machine\\" cogently reminds us of interdependency but that interdependency cannot be sped up artificially to produce brotherhood. Brotherhood and its accompanying peace only come about in the fullness of time."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Most H.G. Wells fans, and even many casual Wells acolytes, are aware that social commentary took precedence over scientific fact in his novels. Indeed, on one level the science/technology in the novels was a general pretext or springboard for Wells to make observations of humankind's social flaws. But on a more despairingly complex level, Wells depicted science/technology without conscience or forethought as the source of many of humankind's sins. I wish to address this theme of soulless, hasty, harmful science/technology in Well's literally timeless novel \\"The Time Machine\\" (hereafter TTM).The Time-Traveler in TTM is anonymous for a reason. I believe he symbolizes humanity's science's/technology's exploratory spirit. However, he also symbolizes, and witnesses, the potentially destructive rashness of that spirit. Having learned to travel in the 4th dimension (time) without moving in physical space, the Time-Traveler demonstrates this ability with a miniature model to several skeptical dinner guests. When even that demonstration fails to convince them, the Time-Traveler becomes anxiously bent to travel forward in time. This is the first clue of the Time-Traveler's careless impulsiveness and failure to prepare. Perhaps he should have gone back in time first to establish a frame of reference, to observe how humanity survived in the past, and with what science/technology. Instead, without any provisions or weapons, the Time-Traveler surges forward at once to the far distant future, with NO foreknowledge of what to expect. Didn't he think he might end up underwater, or on the edge of volcanic lava, or in the middle of a battle, for example? No, he didn't.Fortunately, as he decides to stop at the England of 802,701 A.D., the Time-Traveler beholds a seemingly idyllic, verdant countryside and hastily concludes that mankind has achieved utopia. He meets the effete, docile Eloi and is charmed by their childish insouciance. As he gradually, falteringly learns, though, appearances are cruelly deceiving. The Eloi are the degenerate, feeble ancestors of the privileged 1% classes who do nothing but eat, sleep, and play. They barely have a language, or even the moral sense to save one of their own, Weena, from drowning from a leg cramp. The Time Traveler saves and befriends her. The Time-Traveler's admiration of their charm soon turns to frantic impatience. Even worse, he is unsettled by their puerile panic as night falls. Why do they fear the dark? The Time-Traveler finally notices the ventilation shafts interspersed among the meadows. Again, without illumination or any other preparation, he enters one of the shafts and is nearly overwhelmed by probing, invisible hands. He manages to escape and finally realizes that he needs a light source to find out what those creatures are.The Time-Traveler stumbles upon what he calls the Palace of Green Porcelain, a decrepit museum. Besides finding matches in a matchbox and flammable camphor (in improbably working condition), he finds a crowbar as a weapon. Just in time, too, because the Time-Traveler discovers that his unguarded time machine is missing! At least he had the forethought to unscrew the operating levers. He sees that it was dragged into the pedestal of a sphinx statue. He manages to get into the pedestal, light a match, and see a subterranean industrial civilization run by albino troglodyte-like brutes called Morlocks. The Time-Traveler gradually observes that they are degenerate counterpoint to the Eloi - the 99% machine workers who still have the knowledge to maintain, feed, and clothe the Eloi, but also cannibalistically feed on them!A fight ensues. The Time-Traveler is stronger and larger than the Morlocks, but severely outnumbered. He lashes out with the crowbar and slaughters several of them. He tries to light a match, but they are matches that can only be struck against the box (a recurring Wells science joke), and he has dropped the box. He enters the time machine and moves forward a few days to get out of the sphinx. A bit earlier, spurred by bloodlust, he had rashly set the area on fire with the matches and camphor, knowing that the loathesome Morlocks are sensitive to light. But the fire spreads and slays both Eloi and Morlock alike, including Weena.The Time-Traveler manages to jump into his time machine and move even further into the future - about 30 million years. He finds cold, barren landscapes fit only for giant crabs and millipedes, and at last, the final fate of the earth as the sun becomes a bloated red giant prior to going supernova. The time-traveler escapes just in time.The Time-Traveler, in a microcosm, shows what destruction science/technology can wreak when it has no moral or logical restraints. His lack of foresight has, presumably, finally extinguished the remnants of human civilization, which was already doomed by centuries of technological progress. At the end of the novel, the Time-Traveler finally learns the value of foresight as he returns home, relates his adventures to his dinner guests, and disappears forever into time, this time into the past, perhaps to learn about mankind's mistakes and perhaps prevent them and alter humankind's destiny. Ah, but the Time-Traveler did not reckon upon the time travel paradox. Perhaps those mistakes are immutable!Wells most likely appreciated the benefits that scientific advances could bring, but was astute enough to realize that cold-hearted, RECKLESS science could bring disaster. There is nothing wrong with scientific discoveries, provided you have reckoned with and planned for the future."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is classic in literture.

Wells did it and the result is amazing. He naturally take advantage of the astrophysics knowledge of his time but the social aspects described is mind-blowing."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Traveler was dirty and disheveled when he finally came to dinner. His friends asked what happened and he began to tell them that he finished his time machine and of his trip to the year 802,701. He encountered a descendent of the human race called the Elois. He found these people very friendly. They took him to their dining hall and he began to learn their uncomplicated language. When he finished eating he found that his time machine was gone. For many days he and his new friend Weena looked for it. The Time Traveler decided to look down in one of the shafts. There he encountered one of the Elois' greatest fears, the cannibalistic Morlocks. He escaped and thought that they might be the ones that took his machine. A few days later, they encountered the Morlocks again. Weena fainted and the Time Traveler tried to scare them off with fire but the fire started to spread. He never saw Weena again. He found the time machine and head back to his own time. A few days after telling his friends he went back in his time machine and never returned. This is a great book about time traveling and the mysteries of the future.The first two chapters would introduce the topic of which the story was based upon. It opened up with a group of men talking about the dimensions--length, thickness, width, and time. They were discussing whether or not it was possible to travel through time, either in the past or in the future. Then the Time traveler brought in a metallic clock. He had one the Psychologist pull a lever and the little clock began to spin then it disappeared. After a little more discussing, the meeting ended. The next meeting was when the Time Traveler told of his adventures.The novel was very uniquely written. At the very beginning and at the end of the book the story was told in first person by an onlooker who apparently \\"wrote\\" the story on paper. The majority of the novel was written in first person limited to the Time traveler. He told his amazing adventures to his friends at one of their meetings.Although most of the novel did not involve many major characters, the author gave the characters very interesting names. He mentioned a few of their real names but other than that they were called based their occupation. Some of the characters were named the Psychologist, the Journalist, the Provincial Mayor, and the Medical Man. The Silent Man and the Editor were a couple of other characters.The element I liked most about The Time Machine was that the author used very elaborate and sophisticated details. When the Time Traveler first came to the year 802,701 A.D. he described himself as an African, who was just brought from his tribe in the middle of Africa to the busy streets of London. The Elois were delicate four foot tall people. They had a very limited and simple language. They wore elegant fabrics and sandals. Weena was very child like. She would cling to the Tim Traveler and give him flowers. The evil Morlocks were of a hazy whitish color with pink eyes. This novel was a great story about the future in a way that is different than machinery and robots. This is definitely a great book to read if you like tales of the future.By K. Lissner"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"At first glance, H.G. Wells's \\"The Time Machine\\" is simply the tale of a man who travels 800,000 years into the future and sees the fate of mankind. Only the smallest amount of reflection is needed, however, to see the book as more of a political parable than a science fiction story. Unfortunately, the age of the book makes it feel quaint and old, perhaps moreso than Wells's other works.The story is very simple, following the adventures of the time traveller in in a future time, where mankind has split into two subspecies. There is conflict between the species, and the Time Traveller must safely negotiate the unknown territory and society as he tries to get back home in one piece. However, the musings of the author during his adventures - e.g., his theory on how the human race could have split in two - is the meat of the book. Wells weaves together political science, philosophy, and social commentary in a compelling if not always convincing way. The thrust of his thesis is that Mankind will eventually become somnambulent, having used his intellect to \\"conquer\\" nature. At that point, evolution will not only cease but even start to move backwards, as man needs challenges to grow and evolve as a species.This theory is almost quaint in its old-fashionedness. Current science fiction writing generally holds as a truism that Mankind's \\"vital energy\\" will be put into colonising / terraforming new planets to expand into (if we don't first wipe ourselves and our planet out of existence!). It is interesting and refreshing to look back at an older book and see how the philosophy of the time shapes its outlook of the future. Unfortunately, Wells's book is very short and just doesn't have the meat on its bones that a modern book would have. As an historical/influential book, it certainly rates 5 out of 5. I've given a 3 out of 5 because I don't think it stands up as well as some of the author's other work, and because it's clearly dated in some of its social and political commentary."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I believe that this book only deserves three stars for many reasons. But don't get me wrong, the book is a classic in its own unique way, but the way the author tells his story is un-interesting to me.The author begins with a man who says that time travel is the fourth dimension, and that he could find a way to travel through time. His colleages do not believe him and leave. Later when they return, they see the weary man dismount from his time machine. he then begins to recall his journey.He traveled to a distant future (802,701 AD) where the world seemed to be a great paradise where nothing was wrong. He discovers a small human race that seem to befriend him. They tell him of the horrible night raids where an ape-like species will come and hunt the small humans. Not to concerned with this, he decides to go explore the underground world where these creatures live so he may retrieve his time machine. he finds out just how hostile the race is and barely escapes alive. Then running from these monsters, he finally gets in his time machine and escapes. He travels to many other time periods where he discovers large and strange creatures roaming the planet, until he finally gets back home.I think that the character development of this story was too weak. The main protagonist seemed to be an average joe that had a time machine placed in his hands, no more. The rest of the world he developed seems to be the bright side of his story telling. It is obvious that he had a dun time creating his won unique world. Other than that, the story and its plot were only average, but definitely worth looking at at least once in your life time."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I was given this book at Christmas a long time ago when I was a young boy (Perhaps 9 yrs old?). I read it over my Christmas vacation in a home that was set back in the woods and heated by, believe it or not, a wood stove. If I remember correctly, it was snowing that year. It was a warm cozy environment for a wide-eyed child to read a book. In my mind is one of the best books ever put to page in ink (and i do mean ink!) It began a lifetime love of science fiction and history. I have reread it a few times since then and I have also repeatedly watched the 1960 movie adaption of this book. Parden the pun but this book is timeless. It is a piece of prose that is over a hundred years old. The book itself has become a &quot;time machine&quot;. It conveys a piece of a mans imagination and maybe some of his life to generations of others born long after his death. Cervantes, Milton, St. Augustine and numerous others also have done this. They have captured their &quot;times&quot; in the ways that they penned there art. My children will also be given this book when they are old enough to appreciate it. Hopefully it will continue to be given to my proginy generations down the road. I for one will try not to allow the richness of this literary work crumble to dust in the passage of time."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Concise and compacted, the book looks pretty good. It also contains a vocabulary, making it more readable for the youth."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I attempted to read one more \\"classic\\" story - H.G. Wells' The Time Machine.The way people wrote stories back in the day is very different than what I'm used to. For the books I read, I don't know all the answers until the final twist.For books that fall under the genre, \\"Classic\\" (i.e. Jekyll & Hyde, Invisible Man, etc...) you already know how things turn out.Take this book for example. The Time Traveler invites his audience to his flat for dinner. As they are waiting for him to join them at the table, he stumbles out of a doorway and proceeds to tell them the story of his adventure traveling through time.There shouldn't be any suspense because you already know that he survives the ordeal. Perhaps the purpose of this book, like it's classic cousins, is to inform the reader of some deeper point than just to deliver an action adventure story.Having said all that, I am glad I finally picked it up and finished it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I thought this was a mostly good book,but some parts were a little creepy. Also some words were a little too big (but hey, more dictionary practice!).On the plus side, the plot is interesting, and it is a definitely a book i d recommend. It seemed to me like it was a cross between mystery and science fiction. For younger kids, I'd advise a retold version because of some of the big words and creepy parts. Overall, I'd say this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a strong book that always keeps yo guessing and on the edge of your seat. I think that this author writes some nice pieces of written masterpiece! I will be buying more!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"It's hard to believe it took this long for the concept of time travel to enter the body of literature. Of course, it's so obvious once you're aware of the possibility, that's it's probably unfair to judge in hindsight.Overall the book was quite entertaining. I've seen something like three or four renditions on TV and in movies, and while each puts its own stamp on the telling of the story (e.g. the 1970's version has a model that travels forward five minutes into the future; and the most recent remake includes the death of the inventor's wife), the basic elements all come directly from the book. There's also a scene from the book that takes place in the far future, and that I haven't seen done in any of the movies.A brilliant example of what happens when one asks \\"what if...\\" and follows the answer to its logical conclusions, this book has been hugely influential in opening up entirely new avenues for fiction storytelling."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Written in the 1800's , this novel is filled with old english and is very confusing for most people my age. Although after finishing it, i found it very good. Its about a man who is destined to travel through time, and whos friends deny him of his persiut. when he finally does travel to the year 802,701 AD, he is greeted by the eloi, which to me, is the strange, lifeless evolution of mankind. The eloi also interact with Morlocks, other strange people, who are cannibalistic and live in the underworld. The whole novel is pretty much the Time traveler explaining his journey through time with his peers, and them not believing it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book has alot in common with &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; in the sense that it is also one of the books that helped shape the future of science fiction. It is also similar in the sense that modern readers might find it a little slow and hard to trudge through. But if you enjoy classics, then this is one to buy and read. A great and &quot;timeless&quot; story (no pun intended!) :)"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"A story set in a future that may seemingly surpise the optimist, this story is a classic giving us more insight on what could possibly happen to humans. Although different people have different interpretations, I think Wells had meant it like that. On my interepretation, I think that this story talks about classes (socialist or capitalist), maybe a reminder of technological abuse making us weaker, or even a story of how we humans are too overprotected and have lost abilities as we have not suffered enough hardship for understanding, you decide. Overall, this is a great story despite the shortness and it does make you reconsider about the world."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is an enjoyable read. Full of political commentary and posing questions about the future, The Time Machine is truly a worthwhile work of early science fiction. The main characters are well developed. The ending is a little sudden, but the epilogue is inspired. I recommend this book and edition very much."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"&quot;The Time Machine&quot; is a science fiction classic and a book that has inspired not only a great movie but also many other stories and novels. One of them is an excellent sequel to this book: Stephen Baxter's &quot;The Time Ships&quot; tells about the further adventures of the time traveller and really is a worthy successor to the original work. My advice: Read Wells first, and if you like it, you should definitely check out Baxter's work as well."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is widely considered the first \\"real\\" science fiction book and is also one of the best. Though it focuses more on pure imagination than science, unlike some later Wells, it is nevertheless an interesting read. It touches on several important subjects, such as evolution and the question of whether or not we should really view the future before if we could. It is extremely suspenseful and can be read in one setting. This is a very good book, complete with a cliffhanger ending."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H. G. Wells was the first to write about quite a few of the standard science fiction themes, discounting books such as _Gulliver's Travels_ which were written before the genre was really established. This book, obviously, is the original time travel story. I read it as a young teenager when I went through most of Wells' work but I still remember the main points.The main character builds a time machine and travels tens of thousands of years into the future, at least. There he finds that the human race has evolved into two distinct groups. There's a surface dwelling race which appears to be living in a carefree utopia, but after dark they hide from the underground, predatory group.I only gave this book four stars because the book didn't strike me strongly enough for me to remember the plot or details vividly. In contrast, Wells' _War of the Worlds_ still stays with me in broad outline, including the ending."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I think that &quot;The Time Machine&quot; was a great book. It left me hanging off the edge of my seat. I like the book because the Main Character risked his life to prove a theory about time.It was very exciting and I would recommend this book to a friend.

Wells."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I think this book was an excellant book. I liked it because one of the main characters risked his life so many times to prove a theory.

It does lag in bits, but there are some stupendous bits that need to be read. As i remember it, some parts genuinely terrified me and i think Morlocks were the pre-amble for what has now materialised itself as my utmost fear and hatred of all spiders tht have the audacity to come within four feet of me. Minions. Well, read if you think it will benefit your life. If not, avoid."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Listen up if you are hesitent to read this book. I had to read this for gifted English class, and I was ready to quit reading it after the first chapter (I only knew like half the words he used), but really, believe me, it gets a LOT better and more exciting. I hate science fiction books but the adventure was captivating. So please, stick with this book and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Book ReviewThe novel I am reading is the Time Machine and it is about a psychologist who wants to travel through the future.He had a machine that was used to travel through the future. He called it the Time Machine and it was made up of crystal, nickel and part of ivory. it also included two levers to control the Time Machine. When he first travelled through the future he saw gigantic buildings and big trees. He also saw things that were different from where he come from. With the Time Machine, he can do anything incredible like slow down time.I found the novel a little confusing with the words and it was hard to remember what I was reading. the novel appears to be a good one. what I didn't like about the book was the end of the book. I also had trouble with the vocabulary.When you understand the vocabulary, you will start to get into the book more. my favorite character is the Psychologist because he is the one and only Psychologist who controls the Time Machine. I would rate this book a three because the author didn't explain the book well enough.

However, I wanted to make sure I wasn't throwing away $40 - $50 on a book just because somebody labels it a &quot;Masterpiece&quot;. It's a good thing a read it first, because it was rather boring. This said, it was written some time ago, but still does not excuse the lack of depth in this title.

Wells used science fiction as a medium in which to promote his ideas. This book is typical of his work in that it supports the following ideas: 1) People are, in general, bad, wicked, and evil. 2) As time goes on, the condition that we live in will get worse and worse. 3) Technology is bad, and causes more harm than good. 4) Capitalism causes suffering. 5) Socialism is good.Contrast this with the wonderful book MYSTERIOUS ISLAND by Jules Verne. That book expresses a very deep appreciation for freedom. And the characters are portrayed as heroes while they use their minds to develop technology to improve their quality of life. You can get MYSTERIOUS ISLAND right here at amazon.com. And if you like MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, then you might also want to read ATLAS SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand, which is also available here at amazon.comWells was a pessimist and a socialist. Verne was an optimist and a lover of liberty. And I think that your political views are going to have a big influence on how you feel about each of these two authors.Of course there is nothing wrong with using fiction as a medium for discussing political ideas. It's just that when I read a book such as THE TIME MACHINE, I can't help but noticing how flawed Wells's view of society is. If only Wells were alive today so he could witness the millions of poor people who flee from socialist countries and move to the capitalist USA because they are seeking a better quality of life. I wonder what kinds of books Wells would be writing today if he were alive to see this."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"&quot;The Time Machine&quot; had the potential of being an interesting novel, but came up short.

Over all this book is a very challenging book but it a good book to read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a story that should be read for cultural literacy and the political satire, but it is really a mediocre book. Wells' is not a particularly good writer and his action is jumpy and characters are poorly drawn, but fortunately he is very creative so his imagination carries the day. This is a very short, easy read which would be great for book reports or a Sunday afternoon on the couch, but it is an excellent critique of late-19th century society and the ills of the industrial revolution and time travel stories are always intereting, particularly in this story in which the genre was basically invented. I would recommend it to students, science fiction fans and people who just enjoy increasing their general cultural literacy."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Do not read this book if you enjoy character interaction. This is definately not a character story. The Time Traveller doesn't even have a name, much less a personality. Never did I once care what happened to the guy. The plot, which Wells seemed to attempt to make interesting is rather bland. There were no motives other than scientific curiosity. Very unrealistic. The Time Traveller assumes that because the Morlocks are strange and ugly by his standards, that they're evil. He didn't even give them a chance. Looking at everyone as part of a stereotyped group, no one, not even the Time Traveller himself nor Weena, was an individual.What's worse is that this book had true *potential.* But potential left untapped is better off nonexistant. Don't expect too much from The Time Machine."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The part in the book that ia ctually liked is when the time Traveller and Weena, his friend from the futre, are in the forest. it is getting dark so the Time Traveller starts a fire, Weena is som amazed by it because she has never seen one, she tries to stick her hand onto the fire and feel it. A part that i disliked was when the Time Traveller fell aslep in the wells where the morlocks live and when he woke up the Morlocks were groping him. I think the Time Traveller was stupid to go down into the monsters lair and fall asleep. I mean what did he think was going to happen, the Morlocks were going to leave him alone? Yeah rigth buddy.The book starts off with The Time Traveller and his friends at his house in england during the 1800s. As the book moves along he was in the same spot as where his Time Machine was in his laboratory but instead of during the 1800s he was in the year 801,701.The main problem of this book is when the Time Traveller gets to 802,701 and the Morlocks steel his machine. He knows that it is in the Sphynx but he cannot get in. The Morlocks decide to set a trap by leaving the doors to the Sphynx open and when the Time Traveller walks in to attack him. The Time Traveller fought off the Morlocks until he got 2 his machine and went a little bit into the future just to get out of there. He then went back to his time.All in all I did not like this book it was boring and did stand out to me at all.

That is they are worth reading just to understand a certain school of literary aesthetic or thought, a past era, etc. and maybe they might be worth reading not for their fame (or infamy). \\"The Time Machine\\" shatters any assumption that a classic has to be stuffy, irrelevant or out of date (of course, it is by no means the only classic novel to do so). Wells creates the first novel about a time traveling machine with wit, intelligence, suspense, political satire and an adventurous spirit.The story begins in Surrey where a scientist and inventor referred to simply as the Time Traveler is discussing with dinner guests how he views time as simply the fourth dimension (the other three being height, length and breadth), which can be traveled through just like the other three dimensions. The catch is that this eccentric is actually successful and manages to travel over eight hundred thousand years into the future. The Time Traveler navigates through a different world which appears to be an utopian world of leisure occupied by a civilization of small but pretty persons calling themselves eloi. The Time Traveler soon finds out that things are not as they seem. Even though this is a well known novel, I will not spoil things in case of new readers who stumble across the magnificent book which is in the public domain and free on theKindle. You may find the musings and observations of the curious and bold Time Traveler to be fascinating.Wells manages to create a thrilling tale with satirical and political themes woven in to warn against oppression and promoting his socialist ideals.

I had totally forgotten what was written on those pages. As I began reading it again for a book club, I found myself lost in a classic that too many people never read.A man creates a time machine in which he travels very far into the future. The discoveries he encounters bring about a mixture of amazement, sadness, and horror. Mankind has become two distinct races with one living above earth in finery and sunshine and the other living below ground in a mutated form afraid of all light. The problem lies in the fact that the creatures living underground steal his time machine. In order to get back, he will have to venture into the dark unknown.Reading this story can be rather slow at times as the style of writing is vastly different than what we get today from contemporary writers. At times, the dialogue rambles along. In fact, most of the book is dialogue as the Time Traveler describes his experience to his dinner guests. This might be a turn off to younger readers who expect more modern writing.I had never looked at this story as a thriller or horror book but reading it again I could see it as such. There were times when I felt my skin crawl as the narrator described his encounter with the underground race.The ebook I read was a public domain copy and was free. With it came many editing issues but for just reading the classical piece it was not too bad.If you need to read this book for school, check out this free version though there are some out there that include study guides and other commentary. If you just have never read it, give it a try. It is not an extremely long book but it will take concentration as the style is so different than most are used to.Note: This book was free and obtained by myself. No one gave me the book with any expectation of a positive review."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Simply the best. It makes you feel that modern science-fiction hasn't created anything. One has to keep in mind that this story was written a century ago, at a time when cinema was not an industry. H.G. Wells worked hard on his story and modified several it times but in the end, he takes us into a wonderful journey way beyond human nature. Every single human being on earth should read this.Franis E.A.R.

I had, however, seen the old movie version of this book a lot of times. I was surprised to find that the movie was a bit different than the book, and so reading this was refreshing!For someone who had been through what the main character had, I felt that his recollection was a bit unrealistic, though if it had not been, the book would have not had as much substance, and would have had to been written in a different way. Even so, I believe that being more realistic could have made for a more engrossing story. The other notion would be to have written the story in an autobiographical viewpoint, which would have been equally as good. Yet, the ending would have to have been different, in that case!Possible spoiler: Regarding the question posed at the end, my vote is that he returned to save Weena, and vanquish the Morlocks, providing freedom to the Eloi!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The alien voices tape is indeed excellent.

However, Mr. Kingsley's delivery does the story a disservice. He is generally monotonic, and does not impart much emotion into what he reads. In addition, there are numerous points where he pauses as if at a period, only to continue the sentence. This has the effect of breaking up the longer sentences into disjointed, odd-sounding fragments. Finally, there were a few typos (or mis-reads, if you will) scattered throughout the text (i.e., &quot;gloves&quot; for &quot;globes&quot;).

The great thing about this book is the fact that the reader is trusted to come up with individual answers, but only after H.G. Wells thoroughly frightens us and shakes things up a bit. The ideas in this little book are enormous. Read once every decade for a lifetime, the book is different each time, and its implications change and transmogrify. As if the book itself isn't exciting enough, editor Nicholas Ruddick provides us with enough background material to earn an advanced degree in science and philosophy, should we take time to read and study the full texts of great 19th Century thinkers he has briefly quoted. The amazing thing is, H.G. Wells did read and study all those great thinkers, and in his lifetime wrote more thought-provoking material than Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare combined. Wells' brain was indeed a world brain--one that kept developing right up till the end. And at the end, Wells charges us to continue developing or, he warns, we will perish after a few screams and whimpers, imploding from our own laziness. --Jim Reed, author, DAD'S TWEED COAT: SMALL WISDOMS, HIDDEN COMFORTS, UNEXPECTED JOYS ..."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is about an inventor from the late 1800's who builds a time machine and travels far into the future.

Wells, is a tale from the very brinks of the imagination. Wells' nameless physicist is a scientific genius who built a machine capable of making him a nomad in time. When a trial run sends the time traveler more than one hundred thousand years in the future, he finds himself in an unindustrialized, tropical climate surrounded by odd vegetation, magnificent and mysterious citadels, a race of childlike humanoids called the \\"Eloi\\" and a frightening, subterranean apish race called \\"Morlocks.\\" The timetraveler surveys his surroundings, attempting to discover whatever happened to humanity. Although the prose is somewhat dated and unsophisticated, the Time Machine is a true original of speculative fiction and a fantastic stimulator of the mind's eye."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"For a more comprehensive review, read darkgenius's. I enjoyed this book immensely. I loved the way the story begins where we do not know any names of the characters but the plot grips us early. We are given great descriptions of all aspects of time travel and the natural reactions of people in such a situation. The adventure itself felt more as a trip through a museum rather than being 800,000 years in the future. Wells touched just enough of the science fiction area to intrigue us and then zooms back into the story. The book is not too long which is another plus."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is ok, but might be a little hard for younger readers to follow. The story is presented in a factual manner, which reduces the excitement a bit. If you are looking for an older science fiction book that will invoke some thinking, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book that you have to think about to understand, this is the book for you. The ending isn't all that great, but the story itself is interesting and suspenseful.

The time traveler first went back in time and told the people about the people about his journy. Next he talk about how he had lost the time machine how he got it back."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This story gets right to the point. There is no character development (in fact, none of the characters are even identified by their name, besides Weena), and there are no tangents this book goes off on. It is, plain and simple, a story about a man who creates a time machine, goes into the future, and returns to tell about it. We are given a glimpse into Wells' idea of the future, and by today's standard, it is pretty tame. I was intrigued with how the Time Traveller first observed the Eloi people, how the evolution of human beings turns them into an androgynous species, phasing out the need for competition, conflict, and strength, resulting in a communist-like existence, though. And how these traits are signs of weakness, whereas sloth and a child-like intellect are admirable qualities. I felt that the Morlock were portrayed unfairly, as bad creatures because they were industrial and underground. Much like the working class of today, the Morlock are the flesh and blood of society; however, they are treated unfairly. They provide all the necessities for the Eloi, yet, they get nothing in return from them. The Eloi simply throw them a necessity (air) that they should take no credit for and have no control over. Of course this is going to lead to conflict and upset the Morlock. I'm sure this novel blew people away when it first was introduced, but it didn't do anything for me today."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I am reviewing The Time Machine. The Time Machine is written by H.G. Wells, it is a very good book. The author uses a wide variety of vocabulary. He uses metaphors and generally gets the point across fairly well, despite the confusing topic. The Time Machine is basically a window into the future. Wells is showing us what he thinks the world will be like in the future if we don&iexcl;t change our ways. That society will divide itself into two, the &iexcl;corrupt capitalist&iexcl;, and the &iexcl;moral people&iexcl;. The corrupt portion of society is represented by the Morlocks. The Morlocks are ugly creatures that live deep underground that only come out to prey on the innocent surface dwellers. You know that he is trying to convey that these were the business people by the use of machines. The Morlocks have many types of machines that supply the surface dwellers with clothes and all the supplies they need. The Morlocks only go up to the surface at night to &iexcl;harvest&iexcl; the surface dwellers.Wells represents the moral part of society as the surface dwellers. The surface dwellers live in an ideal utopia with nothing to fear during the day, but as night approaches are scared to venture outside. This is a very good metaphor for how society is now. The &iexcl;moral&iexcl; people of today are scared to go in the night to the more crime- inflicted parts of society. The Morlock society is the gangs and the streets they live on, and the surface dwellers are the law-abiding people that go to work everyday. The Time Machine is a very good book if you are into opinions, because this book is really just one mans opinion of how the world will be in the future. Even though Wells takes a long time to get to the main plot of his story I think that it all adds to the suspense of the story. I would recommend this book to anyone that is into science fiction....."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time MachineH.G.

Wells is the story of a scientist that is trying to prove that the world not only is three dimensional, but four dimensional. That fourth dimension is the ability to travel though time. To try to prove his point he develops a time machine to show that it is possible to travel through time. He uses the time machine to travel into the future throughout the entire book, where he finds friends and foes, and simple and complex environments. In my opinion this book was probably one of the worst books I've read in a long time. I found the story of the entire book to be boring and unentertaining because the plot itself was very basic and not very deep compared to some of the other books I have to read at a high school level. I feel that this book is more suitable for a 4th or 5th grade reader, or it would work for an elementary school teacher to use as an introduction to science fiction novels for his or her students. I also feel that the book could have ended sooner. After he gets his time machine back from the Morlocks, he goes even farther into the future to a place that I think contributes nothing to the overall story. What he should have done is after he escapes from the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks, he should have gone back in time instead of forward into his own home and end the story there. In the book when he goes even further in time. He lands on a sloping beach and mentions that it has vegetation covering the entire surface facing the unmoving sun. He also mentions seeing many giant crabs and giant butterflies on that same beach. As he goes even farther into the future he just finds even more crabs.

First, he proves his theory of there being a fourth dimension. Then, he travels into the future and tells his fellow scientists about his adventure.My favorite part of the book would have to be when the Time Traveler meets Weena, one of the Eloi's, in the future.

It gets you thinking if it really is possible to travel in the fourth demension back in time and forward as well. Thats just the beginning, like a hook in a sense. Once your hooked then he really starts to throw some ideas at you.What I really loved was the fact that he expressed his ideas in a brief but concise way so that it made you develop your own ideas on what might life might be like and also draw conclusions to society as a whole. In the future it seems as though there are two classes and it really makes you think about the theory of darwin and survival of the fittest. In the book one society lives the good life and others do what seems like slave labor below ground as if they are inferior. This intrigueged me because it brought to mind slavery here in the U.S. And it made me wonder if things in society continue like they are will this be what it will be like? Such a huge sociatal gap between classes. It seems as though we are moving away from driscrimination however is it all just a cover up? Is disrimination just much more hidden these days? A.G.

The last setting was on he beach with the huge crabs even further into the future.The main problem was that the Morlocks had stollen the Time Machine and he was afraid that he was going to be stuck there forever. This problem was solved because the Morlocks tricked the Time Traveller into going into the shpinx to retrieve his Time Machine. The Morlocks were waiting inside for him, and as soon as he came in, they attacked. The Time Traveller struggled to get away and finally he pushed the lever forward and went farther into the future.All in all this book was pretty boring and slow. There was only about one exciting part. It wasn't a very good book.Book review By: C.D."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The time traveler lands on \\"Eloi world\\" and the Eloi think he is some kind of god. I liked that part because that i thought it was sort of funny how the Eloi were all so interested in him like a child with a new toy. I liked the part where Weena was drowning and the Time Traveler saved her. I liked it because the Time Traveler had a heroic moment. Every book needs a hero.The book has 3 settings. The first setting was at the Time Traveler's house in England some time in the very late 1800's. Here the dinner guests learn for the first time of the Time Machine and the Time Traveler's plans. After that night he goes to the land of the Eloi before anyone could see him 1 more time before his trip. this would be the second setting. Here, in the year of 802,701 he meets Weena. He also meets up with the Morlock who eat Weena's race, the Eloi (a very weak people), for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. He finally finds his Time Machine after the Morlocks hide it from him and he geos in tio the future to escape them. This is the 3rd setting. There are huge crabs and nothing but beach.The main conflict is when the Morl;ocks take his time Machine and hid it in the bronze sphinx. He was stuck in the future with no escape. In the end, though, he escaped to his Time Machine while fighting the Morlocks. -M.M.-"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book has its ups and downs. Like one moment it would be really suspenseful and descriptive then the next it would just have words that mean nothing. I did like the ideas and how the author used them. I definitely think this book could/should have been a lot longer than it was. At certain points it seems like it just gets cut off and just makes me lose my attention to the book.Some of the twists in this book seem kind of weird and/or obvious that they would happen in the future. I won't say which ones they are because I don't want to give away anything to those who want to read it still.Things I liked about this book. I like the way H.G.

These are two things people have poked at for a long time. The Time Traveler has built a time machine to prove his theory of time travel, \\"There is no differance between time and any of the three dimension of space except that our consciounsness moves it along.\\" He goes vastly into time to have evidence to show his unbelieving comrads that time travel is possible. From his time machine he flys past the future watching things being destroyed, built, people die, right in front of his eyes in a matter of seconds. He stops his time machine in the year of 802,701. It seems peaceful with the child-like people, Eloi, and the beauty that surrounds him, but little does he know about the evil that lurks beneath the ground. What is this eveil and what do they want? Does the Eloi know about this threat? Will the Eloi and the Time Traveler be safe? Read it to find out!!!!THis is one of my favorite books that I have read. It's kind of hard to explain why I like it, because I'm a random person who likes random books, but it's one of those books that you read it and love it. I really want whoever is reading this to read this wonderful book. Although, since this book has a movie, some people watch the movie then read the book. I do not reccomend that because they totally warped the story on the movie, so it's nothing like the book. I say the book is so much better, so that you'll read before you watch!

I'm sure this was entertaining enugh when it first came out, but it's not today. We are too spoiled...

Greg Bear is an amazing award winning sci-fi writer in his own right (Blood Music, EON) and reading his introduction to the Time Machine not only illuminates the text, but it also gives us a peak into his own mind. Bear deftly discusses Wells's scientific influences, the scientific culture of his time, and Wells's role in nearly single-handedly creating the sci-fi genre.

The story is simple, short, yet exceptionally profound. The story encompasses a time traveler who goes 800,000 years into the future, only to find that human evolution is far from what anyone would expect; the result being a lesson on our own society of classes.Perhaps most intriguing about this masterpiece is that Wells wrote it in the late 1800s, a time before the phone, plane, radio, TV, automobile, computer, and a plethora of other present day common advancements. Yet Well's depiction of the future suffers no technical shortcomings, a remarkable feat when considering the multitude of writers so often well of the mark from even decades ago. Yet Well's future, a staggering 800,000 years ahead of our time, is completely believable, having stood the test of time for over a century. This perhaps is the essence of the accolades attributed to the Time Machine.If you have an interest in science fiction, the Time Machine should be your very first stop."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The time machine by H.G.

Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, and HG Wells have led the list, but Wells is the most consistently satisfying. He mixes technology and suspense with ethical questions of what we often call \\"progress.\\"\\"The Time Machine\\" introduces us to the Time Traveller, a scientist who has figured a way to use the Fourth Dimension, Time, to his advantage. The story is told by the the Traveller, his words recorded by an unbiased listener. This gives it a sense of credibility, while forsaking some of the tension that a more modern tale would build by putting us directly in the protagonist's shoes. The story is fast-paced, but lacks the wide-ranging adventure I expected. We see only one period of time in detail--the future, hundreds of thousands of years from now--and the action is limited to the last third of the book.Wells grew up in the shadow of Darwinian thinking, a time that must have been wide-ranging and unnerving in its effects on mankind's thinking to that point. As in his other books, he seems more interested in considering this evolutionary march and its eventual outcome. In \\"The Time Machine\\" he suggests that the pinnacle of mankind's evolution would, in fact, be a regression. The very change and conflict that force us into intelligent responses and reactions would be gone, leaving us to revert to childlike states of innocence, fearlessness, asexuality, and laziness. Or, in a more frightening result, some would become more animalistic and predatory, held down by the higher thinkers but always ready for revolt.Wells explored genetic manipulation in \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\\" and scientific discovery in \\"The Invisible Man.\\" In neither case did society benefit from such progress. \\"The Time Machine\\" examines progress from the future. Again, he offers a gloomy outlook, a cautionary tale that still resonates despite its references to communism and British colonialism. He was a true visionary, grappling with the discoveries of his own age and trying to balance them with his own social and ethical quandaries."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"With a Kindle in one's hands, downloading and reading many older books that are no longer in copyright is both free and simple. Having thus come into possession of H.G. Wells' The Time Machine the other day by way of experimenting with the Kindle, I found myself reading it at once, and so, almost without meaning to begin it, I've finished. In the book, first published in 1895, an unidentified narrator relates what he and others were told by the so-called Time Traveller, at whose house they were accustomed to congregate on successive Thursdays. The Time Traveller had built a time machine which he showed to the assembled one week. The following week, arriving at his own house for dinner late, sockless, and apparently injured, he told them of the experiences he'd had in the future since their last meeting. The Time Traveller had in fact gone very far into the future, looking to discover the ultimate fate of the earth, but he spent most of his time in the year 802,701. There he was greeted by strange descendants of humanity, the Eloi--small, childlike, sexless, pasty people, all of them having \\"the same girlish rotundity of limb.\\" They spoke an uncomplicated, mellifluous language and all dressed similarly. (Here is the antecedent for that Star Trek trope, noted by Jerry Seinfeld, wherein everyone in the future always wears the same outfit.) The Eloi were strangely uninquisitive, apparently fearless, and they seemed to live in a sort of paradise, where man had thoroughly subjugated nature to his needs and, having nothing further to fear or for which to strive, had become soft. So, at least, the Time Traveller thought at first. But his first impressions turned out to be horribly mistaken, and the novel, in the end, is deeply pessimistic about the ultimate progress of mankind, Wells having taken the development of the relationship between the haves and the have-nots to its distressing extreme.-- Debra Hamel"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a great novel. This book took Sci-fi to a whole new level. The Time Machine is about a man only known as the \\"Time Traveler\\", who invents a time machine in the 1800's and travels through time, obviously, and comes across an Earth where human civilization has fallen to evolution. And when the Time Traveler goes back to his time machine it isn't there, it just disappeared he then finds that Earth is inhabited by little people that speak a completely different language than English, an that the buildings were taken back by mother nature. The Time Traveler eventually learns there weird language and befriends a female \\"native\\", but there is a dark side to all of this, there are the Morlocks; a nocturnal peoples that somewhat harvest these other little people and eat them. These Morlocks live in caverns underground, and are thought to be the \\"Working Class\\", that moved underground to work in factories. As time went on they just lived there and broke away from the \\"Upper Class\\" aka the little people, and thus the Morlocks where created, but when food ran out the Morlocks turned to cannibalism and started to catch and eat the little people. The Time Traveler eventually figures out the Morlocks have taken his time machine which he gets back after fighting off a horde of Morlocks and he goes back in time to tell his tale to few friends. He then goes back into the future and is never seen again. This is a great read for anyone, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a good scientific book that is based on time traveling. In this book there is the time traveler and the narrator. The narrator take the lead roll when the book is talking about the meetings the time traveler has at his house. As the story starts out, the time traveler creates a miniature time machine that disappears in front of the narrator and the guests. When the time traveler goes into the future with his time machine, he stops in the year 802,702 AD. He sees the small, robbed creatures that are called Eloi. At first he tries to learn their language, but they get bored and go away. As he is discovering the land, the other creatures, Morlocks, stole his time machine and put it in the Sphinx statue. When he discovers his time machine is missing, he panics and scares the Eloi. Then on his adventure of discovering the land again he comes across wells and quickly learns that there are creatures down there. Before he enters the wells, he saves an Eloi from the river. This Eloi's name is Weena. The time traveler figures out the Eloi are scared of the dark because the Morlocks attack them in the dark. After the time traveler goes into the wells and scares the Morlocks with fire, he returns to the land and runs away to a safe place, Palace of Green Poreclain. with Weena. When he discovers that the Palace of Green Poreclain is a museum, he gets flammable substance and matches, which are not around in this time. On there way back to the Sphinx statue he and Weena are attacked by the Morlocks. The time traveler sets a small fire to keep them safe, which inturns creates a large forest fire. During the forest fire the Morlocks take Weena, so the time traveler follows them in hope to find safety and Weena. When he gets back to the Sphinx he finds that the door is open so he goes in and the Morlocks close the door so the time traveler can not escape. With the time machine right in front of his eyes he fights off the Morlocks and shoots into the future, where he discovers the end of time. As he goes back in time to tell his story he gets to his laboratory and forgets what happened to him. Then he tells everyone he will be back in a half an hour to gather evidence that he traveled he never comes back. Again I liked this book because it was easy to put your self with the time traveler and go through all of his experiences."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells had a knack for turning the Victorian worldview upside down. In \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" Martian invaders assault imperial Britain and slaughter the inhabitants like bushmen in the Kalahari desert. In \\"The Time Machine,\\" Wells sketched a world where capitalist social relations have led to grotesque evolutionary changes. Both books are throught-provoking and superbly written. They belong to the science fiction canon.\\"The Time Machine\\" tells the story of a Londoner of 1895 who travels 800,000 years into the future, to an age when mankind has split into two separate species. One group, the spawn of capitalist ease and affluence, has been reduced to the mental and physical level of children; the other group has become feral after eons of industrial toil. Neither group is human any longer; culture and intelligence have died out forever. In fact, with the social tables turned, the \\"lower\\" orders now use their \\"betters\\" as a food source!Wells' vision of human decline was subversive and eloquent, and offered a wry counterpoint to the Victorian cult of progress. The penultimate chapter -- in which the time traveler voyages 30 million years into the future, to an era when the sun is dying, humanity is long-extinct, and lichens have inherited the earth -- is heartbreaking. Six stars!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Written by H.G Wells in late19th century London, the style, pace, and language used in the book are what you would expect from an English book of that time. Very old fashioned and complex- but beautiful and captivating. The Time Machine has become an undisputed classic, almost everyone has read it. A short book, it is only 123 short pages, but a powerful and moving one. Raising legitimate and puzzling questions about the future of the human race, and illustrating just how easily humans can be reduced to animalistic behavior make this book more than just a light hearted adventure story. The Time Machine makes you seriously think, and takes you on one hell of an adventure along the way.Although it was written in England more than 100 years ago, it was far ahead of its time. Ironically, I believe this old, English book to be the quintessential modern American novel. Why? It's short, fast paced, action packed, highly enjoyable, and easily digestible. Sounds what Americans nowadays look for n books, music, and movies doesn't it? At the same time, it brings up serious questions about the fate of humanity and invokes powerful emotions. All books have some problems, and The Time Machine is no exception. Despite its flaws, it is a \\"timeless\\" classic.Strong points of The Time Machine include lovely prose, ingenious plotting, perfect pacing and rhythm, thought provoking and meaningful questions, and a clearly expressed distaste (on the part of H.G. Wells) for theatrical devices, conformity and predictability that so often haunt most books (even those that have attained \\"classic\\" status). Wells does do a fantastic, and nearly unrivaled, (so far as I've read) job of describing emotions and feelings, particularly negative ones: \\"I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind - a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and crying upon god and fate.\\"Unfortunately, Wells falls short in some aspects just as much as he excels in others. The imagery and synesthesia is underdeveloped (one reason for the brevity of the book), the story is everything. Wells has great ideas and stories, but can't develop a character for his life. Mysterious (in a bad way) characters, most of which have no names, are given no physical descriptions, no information is given about their background, and no impression of their true temperament revealed. In fact, he can't really describe anything (characters, animals, buildings, scenery, etc) beyond vague measurements. That being said, this does not detract from the book at all. Some of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of all time (including everything by Asimov) all suffer from these problems. It's just the way Sci-Fi is written.Characterization in the book was weak, so there is not much to say about the unnamed \\"Time Traveler.\\" We know he is male, and we know he is a brilliant scientist that lives in the 19th century. No family history or background information is given, and we have no idea what he was doing before the story began, or what his life is really like. He has one objective: to find out what happens to the human race in the future.Through the rest of the book we do learn a little more about him, and gradually we come to realize that he is a good deal more complicated than one might first assume. The beginning of the story sees his arrival in the future as a composed and intellectual man. From the point his time machine is stolen on, he goes through a transformation. Desperate and isolated in a strange new world, he becomes over-emotional, upset, frustrated, and seriously disturbed at finding the human race in its current state. As he learns more about his future society, his own humanity begins to slip away. Anger, hatred, vengeance, sadism, replace his previous feelings of helplessness. \\"I could hear the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I was free. The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me.\\" This transformation happens in a matter of days. H.G. Wells is trying to show that given the right circumstances, how easily a supposedly \\"refined\\" and \\"civilized\\" can be reduced into a snarling beast. Or in the case of all humanity, simple and ignorant children.\\"It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\\""},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells introduced the concept of time travel in literature, and this book is nothing short of magnificent. I only wish it was longer. I wanted to hear more about the protagonist's theories on time travel and more about how he came up with the idea for the machine. I wanted to know more about the worlds he saw after the first one, in which 95% of the story takes place. I wanted questions about that world answered. Like so many others who read this book, I couldn't get enough. This book is a treasure to be cherished."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I enjoy science fiction stories with a focus on time travel, and The Time Machine is probably chronologically the first book that falls into this category. The story is told in first person by the unamed Time Traveler upon return from his first venture into the future. There are no paradoxes, plot twists, or complicated interweaving time travel stories like much of the genre focuses on today. Instead, it's just a short tail from an average man thrust far into the future, observing the evolution of humanity, where eons have branched the race into an above ground species of docile vegetarian humanoids called the Eloi, and an underground dwelling carnivorous race known as the Morlocks. The story is well written with a certain elegant simplicity and realism to it, which has aged rather well by not focusing too much on the technology or science, but in the adventure instead.Without revealing too many spoilers, my biggest complaint of the book would be the actions of the Morlocks. Meant to be a fear inducing race of underground monsters, they appeared to me more a bunch of underground monkeys with little actual threat to anyone but the docile and helpless Eloi. Perhaps corrupted by modern day thrillers and horror movies, I found the Morlocks a very unintimidating group of monsters. Although the first descriptions of them crawling about the wells could make the hair on your neck stand up, you later realize that our Time Traveling protagonist is able to escape simply by beating them back with an iron lever and clearing his path with the light of matches (blinding their subterraneum adapted eyes). However, this might help with the realistic nature of the book which I previously mentioned. In many stories told today, the protagonist heroically escapes when all odds are against him. The survival of the Time Traveler, a 19th century tinkerer of mechanical things, would be less certain and believable if the Morlocks were a more formidable enemy.On a final note, I don't know why there are two Kindle editions of The Time Machine, with this one labeled \\"ORIGINAL VERSION\\". I downloaded them both and as far as I can tell they're identical."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Having been familiar with the basic story of \\"The Time Machine\\" long before I read it, I was somewhat surprised by the style in which Wells told the story. It is a frame narrative in which a dinner guest of the Time Traveller (for he has no other name) recounts his association with the main character who then recounts his experiences of traveling far into the future. With \\"The Time Machine\\" H.G. Wells truly helped to usher in an entire new genre of writing - science fiction, much more so than Jules Verne before him.\\"The Time Machine\\" recounts the journey of the Time Traveller into the distant future where the human race has devolved (rather than evolved) into two species, the frail and beautiful Eloi and the underground dwelling, cannibalistic Morlocks. The Time Traveller hopes to discover how the planet Earth devolved to such a point, but the world of the Eloi and Morlocks contains no evidence of what happened. With his time machine locked up by the Morlocks, the Time Traveller must find a way to return to his time before he becomes a delicious meal for the underground slothlike creatures. What he sees on his further journey once he escapes their clutches is a vivid and harrowing picture of what will happen to the planet Earth.Wells wrote six different versions of \\"The Time Machine\\" refining the story with each subsequent version. Knowing there are different variations of the same story makes one curious to read them as well. Wells was a gifted writer and storyteller who had an uncanny ability to combine real world elements with the fantastical and to subtly criticize political and social beliefs without becoming preachy. \\"The Time Machine\\" is a standard bearer of science fiction that will continue to stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"\\"A Perfect World Crumbles\\"By: Cameron WrightH. G. Wells, in his novella, The Time Machine, weaves a tale that at first seems like a simple science fiction. However, it contains many symbolisms about the lifestyle choices of mankind today. The main character's name is never given in the story; he is referred to as \\"The Time Traveler\\". He invents a machine that can travel back and forth throughout the fourth dimension of time. He successfully travels forward approximately eight-hundred thousand years into a time when humanity has been split into two groups: the Eloi and the Morlocks.In the author's depicted future, mankind has undergone extreme favoritism of all living things. Plants, animals, food, etc, have all been winnowed into what is considered best. We act this way even in the present day. For instance, we decide which breed of dog is superior amongst the others and preserve and flourish these select. We feel that we have the right to judge and decide what has the right to exist and what does not. After eight-hundred thousand years of this practice, The Time Traveler has stumbled onto the result of a world with only \\"the perfect fruit\\" and the \\"the perfect animals\\". The Eloi live on the surface of our planet among those that have passed our critique.The Time Traveler notices wells along the ground spread out from each other. For a time, he does not understand what they are. It seems too primitive that a well should exist in the future. He discovers that the wells lead to the underground world where the Morlocks live. The Morlocks act like slaves for the Eloi underneath the planet. They are only allowed to come onto the surface during the night. Earlier, the Time Traveler had noticed that the Eloi sleep in clumps huddled together during the night. This is because they are afraid of the Morlocks.After living a life of carefree perfection, the Eloi have become witless and weak. They are unable to fend for themselves and depend on the Morlocks for their sustenance. The Morlocks, on the other hand, have become intelligent and strong. They have worked their entire lives and must fight simply to survive. If they attacked, they would easily be capable of defeating the feeble and delicate Eloi. A rebellion begins, and it is clear that the Morlocks will overtake and kill the Eloi. The Time Traveler is nearly killed, but escapes in his machine before the Morlocks kill him. He goes ahead much further in time and cannot find any human life. We have destroyed ourselves.I believe that the Eloi and the Morlocks resemble today's society. The Morlocks resemble the poor who must earn their right to live through hard work and determination. Like the Morlocks, those that have to diligently work become capable and strong. The Eloi resemble the rich who are handed everything to them. When a person does not need to put effort into anything it is like the dulling of a blade. A blade cannot penetrate anything if it is not sharpened. Work and effort is our sharpener.Another aspect found in this book relating to our society is the devaluing of what we do not think is perfect. Ultimately, if a society is made up of only who we believe is \\"the best-looking\\" or \\"the richest\\" or \\"the most useful\\", etc., while all others are diminished, the society will crumble. When the Time Traveler travels into the future, human life does not exist. We have ceased to live because we have lessened the value of life and imperfections.The Time Machine was and still is a thought provoking novel. It caused me to evaluate the state of modern society. I think that H. G. Wells was ahead of his time. We have begun to see some of his predictions come to pass. The most obvious example would be the cause of World War II, the holocaust. Hitler implemented selective elimination of what he considered to be the weak. Even today, we see our society place value on what we believe is the most beautiful.Reading this book has caused me to assess how I place my values. I have certainly put more value on what is most beautiful or expensive in my life at times. I do not believe that is the way God wishes for us to live our lives or view each other. In the Bible, 1 Corinthians 1:27 states, \\"But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.\\" This shows to me that we should not cherish only what we believe is best, but instead support the weak and less beautiful as well as the greater."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a great read. This is also HG Wells trying to convince us that free markets are bad.Wells fails to convince me that the world will someday devolve to a world where there is a gushy upper class that sits around and eats delicious fruit all day, while an underclass works to provide the fruit. Did I mention the underclass eats the gushy folk up top?Honestly, if you had the ability to eat your competing race, with no retaliation, one of the races would get the picture and make the other go extinct.Despite all the socialist leanings, fallacies and errors in Wells' judgment, I really love this book! Let's be honest for a minute, this is top-notch story-telling at its best! How much creativity does it take to invent a new genre (science fiction) like Wells did? That takes some awesome right there.The price for the book is also right! This thing is cheap! Not even cheap, used and dirty! Just cheap! I think everyone should read this book for fun, not for political insight, but fun.It is also really short. Quick reads are good stuff.I urge you to try it out, all you can lose is 5.95 and a few hours of your life."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This was an interesting read from an author who was far ahead of his time in all of his works.

My opinion about it is that it is excellent. Some of the characters are the Medical Man, the Editor, the Psychologist and more. This book takes place mostly in the future. When the Time Traveler goes into the future, his time machine is stolen by the Morlocks. Can the Time Traveler get his time machine back, stay in one piece, and get back to where he lives?

This book takes place in the late 1800's. It's about a man that discovers methods of time travel. He explains the scientific schematics to his invention to a few of his English buddies.

He tells a descriptive story about his journey through time.I give this book 4 stars for action, drama and suspense."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a great book. I love science-fiction and this is almost the best book I've read. It's about how a man travels into the future with his time machine and finds that the human race has split into two: the beautiful, small, and frail but dumb Eloi and the white, monkey-looking, red-eyed, but ugly Morlocks.

Upon reading the book, I felt that this was an instance where film and book were both done equally well. I enjoyed each version for many different reasons. The movie for it's visual concept. They kept the film pretty much the way H. G. Wells had envisioned it. The book for taking it a little deeper than the movie dared. The movie never deals with the Time Traveller going further ahead into the future, past the time of the Eloi and the Morlocks, to the very near end of the earth and the extinction of the sun. An immensley enjoyable story. Eerie and fun. A great movie too."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I enjoyed this book not just because of the science fiction slant (and HGW does a good job of theorizing time travel), but because of the thinly veiled commentaries, covering everything from class struggles to evolution. The narrative is a bit dry, but hey, I can deal with it, and the fact that this book was written so long ago only adds to the outstanding quality of the plot. A funny note - my edition was published in 1968, the cover showing the traveller materializing against a background of Eloi and Morlocks. The Eloi, as they should be, are represented as slight people covered with flowers, and the front &amp; back covers as well as the intro page emphasize how this book predicted the coming of the &quot;flower children&quot; and how HGW foresaw the peace movement of the 60s. Yeah, it's a stretch, but cute nonetheless..."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book, though has it's ups, i found it boring in some parts.

I read the book for the first time last night, and finished it in less than three hours. The symbolism of the future is clear, but beyond that it is also a really good story. This is how science fiction should read - an adventure around every corner. In addition, HG Wells' superb use of language helps this rise above the myriad of look-alike sci-fi out there today. This would be required reading in my world."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine was an absoultely outstanding book. From all of the other reviewson this book, my thought tend to differ. I think that H.G. Wells not only chose to write this book solely serving entertainment purposes. I think H.G. Wells was also criticizing his social society and his ideas of the injusticies of his day. When Wells grew up, society was strictly divided in half. There were the rich and there were the poor. It boiled down to the fact that the rich kept getting richer and the poor kept becoming poorer. The society lived by Social Darwinism. Seeing how Wells was an author his social status tended to shift from rich to poor. In other words he got a taste of how it was to live through the eyes of the rich and of the poor..just obviously, not simultaneously. Wells, took his changing social status and decided to take it to the extreme. If the rich kept getting richer, they would just want to live more and more simple lives which would eventually lead to the lives of the Eloi. The Eloi were frail people. If the rich people found a way to live on their Heaven on Earth they would eventually become frail and helpless... if you don't use it you lose it. The rich wouldn't have to work and so they could play and relax all day. The poor on the other hand would become forced to live lives similiar to that of the Worlocks. According to just an everyday stereotypical view, out of sight, out of mind. If the poor lived underground the rich could easily forget about them and continue to live their troublefree lives. If the poor lived underground, they would be forced to learn how to relate to their living enviornments... such as the long fingers used for climbing. The Worlocks/ the poor people are forced to turn cannabalistic on the rich/Eloi because they have no other food to eat. It would also serve as an act of revenge, not the eating, but the killing. I think that Wells did a great job supporting his comparison on where the world was headed. He even goes to the extreme and explains the end of the world where there is absolutely nothing in existance."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"&quot;I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands...&quot;Time traveling? Has the thought ever popped into your mind? I'm sure it has, but have you ever thought about it so much, that you wrote a book about it? That's what H. G. Wells has done. In his book, The Time Machine, he has searched his imagination and beyond to bring you excitement.After the time traveler worked many years on his odd-looking creation, he decided to start experimenting with it. In about five minutes, he had already gotten himself into trouble...Dazed and confused, he got out of his time machine, and started to explore his new world. He saw many strange creatures. Most of them fled at the sight of him, but one, was curious. It seemed that she liked the time traveler. He named her Weena, and described her as speaking a strange language, three feet tall, and having short legs. After he discovered his new land with his new companion, he went back to his time machine to find it missing!In my opinion, this book is for children, teens, and adults. Some of the weaknesses of this book are, 1st Wells doesn't describe things in his story too well, and 2nd , he dwells on some things that are not important, and doesn't talk about the things that are important too much. Some of it's strengths are, it's imaginative characters.Other books by H. G. Wells include When The Sleeper Wakes, and The First Men on the Moon.-Jason DiVener"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"An unnamed time traveler sees the future of man (802,701 A.D.) and then the inevitable future of the world.

Some of the details are fascinating as the traveler come to discover the secret of the results of social striation over centuries which eventually creates two separate species from humans. Which species is the more human? Can anything be done to prevent or correct this?I grew up on the Rod Taylor /George Pal movie. When I started the book I expected it to be slightly different with a tad more complexity as with most book/movie relationships. I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too munch.After all the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless. The writing and timing could not have been better. And the ending was certainly appropriate for the world that he describes.

Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is a sci-fi classic in every sense of the word. This book proves that science fiction can stand the test of time. Great sci-fi does not necessarily need to be heavily technical but does need to deal with grand themes. Themes such as the nature of society or man's hopes, dreams, and fears. Wells does not go to great lengths in describing the time machine nor how it works. He lays the foundation of the story in science and then proceeds with his socially conscious story. This makes his writing enjoyable, much more than that of a Jules Verne who can be too scientific and technical. One of the more striking aspects of the novel is Wells' treatment of the actual experience of time travel. In his story moving through time is not like opening a door and walking through it. There are physical and emotional aspects of time travel. Indeed some of the most descriptive passages in the book are those describing what the Time Traveler experiences and sees during his time shifts.Wells seems to be posing the question of What will man be like in the distant future, a question he later answers in a way that could be considered bizarre and is definitely unlike any other most would come up with. His answer gives birth to a simple and tragic society made up of the Eloi and the Morlocks. Through these two groups, he offers a critique of the sorts of men in his own time. Clearly, he is worried about class gaps the dangers posed by such a growing rift.It was interesting to see how the Time Traveler's views of the future change over the course of his stay there. At first, he thinks the Morlocks, who are stuck underground, have been forced to do all the work while the Eloi on the surface play in perpetual leisure. Later, he realizes that the truth is more complicated. The whole book seems to be a warning for his time and ours. The future human society that the Time Traveler finds is supposedly ideal but the great works of man have been lost and human beings have become little more than children.This basic message of this novel is more than applicable today. While science and technology are important, we must not come to view science as a religion. Knowledge itself is far less important than the healthy pursuit of that knowledge. Man's greatness lies in his ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. I think this novel also points to the importance of individualism and free society."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"As a reader of many books I would say this is a good read. H.G. Wells brings some wild imagination to reality. As the time traveller travelled into the future he did some strange things but encountered many dangers. As a complete story I would say for a quick read or for people who read small novels this is very good.The 4 star rating means for fiction well done. But 5 stars would be a bit too much because it isn't long or a novel that goes extremely deep. For children maybe a 5 but for adults or college students it's satisfactory and a bit fun.The future is something we will always dream about. I truly suggest this book if you want some imagination about the future or some adventure."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In regard to the plot and story- The Time Machine is head and shoulders above other Wells stories. The story and plot are eerily believable (in regard to future society), and very interesting. Wells obviously wants to make a point about the dangers of having a society with large, clear class distinctions and tries to make the connection between class distinction and oppression. This is clearly a belief coming from socialism.Although the philosophy and politics behind this science fiction story are lacking (for me personally)- I thoroughly enjoyed the story itself. The development of the story comes along nicely- enticing the reader to indulge his imagination just a little bit more. I enjoy stories that always keep you guessing, and The Time Machine is a story that keeps you on your feet. Who are the good guys? What happened to the machine? What are the fuzzy things? What are the dark-dwelling beings? These and other questions reflect the suspense aspect of this story. The book is very short and easy to read. I read it easily in one evening. I don't consider myself a fan of science fiction- but this book was enjoyable through and through."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Not the easiest to read but worth the while, as most classics are. Although it's one of those books where, I would say, it really doesn't matter whether you watch the movie before or after."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Year is 802,701; no man has ever set foot on this pristine frontier. But is it just that. The Time Traveler, a wealthy mastermind has discovered the fourth dimension. Only two races of people now exist, the Eloi and the Morlocks. The first group is childish creatures. The second live in a world of absolute darkness.When the Time Traveler arrives at this seemingly perfect paradise, his time machine is mysteriously missing. Out to find who had taken his only ticket back to his own time period, he encounters many breathtaking events.For example, as he walks many miles with his new Eloi companion Weena, he must explore the under-world of the Morlocks. As he enters the dark corroded steel tunnels, the like humans start to attack him. His only weapon against them is his scarce supply of matches. As he scrambles for an escape he notices is a slab of meat on the floor, what could this puzzling piece of evidence mean?In my opinion the message in this story is the rise and fall of humanity. Towards the middle of the book, H.G. Wells compares the rise and fall of humanity to the sunset. Technology will rise on a steady incline, then peak and slowly start to fall.I recommend this book to ages 12 and up because there is a lot of sophisticated vocabulary. I had to use a dictionary quite a few times. I give it 4 stars because it is considered a classic book and is often on the suggested reading list. It also gives many deep-thinking situations."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"\\"And, as everyone knows now, he has not yet returned.\\" This ends a marvelous journey forward in time to a place where two \\"species\\" exist. Those descended from the proletariat and those from the ruling class, each with much to tell us about our own time. That is what makes Wells so wonderful. He wrote this story in 1895 about a traveler to a time far in our own future that is very relevant to the present time. Basically, the book speaks of class warfare in a way that elevates neither side. In the end, I was not left thinking how bad one side was, but what both sides could do different to make life better for all. Once again proving, H.G. Wells was a genius in his time, and remains a genius now."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In this sci-fi classic, the entire story hinges upon a scientist's achievement; he built a tiny time machine. He displays the working machine to a bunch of non-believers, shows it disappear, and the other people still don't believe. He ends up testing the real machine, going forward in time, only to find human civilization is split into two species: Eloi - upper-world, gentle, indolent, harmonious, nave, and living in an apparent utopia; Morlocks - subterranean, pallid, carnivorous, and industrious. The Morlocks steal the machine; the guy tries to learn about the new world he is in; he tries to get the machine back; almost gets caught by the Morlocks (which he would have presumably been eaten by); then he eventually goes further in time, ragged, tired, and somewhat bloody. In the new time, he sees a dark red sun, a desolate Earth, and giant lobster/crab beasts. He feels in danger, so he returns to his own time.From this the reader is supposed to learn, to infer what the future is like, how humankind will appear, and what the social structure will be.The time traveler laments what the future society has become. At first, he slightly detests the worry-free Eloi, dancing around all day without a hint of responsibility. Meanwhile, he respects and empathizes with the Morlocks, the grunts of the world. Later, he realizes that the relationship is symbiotic, with a few scary trade-offs.Parallels to this masterpiece are never-ending. When ever there is a situation of \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\", just think of the \\"Eloi\\" and the \\"Morlocks\\"; you might be surprised to find that perception can often be incorrect."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is both an exciting adventure through a world of science fiction, and a grim theory of future human evolution. The novel plots the journey of a scientist who invents a time machine and travels far into the future. In this future he finds two distinct species, one very frail and simple living above ground, and another sinister and dark, living in subterranean caverns. Upon further observation of these two breeds, he finds that the peaceful surface-dwellers are preyed upon by the more hostile subterranean creatures. Through suggestive description such as the factory-like underground and the leisurely lifestyle above, Wells displays that the story is an allegory for the lower and upper classes of American society. Many other details invoke in the reader questions of societal class and how these classes would affect the evolution of mankind. In this way The Time Machine by H.G. Wells acts as a warning to the possibilities of the future and leaves the reader with a new outlook on the relationship between evolution and social class."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"If today's standard of thud-factor were applied, this slim book would barely count as a novel. The problem is in today's standard, not in this book.Knowing that Wells was a social activist and reformer helps in reading this book. Nominally, a mysterious gentleman known only as The Time Traveller builds a mysterious machine, takes a trip to distant futures, and recounts his story - with near total lack of hard evidence. It's a fair tale at that level.His future, however, has humankind split into two species, as if C. P. Snow's two cultures came to life. The Morlocks are the troglodytic technologists, descended from the 19th century laborers who followed the machines in their subterranean serivce corridors. The daylit Eloi epitomize the effete and ineffectual extreme of \\"the artistic temperament,\\" living in gentle and infantile hedonism. Wells created the Eloi from the pampered, cloistered aristocracy of his day. Once exempt from the trials of social Darwinism, they quietly slid into a neotenous perpetual childhood. The Morlocks fared no better. They seem instinct-driven to support the machines that provide for both species, and racially degraded (in the idiom of Wells' era) so far that the concept of morality no longer applies.Once or twice, Wells injects a phrase about \\"brother man\\" to suggest that socialism might have healed the class rift. He never really proposes a solution, though. Instead, he simply explores the extreme of class-level segregation, consuming vs. producing cultures, and chasm between technological and esthetic frames of mind. In the end, divided humanity fails the test of time. The far-distant end of all days is a silent sunset, with no trace of the species that shortsightedly volunteered for extinction.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"1. The Eloi didn't acknowledge the fact that the Time Traveler was from the past, and just didn't care. I didn't like this part because if I were to ever encounter someone from the future I would have been a lot more flabbergasted by the fact that he came from the past using a Time Machine.2. There were many different settings in the book. There was the Time Travelers house, which was where the Time Traveler showed his friends his creation but they thought that he was crazy. There was the future time period when the time traveler found Weena drowning in a lake. Also there was the Sphinx, which was where the Morlocks lived. There was the forest setting where Weena and the Time Traveler get attacked by the Morlocks. Finally, there are the wells, where cloths are sent up for the Eloi, made by the Morlocks.3. The major dilemma in the navel was when the Morlocks were trying to trap the Time Traveler by putting his Time Machine in the Sphinx. They left the door open later on in the book right when the Time Traveler walked by. But when he walked in towards the Time Machine the Morlocks closed the door. They began to attack the Time Traveler but thankfully the Time Traveler got away. So the major problem was that the Time Machine was missing but the problem was resolved by the Time Traveler fighting off the Morlocks.-J.T."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is one of those books I'd been meaning to read for years and finally got around to it this summer. I'm a sci-fi fan and enjoyed Wells's book, which was one of the first well known time travel stories ever written. It's a concise story without any unnecessary fluff, which makes it exciting all the way through."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a fun read about a time traveler who travels into the future some 800,000 years. The Time Travler speculates that humans have split and evolved into two different classes. One class is called the Eloi; they are a group of peaceful communists who have evolved into weak, unintelligent but elegant child-like beings. Strength and intelligence are no longer needed. Working-class humans have evolved into light-sensivite ape-ish beings called Morlocks who live and work underground. After traveling into the future the time machine is stolen, so the Time Traveler has to find a way to get his machine back so he can travel back to his familiar world.Now that I have read H.G. Wells' three most popular science fiction books (The Invisible Man, War of the Worlds and The Time Machine) I have to say that The Time Machine is my favorite of the three. Wells keeps the story short and simple, but very imaginitive."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a book I read once in high school (from the school library), loved it, and for some reason or another have never come back to it again until recently. While scanning through the time travel section, (yes, I am a time travel fiction die hard), this cover caught my attention, and when I noticed it was H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, I decided it was time for me to revisit this classic story and pick up this edition. Wells writes efficiently, never unnecessarily verbose, yet he still paints a fully developed story. While his classic style may be off-putting for those on the short end of the attention span range, I find Wells' style to be elegant and intriguing. It's a milestone in scifi, time travel stories, and even literature as a whole. I enjoyed it as much in my 30s as I did in my teens."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is more than cool, classic sci-fi. It's more than just THE original story to include a scientific rationale to time travel. It's a story that delves into the differences and injustices of class relations. It's a story that considers a burgeoning scientific revolution. And it's a story that explores evolution and the fate of mankind (at the same time as the World is still grapples with Darwin's theory).The story is quite simple. The Time Traveller (TTT - no name is given) creates a machine that's able to travel through time. TTT demonstrates, in miniature, how the machine works and then travels himself, in full scale, 800,000 years into the future. The narration is handled by The Writer (also no name is given) who witnesses the miniature demonstration and is present when TTT returns from his trip to the future.TTT finds himself in a future inhabitated by the child-like Eloi living a vegetarian and almost Luddite existence. The Eloi are innocent, fun-loving, sympathetic simpletons. When his time machine disappears, TTT explores this future land and ultimately discovers the Eloi's underground-dwelling symbiotic cousins - the Morlocks. Symbollically, the Eloi serve the role of aristocracy, patrician, or white collar; while the Morlocks serve the role as commonor, plebian, proletariat or blue collar. The Morlocks are carnivores (you can guess where they get their meat), and industrial, who can only see in the dark and are afraid of fire and the light.After battle the Morlocks and losing his one Eloi friend, Weena, TTT recovers his Time Machine and launches himself further into the future.The image of a desolate, grim far-future inhabited only by large crab-like creatures is as haunting and memorable to me as an adult as it was when I first read it 20+ years ago. The Signet edition of The Time Machine includes one additional future vignette that was edited out of the definitive edition of the story. This additional scene precedes TTT's visit to the crab-beach. He finds what he believes to be the last vestiges of humanity having taken the shape of large grey formless rabbits who are hunted by enormous caterpillars. These few additional pages evoke the same creepiness as the beach crabs and are a nice complement to the original story.TTT relates his journey at a dinner party at his home. We view his adventure and discourse through The Writer's detailed account of TTT's return. English society is represented at the dinner party and, naturally, nobody quite believes the tale.Modern scifi stalwart Greg Bear writes an introduction to the Signet addition and provides informative context to the story, it's place in writing history, and background on H.G.

Humanity, he notices, has evolved into two distinct races; one that lives an idyllic, vegetarian, carefree life and appeared to him as unintelligent and androgynous (evolved from the aristocratic class of his times), and a subterranean race that preys on the former (evolved from the working class). In some sense, what the time traveler notices is already here; you can see it coming to play in certain prosperous regions of the world with decadency setting in; or, perhaps, the morlocks are going to be the machines that increasingly control our lives, (the GPS in our car and the like) without which we are starting to lose our bearings even in our own neighborhood.

A classic for a reason"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is the grand-daddy of them all - the first story to feature time-travel. Every time-travel story written or screened since owes something to this. It's been years since I first read the story and on re-reading again after so long I realised how much my recollection of it had been coloured by the various cinematic interpretations I had seen in the intervening years. This is the original, without the Hollywood extras (and it does not suffer for that loss), a tale of an eccentric inventor who devises a means to travel through time and in doing so discovers the sad fate of mankind in the distant future - one which he is powerless to alter."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"It's a classic.

It's look into the future feels plausible which is a feat given how long ago it was written.What disappointed me: I saw the movie first and it was very different. And in my opinion, better. I just could not get into the interactions with the races, which was the bulk of the story. I found myself much more interested in how he traveled as opposed to where and when he traveled to.Recommended: Not especially. I much prefer the movie."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Time traveling has proved to be an endless resource for the imagination of people. This book tells the story of a man who goes 800000 years forward in time, to a future where the world population is divided into two species, the Eloi and the Morlocks. It is captivating and thought provoking and I warmly recommend it as a captivating read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"It's surprising that it has taken me this long to finally pick up this sci-fi classic and actually read it. H.G. Wells's classic tale of time travel to the distant future is where every story on the subject originates from and pays homage to. Unlike many time travel stories, this one doesn't travel through both space and time, meaning that the action takes place in the same place, if just thousands of years later. And it is certainly an interesting tale that is worthy of the title \\"classic.\\" Yet I found the themes of the book to be well-trod. Nearly all time travel stories start off with the premise that either the past or the future was/is better than the present, which is then shattered in the course of the tale. Here, the Time Traveller, who is never named, finds that his initially rosy hypothesis on mankind's evolution into harmony with the natural world is completely wrong and that mankind has devolved (or evolved) into the monstrous Morlocks and the cattle-like Eloi. But, like I said, this theme is common to many time travel stories, the only novelty being that this is, literally, the first time anyone wrote about it. Thus, it is not as great a story as I had imagined it to be, but it is still worth the time of any sci-fi fan. The Time Machine is also good for young readers (say, middle school and up) who are coming out of youth novels and are interested in science fiction."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"What a great read this was.

Therefore, this review is not about the story, but the edition of the book itself. It's very difficult to find a hardcover version of such a small book. The binding on this edition is great and doesn't feel cheap. The paper quality is good for the price. Overall, I would have given it 5 stars if not for one gripe: They included illustrations. I was most disappointed to see pictures which did not match up to my grandiose visualizations of the book's many amazing locations. The cartoony representation of the Eloi was my least favorite part. They looked more like the dwarves from Snow White than the graceful, diminutive people which they were described as. If you can get past the visual setbacks, this would be a nice edition to have on hand for those \\"I'm really in the mood to re-read it\\" times."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I very much enjoyed Wells' writing. The atmosphere of joining a group of people in a room while listening to the Time traveler's experiences was quite mesmerizing. The adventure and worlds he elegantly paints are definitely images that still wander in my mind after finishing the book. It appears as if Wells has built a social criticism of his times and the future it awaits, although I cannot help thinking that he is encapsulating the dichotomy of humanity in a story of the future. Regardless, a very enjoyable and short read reaching into the Victorian realm of fantasy and science fiction. I will definitely pursue more of his works as well as take a peek at his nonfiction. Apparently he wrote all his famous stories as a young man in his 20s."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This was my first book to read to completion on a kindle.During my high school years if I was forced to read a book, I hated them. Now in my thirties I am pleasantly surprised to find that the banes of my literary education are actually worth reading. I never had to read \\"The Time machine\\" before, but chose to since I have seen both movies (1960 and 2002).The book was a pleasant read. The narrator was not the Time Traveler himself, but a person who wrote down the time traveler's story as he unfolded it after his immediate return from the distant future. This gives an interesting writing technique from Mr Wells in that he is writing the story as if he were the person present at the telling of the time traveler's tale and was merely a scribe to its unfolding. Like all good time travel stories the rules are first explained in generalities at the beginning as the time traveler reveals that time is the 4th dimension and he has discovered a way to move about it was we do in the other 3 dimensions (X,Y,Z axis of a plane).The movie makers certainly took some liberties as there was never a stopping point between his leaving the present to the stopping at the year 802,701 AD. The stops along the way were added for effect to both movies as, published in 1895, Mr. Wells would have no foreknowledge of World War I nor II nor any nuclear bombing to which the movies allude.The bulk of the story continues in the distant future where mankind has evolved/devolved into two separate races the above ground Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. There are numerous political/social commentaries about the book which others explain in much better detail, but I will say that they are not missed by even a novice such as I.The story has a wonderful flow and I found I couldn't put it down.The Kindle version includes a preview of the book \\"The Map of Time,\\" by Felix J. Palma."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a classic among science fiction books, and helped define the genre. The story is simple, short, yet deeply meaningful. The story encompasses a time traveler who goes 800,000 years into the future, only to find that human evolution is not quite what he expected; think idiocracy. The result being a lesson on our own society of classes.The book doesn't get excessively technical and that never has been what sci fi is truly about. It tackles sociological issues like communism vs individualism and placing excessive faith in technology.Perhaps most intriguing about this masterpiece is that Wells wrote it in the late 1800s, a time before cell phones, flat screen tvs, automobile, computer, and a range of other present day common advancements. Yet Well's depiction of the future suffers no technical shortcomings, a remarkable feat when considering the multitude of writers so often well of the mark from even decades ago. Again this is because he focuses on how and why we use technology not the minutiae of how they are made.If you have an interest in science fiction, the Time Machine should be on your list."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a very interesting book about a man(referred to as \\"The Time Traveler\\")'s adventures in the future. While there, he loses his time machine and has to go through many trials of courage, ingenuity, and curiosity. The Time Machine speculates greatly on what would happen by the year 802,701. The Traveler surmises that at some point in time, the human race achieved perfect social equilibrium. His theory evolves and grows as he learns more and more about the future. Throughout the book, though, it is always asserted that these theories are assumed from his surroundings, not correct per se. This leaves a nice touch of uncertainty that makes this book so enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I picked this book up because it was a freebee on Kindle, but I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality. The book tells the story of a scientist identified only as \\"the Time Traveller,\\" who invents a time machine and travels far in the future into a time where humans have evolved into simpler beings, the Eloi, who live above ground, and the Morlocks, who live below ground. The Time Traveller surmises that the split in the race resulted from a division of the classes, with the upper class Eloi living above ground and the working classes reduced to live underground. With all of their needs taken care of, the Eloi eventually atrophied, mentally and physically, being reduced to weak and simple beings. The Morlocks, on the other hand, became so accustomed to living in the dark that they lost their ability to live in the sunshine, only coming to the surface to satisfy their need for meat by cannabalism.I thought the book was well written (though it clearly reads like a book written in 1895) and think the author raised several interesting philosophical points. For example, he stated his belief that people (as well as societies) need challenges and hardships to stay sharp and to grow, and that while achieving a \\"perfect civilization\\" is a laudable goal, when outside circumstances change, that perfect civilization may not be so perfect any more."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I had just finished David Copperfield and needed a shorter, lighter read.

The machine was stolen by the evil creatures of the future, Morlocks. These ape-like animals took the Time Machine and moved it into the great white sphinx.

The author put in too muchh detail into parts that didnt seem very important or exciting just dull and confusing.Overall, I did not really enjoy this book but I am not much of a science-fiction person. I found this book to be very boring and hard to understand. It might be a good book for people who enjoy novels that are very thorough and scientific.

Not only were the words difficult to understand, but also it was so boring and slow that it was hard to pay attention to what I was reading. I enjoy books that are realistic fiction. The Time Machine was so impossible that it was hard to read it without laughing. The romance was very weak and the suspicion was nonexistent. I found this book a waste of time to read. If we really could travel in time I would go back and never have read this book. The characters are truly shallow and have very little emotion. The climax was weak, but the story line was even worse. I would never recommend The Time Machine to anyone!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Granted Wells was far, far ahead of his time, but really, his writing stinks. There's no character formation (bland unlikeable protagonists) and no passion for the art of storytelling. If he had a writing partner who could of helped him with these shortcomings, his very original ideas and his true vision of what he was trying to write might have come through better. I'm glad he was there to get the ball rolling for science fiction, but I forced myself to read all his books on the hopes and say-so that these were classics.

The story itself wasn't bad but the way it was told was. From the start you know the ending, but then at the end the author make an attempt to change it in a way he did, but in away that it would not have mattered if he did or did not.

Advanced technology and crowded cities, right? In H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, the future is not as mechanical as one might think. In fact, machinery is hardly seen at all! The year 802,701 AD appears to be a utopia, free from strife and the stresses of current life. But, it is later shown that things are not always as they seem!The story begins in the home of a wealthy scientist, known in the book as The Time Traveler. The book takes place in the 1800s in England. The Time Traveler is hosting a dinner party with other scientists. Casually, The Time Traveler begins to introduce his concept of Time Travel with the men. He tells them that he has discovered the fourth dimension: time. In the fourth dimension you do not actually move physically, but through time. The scientists find it hard to believe. A week later, when he is hosting another dinner party, he showed up late, with torn clothes and a haggard look on his face. All of the men are shocked and give him the time he needs to recuperate. After a shower and a little food, the main plot begins, as the Time Traveler begins to tell his tale.The main plot of this story, about a time of apparent peace, is dated in the year 802,701. His first encounter with humans is with a people called the Eloi. They are slim, weak, unintelligent, and good natured. The Time Traveler quickly finds out that even though they are men of the future, they have a mentality of a seven year old! He ends up becoming friends with one of them, a girl named Weena, who happily follows him around after he saved her life. Through her actions he begins to learn their lifestyle, and when she speaks he begins to learn their language. Later, when he was able to translate one of the Eloi's songs, a terrible truth begins to dawn on him. After an encounter with a strange, ape-like creature that climbed down a well, he realized that in this world there are two species of man, the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Morlocks dwell under the ground and only appear during the night. The song of the Eloi describes the Morlocks and what they do. The Morlocks in the story are what turn this future from a utopia to a dystopia. To find out why, read for yourself.The Time Machine is a book full of imagination. The book turns away from the usual descriptions of the future, and throws a completely different spin onto it. Books like these end up stretching your mind just trying to imagine the place they are describing. The illustrated version of the book greatly helps you picture what is actually happening. I would recommend this book to people who don't have a hard time grasping concepts of the unknown such as time travel. The book would have been a better read if I could have gotten past the fact that time travel is not real, and just accepted the story. After all, maybe someday a real time machine will be invented."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"One of the most popular stories of all time, The Time Machine, is a classic to all readers alike. Published in 1895, The Time Machine was H.G. Wells's first novel in his variety of science fiction books. This novel remains to be the most famous one of his collection due to the extreme imagination that he put into it.The main character is only known as the Time Traveller, and we go through his perspective the whole novel. He ends up traveling through time to the future to find that the human race has evolved into two races, the peaceful Eloi who are vegetarians and are tired easily, and the Morlocks who are carnivorous. He struggles to find out why things are this way and eventually finds out. So horrified of the future he returns home to only end up going back. He had the desire to ask why things were as they were, so he went out again to search for the truth. .The basic idea for the novel comes down to one basic question, what will be in the future? Though looking back now and seeing that he was obviously wrong, he still was extremely different in what he thought would be in the future. Looking back now onto what he thought the future would be is a little humorous but still interestingI personally thought that this book was extremely interesting because Wells didn't see the future happy and everything is going to be nice, he thought that the world was going to get worse. To me that's crazy that he would think that things would turn out that way. The one thing that I didn't like in the beginning that I ended up appreciating at the end was his wording. He used big words in the beginning and at first it threw me off but once I really got into the book I could see how useful it was to describe things.Overall I felt that this novel was very good. For anyone who is really into science fiction this is the king of all of them.

You see these weird alien looking creatures. You don't know how to comunicate with them. This is how The Time Traveler, the main character, felt in The Time Machine by H.G.Wells.This book is an alright book. It's about a man known as the time traveler. He hosts a dinner party and tells some of his friends about the four dimensions the last one being time and that men can move in this dimension. He then shows them a machine that did that. The next week or so he organized another dinner party. That time he came late. He comes in all dirty and fatigued he eats and tells them that he went on his time machine and begins to tell them his quest in the year 802701.At first when he gets to the future it is rather slow. Wells writes this part as if it were a science journal. It begins to get better when he loses his time machine to the Morlocks, dark ape-like creatures that control Eloi, which are the creatures he first met. It doesn't get very,very good but it gets better than the beginning.This is where the conflict begins. He then begins a new quest to get his time machine back. I won't say anymore of his new quest you'll have to read it and find out. Overall this was a good book. It describes things pretty well and I would recomend this book to others.

A week later when asked about his worn-out look, he replies, I just returned from the future. The rest of the book is completely made up of him telling his pals about his travel (literally, he is talking the entire time)."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G, Wells is a very renowned science fiction author. Among his works are War of the Worlds and The Time Machine. The Time Machine is a science fiction novel about a professor who builds a mechanism that allows one to travel through time. It isn't a surprise that he is referred to in the story as the time traveler. In the story the time traveler (wait for it) travels through time into a different age, I won't give it away though. Here he is greeted by a small society of people. However, these people who seem so carefree are living in fear, for there is a dark secret which they all must be wary of. The time traveler recognizes this and realizes he must be the one to help them. But as he descends to the world which the people fear most, he too finds himself in a dilemma that will take all his wit to get out of.I enjoyed reading this book mostly because of the its element of mystery and surprise. I think this book deserves a four star rating. It is a must read for fans of sci-fi and I'm sure readers of all types will like The Time Machine if they read it. It is however no more than a week's read, so don't fall into pieces when you come to the end, which will undoubtedly be soon after you begin. The end is a satisfying one though, so don't expect to be left hanging.The Time Machine is a rather unique book, either that or I have not read other works like it. Anyway, the whole aspect of time travel is a fantastic base for the story. To the characters within the story, time travel seems an absurdity and hardly any of them believe it. When the time travel comes back a week later after his adventure begins, well... I'll leave it to you to find out. Don't miss out on this great read.

The 2 species evolved from humans, yet they are completly different. The evolution of the world around them (flint, petrolium, and many other materials have been used up) has caused these species to be nothing more than animals.

The psychological aspects of this story are spectacular, but one thing I am disappointed about is how the Time Traveller labels certain beings as inhuman and, so to say, &quot;bad.&quot; Humans defined what is considered good or bad, civilized or primitive, clean or filthy, and even time itself.

I have by me for my comfort, two strange white flowers now brown and brittle , to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man.

The Time Machine, along with The War of the Worlds stands as one of the first books of modern science fiction. When I was growing up, H.G.Wells had a strong impact on my life. His books always takes the reader into a web of science and imagination. The reader is faced with the horrors and wonders of science and its abilities.

It has quite a bleak view of things to come but a few things give this away as pure fantasy. At first I hated the ending but it leaves your imagination on 10 gallons of fantasy petrol!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells properly deserves the title of the founder of science fiction. His novels are disciplined, very well-written, and devoid of the open ends and sheer fantasy that plague so much of this genre. (See the commentary to my review of War of the Worlds.) The present work deals with Wells's view of the far future. Only a fleeting, rather optimistic, view of the near future is offered in the second chapter.Well's nameless time traveler ventures to the warmer world of 802,701 A.D. and finds man divided into two camps, the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Eloi are a gentle, winsome, idle race, who are served by, (and to), the Morlocks, a subterranean group of more barbaric beings who use the Eloi for food. The Morlocks only come up at night, of course. Many people feel that Wells based this division on the growing disparity between the working class and the English aristocracy. This viewpoint is easily understood.The two latest movies based on this novel destroy both its essence and its meaning, in my view. The movies' intellectual content is zero, whereas the book exhibits Wells's genuine concern over future evolution based on present sociological trends. The book is extremely interesting, and displays the wide range of intellectual gifts enjoyed by this eminent novelist and writer.Perhaps the most fascinating part of the book is the further travels into time, after 802,701 A.D. In the unexpunged version, the time traveler goes into a period where the sun has faded to an orangeish color, and the world is dominated by 30-foot-long insects who prey on the rabbit-sized animal descendants of man. Even more fascinating is Wells' vision of the dimly distant future when the sun has expanded and faded to a reddish hull filling half the sky. The only living thing seen on Earth at that point is a crab-like creature foundering on a cold ocean shore. Wells's phraseology captures this forlorn event better than any movie ever could.The time traveler then returns with only a faded mallow, and a bruise, to show for his troubles. He informs Wells' narrator that he will travel again, but he then disappears, never to return.Wells accurately envisioned then-unkown developments in astronomy, biology, global warming, and physics with startling accuracy, even though his time calculations are amiss. Even today, his ability to create things out of his imagination that have since come to pass is unmatched.The book is entertaining, thought-provoking, and marvelously written; a true gem. I recommend it to one and all, very highly."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine was a very advanced book! It was written in 1895 but still H.G. Wells uses vivid descriptions and has one heck of an imagination. It starts with him in a meeting and he tells his friends of his plans to build a machine to travel through time with. I thought the book would tell about many different trips into the future or past, but it only told of one. The Time Traveller, as the main character is called, tells of his trip millions of years into the future where he encounters an evolved form of the human beings we associate with in our time. When I realized that the book would only be about one trip into the far future, I thought the book would just ramble on about a week or two, but it was surprisingly interesting. I really enjoyed The Time Machine and I thought it was a great book. The only thing that made me give it four stars was how tough some of the concepts were to grasp. You can still read and enjoy the book without totally understanding what it is based off of, but it makes you wonder and really think about all the crazy things H.G. Wells came up with. I thought it was very hard to make sense of everything, but like I said, you can still enjoy the book without understanding everything. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who likes science fantasy."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Devotees of the movie versions of \\"The Time Machine\\" are certain to be surprised by how short and deceptively simple Wells's classic (and first) sci-fi novel really is. He packs an adventure tale, a drawing room comedy, and a social satire in a book no longer than a novella.Everyone knows the basic plot, in which the unnamed Time Traveller races to the year 802,701 and discovers that the human species has split into two: the simple-minded and dependent Eloi, who live on the surface of the planet, and the sinister Morlocks, who keep the planet running from caves while caring for the Eloi exactly as a farmer tends to a herd of cows, supplying them with their basic needs before harvesting them.What may be less familiar to today's readers is Wells's sociological commentary, a morbid version of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs.\\" The aboveground (upstairs) Eloi represent the pampered gentry, while the underground (downstairs) Morlocks are the descendants of the servile classes. Readers may think that Wells is portraying the Morlocks as evil incarnate and the Eloi as \\"innocent\\" victims, but he is actually condemning the human propensity to create such divisions at all. Both sides share the ultimate responsibility for the way things turn out, and the author's contemporaries, both master and servant, surely found the possibility of being either eaten or eater equally loathsome.\\"The Time Machine\\" has proved a major influence on subsequent works of literature. Yet , in addition to being a seminal work of science fiction, it still can be read as a warning against the evils of class warfare."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In this short novel, this novella in fact, H.G. Wells enters frightening lands that are still quite up to date more than a century later. If God is dead and we do not have His guidance in life, what happens ? If Science is true and we only have It to guide us, what happens ? If Darwin has seen truth, and if we only have His Theory to guide us, what happens ? No more Providence, only evolution. The working class will develop into a subterranean race that will have the absolute power of providing everyone with what they need to survive including their clean air, and, what's more, that will provide the upper race with all it needs to enjoy life and do nothing at all. The upper classes will evolve into a new type of cattle since they do nothing, they live in a decaying surface world that has lost all knowledge and scientific guidance. They will regress to a child's consciousness that wil ; only know one adult fact, sex, and they will enjoy the pleasures of inactivity all day long, and the fear of being caught by the subterranean race on moonless nights to become their daily meat. So when God's Providence disappears from our consciousness there is only a dramatic evolution that will lead to the absolute regression of humanity into animality and the ultimate destruction of humanity and its diasappearance with maybe the hope of a new emergence starting from scratch, that is to say, from the sea and sea-creatures that may evolve again into a new human race in some billion years. But the final morality of this scientific tale of science fiction is that the first victim will be the scientist himself, (1) because he won't be believed, and (2) because he will be swallowed up by his own invention and will disappear into the thin air of time traveling. A mind raking and mind boggling book that should give you some nightmares, if you read it with a mind to its predictive value.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"It's amazing how this book has inspired so many future writers and creations.

Wells' The Time Machine sets a presecedent in the genre of time travel stories, books, and movies. The short novel explores a future far stranger than those assumed by later distopian works like Brave New World and 1984, or even more current movies like the Back to the Future Series. The future envisioned by The Time Machine has neither glaring technological advancements nor a strict government. Instead, Wells envisioned that a far distanter future would eventually lead to mankind's decline. Although the story is often thought of as pure science fiction, it contains a prevailing theme against class structure and an anti-Darwinian theme by juxtaposing the Eloi with the Morlocks.The Time Machine may not be the most in-depth science fiction when compaired with some of its offspring, but it was definately one of the prominent forerunners of the genre. It is also a short and intreging read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Having recently seen the 2002 film version of &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; I decided to pick up the book and get reacquainted with the story. As I suspected/remembered, the film departs greatly from the book (and not for the better). For those who have only seen the film, take the time to read the original story. You'll be glad you did.That story is about the Time Traveller and his journey into the very distant future - to the year 802,701 AD. The Traveller chooses to go out of pure curiosity, hoping to see what the future had in store. What he found seemed like something out of the past.The semi-humans he encountered lived in an era not unlike the Bronze Age, with limited communication skills and little else. These Eloi seemed content to while away their time, without a care in the world - except when it was dark. For at that time the other semi-human species, the Morlocks, emerged from below...with a taste for Eloi.The Time Traveller struggles to understand how mankind could have degenerated into such a state of affairs. His distaste for the Morlocks and their actions (including the theft of his time machine) soon causes the Traveller to confront them, with disastrous consequences for both.Generally accepted as one of the first Science Fiction stories, it is believed Wells was also using the story to advance his criticism of the capitalist system. Specifically, the story relates what happens when one group of people is continually subjugated by another higher, elite class. Wells' tale of the fractured relationship between the Eloi and the Morlocks is his warning of the dangers of allowing such a system to continue unabated.All politics aside, the story remains excellent. Although written more than a century ago, it has lost none of its power or appeal. It is also a short read, at less than 150 pages, and is also very &quot;readable&quot; - despite its age the story does not seem at all antiquated. That Wells was able to accomplish this in the 1890s is no small feat, and is an indication of his prowess as an writer.Five stars."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Things in the science-fiction world haven't moved on much since 1895, with respect to Science Fiction and its love affair with time travel and the paradoxes thereof. I suppose this is because the Time Machine by H. G. Wells is very much a philosophical piece on the nature of man and abstracts to do with multidimensionality, more so than any technology to do with time travel.I was surprised at some of the ideas put forward at the beginning of the book, one of which postulated that time could be a state of mind as much as anything. Something along the lines of Groundhog Day, with only a possible glimmer of memory as indication of what might be happening. A notion given a touch of reinforcement at the end of the book where the Time Traveller finds himself forgetting details of where he's been in the future because of the intrusion of his normal surroundings and associations. The white flowers given to him by Weena, acting as a mnemonic jolt.This is more a novelette, than a novel.

The whole point of the book is based upon the assumption that there shall never ever be any inbreeding between upstairs and downstairs people, the rich and the poor. Thus the upstairs people gradually evolve into the sappy Eloi, while the downstairs people evolve into the brutal Morlocks. Oh, I must tell you, fifty years ago I lived not far from a building with a well in the front yard, and the sign said \\"Morlock Realty\\" -- no, not a joke, it was a splendidly comical coincidence that delighted me and my high school friends as we went past it every morning on the bus.

He could not believe that anything could get better than it was, and life as it was then was savagery barely curbed. This book, which has been imitated, plagiarized, made into movies, made into TV shows, parodied, and so forth, is a paean not to human good but to human bad. Neither the Morlocks nor the Eloi were really happy; they existed for each other's benefit, because the Eloi would starve without the supply of food and clothing largely supplied by the Morlocks, and the Morlocks would starve without the Eloi to eat. Such was the prevailing thought among the Socialists of his day, and a Socialist he certainly was. The book should not be assigned for junior high or high school, because the young students lack the proportion that will allow them to see what the book is about. But for an adult, or an advanced teenager, it is a poignant future of what could happen and, in Wells's mind, probably would happen in some way, in some dim future.This is an adult book, and should be read as such."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The account of the \\"Time Traveller\\", an English scientist and inventor, and his journey to the year 802,701. Instead of finding an advanced civilization, he finds that humanity has evolved into a peaceful society of small, childlike people called the Eloi. They do no work, eat a vegetarian diet, and lack much curiosity or interest. He soon realizes, however, that his time machine has gone missing, and that there is another race of people: a pale and ape-like race who lives in the darkness underground called the Morlocks. These are not so idle, but maintain machinery that provides for their ventilation as well as the comforts of the Eloi. The Morlocks are carnivorous and not so peaceful.Written in 1895, this short book is rather interesting in it's bleak portrayal of the distant future and the theories of how mankind has come to such a state. The allusions to the Eloi being like farmed cattle was amusing, with heavy Darwinist and socialist overtones typical of the era in which it was written. Also interesting was the Time Traveller's (no name is given) description of his theory of time travel as a fourth dimension. And while the book is somewhat appealing, I realized about half-way through listening to the audio book that I've actually read it before, and even though I couldn't recall all the exact particulars of the story it was substantially familiar. And I guess that's my biggest objection: it was okay but not so memorable to make a strong impression."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Thanks for a quick and easy transaction and for shipping it out so fast! The book was in wonderful shape, too."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Evolution means progress; perfection. Or so Victorians (and most people with a muddled idea of what evolution is) think. Wells, however, had an intuitive grasp of the theory and how it applied to England's class society. Like all great visionaries, he reveals what is always blindly before the eyes, and takes it to its extreme logical conclusion. The novel is as poignant and relevant as they day it was published."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The book, the Time Machine by H.G. Wells was very interesting. He uses his creativity to imagine what it would be like in the future. The way Wells used his choice of words to tell about what was happening was \\"to the point.\\" He described each event with such detail, it seemed as if you could picture everything that was happeneing as you read. I thought it was an exciting book to read, it got me wondering about what would happen in the next chapter. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes to think about the future (maybe your opinion was close to this futuristic opinion), anyone who likes things about Sci-fi, or just wants something fictional to read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Wells wrote The Time Machine (1895) rather furiously; it seems the author was short of money and exploited his idea of future time travel, summing it up in a tightly constructed, very short novel. Most works that I have read from the nineteenth century are long-winded, purple-toned, velvet-like effluviums. This one is short and for once I would have liked a book a bit wordier.Anyhow, the narrator, a sort of mad tinkerer, describes his visit 800,000+ years to the future. He finds two distinct inheritors of the human race: one smallish, simple-minded but joyful class of vegetarian people that live on the surface of the Earth (the Eloi), and one larger brute-like class of photophobic ground dwellers that perform most of the work for the Eloi, but unfortunately also eat them. Gone are most of the trappings of modern society. Humans have devolved into beautiful idiots and those that prey upon them.Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection were just beginning to take hold at the time Wells was writing and they obviously influence the work. I read somewhere that Wells took a university course taught by the biologist T.H. Huxley, who highly regarded Darwin's theories. Socialism also influences the book, with the Morlock underclass literally kept in the dark until they devolve into creatures that cannot tolerate light and have to rely on human flesh for food. Part of socialist theory is conflict theory; so instead of cannibalizing their own, the Morlocks eat the Eloi as a sort of vengeance.Darkness, and the use of the dark as something mysterious from out which monsters may jump, is Gothic old hat for early writers of this genre. Wells uses the dark as the place where the Morlocks are banished, and where the Time-traveler believes the Morlocks have his stolen time machine. We feel the Gothic fear when he knows he has to go down there to attempt to get it back. Also, I wouldn't say Wells is the first to blend science with fiction either; see Hawthorne's \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\", Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Edgar Allan Poe. And is there something unsettling about the Time-traveler's undertaking with the childlike Weena? Her death at the hands of the Morlocks is tragic, but imagine the circus-spectacle she would make if the narrator brought her back to his time as he intended."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine by H.G. Wells is a wondeful novel to read and I would give four stars to because the author's imagination and descriptions of the future makes the book so interesting and one that you don't want to put down.The author did give a great description of what the time traveler saw in the future. He described the people very well, it was like I was actually in the time traveler's shoes. These creatures consisted of the Eloi,people who never spoke, and slept and ate most of the time. The Morlocks who were from the shadows, they rarely saw daylight, and are ape-like figures who lurk in the darkness. The future was much more advanced from our time now, according to the time in the book. The book shows how everything is coming to and end and how our time is much different from theres. Even the enviornment has changed greatly!This new world is strange to the time traveler at first, but then he comes to realize how everything is coming about. He witnesses the buildings, and how they aren't so much in tact. Also, hey discovers new fruits and flowers. The Eloi and the Morlocks are very different groups of the future. Morlocks, from what the time traveler has discovered, are the ones who do the work to survuve. The Eloi are the people who sit around and have everything going great for them.As time progresses, the time traveler observes that humans become a thing of the past. He finds out that this future is a dry wasteland that serves no purpose, and ends the circle of life.I'd also recommend Our Town,by Thornton WIlder, which is a wonderful and terrific story in three acts. Another book I would recommend is Bud, not Buddy, by Christopher Paul Curtis, which is about a boy living in a foster home. The Time Machine is a fantastic fantasy, adventure that you don't want to miss! I am one person who loves to get away."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is hard to beat. The pace of the book is perfect, the writing is beautiful, the story is inordinately interesting and the book makes one think.The concept of the time machine was a stroke of genius on Wells' part. Other authors had written about characters traveling in the past and future. But other authors did not have plausible ways for their characters to get into the past and future. For instance, the man in Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" travels into the past after a blow to the head! Traveling between eras through the use of a scientific invention seems much more believable than travel by way of a blow to the cranium!The use of the time machine allows Wells to show us what might lie in the future. What he depicts is bleak. The human race has splintered. Half the people live above ground, and they are cherubic, indolent and unenterprising--almost like Cabbage Patch dolls. The other half of the human race lives below ground and is industrious and grotesque-looking, almost like hard-working Gremlins. It is not certain what point Wells is trying to make. Perhaps he is saying that a society stratified by class could eventually lead to the human race dividing into two camps. Or it is possible that he thinks that Darwinian evolution could lead to the human race evolving into two breeds, based perhaps on genetics or adaptation to external circumstances. Whatever Wells' point, the concept of a divided human race is fascinating to ponder!Further into the future, we learn that mankind has been wiped out. The only living creatures are gigantic crabs. I do not know what to make of this projection by Wells, but I loved the description of the enormous crustacean!This book has been dismissed as a childen's book. How could that be? This book leaves one pondering weighty ideas such as the evolution of the human race and the potential consequences of a class-based society. This is a book of ideas cloaked in a science fiction story. Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"To be honest with you, I only found out about the Story \\"The Time Machine\\" while I was looking for a copy of \\"The War of the Worlds\\". I really didn't have any interest in the book at first, but I figured I owed it to myself to read it with such good reviews. And boy was I ever surprised by this AMAZING book.This is just one of those books that has \\"it\\". I mean, it's a facinating trek to the year 802,701, with every time I open this book. H.G Wells was one of the most amazing writers to ever live, and that is evident within the first few pages. It is H.G Wells genious and painstakingly intimate amounts of detail that make this book a real voyage. From the \\"new\\" Earth of 802,701 to the amazing description of the Time Traveller's voyage in the time machine itsself, this book really shines.I recommend this book highly to all those interrested in an amazing journey. Truthfully, this is THE book to read on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Was H.G. Wells making a prediction about the future of the human race when he wrote this book? His reasoning in the book was such that it made complete sense.An interesting and important read, I think, that I would read in conjunction with Animal Farm."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Overall I thought THE TIME MACHINE by H.G. WELLS was a very excellent book. It was suspenseful, thrilling and not at all like the bomb, they called a movie. It starts off with an interesting introduction with the narrator, the time traveller and a group of men who the time traveller intends to preach to. He demonstrates to the group of men with a small machine he has built that is about the size of a clock. The spectators are sceptic and quickly criticize the man. I really like chapter one because I started to imagine myself in this situation as the time traveller. It puts a seed of imagination in the readers mind and feeds it as the book continues. The seed grew into an amazing tree of thoughts and wonders of \\"what ifs\\" by the time I had finished the novel. The narrator explains of how the time traveller gets into a much larger machine and quickly disapears with the pull of a lever. He experiences feelings of headlong motion as it turns into exhileration. And becomes frightened as he is about to stop, so he pulls the lever to go farther into the future. I liked this part, because it is explained in elaborate details and the first characters from the future are brought in to the scenes. The narrator describes them as \\"foolish and indolent\\"(CH.4). The novel ranges in setting from modern time to the year 802,701 AD to the end of the Earth three million years into the future and back to modern times. This kept me interested throughout the entire book. The author displays great detail into the detail of the main character, the time traveller. It is explained throughout the many chapters that he is intelligent. He reflects on his theories more than a normal person should but I don't blame him for i probably would do the same were I in his situation. I thought this fact was very strange but also very interesting. The narrator explains how when the traveller goes through time at thousands of years per second, he notices night and day go by very quickly along with the seasons and years. It is also explained that the sun begins to become larger and redder. And the Earth has stopped rotating. The Earth still circles the sun just like the moon used to do before it died. This begins to explain the end of the world as the sun is dying out and all life is fading away. This part was very interesting but also quite saddening because the world is coming to an end. But one must realize that he will be long gone and dead and reincarnated, if you believe in that, before the end of the world comes. I really liked this part, it opened my mind and I thought into this book alot more than any ohter book I have read. I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone who might think to read it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine was a very advanced book! It was written in 1895 but still H.G. Wells used vivid descriptions and has one heck of an imagination. It starts with him in a meeting and he tells his friends of his plans to build a machine to travel through time with. I thought the book would tell about many different trips into the future or past, but it only told of one. The Time Traveller, as the main character is called, tells of his trip millions of years into the future where he encounters an evolved form of the human beings we associate with today. When I figured out that this book would only be about one trip into the future, I thought it would just ramble on about what he did for maybe a week, but it was all surprisingly interesting. The Time Traveller tells what happened to him in this far future and he uses extreme detail. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I really thought it was well written. H.G. Wells did a very good job on this one. The only reason why I gave it four stars was because it was kind of hard to grasp all the concepts that the book is based off of. I would sit there and try to figure out how that certain idea might work in real life, when really it was too hard for me. But it was okay that I didn't totally get everything, because anyone can read it and still enjoy the book without understanding all the mechanics and science behind everything. So I thought The Time Machine was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes science fantasy or just a good classic."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The \\"stranger in a strange land\\" genre -- ordinary men adventuring in extraordinary places -- is at least as old as Homer, but H.G. Wells's great invention in \\"The Time Machine\\" is to have his protagonist visit a land that is separated from his home by time, not distance. This man, who in the novel is enigmatically known only as the Time Traveller, contends that time is a dimension that is just as travelable as the three dimensions of space, builds a machine not to test his theory but to demonstrate his conviction, and embarks on a journey into the future while incredulous friends and colleagues wait patiently for his return.His destination is not next week to check the weather, or next year to forecast the stock market, but 802,701 A.D. He finds that humanity has undergone a curious evolution and divided itself into two subspecies -- simpleminded, childlike little people called the Eloi and apelike subterranean dwellers called Morlocks who prey upon the Eloi. Hypothesizing that the Eloi are the result of thousands of years of upper class leisure from not having to struggle to survive or worry about diseases and hardships, while the Morlocks are the outcome of the working class's having been forced underground where all industrial operations have been relocated, he implies that social class consciousness is one thing that is sure to survive for 800,000 years.If a time jump of eight hundred millenia seems ludicrously excessive, perhaps Wells wanted to be merely speculative without risking the fallacy of attempting to be prophetic; after all, the farther into the future, the more liberties he could take in imagining what the world would be like. He uses this unique opportunity to envision terrifying mutations of animal life millions of years beyond the Eloi and the Morlocks; what is so eerie about these images is what we can (or can't) guess about the climatic or environmental circumstances that could cause such monsters to evolve.The level of intelligence of the futuristic monsters is unknown, but the novel's outlook for intellectual evolution is bleak. When the Time Traveller, scheming to retrieve his Time Machine which has been confiscated by the Morlocks, sees in an abandoned museum a library whose ancient books have decayed to a state of complete illegibility, he sadly muses, \\"Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\\" In a novel filled with cryptic scenes, this is quite possibly the most ominous -- a projection of thousands of years of human knowledge blithely going to waste as the species surrenders its intellectual advancement to the vagaries of fate."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine by H.G. Wells is a fantastic book in my opinion! It is filled with everything ranging from action to romance to science. There is a little comedy, yet not enough to interfere with the point of the book.The story is set in the late 1800's and centers around a young man repeatedly referred to as the Time Traveler and the Inventor. The story follows the man through a series of events, ultimately leading to the man's travels through time.He travels about 80,000 years into the future and encounters a race of people known as the Eloi. The Eloi are a race of sub humans that do not speak any language known to him.After hanging out with the Eloi for a while, he decides t go and check on the time machine, and possibly even leave. But when he gets to where he had landed, he discovers that the time machine is gone! He looks all around to see where it could have gone. He sees a sphinx-like structure and believes that his contraption might be within it. Without a mode of transportation home, he decides to settle in with the Eloi for a potentially long period of time.While living with the Eloi, he learns words of their language and he comes in contact with a female that he grows quite fond of. The woman's name was Weena. The Eloi lived as they pleased without a care in the world. But, as it turned out, their life expectancy wasn't as long as people like it to be. The Morlocks, another sub human race, fed off of the Eloi, literally. The Morlocks used the Eloi as their primary source of food.As the main character of the story, of course he has to be a hero. He goes to try and free the Eloi from the wrath of the Morlocks by destroying their underground homes. To do this, he first must explore these underground caves. Not very long after he enters the caves, a hoard of Morlocks began to grab him and poke at him. He discovers that by lighting a match the Morlocks disperse very quickly. Living underground has made them very sensitive to the light. Fire, as you will find out, will be the Time Traveler's weapon of choice. But, when he runs out of his own, how he gets some more will make you question the likelihood of the book (like you haven't already).He decides to enter the Morlocks caves from where he landed his time machine. He had been told that the Morlocks go in and out of the sphinx quite often. On the way to the sphinx, he and Weena have to walk through very thick woods. They find out quickly that a group of Morlocks are following them. He decides to build a very large bon fire to ward off the Morlocks. After he observes that the Morlocks are making no more advances, he dozes off to sleep.He awakens to find that the fire has gone out and the Morlocks are prying at him and Weena. He reaches for the matches in his pocket but finds them to be gone! But, he finds a loose one rolling around in his pocket. He quickly lights it but accidentally starts a forest fire. The Morlocks run swiftly away, and so does the Time Traveler. But what has become of Weena? What happens is totally different from either of the movies. But you will have to find out what happens for yourself.Once again, I would like to restate my opinion of the book. This is an excellent book and really makes you think about what the world will come to of the world if we do not act swiftly. I hope that you will enjoy The Time Machine as much as I did."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a complete and unabridged audio CD presentation of H. G.

Once he makes his memorable time machine, he travels to the very distant time of eight hundred million two hundred seven thousand and one. While there he met a perfect human and her name was Weena. Weena is an Elois, which is one of two species of the human raise. The other raise is the blood thirsty Morlocks, which live under the feet of the Elois in the caves. The Morlocks are cannibals that survive off of the Elois.The Time Traveler needs to go back home but he lost his invention to the Morlocks. While there he tries to find the machine in many different areas. Like the Emerald Palace, the forest, and in the den of those little monster's. His largest problem was finding a way to communicate since the Elois have a totally different language. In order for him to get his machine back he must fight the Morlocks. Even thought the Morlocks are small but there very strong. He ends up using a metal pipe for a weapon since there wasn't any other kind of weapon in that era.All of the other parts of the book were good but the best will be unmentioned. The ending was a little out of there if people have seen the two very different movies. But if people haven't seen them the ending will be even more odd. People recommend seeing the older movie instead of the recently made movie. The Time Traveler just wanted to see what was going to happen to the human species in the future. He was definitely in for a ride he wasn't about to forget.H. G. Wells is an author with very detail work and sophisticated words.

It's a classic, and that sums everything up. As a young science fiction fan, i couldn't put this book aside and last weekend decided to read it. It was everything i hoped for.A scientist builds a time machine. Why? Because of mere scientific curiosity. I know that's not enough for the modern fans, but putting the book in its historical contet, we go back to a time where the advancements of science were increasing every day, each scientific field being researched. Of course, Time wasn't the exception.The time machine leads the scientist and the reader to a dark, bleak future, where the enthusiasm for knowledge has been exchanged by the pleasures of a dull, easy life withou work or preocupations, an utopia for a small group called the Eloi.But underneath their feet live the Morlocks, a group of cave men who toil for the Eloi and are paid with their meat, for they are cannibals.Wells surely wasn' an optimist regarding the future of our earth, for the time traveller ends his dark journey at the end of earth's existence, no longer inhabitted by men but by gigantic creatures such as crabs and butterflies.Most readers might complain about the lack of characterization, thence my four stars, the weakness of the plot, nowadays very common,and even the lack of scientifical explanations, that makes today's science fiction novels so wonderfully complex. but this was a classic among the classics, that gave birth to so many books... A lot of people owing a lot to H. G. Wells, who never got anything for his unique book."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Anybody that wishes to get a balanced understanding of the science fiction genre ought to read its classics. This would include H.G Wells and Jules Verne at the very least. I have read (and alas not reviewed) Verne&#65533;s \\"20&#65533;000 Leagues under the Sea\\" and, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\" I have not read Wells&#65533; other famous science fiction novel, \\"The War of the Worlds.\\"It is unfortunate that the novel is so short (about 100 pages) because it has a very interesting premise. The plausibility of the time machine suffers somewhat due to the vague description of the machine itself and no hint at how it might work. Properly speaking, the novel is not hard science fiction (heavily technology or science oriented). Rather, Wells uses the plot device of time travel to make a social/political point.The Time Traveler (one of my biggest problems with the novel is that the protagonist's name is never given) wishes to travel to the future to see what it might be like. He travels roughly to the year 800,000 AD... What he finds is a strange fulfillment of the Victorian ideal of Progress. The Traveler tries to figure out different theories about what happened; the people seem primitive and London is gone (it has changed into a forest). Wells, through the Traveler, theorizes that the people he sees (the Eloi) were the rich of the world that had made their world so comfortable that there were no challenges to keep them active and they soon fell into a sort of pseudo-paradise. Meanwhile, the Morlocks (those who live under the ground) were thought to the workers who made the paradise of the Eloi possible in the past. However, with the passage of time, the Morlocks became more powerful and started to view the Eloi as prey.The end of the novel is poor, in my view. The Traveler steps into one of the ancient buildings nearby looking for his Time Machine, which went missing shortly after his arrival in the future. After a brief struggle with the Morlocks, he travels millions of years in the future and sees that man has ceased to exist and witnesses what he thinks to be the end of time. Finally, he returns to the 19th century and tells his friends about his adeventuresThe novel, by modern standards, is much too short and there is not enough dialogue (this is partially due to the format of the story: The time traveler is telling what happened to him to a group of acquaintances). It is nonetheless one of the early attempts at what is now called science fiction and its brevity makes its antiquated style easily bearable."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I've never read any books by H.G. Wells. However after seeing previews for the upcoming Guy Pearce movie The Time Machine (which doesn't seem to have much in common with the novel) my interest was gained.The Time Machine is actually more of a novella than a novel. It clocks in at 85 pages in the volume I have. But it's a fun and fast paced read. The most shocking part of the story is that it was written in the late 1800's and yet it reads like it could have been written in the present. The prose is crisp and direct and doesn't lose the reader. The ideas are even more impressive considering they are over 100 years old and still hold up better than many time-travel books I have read lately.So by saying that The Time Machine is probably the father of the time-travel genre, I have to say that it is also a fun adventure with a surprisingly sharp ending twist. The story surrounds the first-person narrative of a man who builds a time-machine and travels into the distant (800,000 AD) future where man has evolved into two races: the gentle Eloi and the hostile Morlocks. Beyond exciting adventure (trips into deep caverns, the loss of the time machine, battles in burning forests) the story does make general comments on the society we live in and how it may change around us...subtlely and dangerously.All in all I enjoyed this story and I plan on reading other offerings by H.G.

Wells' first major work, and was praised both publicly and critically. It has gained a strong following, and its popularity has never abated.The story focuses around an unnamed scientist, known as The Time Traveler, who creates a machine, which takes him hundreds of thousands of years into the future. In the future, what he finds is an unexpected disturbing society, consisting of \\"Eloi\\" and \\"Morlocks.\\" The \\"Eloi\\" are childlike creatures, all identical. The \\"Morlocks\\" are hideous beasts, living underground in a system of tunnels. The Time Machine is a great novel, filled with a few unexpected twists, and turns.H.G. Wells is a fine writer and his talent is shown in this work. He is so descriptive in every sentence, and his description of the creatures of the future is fantastic:\\"He was a slight creature - perhaps four feet tall - clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins - I could not clearly distinguish which - were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare.\\"\\"He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive - that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.\\"Throughout the story I had a distinct image of the creature in my head, along with many others, due to the authors great choice of words. He also perfectly structures his sentences. He gets as much he can into each sentences without being overly descriptive, and boring:\\"As I walked I was watchful for every impression that could possible help to explain the condition of ruinous splendor in which I found the world - for ruinous it was.\\"The Time Machine is a classic. However, some things in the novel I didn't enjoy. For one, the story is sometimes slightly boring. Another thing that I thought hurt the novel is that the main adventure of the novel is told in as a narrative, with the \\"Time Traveler\\" telling his story to other guests. I think the book could have been more exciting, and suspenseful, had it been happening right then and there. But besides those two minor problems the book is great. H.G. Wells' vision of the future is different than any others. In The Time Machine the creatures of the future are not at all intelligent, which is completely opposite of what I expected.The Time Machine is a highly interesting novel that I recommend to fans of the author, and fans of sci-fi thrillers. However, if you don't want to think, and want an easy reading, this, although short, is not the right choice for you:\\"Filby became pensive. \`Clearly,' the Time Traveler proceeded, any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and - Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\\"With this novel H.G. Wells gained popularity, and rightfully so. The Time Machine is a classic, which will not be forgotten any time soon.\\"And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers - shriveled now, and brown and flat and brittle - to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of a man.\\""},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book includes many great adventures. The Time Traveler encounters many problems on his journey into the fututre. The main problem the gallant man faces is when he arrives on this strange island.

While he is on this strange land he begins to explore. He finds many strange tunnels that lead to the underground. He soon finds out that Warlocks live in these tunnels on the land. The time Traveler does not want to hang around and be a Warlocks lunch. He returns to his time machine and goes back to the present. When he returns he staggers in the room and starts this story."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"\\"The Time Machine,\\" by H. G. Wells is a brilliant and entertaining novel about a scientist who invents a time machine and travels hundreds of thousands of years into the future. There he finds the Eloi, a group of people who live in peace and harmony. The Time Traveller is curious about the people who do not grow old or work, yet have everything they need. He wants to learn more about the Eloi, but someone has stolen his time machine.While searching for his time machine, the Time Traveller discovers a group of hideous underground creatures called the Morlocks. He learns the Morlocks have been providing everything for the Eloi who has lost all ambition and curiosity. The Eloi's passivity have made it possible for the Morlocks to take the adult Eloi underground and make them their slaves.I highly recommend this book of adventure and science fiction. H. G. Wells is a genius."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Leave it to H.G. Wells to come up with a book on time traveling into the future and leaving us, the readers, totally captivated. What a visionary. The movie, which I have seen many times, did a great job of keeping to the original storyline. If you have not seen it, please do so. Amazing film.What I love about the book is how much further Wells went with the story. Towards the end of the book, our weary time traveller proceeds further into the future to actually witness our earth and sun dying. The barren lands growing cold. Life at its final stages. How utterly eerie yet thrilling all at the same time. Wells describes the sequences so vividly. Who would not do the same if a time machine was made available to them?For you first time readers, enjoy. It is a terrific ride."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Commuter Library produces a wonderful set of stories that are true to the original books, and H. G. Wells's &quot;The Time Machine&quot; is no exception. As it is unabridged, it makes an ideal first exposure to this tale. The highlight of the edition is Ralph Cosham's crisp delivery. His accent and changes of inflection are well-suited to the events and emotions of the story. His rendering seems appropriate especially when reading the portions of the novel where Wells expounds his theories of social evolution regarding the Morlocks and Eloi. Expository passages like that by any author can be dangerous for any reciter, but not so with Mr. Cosham's delivery and Mr. Wells's prose. Often at the top of many people's lists of great science fiction novels, &quot;The Time Machine&quot; strikes an excellent balance between the science and the narrative. Critiques of science fiction by such persons as author Brian Aldiss frequently bring up the fact that good science fiction is not merely about gadgets, but are best when they reflect or portray some aspect of the human condition. This novel provides ample proof of that. Throughout the reader is gripped not only by the anonymous Time Traveller's trials in the future, but by his intellectual approach to discovering the fate of mankind. Well's depiction of the very distant future in the final chapters is one of the most terrifying and breathtaking literary landscapes in any literature. For the person on the go, this audiobook rendition can amply substitute for the novel itself."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Good story. I felt like I had to get the real story after watching the two very different movies that were based on this book. However the text is curious; instead of italicizing the words that need emphasis, they are typed like _this_ throughout the book. Also, the quotation marks are backwards. 'First the single ones are used, &#34;then the double&#34; for quotes inside quotes.' Maybe this is because of the version of Kindle I'm using? Either way it is annoying."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H G Wells has awakened the world with his art of tale through the travel of time. He is the inspiration of every time travel writer in existence today, with no exception, myself included. Along with great classics like Twenty-thousand Leagues Under the Sea, I remember the first time reading these classics. I was in awe. Though time travel, a genre given life by H G Wells is the ultimate epic sci-fi adventure. The very idea of time travel has opened the eyes of every imagination in my soul. The ramifications are endless. H G Well's Time Machine is my favorite, all time story. Even when you think of how the future looked as grim as it did thousands of years from the story line's origination, one only needs to remember that this tale is merely one possiblity of billions that could be changed with a simple act of maybe a push of a button or even less. I believe THAT was the message Wells was revealing to us all. This is a very well written story that I highly recommend to anyone of any age or time. This very book was my biggest inspiration since I was first able to read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Wells's first novel is one of his best: it has lived on in the imagination of the Twentieth Century, breeding all sorts of children - some rather gainly like Jack Finney's delightful \\"Time and Again\\", some less so. This beautifully written novella blends Darwinian speculation and Marxist nightmare with a page-turning narrative of high adventure - still fresh and vivid after 110 years. It ends on a note of poignancy and optimism that seeks to balance the horror and despair that has come before, and leaves you in the quiet hush that follows a tale well told."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"An amazing book, and truly inspirational.

Excited to get them started with the book, I ordered a dozen copies (on a 4-for-3 promo since I was using personal funds to purchase the books) and distributed them as soon as I received the shipment. Imagine how upset I was to learn that these books do not contain the full text of the book; they stop in the middle of part V. I cannot return them for a refund, as I gave out all copies to students and they began annotating their copies as soon as they began to read.Wells' novel is wonderful! This edition is terrible..."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In England in the early 19th century the Time Traveler tells his tale of the year 8002001 or so...and beyound, but that is not the whole story.Playing on ideas from evolutionary theory...and also suposedly ideas on the solar system from the early Darwin...a future world is created that is eerily unlike our own.I was kept reading even though I did not find the character development or world building compelling enough. But there was enough detail and a bit of action. It is a short science fiction read of 12 chapters, a bit odd but thought provoking. Some of the scenes were very vivid and creative...expecially nearer the end.[Story Spoilers Ahead!]Although I doubt this would happen, I found the details and drawn out ideas from the era fascinating.The two branches of humans: the underworlders aka the Morlocks and the overlanders aka the Eloi reminded me more of negative mutations and less of Utopian creations...and I still don't see how mankind could have such seated stratification for thousands of years to end up that way. That would have been an interesting story.Weena... still don't know what to think of her, or the fact that the Time Traveler is so terrified of the spiderlike underworlders that touch him and look creepy but seemingly have no real defense. Especially since the Eloi are so similar in odd behavior, I found it a bit confusing that he was so set on destroying the Morlocks...but oh well. He had assumed that the vegitarian Eloi were pray to the meat eating Morlocks, so I guess he wanted to create an alliance."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I am so glad that I am going back and re-reading H.G. Wells. I enjoyed reading him in high school, but, no offense to my younger self, I only appreciated Wells on one level. Just like I was blown away by my re-read of \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\\" this book was just as stunning, although not as deeply disturbing. If you have not read Moreau, stop reading this review and go read it. We'll talk when you get back.In Moreau, Wells explores the nature of man, his place in the scheme of things, as well as man's supposed moral nature set against the amorality of science. Clearly an example of Einstein's famous fear that \\"our technology has surpassed our humanity.\\" Equally disturbing is the idea that the concept and identity of God clearly is a function of your own personal point of reference and a position ready to be filled by whomever has the power to take it.In The Time Machine, Wells tackles society, economic realities, and evolution and presents a plausible and terrifying scenario. On one level we have a great sci-fi adventure about the evil and monstrous Moorlocks and the sheep-like but sympathetic Eloi. That is what I read as a kid. However on my re-read I was fascinated when I learned who these races represent and I really can't argue with his theories. I don't want to give anything away, because I HATE spoilers, but I will say that this novel is a social commentary on a level with anything written by Dickens and although I always enjoyed Wells as a masterful and creative story-teller, I now recognize Wells as a great thinker as well. I bought the Delphi edition of his complete works because I want to read everything the man wrote and spend some time with his work.Then, as a sort of ad-on set piece at the end, Wells' scientist sets his time machine's dial to the distant future to observe, first hand, the end of the world. So logical that a scientist would do this, it fits perfectly into the story and shows how great a storyteller Wells was. However, this scene goes way beyond mere story-telling. I read this section several times. We have read this type of scene before but I will argue that it has never been done anywhere nearly as well as this. Chilling, creepy, unnerving, dark beyond description----absolutely brilliant. This set of scenes put this book onto my all time favorite shelf."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Hoffer once said that great books generally have a great sentence or two. Obviously, he (and I) has an extraordinarily high standard for what is a good sentence. There are few standards that surpass the rigor for demarcating classic literature; we all remember that, almost transcendental, line from each of the true classic works, which touch us on rational and aesthetic levels. \\"The Time Machine\\" is exemplar of the great-sentences standard for classic literature. From a purely pleasure-reading standpoint, there are few books that I can name that are so packed with the modes of excitation that make, more broadly speaking, a great book great; I can, maybe, proffer two on the same level, Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" and Boethius' \\"The Consolation of Philosophy.\\" \\"The Time Machine\\" is a breed of book that captures the imagination, making you linger on every page. Personally, I could not help but reread virtually every page, before going on.As an advocate of science in literature (and I mean science in literature, not necessarily, strictly speaking, the more fantastical science-fiction), I think this book has much to offer the imagination. In one of the most original bits of science-laden dialogue I have ever encountered in literature, the Time Traveller offers the notion of the \\"instantaneous cube,\\" which sends the reader's mind into a whirl of wonderment and amazement. (For those interested, see my blog, entitled \\"The Time Traveller's Instantaneous Cube\\": milliern_dot_wordpress_dot_com) The dialogue, itself, is as phenomenal as the actual idea presented. It is a real treat, to say the least.I must also mention that this books storyline has some really fantastic feature that most literary critiques would be interested in: it synthesizes an endless plenum of ideas, ranging from utopian, sociological, and human psychological elements, just to name a few. Additionally, the theme of man-as-wonderer, a veritable element of the human condition, as found in the Anglo-Saxon poem \\"The Wanderer,\\" Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" and Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" is very much a central thread of this work.There is so much that one can say, so all I will add is the imperative: Read it; even if you know the storyline, as I did, you will enjoy it.Review of the Edition (Pocket Books 2004): This edition is not exhaustive in its notes and introduction, but it is definitely a good one, especially, if you are not looking for a deep plumbing of the material. The introduction does it justice, and the notes are on queue with things that I was wondering, as I went through the book. All in all, if you aren't reading this edition for some college book report, or, if you are, you have some external sources to work with, I recommend this book. The print is clear, and the book fit into the side pocket of my cargo pants, so it was nicely portable on bus rides."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The shipping envelope left a very hard to remove adhesive on the book cover.

Did Mercury crash into the sun, as Wells suggests? Or, was it...GLOBAL WARMING? How very prescient.I didn't really get into the storyline with the good, moron Smurfs and the underground, cannibal Smurfs. Seemed like Wells was trying to make an evolutionary point on class structure in England at the turn of the last century. Good for him.Who really thinks the world will still be going eight hundred thousand years from now? Don't we expect Jesus to come back at some point? Or at the very least, won't we use up all the earth's resources or blow ourselves up?More interesting to me was the main character's trip to the end of time. That kind of cosmic viewpoint helps one put life, the universe and everything in perspective, giant mutant crabs not withstanding.The Time Machine is a humorous and engaging little work. The funny thing is, in over a hundred years of science and literature, time travel is one plot device that few people have done better at.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine, by H.G. Wells, was first published in 1895. It remains a piece of classic literature because it is well written and because many feel that its message about society is still relevant today. H.G. Wells uses formal diction throughout the book, and much of the language used is typical of English literature in the late 19th century. The Time Traveler develops a Time Machine which he uses to travel into the future, to the year 802,701 A.D. While there, the Time Traveler learns about the society of the future, and the reasons for the distinct separation of classes.Immediately upon arriving in the future, the Time Traveler meets the Eloi, a beautiful, graceful, child-like race. The Time Traveler befriends one of the Eloi after saving her from drowning in the river. Her name is Weena, and the Time Traveler learns about the Eloi from her companionship. The Eloi are a peaceful people, but also weak and stupid. The Eloi live a very leisurely lifestyle, eating strictly fruits. There are no houses in the year 802,701 A.D., and there seems to be no private ownership. The Eloi live, eat, and play as a group. There does not appear to have any form of government, and the Eloi seem to live in a perfected socialist society.The Time Traveler soon realizes, however, that the Eloi are not the sole inhabitants of the earth in the future, after he returns to find his Time Machine stolen. A separate and very different race, the Morlocks, live below the ground. The Time Traveler describes these subterranean creatures as pale white, clammy, and apelike. The Morlocks have become so accustomed to the darkness underground that they avoid all light. The Time Traveler presumes that it is the Morlocks who have stolen his time Machine and hidden it in the base of a great statue.It is not until the Time Traveler ventures below ground to search for his Time Machine that he realizes that the Morlocks are cannibalistic, relying on the weaker Eloi for food. The Time Traveler then begins to understand society in the future. The Eloi were once the aristocrats, and the Morlocks the working class. The aristocracy continued to buy the land above ground until the industry was forced below ground. The workers moved below ground with the industry, and the aristocrats stayed above ground, pursuing pleasure and relying on the workers underground for their goods and labor. Gradually, the laborers underground grew to detest the sun and their skin became bleached white, while the aristocrats became so comfortable and so unaccustomed to necessity or hardship that their size, strength, and intelligence waned. Thus, the Morlocks met all of the Eloi's needs so that they would have food. In essence, the Morlocks fattened up the Eloi in much the same way that we fatten up pigs for the slaughter. This society is not at all socialistic, like the Time Traveler first believed, but rather, the deep separation of classes has been caused by capitalism.I would not recommend The Time Machine to one of my peers, simply because I do not agree with the underlying social message of the book. I do not believe that capitalism would ever produce a separation of classes as great as the one described in The Time Machine. History has shown that when the ruling class abuses its power and harms the working class, the working class will rebel and overthrow the ruling class. I did enjoy the book's story, however, and it is an easy read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. I believe that this is a book that many people might like reading in the beginning. It touches on one of the things that humanity has wanted to do for ages. To be able to go back in time. So in this novel the Scientist gets the opportunity to do so. He creates his own working time machine. He then goes into the future. Here he has many interesting adventures with the futuristic people. Yet, his time machine is gone one day. So now he starts his journey to get it back. This story is well a classic and most people should read it. It ends with a small disappointment yet I don't want to spoil the ending for you. Well I give it 3 stars because it is an interesting read, yet it may not and is probably not right for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine written by H.G Wells is a book in my opinion which is written to connect to those who have an interest in reading about an adventure with twists and turns. The book as a whole is for one that reads books that may not seem to be realistic and is very imaginative. I am one who enjoys reading stories that connect to me as a person with events that I can relate to. But at the same time I am one who desires to finish a book to see the outcome of the story as a whole. The turn in this book was traveling back to the fourth dimension and the twists were being an environment split having Good and Evil. As a result, \\"The Time Machine\\" is a book that can get people interested but also one that makes people only want to finish it only to see what the outcome will turn out to be."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I thought the Book was enertaing and fun.

(I saw the film first.) After taking a trip into the future, a Time Traveller returns to the 19th century and tells his colleagues what he saw.In the distant future there is nothing, not a trace, of our world left. The Time Travller discovers a new society and finds that we have evolved into a puny, ineffectual race called Eloi. At night he discovers the other half of the society, the hideous, carniverous Morlocks. The Eloi live simple lives and play in the sun. They are food for the Morlocks, who live underground, operating machinery. The Time Traveller goes even further into the future, to a depressing world where the sun is dying and monstrous creatures roam the surface.Getting away from the point for a moment, there was once a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story called &quot;Timelash&quot;. In that story the Doctor travels back in time and meets a young writer called Herbert, who accompanies the Doctor on a journey to the future on another planet. There are monsters called Morlox. At the end of the story the young writer gives the Doctor one of his cards, which has the name HG Wells. The story implied that HG Wells' novel was inspired by the Doctor! But in reality &quot;The Time Machine&quot; paved the way for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, one of my favourite childhood shows. So we owe a lot to Wells.Time travel looks like a fun thing to do but sometimes it's best if the future is left unknown. Would you want to know your own future and find it's not what you hoped for?"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I did not like The Time Machine.

I was very bored and I almost picked up another book.Anyways the book is about a man that goes to the future and meets up with these small people that eat fruit all day. Then he meets the mongrels that eat the small people. Which I think is sort of stupid.In the book H.G. Wells doesn't, I think, portray the time traveler as he should be portrayed. I think it would also be nice if could have given everybody names instead of calling them their profession.Over all I give this book a 2 out of 5."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"It goes without saying that this book is a science fiction classic in every sense of the word and that H.G. Wells was a founding father of the genre. This book proves that science fiction does not necessarily need to be heavily technical but does need to deal with grand themes such as the nature of society; man's hopes, dreams, and fears; and the very humanity of man. Wells does not go to great lengths in describing the time machine nor how it works. He lays the foundation of the story in science and then proceeds with his somewhat moralistic and certainly socially conscious story. This makes his writing much more enjoyable than that of a Jules Verne, who liked to fill up pages with scientific and highly technical nomenclature. One of the more striking aspects of the novel is Wells' treatment of the actual experience of time travel--moving in time is not like opening and walking through a door. There are physical and emotional aspects of the time travel process--in fact, some of the most descriptive passages in the book are those describing what the Time Traveler experiences and sees during his time shifts.Basically, Wells is posing the question of What will man be like in the distant future? His answer is quite unlike any kind of scenario that modern readers, schooled on Star Wars, Star Trek, and the like, would come up with. He gives birth to a simple and tragic society made up of the Eloi and the Morlocks. In contrasting these two groups, he offers a critique of sorts of men in his own time. Clearly, he is worried about the gap between the rich and the poor widening in his own world and is warning his readers of the dangers posed by such a growing rift. It is most interesting to see how the Time Traveler's views of the future change over the course of his stay there. At first, he basically thinks that the Morlocks, stuck underground, have been forced to do all the work of man while the Eloi on the surface play and dance around in perpetual leisure. Later, he realizes that the truth is more complicated than that. The whole book seems to be a warning against scientific omniscience and communal living. The future human society that the Time Traveler finds is supposedly ideal--free of disease, wars, discrimination, intensive labor, poverty, etc. However, the great works of man have been lost--architectural, scientific, philosophical, literary, etc.--and human beings have basically become children, each one dressing, looking, and acting the same. The time traveler opines that the loss of conflict and change that came in the wake of society's elimination of health, political, and social issues served to stagnate mankind. Without conflict, there is no achievement, and mankind atrophies both mentally and physically.This basic message of the novel is more than applicable today. While it is paramount that we continue to research and discover new scientific facts about ourselves and the world, we must not come to view science as a religion that can ultimately recreate the earth as an immense garden of Eden. Knowledge itself is far less important than the healthy pursuit of that knowledge. Man's greatness lies in his ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Speaking only for myself, I think this novel points out the dangerousness of Communism and points to the importance of individualism--if you engineer a society in which every person is &quot;the same&quot; and &quot;equal,&quot; then you have doomed that society."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"When I tried reading this book as a child many, many years ago, some of the \\"big\\" words and allusions made it hard going, and I never completed it then.

Well, the annotations in this edition (about four pages worth as endnotes) of \\"The Time Machine\\" cleared away whatever fuzz remained, and I was completely overcome by the greatness of the book, great from whatever way I looked at it: plot, speculation, characters, \\"sense of wonder\\", even throw away humor were all topnotch. I couldn't believe what I'd been missing. A few days later, I read another editon of the book that didn't have notes, and had no trouble following that version.

For the English-speaking world (some translations of Verne possibly aside), science fiction begins with the four brief, brilliant novels published by H G Wells in the 1890s. The War of the Worlds is a still-unsurpassed alien invasion story; The Invisible Man one of the first world-dominating mad scientist tales; and The Island of Dr Moreau a splendidly misanthropic story of artificial evolution and genetic modification. But The Time Machine came first, launching Wells' career in literature; and, after just over a century, there still isn't anything nearly like it. A Victorian inventor travels to the year 802701, where the class divisions of Wells' day have evolved two distinct human races: the helpless, childlike and luxurious Eloi and the monstrous, mechanically adept and subterranean Morlocks. Predictably, the film version turned them into the usual Good Guys and Bad Guys, though it's still worth seeing, particularly for its conception of the Time Machine itself - a splendid piece of Victorian gadgetry. The book, despite its sociological-satirical premise, is rather more complex in its treatment of the opposed races, and the Time Traveller's voyage ends, not with them, but still further in the future, with images of a dead sun and a dark earth populated only by scuttling, indefinite shadows. As in the other three novels, too, the premise of the story is carefully worked out and clearly explained - a discipline largely beyond science fiction today, in which time travel, invading aliens or whatever are simply taken for granted as convenient genre props and automatic thought-nullifiers. After more than a century, The Time Machine is still waiting for the rest of us to catch up."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"An unnamed time traveler sees the future of man (802,701 A.D.) and then the inevitable future of the world.

I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too munch.After al the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless.

And although Wells would go onto a very long and distinguished career that included some one hundred published books, THE TIME MACHINE remains one of his most popular novels to this day.The story has been famous for over one hundred years. The narrator, identified only as &quot;The Time Traveler,&quot; has created a machine capable of moving through time. He boards the machine and rushes headlong into the future--where he finds himself in the strangely utopian society of the &quot;Eloi.&quot; But unbeknownst to the time traveler, that society is built on the back of a much darker one, the underground world of the &quot;Morlock,&quot; who supply the Eloi's every need in order to harvest them like cattle.Wells was an extremely didactic writer, a social reformer whose thoughts inform virtually everything he wrote. In many respects THE TIME MACHINE is the perfect example of this, drawing the reader in through an exciting story that Wells turns into a social parable. Born under the rigid class system of Victorian England, Wells had quite a lot to say about the benefits and evils of such a social system, and his thoughts on the subject are extremely clear here--as are his thoughts about the then-new theory of natural selection. The result is an elegant but often fearsome portrait of how class systems and natural selection might combine to create a uniquely horrific civilization.Wells would return to these themes again and again, perhaps most obviously in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON--both excellent novels in their own right. But if you are new to Wells, THE TIME MACHINE is an excellent beginning, for it offers a sampling of his mind in remarkably concise fashion. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"A psychologist builds and uses a time machine to travel 800,000-30 million years into the future. It is made of Ivory, Crystal, and Nickel, with two levers for control. I found his turning the hypocritical Victorian society inside out to be refreshing and made the book a fast page turner. His not using overly technical language was another plus. The future society he described was intruiging and scary in its extremes. The gentle Eloi being taken care of by the slavish Morlocks makes the reader think of other historical eras where the few parasitically lived off the many. Feudalism and Communism come to mind. But, in this world the Eloi send their own on a regular basis to be fed to the canabalistic Morlocks. This book makes the reader think and encourages one to want to read more about both history and other fiction novels. For that alone, it deserves four and a half stars."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells' timeless novel, \\"The Time Machine,\\" was a great book and well worth my TIME. You will wish some elements of this story were real so you could go back and read it again and again. This story is about a man who studys about the 4th dimension (time). He comes up with a remarkable idea and decides to build a time machine! With this machine, he is able to travel forwards or backwards in time. He travels way into the distant future, about 803 thousand years from now. He lands in a mystical place with gentle, little inhabitants called the \\"Eloi.\\" They are human-like people that have evolved over time. On his journey, he is faced with many qualms and incorrigible situations. How does he deal with these problems? Does he make it back to his old time dimension? Read the book to find out...I particularly enjoyed this book because it kept me wondering and on the edge of my seat. It also stretched my imagination so much, as if I were back in the third grade! H.G. Wells' vivid interpretations of the future were interesting and suspenseful; For those reasons, \\"I dub thee 4 stars.\\""},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is Wells' (1866-1946) first novel. It is a social allegory in which the unnamed hero travels to the year 802701 and finds an Earth completely altered. It appears initially to be a form of utopia but the Traveler soon discovers that this is far from true. Society has two classes. The Morlocks, subterreanean workers, are beings evolved from man that have sunk to depravity and who prey on the decadent Eloi. The Eloi are completely useless beings, totally dependent on the Morlocks. Wells is suggesting a world in which the two main classes of Britain of the 1890s have degraded into Morlocks and Eloi. The world of 802701 is the end result of unrestrained and unchecked class struggles and isolation. The upper class has degraded to uselessness and the lower class has become buried by their labor and degenerate into darkness. The term \\"Morlock\\" is derived from the Biblical word \\"Molech,\\" the epithet of a deity to whom children were offered as sacrifices. \\"Eloi\\" comes from the Hebrew for \\"my God\\" and is associated with an important phrase in the Bible (a rendering of the first verse of Psalm 22 is \\"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani\\" [\\"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me\\"], a phrase heard again in Mark 15:34). Thus, both terms are appropriate descriptions of the two classes. Are the Eloi forsaken? Or, will the Traveler return to help them? Although this is probably the first novel containing a time machine, it is not the first time traveling novel. Both Twain's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; (1889) and Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843) precede it. In de Grainville's &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1805), a Frenchman views future events through a mirror; he doesn't actually travel through time. Finally, to the reviewer of Jan. 24, 1999, from New York, there is a reason why the Traveler remains unnamed! Can you see it?"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Mr. Wells is a fine writer. However, as I read, curled up in my favorite armchair with a cup of tea and a slice of Eloi-pie, I cannot help but feel saddened at his stereotyped and ignorant portrayal of my noble race. The Morlocks are not, as Mr. Wells seems to be suggesting, a brutish and de-evolved form of humanity. We are a highly intelligent and technically adept species. Yes, we do systematically butcher the Eloi. We unfortunately have no other food-source, as our digestive systems cannot extract nutrients from the fruit that sustains our surface-dwelling cousins. But did Mr. Wells bother to mention the great care we take to make our food's death as painless as possible? Hmm? Or that we go to such trouble to make clothes and build shelters for them so that their lives on the surface world will be more pleasant before we consume their delicious flesh? It pains me to know that Wells' mistaken ideas about Morlocks are so widespread in human culture. The movie adaptation of his novel was even more disturbing, as it portrays my race as humans in bad costumes. No wonder so many young Morlocks suffer from low self-esteem; the media is so devoid of positive role-models."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"For those students who need to follow along with a recording of a book the Time Machine was very good!

Man's voice is clear and theatrical. We enjoyed it very much and students were able to grasp the ideas better than merely reading it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is probably the most well-known and greatest H.G. Wells novel of all time. It is a classic novel of a marvellous scientist who proves to his disbelieving friends how good a scientist he is. The story really kick started Well's career, and he later came to greater success in 1896, with the, in my mind, gruesome War of the Worlds. It was a parachute in Wells career, and in this short book alone is no exception, containing 75 brilliantly descriptive pages of the 'Traveller's own account in his own words. His disbelieving friends ridicule how about his adventure was not true, but he has scientific proof.This novel was differential to his later phenomenoms, this was probably because his style changed and he became more fluential with his novels, because the world knew and expected of him and he was already a phenomenal success. A household name indeed.The two(or so I think) movies doesn't depict Wells writing, and the imagination of Wells flutters through his pen as he writes.The falling of Mankind in the year 802,701 and the intellectual decrease of the earthlings that roam freely is apalling to the 'Traveller and some of us. There is no point in earth, it is just a plane and strange elfin race terrorised by a fierce 'Underworld' called the Morlocks.There are no schools, no education, the future isn't as we expected: technology is nothing. It easier to say, the world we live in is now better. The 'traveller sees it like the world is a bright garden with a small elf-like race, called the Eloi. No real trademark buildings or icons. The earth has no purpose.The book ends on a mystery. The 'Traveller disappears for all eternity or so it seems after his attempt to arrive back in the future with a spare camera. He doesn't return for three and half years and that is about it to end one the greatest stories ever told. Wells ends a brief short story which really consumes most of your time. The 'Traveller is an all likeable character, you really feel all attached to him. There are many argumentetive characters who speculate and it is a debate who is right.Is this Time Traveller telling the truth?The 'Traveller pulls a gritty knock and the marvellous mind of him really has captured the imagination of people for over a century now.It is a timeless classic, something to remember for a Wells starter."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"TravelerThe Time Machine, an InventionBy: H. G. Wells/ Modern LibraryDuring the last century time took place in one big controversy when people often debated about its existence. Wells introduces the story by presenting the Time Traveler, who is the protagonist. He is showing his great invention to a group of men that does not share his ideas, the Time Machine. When trying to test his machine the Time Traveler zooms into the future expecting to be emerge into a sort of technological paradise; but the surprise is big when he sees himself into a place populated by some sort of short and round creatures known as Elois. This angelical people who lived in complete leisure, picking flowers and eating only fruit, because they have develop perfect bodies, live together in large houses and seem to thrive on an indifferent communist society. In the other side, however, the Morlocks populate the underground world. They have a pale beastly looking and they provide clothing to The Eloi before eating them.When the Traveler in his Time Machine, the evil Murlock presence disturbed the peace and stole the Time Machine. It took the Time Traveler about eight days and thousands of discoveries to find the Machine again. Knowing the exact location of the Machine he tries to get it back while being hunt by the Murlocks. The thin plot is just enough to entertain the reader and retain their attention to H. G. Wells' ideas on the development of society.

For example the meetings that he had with his friends. I thought that I was really sitting with the group and I could watch him trying to convince us that this thing really works. That's how good this story is.This story is basely about how this guy goes to the future and confronts a new generation. The catch is that there is also anther type of species living under ground in tunnels. They are called lurks they are stronger, faster. Basely the humans stand no chance against the lurks.

The beginning of the book was a bit shaky and difficult to comprehend, but after reading a few more pages the introduction is explained. H.G. Wells does a great job describing the adventures of the time traveller, he painted a good picture in my head. This book tells about the tragedies and phenomenons of a man and his journies travelling through time. This book is recommened to young adults because of some difficult vocabulary. He first arrives in a world filled with tiny \\"child-like\\" creatures that have a short attention span and are very peculiar. He finds out about underground creatures in the new world that come up every once in a while. He then finds his time machine stolen, so he goes underground to retrieve it and the action starts.

It was also adventurous because in that he fights and outwits one of the type of people that became his enemies. Also the author was very creative by his theories and detail when he is travelling through time.\\"I came back to his house but he was nowhere to be seen\\" said the narrator of the story.

There are the peaceful, beautiful, indolent, and fairly stupid Eloi who live a life of ease in a surface garden where they await being summoned by the Morlocks who are ugly, brutish, and cannibalistic. The Morlocks live underground where they run machines and just about everything else as well.Ignorant of the Morlocks, the inventor make the acquaintance of an Eloi woman named Weena and, typical of the 19th-century male, finds her lack of actual intelligence rather endearing and falls in love with her. She shows him through the ruins of all that remains of his ancient world. There seems to have been a nuclear war, which is interesting, since this book was written in the 19th, NOT the 20th century.When the Morlocks introduce themselves to the inventor by stealing his time machine, he must set about to rescue both himself and the Eloi....The only reason I give this old favorite of mine 4 stars instead of 5 is for the often old-fashioned language that, though fast-paced for a Victorian novel, is still sometimes rather heavy in places. Yet the wonderful story more than redeems itself."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine, written by H. G. Wells was an interesting book about a man who travels through time. Not a whole lot of information is given on this character, other than he is a scientist who has created a time machine to travel through time. Not even his name is given, although he is addressed as the 'Time Traveller'. Other than this, that is just about all that is said about him. The other characters are not described too well either, their names and their profession are given but not too much else. I feel H. G. Wells does this to try to stir the reader's imagination and make them form their own characters and conclusions.The story starts out with the Time Traveller just returning from his travels and is hoasting a dinner party with other scientists and people who have a high status in society so he may explain his travels to them.The Time Traveller tells the guests that he entered a whole different time, the year 802,700. He then goes on to explain about the people he met there. He met two kinds of people, or creatures. They were known as the Noli and the Morlocks. The Noli were peacefull creatures and also very childlike. They were small and very kind. \\"Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence -a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease.\\" On the other hand the Morlocks were just the opposite, they were big and hairy, mean and very cruel, they also eat Noli at night. Therefore the Noli are terrified of the night time because they fear they are going to be eaten. Through the story the Time Traveller becomes friends with the Noli and learns their language and their way of life while he tries to find his time machine. The Morlocks stole the machine and prevents the Time Traveller from finding it.H. G. Wells uses very descriptive words to describe some of the landscape, but not so much the people. \\"The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light.\\" He then goes on more to talk about what the floor is made up of and all these other details that can clearly paint a picture in your mind. There are other parts which he does not describe so clearly such as \\"The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through.\\" I did not find this to be too descriptive, but it still gave the reader a basic knowlege of what it was like.Overall i found this book to be very interesting as it made me think of how it can relate to today's society.

In the course of reading this book one starts to dwell on the idea of what the future will be like and if the horror in the novel will come to pass. The book is written in an easy to understand manner, so reading it takes a shorter amount of time. Wells takes the position that the ideas posed are more important than the fashion that they are posed in the writing of this. The emotions that are described in the book are illustrated in such great detail that one becomes immersed in the story making it unable to stop reading. The main idea conveyed is that after strength and mind have left humanity only compassion will be left to characterize us."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"well im writing this review for a physics project that i have to do.

Some of the details are fascinating as the traveler come to discover the secret of the results of social striation over centuries which eventually creates two separate species from humans. Which species is the more human? Can anything be done to prevent or correct this?I grew up on the Rod Taylor /George Pal movie. When I started the book I expected it to be slightly different with a tad more complexity as with most book/movie relationships. I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too munch.After all the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless. The writing and timing could not have been better. And the ending was certainly appropriate for the world that he describes. Possibly if the story were written today the species division would be based on eugenics."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"At first, when I saw this book, I thought it would be boring and incomprehensible.

He wrote many other Utopian thoughts in pretty thick texts, but this one is the shortest and therefore the sweetest.It is amazing how this time machine concept is ubiquitous through many other sci-fi literature, movies, television, and video games of today.

We have a background of science as to how time travel might be possible, followed by the harrowing adventure itself.Wells, unlike other sci-fi authors, does not need to delve into mechanical descriptions or minutiae...this is not important for a story that is meant to fire the imagination and ask questions as to where society is going.A must read for any age...enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"As with all his works, Wells demonstrates that he was truly ahead of his time in this novel. The opening scenes are very memorable and set the stage for wonderful chapters to follow. As characterstic of all of Wells' writings, there is much more here than just an entertaining story. His books always contain deeper themes and \\"The Time Machine\\" is no exception. He crafts a brilliant tale here while interlacing it with philosophy, politics, human nature and more. While this isn't as warm an introduction to Wells as \\"The Invisible Man\\" or \\"War of the Worlds,\\" this is reading I recommend highly."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"As H.G. Wells' first novel (1895) and as one of the most important inspirations for the current explosion of science fiction, THE TIME MACHINE should be on the 'to read' list of every fan of speculative fiction. While this wasn't the first story of travel through time, it has become the most popular and was the first to suggest time travel in a controlled manner, using a machine to take a person backwards or forwards at his whim. The future imagined by Wells is one of the most troubling and disturbing of the futures that have been related by the multitudes of SF writers since.The method of relating the story as the narrative of the Traveler presented Wells with many interesting possibilities that he took full advantage of. The book introduced more mysteries about the future than it revealed. How did the Eloi and Morlocks really come about? Does one really feast upon the other? How did society really evolve into such a state? And finally, did the Traveler REALLY travel back in time?It is remarkable the amount of thought this extremely short and simple novel can generate.

When the Morlocks where grabbing at The Time Traveler, I too felt like I was fighting for my life in this strange world. The ability to make the reader feel like they are there, trying to survive is what makes Wells such a great writer and what makes The Time Machine such a classic."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine has always been open to one's imagination. Why? Because Wells did not give any details on what the machine really looked like. So whenever it was turned into a comic, TV show, or movie, the crew or artist or author would decide on their own what it would look like or act like.So while the comic book pretty much follows the story it takes it own view, its own ideas about what the machine, the landscape, the Eloi, and the Morlocks. Always a joy when I find another vision or point of view when it comes to his great work."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I first read the book over 50 years ago and have been fascinated with the concept of time travel and paradoxes ever since. Ironically I remembered the movie version and not the book so in a way it was like reading it for the first time.This was my first Kindle purchase and I must admit I was confused by the various versions available. I decided to go with the optimized for Kindle version even though I do not know what that means and was unable to find any information on Amazon to explain it.I cannot say if this version is true to the original but if not, it does have the flavor of something written long ago. More than once I had to look up the meaning of a word and I wondered how I could convey the same meaning using words that are commonly spoken today.While not for everyone, I think it is very thought provoking if you read between the lines so to speak."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I love free books and fortunately the best books are the free ones.

This book is very short but it's an interesting story and the main character is quite likeable. I also loved the description of the futuristic world.I am pretty much a horror buff so this was something completely different for me, but I did love this book and would definitely read it again in the future."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Probably the most remarkable part of this book is not the adventures that the time traveler encounters, but rather the friends that he shares his tale with. Nameless except for profession, each one of these characters is meant to show archetypical skepticism befitting their professions(Medicine, Journalism, etc) and their subtle interactions between the story telling is a fascinating take on how science and fantasy were viewed when the novel was written.Barring the fascinating historical take on the emerging genre of sci-fi, the book is quite readable and enjoyable to this day. The storytelling does a fantastic job of drawing the reader into the plot and instilling the same curiosity that the protagonist is meant to feel. We learn about a potential future as the time traveler does. Our excitement at the potential is similarly dashed as we learn more about the world and our premonition that something terribly wrong is realized.A classic story that is consistently retold in movies, TV and other books, the Time Machine is a must read to help understand the references that current culture makes. The final bonus is that the book is incredibly short, so don't be intimidated by thoughts ofMiddlemarch. You can safely finish this in one afternoon and check this off your to-read list."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In the preface to the Time Machine(my version is different from this), Wells remarks that this was obviously the work of an inexperienced writer, but even he has a soft spot for it. There are originalities in it which more than make up for that.The book creates a vivid picture in your head, and does a good job of stirring your imagination(even if at certain times it requires a suspension of disbelief with his descriptions of the machine, etc). Regardless of what may at times feel like an amateurish effort in comparison to the way his future stories would read this stirring of your imagination is the point. It is all a means to an end.Wells didn't create Sci-Fi I don't think, but he did do a lot with many of his works to really popularize the genre. This is a great example of a really early effort not only within the modern form of the genre, but from Wells himself, as it was his first book."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book is short, well written, and a great story.

Wells' first time travel story, that honor going to his short storyThe Chronic Argonauts-- but it's the first one to popularize the concept, and the single story generally pointed to as the archetype and progenitor of time travel in fiction. It isn't quite as riveting or fast-paced asThe War of the Worlds, but there's still a decently entertaining story here if you don't mind your sci-fi having a more Victorian pace to it.Despite popularizing the concept of time travel as a story vehicle, it isn't really \\"about\\" time travel in the way that, say,Back to the Futureis; the Time Traveler never goes into his past, and the future remains unchanged at the end of the story. As with all of Wells' fiction, he was trying to make a sociopolitical point -- here, he's critiquing socioeconomic / class divisions, and pointing out how destructive they could be in the (very long) term. (He made a similar point, with a 200-odd-year-long jump forward, in his later novelThe Sleeper Awakes).Considering that socioeconomic divisions in America are at a higher point currently that at any time since before the Great Depression, modern readers might find this book unusually, well, timely."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a well written book. In addition to stimulating the reader's interest by discussing and explaining the subject of time travelling in the first place, H.G.

William Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" provides a classic example,Count Leo Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" falls in the same school and so does Charles Dickens's \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". The imnportance of \\"Hamlet\\" resides not so much in the actual twists and turns of events as the distortion and abject frustrations confronted by the eponymous protagonist;\\"Anna Karenina\\" is in more degree the symbiotic paradox connecting an individual and the circumstances than the experiences undergone by Anna;\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" focuses more on the individual characters and their respective metamorphoses than the events which actually provide the chasms for their expressions. Compatably, Herbert George Wells's \\"The Time Machine\\" is a fantastic science fiction that has translated into a household item not because of the harrowing and equivocal experiences it alludes to but because of the unique conceivement of the idea.A man,so aptly baptised by the novelist as the \\"Time Traveller\\",invents the \\"Time Machine\\",travels far off into the fading future and expploring it for eight absolutely maddening days,returns to tell his telling tale to a group of men who transpire more scepticism than compassion towards him. And that makes up the whole essence of \\"The Time Machine\\". Flying into the depths of time,cutting through \\"the blinking succession of day and night\\" with a strange blend of amazement and complex,confused emotions,the Time Traveller first steps somewhere in 8 million AD only to discover the entire human race fragmented into two diverse,distinguishable compartments. One set comprises of the pretty Eloi---weak and puny and fragile but with \\"a graceful gentleness,a certain childlike ease\\"---and the other covers the diammetrically opposite Morlocks---bestial and nocturnal,living underground and feeding on the Elois. The Morlocks hide the Time Machine,kills the protagonist's Eloi friend Weena and keep their counterparts in utter and constant fear. The Time Traveller escapes from these dark,dangerous creatures dwelling in a world bereft of intelligence,novelty and progress,only to land in a world furthur away in the future inundated with enormous crab-like creatures and huge white butterflies and not so much as a speck of flesh and blood. The Time Traveller then fast-forwards the creation of his genius to 30 million years hence and faces strange bugs,leeches and blood-red seas. All these in just eight days.The link of events is thus sequential and smooth enough but under the plaintive and sometimes blunt description of events lurks a deeper intent of symbolism and of all attributes of art the thrill of symbolism is more intense than others. The pleasure and adventure of travelling in time always encharmed and fascinated humans and the translation of this figment of imagination into an element of fiction is what makes this the first novel by the late 19th.century and early 20th.century author a novelty of a massive degree. H.G.Wells's \\"The Time Machine\\" portrays how easily a tendency to venture into adventure can pave the way for a horrific misadventure. The Time Traveller comprehends that the widening gulf between the Haves and the Have Nots has resulted into seperation of mankind in the dim future and also realises that in several instances,he could \\"see some beginnings of ths even in our time,and in this future age it was complete\\". The bleakness of the future and the debauchery that's spreading over humans merge to provide the Time Traveller a masive insight into the future. The extinction of humans and of Nature's harmonious paradigms form the bulk of the book's weight.Once you commence running after money,you simply can't contain yourself anymore;once you start hiring mistresses,it becomes too tough to turn back;once you imbibe the spirit of adventure,you liken yourself to consume it more and more. So with the Time Traveller. He goes back into the future defying all the dangerous consequences and never returns. The novel barely reaches 100 pages but short as it is,it exposes the uniqueness of this exquisite visonery author. It's really astonihshing just H.G.Wells exploits the most unrealistic on human dreams and actually reveals this English science fiction writers's incredible imaginative and creative flair. The idea of a Time Machine is a novel one and one that would find parralels in \\"The Island of Dr.Moreau\\",\\"The Invisible Man\\" and \\"The War of the Worlds\\",other great works by the author. H.G.Wells's works always deal with themes that transform the unimaginable in to the imaginable,and,in spite of his writing nit invoking lofty diction or subtle descriptiopns,he's someone who could make the flow of the scheme of things genial and smooth.\\"The Time Machine\\" is a highly entertaining and provocating book that has manufactured itself into a massive visoney work. It's unique and the first of its kind that has been the cause of rise os umpteen films and other entertainments and even to this day,retains the same charm that it created when first published. Artists may wither but their art is forever eternal and therein lies the success of the artists. And therein dwells the genius of H.G.Wells."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine by H.G. Wells is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that every true science fiction must read and experience. This masterpiece written in 1895 is one of the true classics on science fiction. The way Wells is able to make the reader believe he or she is in the story is phenomenal. He is able to show what we hope and dream for in the future while throwing in a mysterious twist. As you read the novel you find many mysteries and encounter strange situations. The story begins as the main character and narrator, the Time Traveler, sits down to a dinner party and begins to tell his visitors has invented a machine that can carry him into the fourth dimension, time. Not only does he have one but he also has used it and he then begins to tell his guests of his narrative. His story starts as he travels into the year 802,701 A.D. After discovering a species of man which he believes is the perfect society. The Time Traveler learns of a dark secret which lies beneath the surface of this society. He realizes in a way this new race is in fact not intelligent. So he decides to move on in his travels. When he is about to leave the race he has traveled to see, his time machine is stolen. He must learn about this strange new world if he has any hope of getting home. The Time Traveler discovers the name of the people, the Eloi. As he spend the days with them he realizes that fear is still instilled in this society. The fear of the night leads the Eloi to many strange behaviors. He begins to ponder these behaviors after seeing mysterious creatures at night. He is able to befriend a certain Eloi, whose name is Weena, which he rescues from drowning. Soon after meeting her he goes down a well to discover more about the morlocks. Together the Time Traveler and Weena, his Eloi friend, travel to a strange porcelain palace where he manages to find supplies and has another encounter with the morlocks. He narrowly escapes this situation, and as he flees the creatures sets the forest ablaze. Sad things happen in this fire, but the Time Traveler returns to his machine and travels into the future. His strange adventure continues into the future then returns. He travels back to the past to tell his story but goes back into the fourth dimension never to return again. This adventure will leave you want more. How he get his machine back? How did the human race split? What happened in the forest? You have to read it to find out. I really liked this book because of all the adventure and excitement. It was the kind of book that you want to find out what is on the next page. I could simply not put this book down, it is that good. It has got me reading other Sci-fi books; it has opened me up into a totally new world of books."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I've always thought that \\"The Time Machine\\" was the greatest science fiction idea ever. Ever! I first came across the story in the \\"Classics Illustrated\\" (#133) comic form in the 1950's. That was pretty good, especially the cover art. Then came the 1960 George Pal movie with Rod Taylor. Taylor was good, but the story was weakened by changes. Changes such as the time traveler moving through the 1st World War, then the 2nd World War, and finally, the great atomic war of the 1960's--remember that one? When will Hollywood stop \\"improving\\" a really good story? Then came the 2002 movie with Guy Pearce. The only thing that movie had in common with the Wells story was the title, and Guy Pearce was no Rod Taylor--maybe a Don Knotts. Want to see Wells' future? Then go back to his original story.

The sheer depth of speculation and scientific theory throughout this work is impressive to say the least, and will invariably open new corridors of thought to eager readers. The vivid imagery and gripping narrative will excite and entertain all that read this impressive, concise, and compelling work. It is obvious, however, that H.G. Wells was deeply rooted in the Darwinist and Marxist milieu of the times; he seems to justify communism and totally acquiesce in the theory of evolution. While the apparent theme of this work may be a bit unappealing to fundamentalist Christians, it remains nevertheless, even to those who disagree with it, a remarkable achievement in English literature.

Indeed, throughout this book the action never takes place futher than the time traveler's study and its environs.It is in this way that Wells both accurately describe the nature of the fourth dimension and then put it to such effective dramatic use.His book not only inspired many of the centuries greatest scientists (including Kip Thorne) it also gave the general public an excellent sense of their transitory spot in the scheme of things.True, Wells' story was about A time traveller and his journeys. However, in a larger way, it makes the reader see themself as time travelers too and likewise contemplate their place in the scheme of things.While this is such a great book that further elaboration seems unnecessary, for those wanting a better understanding of the following issues I would recommend the following books:To understand the Fourth Dimension -- Read the Fourth Dimension Simply Explained.To understand the Fourth Dimension in connection with relativity -- Read Geometry Relativity and the Fourth Dimension by Rudy Rucker as well as Hyperspace by Michio Kaku and/or Hiding in the Mirror by Lawrence Krauss.To survey time travel stories -- Read Time Machines.To see some other great time travel stories -- See either other of the two filmed versions of this book or any of the OLD Star Trek time travel episodes.And finally to see someone inspired by this book to actually make it a reality -- Read Time Traveller by U Conn's Dr. Ronald Mallett who's father's early death at the age of 33 inspired Mallett to try and make Wells' story actually come true.In this way, Mallett's book may be the best homage to Wells because time travel has its intrinsic appeal in our desire to revisit and thereby regain that which perhaps is otherwise irrevocably lost."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"As a previous reviewer has stated, having seen both versions of the film, it made sense for me to finally get around to read the book. What a wonderful experience!The story is only 80 pages long in the version I own but what a wallop it packs. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and, being very young when I first saw the 1960 movie version on TV, never grasped the social statement until now. The parable literally hit home even more since living in Los Angeles you see the Eloi getting their lawns mowed by the Morlocks every day.If you are like me who likes to grab a classic in between the current mystery or ghost stories you may enjoy more often, make sure you add this one to your list."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Having seen both versions of the movie, I decided to read the original book by H.G. Wells. The book is an easy read, but entertaining nonetheless. What's interesting is Wells' version of the future as a utopia gone horribly wrong. While most visions of the future are of some post-apocalyptic world or of some suppressive, totalitarian government, this vision is one of a Garden of Eden, where the child-like Eloi sing and dance their days away in a carefree existence. However, the nights brings a stark contrast, as the Morlocks, the carnivorous subterranean dwellers, prey upon the Eloi.The Time Traveler's theory on the condition of man and how the two separate races evolved is intriguing. Whether intentional or not, there is a social commentary and how the pursuit of a utopia is not an end of itself. For, even if a utopia is achieved, the human condition must still be advanced, lest the human race will evolve backwards into a child-like existence.Although it never made it to movies, the Time Traveler ascends further into the future to explore an earth where the sun is dying and humans have long ago been ceased to exist. No social commentary here, but interesting nonetheless.One flaw you might say is the total lack of scientific explanation for time travel. You are to accept that time travel is possible by the Time Traveler's machine, yet there is no real explanation of how it works. Of course, such a discussion probably would burden the novel with unnecessary discussion.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, easy ride and is curious about the original book behind the movies."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is about a man Wells simply calls The Time Traveler who goes really far with his ideas of dimensions, which eventually gets him to the year 802701.

He describes the events as if he was a witness to them. What I did not like about it was, just like all classic novels, the wording is different than that of the present. I would recommend this book to any of thos Sci-fi readers out there (namely my grandpa)."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Wells was a true genius, describing places that are very much real. The descriptions of the Landscape of the earth of tomorrow with all the flora and fauna, and the haunting realism of emotion and character make this book along with his others the most genuine science-fiction to read.For me, The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds moved me in a way that I will always remember."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" is one of the most respected pieces of Victorian science fiction, and deservedly so. It is at once a great novel of adventure and imagination, a social tract predicting class warfare, and a touching story of humanity and the connections humans make in desperate times.Everyone knows the plot. The man simply called the \\"Time Traveler\\" relates to the unnamed narrator his adventures in the year A.D. 802,712, and the two species of small humanoids who reside there: the Eloi and the Morlocks.The Eloi live an idyllic existence of leisure. Their intelligence is limited, they aren't particularly strong, nor altruistic, as the Traveler learns when one of the Eloi, Weena, is on the verge of drowning. Appalled at the apparent indifference, the Traveler rescues her, and makes a close friend.The Morlocks live below ground. Evidently, they keep the engines that run this future moving. They also tend to the Eloi, providing them with the basics. But it soon becomes clear that the Morlocks are the true masters, for the Eloi fear the dark, fear the openings to the Morlocks' domain. For the Morlocks feed on the Eloi. And, as the Traveler soon discovers, the Morlocks have stolen his time machine.To appreciate exactly what Wells was trying to do with this future society, it helps to know that Wells was a socialist, and believed that the upper classes take their soft existence from the toil of the lower classes. The end result is the Eloi. Wells is clearly issuing a combination warning/manifesto-eat the rich; their laziness will be their downfall. However, Wells acknowledges that class war is a double-edged sword. The Morlocks are the lower class in a state of revolt. But they are a degraded, filthy lot who are content to continue their miserable existence for brief moments of revenge. And so, for both species, the benefits of their arrangement are outweighed by the price.Those who have seen the George Pal film will probably be surprised by this dynamic, as in the film (made in the 1950s, the Cold War in full swing), the relationship overtly remains, but the underlying cause has more to do with the events of a third world war, and Pavlovian reflex to basically duck and cover.But, \\"The Time Machine\\" is still also a straightforward adventure novel, abundant with excitement and action. Particularly exciting are the Traveler and Weena's desperate escapes from the Morlocks in the night. Indeed, the Morlocks represent some of the most threatening creatures in literature. Well's descriptions of the Traveler's wanderings in the Morlock's underground are among the creepiest moments I have ever read, as the Traveler is watched by red eyes and the dark, is mocked by hisses and laughter from unseen mouths, and is touched and prodded by furry, spider-like hands.Wells also creates some very tender moments between the Traveler and Weena. Those who have seen the George Pal movie will not doubt expect a love story, which is not the case. Really, the relationship between the two under Wells' pen is a complicated paternal one. Weena adores the Traveler as her savior. The Traveler clearly views Weena as a child. The tenderness of this relationship is heightened by the very tragic end of Weena, and the Traveler's obvious grief over his loss.Of Wells \\"Holy Quartet\\" of novels (\\"The Time Machine\\", \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"The War of the Worlds\\"), \\"The Time Machine\\" is probably the most successful. While the others are obviously good, \\"The Time Machine\\", in my opinion, is the most effective at balancing Wells' desire to share his philosophy with his desire to entertain. It's a short book, and can be read in an afternoon. Certainly that is an afternoon well-spent."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is one of the great classics of Science Fiction. Though there is not much to the 'science', merely the idea of a machine which could travel through time, no attempt is made to speak of the science involved in time travel. But, that's not really the point.This is a good work of societal study of what could happen with the division of the classes over time. Now, over a century after this work was first pened it's not so apparent...a person of any level has the ability to work thier way upwards in class, and class division isn't as much as it was then with a strong middle class and extreme lower and extreme upper classes in the minority. This is an important historical aspect to consider in relation to H.G. Wells's work.In the distant future, a world of polar opposites exists. The Eloi live in comfort and ease, they are the distant decendants of the upper classes who were waited on hand and foot, and who had achieved the ultimate in mastery over nature, and archetecture. Evoloution takes hold and intelligence and strength are no longer nessicary traits for survival, and so the Eloi are childlike, simple, and weak. They enjoy a simple life of playing, eating and sleeping when they feel like it, not bothered with providing themselves for food, clothing or shelter.The Morlocks, decendants of the miserably hard working, toiling servant classes live underground and tend to machinery. Thiers is a world of darkness, they are the unseen, just as thier forefathers 800 thousand years before were the unseen of society, needed, but not noticed, and relegated to the world of cellars and serving thier rich masters.However, evoloution has taken an ironic turn. With the excessive division of the classes, they have become different species. The Morlocks now keep the Eloy as we keep livestock, providing them with food, shelter, and clothing, and letting them live thier peacefull lives frolicking in thier pastures. And, as with cattle, the Eloi are little more than food for slaughter.We read of the Struggle of the Time Traveler, who remains unnamed in this work, as he must confront the Morlocks to regain his time machine and find his way home again."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Herbert George Wells wrote &quot;The Time Machine&quot; in 1895; it was his first science fiction novel, and has remained one of his best. Churning out a number of popularized Hollywood flicks, and influencing countless other science fiction stories and shows involving time travel, this is one of his best-known books. We see an un-named character, known throughout the text only as 'the Time Traveller,' setting forth in his machine to the year 802,701 A.D., encountering a situation that is far more sinister than the years he has left behind.Throughout his life -- up to the tragic day that he died -- Wells was pessimistic about the future (relfected throughout his many prolific works). In &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; the Traveller himself does not care much for the age in which he lives, so he sets forth into the future, to perhaps see advancements and development in humanity, away from the stupidity of Nineteenth-Century England. Instead, he finds humanity -- or specifically, the descendants of past humans -- worse off than before, having probably grown too comfortable and at ease with themselves, letting intellect and ingenuity to fester. This passivity enabled the Morlocks, underworld inhabitants who watch over the meek Eloi (descendants of humans living on the surface) to enslave them (as cattle, for they are cannibals, as becomes quite clear in the book). Violence and disaster erupt, thanks to the intervening Time Traveller.The social parodies made clear in Wells' book are brilliant examples of his talent and merit, though they are striking; there definitely were echoing uproars from Wells' parodies made with the Eloi and Morlocks as representing class differences in Victorian (and later Edwardian) England. Questions relating to human progress imbue the novel, as do questions relating to whether or not a world infested with problems truly is worse than a world without any trouble; will the halo-shining Utopia truly come true, or will stagnation ensue, heightening and exacerbating our vulnerability to future Morlock-like forces?This Modern Library release is a reissue of an interesting 1931 illustrated edition of &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; so while it is an excellent read, it is also an interesting historical piece in itself. H. G. Wells, in a preface to this book, called it the work of an amateur (p. XIX), yet he expressed his delight that it had outlived some of his other pieces. Quite simply, this book will continue outliving many others for generations to come."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a great book, H.G.

Wells didn't just make up a phony way of going through time, he actually made a scientific explaination for doing something of that feat. Wells also made a good twist on the future world. Most people see the future as flying cars, people with odd looking clothes, and life forms far more advanced than any of us could ever dream of. But Wells did just the opposite. He made the future world a place of fear and stupidness. The way the people of the future acted completely shocked me. The Eloi with their fasination of fire and fear of the Morlocks. And the Morlocks themselves with a taste for meat and flesh, but as fragile as an egg. Then there was the Time Traveller himself, whom I thought would be an older man in his 60's or so but in fact was in his early 40's. I found the way Wells played this character was very well done. Once again Wells has taken a stereotype and flipped around.

Not enough happened."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I had to remind myself while reading this book that H.G. Wells was the first science fiction writer to use the concept of time traveling in a work of fiction. Indeed, he was one of the first science fiction writers. To a modern audience, the use of time travel per se seems rather stale, and there must be something unique and intriguing about a time traveling story to hold interest. This story lacks much that would qualify as either \\"unique\\" or \\"intriguing\\", but Wells does get credit for pioneering a new genre (along with Jules Verne), as well as a new idea within that genre.It is evident that Wells constructed his story around the concept of time travel and the social critique about the direction he envisioned society heading he was delivering within that framework. Story elements such as character, plot and setting are clearly worked around his Message, and are of obvious secondary concern.The characters are so flat that most don't even merit names, but are rather depicted by occupation. The narrator is not even identified by occupation, and all we know of the Time Traveler is that he is an apparently eccentric, erudite man who has been tinkering with various inventions, most notably the titular time machine. We get very little feel for him as a person, and most of what we do feel for him is not terribly positive. He comes across as rather self-centered and self-important. Other characters, including those he meets in the future, are only valuable to him insofar as the satisfy his own needs or engage his curiosity.The plot, such as it is, centers around, naturally, the Time Traveler's voyage some 800,000+ years into the future. He initially encounters a race of small, delicate, childlike humanoid people called the Eloi who seem to live a carefree life of ease. The Time Traveler surmises that many hundreds or thousands of years ago (in the future past), humanity had at long last conquered all remaining challenges and had achieved a sort of perfection. However, that perfection was only temporary, as the achievement itself led to people becoming complacent and soft, since they were no longer challenged.Upon further experience, however, the Time Traveler begins to realize that the Eloi are intensely fearful of the dark, and he tries to puzzle out why. His own encounters with an aggressive, cannibalistic race of blind underground dwellers bring the answer home for him, and he experiences his own fear and revulsion. The Time Traveler revises his earlier theory to account for the Morlocks (the name of this new humanoid creature) as the descendents of the laborers who have, over time, increasingly lived underground and who have served the needs of the elite. The evolution of both this elite group and the workers has degenerated into two branches of humanity, each a twisted caricature of humanity in Wells' day - the nobles and other elites vs. the workers, peasants and other commoners.Unfortunately for the Time Traveler, he will have to face these underground beings, as it appears that they have appropriated his time machine. In a series of improbable events and travels with his hapless Eloi companion Weena, including the convenient but unlikely find of usable camphor and matches, the Time Traveler overcomes the Morlocks long enough to recover his time machine, and improbably goes joyriding another several hundred millennia into the future before returning to his own time, battered and travel-weary, but able to entertain his dinner guests with tales of his expedition. (Weena, sadly, met her fate in an unfortunate forest fire, which at least had the benefit of fending off the Morlocks.)\\"The Time Machine\\" works well as an interesting thought experiment, but the characters are too unknowable (or even unlikable), and the plot is too improbably to make for good literature. Still, the entire genre of science fiction is essentially one big thought experiment which owes a great debt to H.G. Wells and other early writers. The book is good if you take it for the social commentary it is, but it would take future generations of science fiction writers to blend scientific prediction and social commentary with good fiction writing."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book may seem very interesting but it really isnt.

This is more of a stroll where you have the time to see everything and think about what you saw. I would not say the movies were better...just different.

Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" is also the first of his scientific romances. After a careful setup, the never-named \\"Time Traveler\\" narrates his journey 800,000 years into the future. The bulk of the novel follows this one journey - his time in a far-future where the human race has split in two, which he calls the \\"Eloi\\" and \\"Morlocks\\".Wells' setup and narration are effective, and the adventure tale keeps the story moving, but it's heavily flawed. The problem is the \\"Eloi\\" and \\"Morlocks\\" themselves; the former are the descendants of the aristocratic upper class, and the latter are the descendants of the lower class. And they're unconvincing. The Eloi are weak, unintelligent waifs; the Morlocks are nothing more than monsters that prey on them. This simply doesn't work; both are far too exaggerated to give Wells' point about class and culture a good impact."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Well The Time Machine was an ok book.

Some of the science in the novel is dated but it does not really detract from the novel very much. It loses one star for length though. Wells could have written an epic here and totally missed his chance.Do not confuse this with the recent movie.

He diverts from the magic of Jules Verne, embarking on a new realm, on his own journey. Where Verne's interests lie in maritime stories of a more mundane nature, as fantastic as these were, we see Wells far more interested in what becomes of a people, of civilization, of earth. We see a writer who looks deeply into the human psyche, wondering how we perceive the passage of time.Ok, so the book starts out straight enough, with four blokes discussing how such a machine could work. He convinces us that a unique perspective will reshape the cutting edge. They are blown away when the ostensible time traveler returns in only moments, having indicated that he spent days in this futuristic world of the haves and have-nots, of the Morlocks and the Eloi. When one of these delicate creatures dies, he learned, the others let it go as part of their every day events. Of course, when the traveler is battle-scarred, made weary of his adventures and tired of the vegetarian diet the Eloi provided him, his colleagues are not convinced but confused. Then, during the events of the new moon, when all is bleak outside, do these Morlocks attack the Eloi. He faces a terrifying sequence. Then he discovers his time machine had vanished from where he left it when he arrived. Let's not give the plot away now. Find out how he gets it back, and how he relates these things to his friends who await his return. It turns out that the Morlocks are highly developed individuals, having abandoned their mechanized world long ago, choosing to \\"harvest\\" the Eloi like cattle, allowing them to graze on the vegetation.Wells is brilliant the way he orchestrates this tale, pitting one aspect of society against the other, making you wonder about how things could end up that way even from our modern perspective. Wells is, no doubt, years and years ahead of his time. Although it's easy enough for a high school student to read, the depth will make you return to his intense literary style again and again. I did."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"From the beginning of time the human race has always had a special concern for the future. What lay in store and what will become of life here on Earth? What will happen to the Earth after it endures horrific natural disasters? Thousands of years later we as a civilization still worry about the future and how we will get through it. In The Time Machine by H.G. Wells we read about the fascinating journey of a single man hundreds of thousands of years into the future using a machine that he spend countless times working to perfect. It is when he travels 800,000 years into the future that he truly is shown what will happen to the human race.After having read War of the Worlds, I am convinced H.G. Wells is a brilliant author, and in his book The Time Machine he expresses his thoughts and his opinions on what will happen to the Earth after an apparent \\"Doomsday.\\" He avoids any possible time paradoxes that may occur from interfering with time. The only problem that I had with the book was how he went so far into the future of the Earth (800,000 years) and humans still existed, which can be questionable if a species can survive for that amount of time. Wells then uses his amazing logical thinking skills to write a novel based solely on this single concept.The Time Machine is an excellent book, that, as a child, I did not fully understand. When I was younger, I truly did believe that the concept of time travel was possible and that I was just too young to know about it. I very much desired to travel into the future to see what I would be doing at an older age and how I would look. Now that I am old enough to genuinely understand the book I still hold on to those same desires, although they have been slightly altered as I now recognize time travel to not be quite as easy as I thought. I am also surprised by how many of the people commenting on the book saw the movie first. Also, in response to Akachei's comment, I think that Wells did a fine job of comparing the two classes, because in the present time this scenario may not seem practical, but 800,000 years into the future, this could be life."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I am sure that you have seen the movies that have been made from this book, there are quite a few and most of them are very entertaining. Unfortunately none of the movies that I have seen have captured the social meaning behind this book. Certainly they have the adventure part down pat, but the rest of it is changed, for the times I'm sure. I would advise those of you who love Sci-fi to read this book, and to those of you, like myself who have a hard time getting into that genera, look at this as a classic and read it anyway.The unnamed inventor of a time machine, known only as the traveler, leaves his home to travel forward through time. Seeing drastic changes in the world he finally settles on a distant future to get out and explore. He quickly meets tiny humans which he refers to as the Eloi. They are fair to look at, complete ADD cases with little to no true knowledge or skills. The Traveler attempts to communicate with them and has some difficulty. He spends a great deal of time in this futuristic world and discovers that the Eloi are not alone in this new world, and that their counterparts are far more sinister.One of the biggest changes made in the movies is the cause of the split between the Eloi and the Morlocks. It is very interesting to read Well's actual reasoning, which is the separation and elitism between the social classes. This becomes more defined and is the actual basis of the entire novel. Rather than being a true Sci-Fi book, this really is about Victorian Society and what it would look like if left unchanged for 800,000 years. Because this book only vaguely touches on the science involved, it is likely to never be outdated. Though this is not a fast read by any means, it is a fun and meaningful one. I don't know that I would hand it to a 10 year old because odds are they would be bored before he even leaves for the trip. However if you can take a deep breath and leave our societies mindset behind (the theory that everything needs to be exploding and that we all need instantaneous gratification at all times) this is a brilliant piece of fiction that spans several genres and is in fact as timeless as the Traveler."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Wells' tale of the future of mankind is both highly entertaining, and a valid critique of the rigid social class system associated with capitalism. Wells was so far ahead of his time, that this tale is actually not the least bit dated. Despite being written over a century ago, Wells' scientific theories are still as believable and sound as they were in 1895. If you have even the slightest interest in Science Fiction pick this one up, its a concise, highly captivating read"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"We've all seen at least one of the movie versions of H.G. Well's The Time Machine, but none of them frankly compares with the original Sci-Fi classic. The book tells the story of the Time Traveler's journey nearly a million years into the future and the very unexpected and disturbing society he finds there. The Time Traveler formulates various theories based on what he observes of the society which each, in turn, prove to be oh so wrong! [Warning: mild spoiler] In the end, his realization of the future is especially terrifying considering it is the result of our current social structure (or H.G. Well's, anyway).I especially recommend this book for those of us with short attention spans - it's only 140 pages (and that's the large print version). But don't get the wrong idea, this book still has more depth and creativity than most 500 page books i've read and is a great read, even compared with today's science fiction standards.This book has to be considered a classic considering it spawned a whole genre of time traveling books, movies, and tv shows which imitated it. It is also the best Wells book I have read, hand's down (though I never read \\"the invisible man\\"). Get a hold of a copy and read it today!!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"They seek him now, they seek him then,They seek the blighter everywhen.If in some future age he's dead,About him now what's to be said?Time travel stories since Wells wrote have become far cleverer and more sophisticated than The Time Machine, but I have never yet read one to equal it. Wells does not contort his or his reader's mind round the now-familiar paradoxes. How is any era visited or returned to by a time-traveller affected by the visit or the return? If objects from the future are brought back to the present, i.e. before they existed, does that do anything to the objects or to their pre-existence environment? Wells keeps all that sort of thing simple. In his schematic storyteller's view time is just like a dimension of space. If you are some variety of Professor Potty and can invent a machine to travel in time, then you can just go to your destination and come back from it as if you were taking a day return trip on the train from Banstead to London.It presumably should go without saying nowadays that whether or not The Time Machine is properly catalogued as \`science fiction' it is not about science. The time traveller has a splendid-sounding Victorian conveyance distinguished by such hi-tech appurtenances as brass rods, ivory levers and quartz doofers of some less specified kind. Security is minimal, as the machine is an open single-seater with the control levers removeable to prevent unauthorised use -- a very sound precaution, as all anyone would need to do is move the levers and head off up or down the aeons, no previous training or experience necessary.For anyone not yet familiar with the plot, I am not going to spoil it for him or her via a review. However any reviewer can hardly avoid commenting on the societal vision that Wells offers, starting with his first stopping-off point 800693 years from the date of my writing this. The scenario of the division of humanity into two simple and drastically differentiated categories obviously owes much to contemporary analysis of society and history on a class basis. However it is about as far from being Marxian, from that point on, as I can well imagine. Marx was an optimist, at least from a certain point of view. He argued that if the urban proletariat, which had nothing to lose but its chains, could only divest itself of the latter a certain kind of utopia could be established in which all would provide according to their ability and receive according to their need. The mind of Wells was darker than this, and his grim visions, like Stapledon's some time later, found creative expression in this tale of unforgettable vividness, simplicity and pessimism, but at the same time also beauty.For me, The Time Machine represents another kind of short journey backwards. It takes me back to the golden era of Victorian prose. Wells had, says Brian Alldiss, practically every gift that a novelist can have; and to that I shall add only that he is a great writer as well as a great novelist. There is real poetry in Wells's prose at its best, and by that I do not suggest any affectation or gratuitous ornament in the style. What I mean is that the story, contained mainly within quotation marks as the time-traveller recounts his three experiences of the far future, reminds me forcibly of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Wells found no redemption, and his final book was called Mind at the End of its Tether. If it is any use my saying so to him from the future, I hope some benevolent deity saved him from the fiends that plagued him thus. For the rest of us, the dangers that we are creating for ourselves are not those foreseen hypothetically by Wells. I only hope they are not a great deal worse."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"An unnamed time traveler sees the future of man (802,701 A.D.) and then the inevitable future of the world.

I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too munch.After all the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless.

It was too obsurd for me to believe it can become reality, and yet there are explanations for everything, making me doubt the future of mankind for the greatness that we believe it to be.The Eloi were interesting, I felt a great love for them. I get along well with children, so I suppose their child-like attitude drew me towrds them. The Morlocks on the other hand gave me the chills.

But even if one discounts the over-simplicity of the story it is hard not to get caught into the strange, distant future world (greater London to be exact) created by H. G. Wells. His vision has been copied and arguably improved upon over the past century. However even now the story enthralls. And the compactness of the narrative, in a book scarcely over 100 pages, is remarkable.Bottom line: yes, it is the sort of science fiction of your great-grandfather's generation. Thankfully it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine written by H.G.Wells is an all around great book. The way H.G.Wells describes the characters in this book is superb and it keeps you interested the whole time.There were several aspects I liked about this book. One being the way he describes the characters. He describes them with such great detail from the way they look to the way they act. One group that he meets is called the Eloi. The Time Traveller describes them by saying, \\" Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. There was nothing in this alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence, a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling the Time Machine. And then I looked more nearly into their features, and I saw some futhur peculiarities in their Dresde-china type of prettiness. Their hair was uniformly curly, their ears were singularly minute, their mouths were small and bright red, and there eyes were large and mild.\\" There is so much description in that quote and I just love it. It's so good that you can make a picture in your head of what they would of looked like.A second aspect in the book that I liked was when the Time Traveller relizes his Time Machine had vanished. I really like this part in the book because without his Time Machine there's no way he can get back and it makes you wonder what happened to it and what is going to happen to him. I loved how it just left you wondering. The Time Traveller says \\" When I reached the lawn my worst fears were relized. Not a trace of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty space amoung the black tangle of bushes. I ran around it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly, with my hand clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal,white,shining,in the light of the rising moon.\\" When you find out it's behind the bronze doors it makes it even more interesting because you say to yourself how did the Time Machine get back there and how is the Time Traveller going to get it back? It makes you wonder what kind of creature is behind that door and that is why that makes this part of the novel so good.A third aspect I liked about the book is when the Time Traveller saved a Eloi named Weena from drowning in the river. I enjoyed the part when they became friends after Weena kept following the Time Traveller everywhere. The Time Traveller says, \\" She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried to follow me everywhere.\\" At first the Time Traveller trys to leave her but then relizes he liked having her around. So from then on they were friends and I thought that was a really sweet part in the book and I liked it a lot.A fourth aspect I liked about the book was when he met the Morlocks. He described them as subterranean,ape-like vermin. He could tell by there smell and appearance that they were obviously carnivores but they had stolen his Time Machine and he wanted it back. He figured out that the Morlocks would eat the Eloi at night when they grew hungry and that is why the Eloi feared darkness. I liked learning about these creatures because they were different then anything I had ever heard or read about it. I thought they were cool characters even though they ate the Eloi.There was a fifth aspect in the book that I didn't like. It was when the Time Traveller and Weena were making there way home in the dark and all of a sudden these Morlocks start to surround them. The Time Traveller lights a match to scare them away but evenually ignites a larger fire to slow them down. Soon enough the whole forest is on fire and the Time Traveller makes it out ok but Weena doesn't and she dies. The time Traveller is very upset by this because they had become such great friends. I thought this was a very sad moment in the book becuase Weena was such a nice and gentle character and then she gets killed by a fire. I didnt like how that happened and that is why this is one aspect in the book I didn't like.Overall The Time Machine is a awesome book. Its one of those books that you pick up and you can't put it back down because it always keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Anyone who hasn't read this should definitely read it because this is one book you don't want to miss out on!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"If you were to build a time machine where would you go?

From start to end. And the last paragraph of the book is really heart-breaking I must say."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Not to put down both film adaptations of \\"The Time Machine\\" because I enjoyed them a great deal, but the novel totally blew me away. Granted, I am a fan of the \\"stranger in a strange land\\" premise, but the material Wells writes about, as well as certain philosophical elements, are way ahead of its time here. I don't think it's real necessary to discuss the plot, because I felt it was secondary to other questions and ideas the novel brings up (if you want to know what they are, buy the book and read it).The novel also doesn't neatly tie everything up by the end like the 1960 movie, and it offered Simon Wells (the author's great grandson, I think) a chance to make a movie adaptation to further journey into the Morlocks' subterranean lair. Even though the passage in the novel where the Time Traveller ventures underground is brief and ambiguous, it's still terrifying and accurate because the bulk of the story is told from his point of view. The ending was so spell-binding, and, in some ways tragic, I had to re-read it couple of times. It's incredible how Wells could fit this exciting and creative story involving time travel, the year 802,701 and beyond, & the Eloi and Morlocks into a compact novel a little over 120 pages. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, I feel this novel will still entertain and definitely provoke."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The time machine by h.g wells is a very interesting book that always keeps you guessing what will happen next.

Maybe its because to understand it I practically should of had a dictionary sitting next to me. Towards the end of the book it became more clear of his message. The creatures such as the elloi were greatly described. I could imagine them next to me. H.G Wells really had a message he wanted to show.

Wells is a classic sci-fi novel that changes your perception of the future. Wells belives that instead of the world developing more and more intellectually, that it will come to a point where there's no need for intelligence. In this novel Wells pieces the vocabulary so well together to create compelling pictures as if you were actually there. The Time Machine leaves you guessing at the end of each chapter to make you want to read on everytime. I would recommend this book to anyone who takes interest in science fiction."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book remains the most stunning time travel story ever written. Most scientists today regard it as H.G. Well's finest performance. The ideas are magnificent, and it presents what in evolutionary terms may be the most realistic depiction of a far-future age ever imagined.This story fascinated me when I was even younger than I am now. It fascinates me still. The footnotes and appendicies are superb, and the main descriptive essay on the reception and character of The Time Machine is worth the price of the book alone.At its heart, the novel is about socialist values. It stands as a warning on class system segregation, on \\"man's inhumanity to man,\\" as Wells put it. It is an argument for social reform, and, on the purely human level, for compassion. The fact that the future it posits can no longer be seriously considered as a threatening possibility in no way subtracts from the power and the beauty of this highly original work. The best warnings, after all, are about those terrible things that do not come true.That aside, the novel culminates in a cracking good story. The unexpected twists and turns are atmospheric, and truly powerful. One by one, the levels of ambiguity are peeled away, revealing a truth which may still be uncertain, but which is profoundly affecting.The story is fascinating in that it promises nothing, but remains like a dream. It tells of vast, far-off wonders, which may or may not be true, and at the end we are free to wake up.The time machine itself is a marvel, a glittering contraption that belongs in the star-speckled pages of the Arabian Knights. The descriptions of its operation are magnificent, as are those of the dying Earth \\"30 million years hence.\\" Astrologically speaking, many billions of years may be necessary for the ultimate death of the sun, but this is a fine attempt to paint a coldly scientific view of the end of an age.One of the most effective and memorable stories ever written. Pure genius and recommended in the very highest sense."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"One of the most awe-inspiring, epic books I've ever read. Makes me realize how pathetic the recent Hollywood movie was. What was so surprising was the numerous hilarious things the Time Traveler says in the account of his trip to the future.

For any sci-fi lover, this is a dream book. It just doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Once you get started you cannot put your kindle down.

While may be considered political natured by some , the book still leaves a last impression."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"once i was about halfway through the book i couldnt put it down. not only was it well written but it was very believable."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I read The Time Machine with a lot of preconceived notions probably based on films like the 2002 disaster which was sadly and ironically directed by the great grandson of H.G. Wells. If you've ever seen that movie please put it completely out of your mind as it is an abominable interpretation that has practically nothing to do with the source material. For all intents and purposes the \`Time Traveler' (as he is known in the book) only travels to one time, that being the year 802,701. Yeah, the time traveler doesn't mess around. He finds himself in a very dreamlike future where man has utterly conquered his surroundings. The rolling green hills are free of weeds, the air is clear of irritating insects and even the wildlife is gone. The population itself has diminished and only the occasional odd and beautiful structure is left to dot the landscape. The problem is that life's burdens have been so removed that humans are left physically and intellectually stunted to the point where their genders are almost indistinguishable leaving the soft, tiny humanoids to spend their days dancing, cooing and picking flowers unable to even maintain the very structures in which they live.H.G. Wells classic is filled with symbolism although much of I'm not sure I follow. The delicate Eloi are a withering of mankind into barely functioning childlike waifs while the subterranean Morlocks are the worker class degenerated into scarcely human, almost simian beasts who steal up in the night to snatch the Eloi away and consume them. The two groups are the reductio ad absurdum of the worker and leisure class but both have degenerated to the point where even the Morlocks are not the slightest challenge to the Time Traveler in a one on one physical battle although the do have a frightening bit of cleverness. The Eloi can be swept away in a shallow, slowly flowing river. It becomes clear to the Time Traveler that he has arrived at the twilight of mankind. Wells was a left leaning writer and I'm not sure what the races were meant to symbolize beyond the idea that it is the struggles of life that strengthen us and without those struggles we are pale, weak and stupid. The Time Machine is a classic that not only stands up to the test of time but continues to shine as one of the great achievements of science fiction. Wells put some real thought into the topic of time travel and I thought it was clever the way the time traveler began to fret that when he materialized in a time his atoms might collide with the atoms currently occupying the space in which he was appearing with disastrous results. Nothing comes of this but it showed that Wells was thinking deeply about the subject.At well under 100 pages The Time Machine is a very short book and was originally published in a book with six other stories. At the end of the book the time traveler makes a journey further and further into the future, millions of years making only brief stops long enough to note that the Earth is increasingly dying. The sun has shifted red and expanded to many times its normal size. The air is increasingly hot and rarified and humanity appears to be absent with only giant crabs roaming the barren landscape. Of course the traveler is always restricted to a physical location within a step or two or his time machine so who knows what was happening elsewhere on the planet. Eventually even the crabs are gone and for me this was a moment that will stay with me. The Eloi and Morocks were nothing more than a slice of history and as intense and harrowing as his experience was, here, at the Earths end it all feels meaningless. The whole of mankind's existence had ceased replaced by the giant crabs or replaced by something else that was replaced by the crabs and even they were gone. The living Earth was in its last throws. The traveler's journey adds a perspective to the notion of time that I have never read in any other book. The Time Machine is filled with strong emotions from the panic when the Time Traveler discovers his time machine stolen to the relationship between the traveler and the tiny Eloi female Ween and the sadness as the traveler moves to the Earths end, this is a book that will not be soon forgotten. I highly recommend this book and can see myself returning again."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This short story largely created the concept of the dystopia, where an apparently idyllic existence comes at great cost. It also defined and determined the storyline of time travel and how humanity could devolve over the course of time.The last half of the nineteenth century was a time of incredible technical advancements. There was rapid mass transit via railroads, nearly instant messages sent via telegraph and telephone and electricity was beginning to light up the night. In this time of great optimism about the potential of technology and the advancement of humanity, Wells wrote this story about how humanity could devolve.The Time Traveler uses his machine to move 800,000 years into the future with the expectation of discovering a golden age. Instead, he encounters two distinct races, the Eloi and Morlocks. The childlike Eloi are beautiful, live above ground foraging for the plentiful fruit and have the minds of children. The Morlocks are ugly, brutish and live underground on the flesh of the Eloi, which are essentially cattle. The Eloi have lost all technical knowledge while the Morlocks maintain the machinery that pumps the air into their underground caverns and tunnels. This is social commentary on the part of Wells, he has the Time Traveler theorize that the separation of the bourgeoisie and proletarian social classes has caused humanity to devolve into two separate species.To understand the social commentary of the Eloi and Morlocks, it is necessary to understand the growing power of socialism and communism in the late nineteenth century. Workers were beginning to band together into labor organizations and there was a growing split between the working and moneyed classes.Given the short length of the story, it is amazing that Wells managed to pack so many new ideas into it. A true visionary, he set down the fundamental idea of time travel and warned of the potential dangers of social separation and questioned the belief that continued social progress was inevitable."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine, by H. G. WellsThis is a short story about an inventor who ends up a time traveler. His name is never given (nor are any for the guests who come to visit and hear his story), he is simply referred to throughout as The Time Traveler.He creates a time machine in his laboratory and uses it to travel to the future. There he finds a race of people that are all very pretty, but rather stupid (he describes them more nicely tarians eating only fruit that they pull from the trees (which are apparently very abundas \\"childlike\\"). They have a very simplistic language, and are strict vegeant).But there is a secret sinister side to this Utopia: underground is another race of human descendants! The Time Traveler muses that they evolved from the servants and workers that the rich upper-class forced underground as the population increased (and, thus, room decreased). But in the end the upper-class got their just deserts, and at night are hunted and feasted upon by the denizens of the underground!Eventually our Time Traveler returns to the present, and just before the end of the book embarks (in a better-prepared fashion) on a second journey, presumably to never return.Being the student of philosophy that I am, I found the thought experiment couched within the thin story to be far more interesting than the story itself. Normally, when man is called \\"self-destructive\\", they mean that we're liable to destroy ourselves rather than succeed in our ultimate goals. But Mr. Wells tacks to a different path; he argues that if our civilization were ever to succeed in its goals, it would destroy us.Obviously I'd love to spend quite a bit of time talking about this, but I couldn't do it better than Mr. Wells, and so, since the story itself was in and of itself interesting, I suggest that you let him do the telling for you, and buy yourself a copy!Memorable Quote:And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers--shriveled now, and brown and flat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man.For more reviews like this, visit [...]"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In any discussion of the history of Science Fiction, H. G. (Herbert George) Wells is sure to be mentioned, and \\"The Time Machine\\" is the first of his novels/novellas. Wells may not have invented the genre, but his impact on it would be difficult to overstate. Unlike Verne, Wells was able to go beyond just what could be accomplished by science currently, and the invention of a Time Machine is central to the story Wells is telling. That is not to say that he has nothing to say on current sciences as well, just that he allows stories to take readers far beyond that which Verne would allow.The history of \\"The Time Machine\\" is an unusual one. Wells had used the subject of time travel repeatedly starting in 1888 with his incomplete serial \\"The Chronic Argonauts\\". It next took form in a series of articles published in \\"The National Observer\\" in 1894, and then finally as a serial novel in \\"The New Review\\" in early 1895 when editor W. E. Henley moved from one publication to the other at the end of 1894 and convinced Wells to write it as a serial for his new publication.The story itself is quite unusual as well. Wells refrains from naming the Time Traveler at all, and the narrator also remains nameless except one reference to a person named Hillyer in the final chapter before the Epilogue, which apparently refers to him. The only major character whose name is repeatedly used is Weena, the childlike woman whom the Time Traveler meets in the year 802,701 A.D. Though Verne would have considered the Time Machine a cheat, i.e. non-scientific, Wells does include other bits and pieces of science in the telling of this tale and there is a point he is making about science as well. He touches on evolution, astrophysics, and sociology in looking at what could happen to a society if life is too much of a utopia, as well as looking at the social divisions in the society of his time and where they may lead.The story is a quick read, at around 90 pages, and just 12 chapters and the epilogue the reader can easily get through this in a single sitting if they desire. It also, despite its flaws, captures the reader's attention and so one is willing to forgive the flaws in the story-telling.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"The Time Machine\\" also contains an Introduction by Marina Warner, notes on the text by the editor Patrick Parrinder, and textual notes by Steven Mclean. Lastly, though certainly not least, it contains Wells preface to the 1931 edition of \\"The Time Machine\\" in which Wells discusses the circumstances in his life when he wrote it, as well as his view that the work will outlive him. Flawed though the story may be, it is a significant work, very readable, and the Penguin Classics edition adds to the experience with the added material."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In my opinion, this book gets an \\"A\\" for originality. Most stories of time travel that I have read or watched on the big screen include super intelligent humans and fantastic technology. Not so in \\"The Time Machine.\\" The two distinct races of humans in this book are simple and animalistic, or perhaps child-like. There is no incredibly advanced technology or even a grocery store to get the food, for goodness' sake. It's as if humanity reverted to the times of the Neanderthals. However, in the area of character development, Wells scores a \\"C\\" at best. None of the characters are terribly deep and I didn't find myself getting terribly attached to any of them -- few though they were. In storytelling, I think Wells did a nice job, as I was engaged in the narrative and enjoyed the description of places, things, and people. However, I was also vaguely aware of some kind of social commentary with the frequent references to the \\"upper class\\" and \\"working class,\\" but I'm afraid this was lost on me, as I am not familiar with the culture of 1800s England. Overall, I give this book four stars."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is a cool book from Wells. In it he takes a giant leap into the future, more precisely year A.D. 802701! This is an action packed novel, it's really quite amazing that it was first published all the way back in 1895! Because the action level is equivalent to a Dan Brown novel. Of course Wells is far better than Dan Brown, because Wells is not only action he is also vitamin! The novel ends with the words \\"in the heart of man\\". That end is kind of a signature for Wells' work, because he was really curious, and of course the curiousity was particular related to what a human can do? What a human is? What a human can become? What there is in the heart of man?"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Thank you, My nephew loves his book.It was fast shipping, and good price."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I found The Time Machine to be very imaginative story.

I am really not a fan of books in general but i would recommened this book to anyone who has a big imagination and who is interested in time travel."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine was an entertaining book about time traveling. I thought it was interesting for a few reasons. First of all, everyone has their own ideas about time travel and what the future might be like. Through H. G. Wells' story, he incorporates his personal theories about the future. Furthermore, the conflict between the Morlocks and the Time Traveler keeps you at the edge of your seat because you don't know if the Time Traveler will make it back to the present time. Also, The Time Machine is very descriptive. From the delicate flowers to the grungy wells of the Morlocks, the author does a wonderful job explaining the strange, futuristic world. At times, I felt like I was in the story, because the descriptions were so detailed. The Time Machine was a great book, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in time traveling or about the future."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Although some people may disagree, The Time Machine is a wonderful fictitious novel. One thing that makes it great is the imagination. In the story the author gives a descriptive picture of what he thinks life will be like in the future. One man builds a time machine and is able to travel in many different dimensions. While he travels, things move quickly and can be witnessed in the blink of an eye. He sees the sun and moon rotate in seconds, he goes through different eras and wars, and eventually ends up in a completely different world. It is full life and will keep anyone reading until the end. Another reason the book is good, is the suspense. For example, when the time traveller first meets two groups of people called the eloi and the morlocks, he is very confused. He later finds out that the morlocks feed and clothe the eloi only to be able to hunt, kill, and eat them later. The time traveller wants to help the eloi and decides to try to fight the morlocks leaving the reader wondering what is going to come next. It is very exciting. Altogether the book is an interesting way to view H. G. Wells point of view of the future, and a good way to spend an afternoon reading."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book was very hard to understand.

Halfway through dinner, the Time Traveler appears, bedraggled, but with a colorful story of his travels into the future; the changes in the whole world and even the people in it.

Yeah, it was recently made into a movie, which was pretty good too. The book is much more straightforward, has (obviously) been around longer, and puts forth some of Wells' opinions and some good science of its day. Particularly striking is the central issue of the split between upper and working classes of people. While Wells' futuristic rendering of this rift may seem fantastic now, it does have the ring of ominous prophecy to it. Considering he wasn't too far off the mark about the future of communism in his fore-seeing War of the Worlds, readers may do well to take note of the message here.There's a reason why Wells is possibly the greatest science fiction writer of all time. This read is evidence clear; and it'll only take you an afternoon."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"i liked that book alot because it was really suspense and interesting book to me ..its just a science fiction but author put a strong thoughts and feelings in it so when are reading you get involved in it actually it grabs ur attention as far as you started to read.

Having built his machine the scientist adventures into the beyond and finds what has become of man; a divided race living amongst the ruins of (presumably) the capitalists empire. Enslaved for a time in the year 802,701 the traveler sees the nature of the utopian society and the neandrethal creatures not burdened with progress but perfection. Ultimately, the traveler escapes his imprisonment and ventures into the dark abyss where the world has aged beyond recognition. He returns to find an unconvinced audience and decidely ventures again into the unbelievable future, never to return.One of HG Wells most enduring novels it has the characteristics which would combine to define science fiction. Origenal and thought provoking it is perhaps the shortest novel that nevertheless retains the substance and power of most 300 paged novels. However, like all of his novels the revolutionary ideas and not the litary magnifisence of the text makes this one of the premere science fiction tales of all time. I recommend reading this piece of literature if you are in high school or above so as to truly apreciate and understand the brillance of the Time Machine."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"After 40 years and half a lifetime of being a sci-fi fan I finally got around to reading War of the Worlds and The Time Machine. I'd read a couple of Wells's other books that are less known, such as In the Days of the Comet, a very slow-paced novel without much action compared to the above two in which the earth becomes a peaceful Utopia after passing through the strange gases of a comet's tail. But I had never read his two greatest masterpieces. After I saw the recent Spielberg remake of War of the Worlds, I decided it was finally time to read them.This book has a notable intro by LeGuin that is readable and informative, and I enjoyed that. The book itself, unfortunately, I found just so-so. I acknowledge Wells's importance and skill as an author, and his importance to the history of sci-fi, but to me this was just pretty dull stuff. I found the future society of the Eloi and the Morlocks to be valid in the sense that they are basically a reductio ad absurdum of present-day capitalist society, but that's about it. I understand Wells was fond of creating future dystopias that, as another reviewer here commented, stood Victorian society on its head, but as I said, this is still pretty thin gruel on which to build a novel. And Wells's style seems an incongruous medium for recounting a story almost a million years in the future, although in War of the Worlds I thought it worked out much better. Wells's somewhat formal and turgid Victorian prose seems an appropriate medium for describing the complete destruction of human society by the Martians.In many ways, The Time Machine works better as a mood piece than as a science fiction novel, and the final part of the story in which the author travels millions of years into the future when the sun is dying and the human race has finally died out I found to be the most convincing part of the book. The dichotomous society of the Eloi and Morlocks, who represent the twilight of the human race, and were really no longer truly human, are gone, and the sun and earth are now in their twilight as well. This was the most evocative and poignant part of the whole book, and recalled the similar and wonderfully evocative ending in Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End, in which the human race also comes to a bittersweet ending by evolving into a strange communal intelligence, thereby leaving the limitations of individual corporeal minds behind.So while I appreciate Wells's greatness and importance as a founder of the genre and think this is still an important and even epochal book in the history of the field, I find it more gravid with historical significance than readability at this point. Perhaps I'm jaded as so much of modern science fiction wouldn't have been written without it, especially many of the classic time machine stories that followed in the 20th century, but in comparison to a lot of the modern stuff, well, I have to say it's pretty dull sledding. So perhaps I'm just a cultural barbarian, but I can only give it 3 or 4 stars, primarily as I said, beause of its historical and literary significance."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The turn of the century was a period when people often debated the future of mankind. Wells beginning by introducing the Time Traveler as he presented his time machine invention to a group of disbelieving men. The plot is simple the Time Traveler zooms into the future expecting to be emerge into a sort of technological paradise. He is utterly surprised. Above the ground, the earths populated by Elio, they are a short, round, angelical people who live in complete leisure, picking flowers and eating only fruit. They have perfected their bodies, so they do not have gastronomical problems with this fruit diet. Underground, however, thrives the Morlocks. They are beastly looking people that provide clothing to the Eloi before eating them. When the Traveler arrived in his box-like machine, it was this evil underclass that stole his time machine, which took him eight days and a thousand discoveries to find. Now that he knows were it is he tries to get it back before the Morlocks kill him. Will he be able to make it or will the he die trying. The thin plot is just enough to entertain the reader and remain uninhibitive to H. G. Wells's ideas on the development of society. Many of his views can clearly be able to see them. Any serious reader will agree with me that the points of view the Time Traveler had, seems to be the same today, and some of the questions are still unanswer"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book was completely riviting and compelling. It was a spectacular adventure and the perils the characters faced were extreme with excitement. H.G. Wells has written a masterpiece with The Time Machine.The settings were so completely illustrated through the author's words that you were practically trasported with the Time Traveler. Even though it is fiction, H.G. Wells makes it a wonderfully real world and shows that things are not always as they seem."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is one one those works that prove the validity of science fiction as serious literature, not simply escapist genre adventures. H.G. Wells provides us with a warning tale about our decay as a society and our very possible decay as a species, working with the theory of evolution since the process does not have to mean progressively better species, but may also mean regression. The science in this classic is wrong, something I usually complain about regarding science fiction, but Wells is far more interested in the social aspects of his novella than in the purely scientific ones. Important points: the humans that the Time Traveller encounters in the adventure he describes to his friends are just a part of the human branch, smaller than most humans of the Time Traveller's day, childlike (as in carefree and irresponsible), indolent, sexually active, lazy, and non-productive: they are parasites who do not contribute anything to their own existence. They still have the essentially weak bodies that humans are supposed to have traded long ago in exchange for a bigger brain and dexterity, so they could use their intelligence and their hands to become the dominant species on the planet. The Eloi that the Time Traveller describes are just useless, and they represent one half of our descent into a new species of primate. The other half are the Morlocks, ugly, soft, underground dwellers who keep the Eloi alive and feed on them. It would be very difficult to explain this biological division, both Eloi and Morlocks sprouting from the human branch, and Wells does not succeed with his explanation: the Eloi are still very similar to us, whereas the Morlocks are clearly different. Eloi and Morlock should be biologically closer to each other than to a 19th century man, but the Time Traveller is sexually compatible with the Eloi girl he saves: this is rather problematic, since the narrator clearly believes that Eloi and Morlocks are what is left of us. Another problem is the Morlock's fear of fire in spite of their knowledge of machinery and metal works. Without fire, there are no metal works. Wells theory of our social and evolutionary decay is the basis of this novella and, in spite of the problem with science, the argument works very well if one applies suspension of disbelief, which is essential anyway for any work of science fiction. Regarding the possibility of humanity -or a part of it- going underground and eventually staying there, I also recommend the book by Gabriel de Tarde \\"Underground Man.\\" A very positive aspect of \\"The Time Machine\\" is that the Eloi that our Traveller describes do not speak English: after evolving into something other than totally human, after hundreds of thousands of years, the Eloi cannot know English, and even though it is obvious to point it out, one of the worst problems with science fiction -especially in film and TV- is that all aliens speak English and plenty of them know Shakespeare pretty well. The author does not fall into that ridiculous trap: neither the Eloi, nor the Morlocks, know what English is, much less can communicate in it.\\"The Time Machine\\" is short, engaging, and thought-provoking. Once the technical problems are shrugged off, this is science fiction at its best: a warning of possible wonders and nightmares to come.

Wells, the main character, called the Time Traveler, goes through a journey that changes his life forever.The Time Machine is a well written book with many different elements of science fiction. If you enjoy reading a book with time travel and strange creatures, I strongly recommend this book to you. This book starts out informing the reader of what the time period is like and where the story takes place. The characters in the book are at a meeting with the Time Traveler. The Time Traveler tells them that time travel is real. Most of the characters think that he is out of his mind. Since they do not believe him, he is going to demonstrate using a small model of his time machine. As the model time machine disappears into time, the time traveler's guests are in awe. After this demonstration, the people are still skeptical about time travel and how it works. The Time Traveler then decides to become the first human being to travel through time.This book shows us many moral actions in the world. The Time Traveler's guests, for example, do not believe in him. So he proves to them that time travel is capable, and he never gives up proving this point. This shows how one can do what they dream by working hard. When the Time Traveler comes to a distant year, he stops the time machine. He is at a beautiful place with strange creatures. From here on, H.G. Wells shows what he imagines the future to be like. He uses special perceptions of reality to show these ideas in his book.This book also has some flaws to it. I think that he could have made the story line a little bit better. At times, I thought it was a little bit difficult to get into the book. Never the less, I thought this book was overall a good science fiction book. It had good supporting elements of science fiction, like strange creatures and traveling time. It is up to you to read the book and find out what the future has in store for the Time Traveler."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I know that the book is suppose to be better than the movie, but this time I just don't know. Having seen the movie so many times growing up, I thought that the book would be miles above. Unfortunatly this time I was let down. The direction that the novel takes doens't really work for me and I can see why the producers of the movie made changes. I found myself a bit bored towards the end and was even more suprised at how short this story was. I felt like it needed at least another 100 pages to enrich the details of the story."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"An unnamed time traveler sees the future of man (802,701 A.D.) and then the inevitable future of the world. He tells his tale in detail.I grew up on the Rod Taylor /George Pal movie. When I started the book I expected it to be slightly different with a tad more complexity as with most book/movie relationships. I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too munch.After all the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless. The writing and timing could not have been better. And the ending was certainly appropriate for the world that he describes. Possibly if the story were written today the species division would be based on eugenics.The Time Machine Starring: Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is about an inventor who makes a time machine to take him to different times.

He comes to the dinner and tells the guests about the experience he had traveling in time. That's when it starts to tell you all about his adventure he had in the future. He meets a lot of strange people and the time machine even gets stolen.I didn't like this book a lot. It was hard for me to read and pay close attention to. It didn't grab my attention like other books I have read. It gets better in the middle and towards the end if you keep reading. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in things such as time machines and travel. It has some hard and complicated words for some people.

Having seen the 1960 movie, however, I couldn't help but picture the movie characters when reading the book."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The phrase \\"the book was better\\" in reference to a movie-made-from-a-novel is incredibly worn out, but I'm going to say it here. H.G Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" is better than the handful of movies that have been made of this book.Other reviewers have touched on the book's themes very well, but I would like to echo that the themes and messages of the book shine through much more clearly than they do in any of the movies. This is classic science fiction, a story with a message. The author does not dwell on the intricacies of The Time Traveler's apparatus, nor does he try to explain the future's technology, nor does he ramble on about how flora and fauna have changed. The core of the story is a message about how mankind may one day wither away as a final, grand, ironic testament to its own victory over Nature.But if you have only seen the movie(s), don't hesitate to read this book! In the movie(s), the story - more or less - ends when The Time Traveler escapes the grip of the Morlocks and returns to his own time. In the book, the Time Traveler continues (for only a few pages, admittedly) even further into the future, and the things he witnesses give the story a very different tone.Additionally, the very end of the book caught me off guard. Like I said before, this is classic sci-fi, and the ending is no exception. This book is a brief read. My edition, which came in an H.G. Wells collection, was barely more than 60 pages."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"for personal reasons I will not review.for personal reasons I will not review.for personal reasons I will not review.for personal reasons I will not review."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"THE BOOK, TIME MACHINE, WAS THE FIRST E-BOOK I DOWNLOADED ONTO MY NEW KINDLE. IT SEEMED FITTING TO READ THIS STORY AGAIN ON SUCH A MARVELOUS ELECTRONIC MIRACLE. THE BOOK IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE TWO MOVIES MADE ABOUT IT. GOOD READING ON A STORMY NIGHT."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I just finished reading this masterpiece one day ago, and I thought I'd better write my review before the details get cold. First off I would like to say that the 2.00 dollar price listing on Amazon is AMAZING!!! That's an incredible deal. My only concern is the number of pages listed. Amazon claims this book is 80 pages long, well...my TOR edition published in 1992 was 118 pages JUST for the story, excluding the epiloge and afterward. I hope this is the ENTIRE complete and unabridged edition of the book. My copy IS...but I don't know about the DOVER THRIFT edtion.That aside, I shall review the story itself. This concept is one we are all familier with. Time travel is the reason why Sarah Conner is being chased by robots, it's the reason why Marty Mcfly was being lusted after by his mom. It's also what Mr. Peabody and Sherman do in their spare time. Time travel is a BIG part of literature and the visual arts. All of this though is owed to one man, H.G. Wells.Wells is the forerunner of time travel by machine. Before him there was of course the ridiculous concept of a man falling asleep under a tree for a hundred years, but H.G. took this leaping forward in time in a different direction. Why can't a scientist build a machine and \\"move forward in time?\\"To accomplish this Wells explores the interesting concept that time is just another dimension, the 4th. Just as a man can move forward, side to side and momentarilly up, he should also be able to move back and forth in time. Because of this brilliant idea for a story, we got 'Terminator', 'Back to The Future', and 'Bill & Ted'. Thank you sir. We also have many scientists pulling their hair out trying to prove this plausible. Good luck to you all.The story is written in an unusual fashion. Namely Wells does not name any of his characters, specifically the time traveler. Actually that's what he's called, \\"The Time Traveler.\\" Almost all mentioned characters are identified by their professions/careers and that's it. It's weird, but not too distracting.802,701 A.D. is the year our adventurer travels to. There he finds that civilization had reached it's pinnacle and since mankind has no struggling left to do anymore, he has declined/decayed into two radically different classes of people: the childlike Eloi and the lemur-like Morlochs.This book is very different than either of the movie releases, I think it's better than both, it's definitely better than the 2002 Guy Pierce rendition.In conclusion, if this Dover Thrift edtion is truly the complete edition I would pop on this and buy it. A great sci-fi tale and a classic everyone should read. I personally bought the Tor Edition from Good Will for $ 1.00 dollar, great deal, also the cover art is far superior to the Dover edition. But in the end it's the words inside that matter, period.Now if you'll excuse I am going to sleep and hopefully time travel 7 hours into the future. -Happy reading."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"An excellent book read many times.

There wasn't any action, so it didn't mean much to a kid. But as an adult, I have revisted this timeless tale, and I have found it to be more than satisfying.This story is a philosophical account of a time traveller. It has literary value beyond what most modern day novels provide. I found the accounts of preconceived stereotypes combined with elaborate hypotheses that turn out to be incorrect to be absolute genius. My only complaint with this story is that I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I read this book within a day and I absolutely loved it. Most of the classics that I have read are boring and can't hold your interest for more than a few pages and you have to take a break very frequently. But this book held my interest for hours on end. It makes you really think of what will happen in the future and how evolution will effect us and our surroundings. The Time Machine is an example of excellent classic fiction and I would absolutely recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"After more than a century, and decades since I last read it, The Time Machine stands as a science fiction classic! If you've seen and enjoyed the movie know that it doesn't do justice to the novel. Wells depicts a society of classes, one above ground and one below ground, in the distant (800,000 years away) future. The story is intriguing as the traveler misinterprets the roles of the two classes but through interaction with both he comes to realize his misunderstanding of both their roles in society and how those roles likely evolved. Considering when this book was written even the concept of the time machine itself is remarkable. (BTW, the depiction of the machine and its use may be the most compelling reason to watch the film.) Wells doesn't need to rely on the graphic horror and violence that seems to be the staple of today's authors. In particular, his depiction of a potentially dying earth in even later years is riveting. This is a quick read that you might just get through in one sitting. And you'll be glad you did! Like many of the classics we read in school or even just for enjoyment as kids, this is a book that can be appreciated even more with age. I look forward to my second pass through more of his works."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"No surprise, the book is much better than the movie. Though it was the movie last night that led me to read the book. The movie is pretty good. But the very end had that typical Hollywood romantic twist, where the scientist goes back to the future to be with the woman, Weena. It was a glaring enough insert that I simply had to read the book and see what Wells really had the scientist do at the end. My artistic guess was confirmed though I will not spoil it here for the reader.What really stands out is the bravery of Wells' thinking. He does sound exactly like a 19th/20th century Brit, ideas laced with Darwinian logic, struggle of survival, noble thinking white people overcoming the dim dark embarrassing past, that is, all of human endeavor until his time and way of seeing things. But then he takes it further. What if mankind succeeds in this assumed task of conquering Nature? Then there would be no more struggle for survival, and mankind would grow stupid, weak, and childlike. So your supposed view of man's purpose then leads to its exact opposite; or at least leads to a state of man that you probably did not see as the original goal.I would say it is not clear whether the author was supporting the \\"Conquest Over Nature\\" ideal, or pointing out the shallowness of that ideal. That's fine. Perhaps he was doing both, or neither."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I have been a Stephen King fan for years, but after reading the book the time machine written by Herbert George, I have to admit that I am 100% impressed by the words that described the journey of a man throughout time.

Herbert George: thank you for giving me the opportunity to read such fantastic story of time traveling."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Oh how I've missed reading the classics. I love them dearly, but I never seem to get around to reading them. They are truly wonderful and rarely do they ever disappoint, and this one certainly did not. I've been meaning to get around to reading something from HG Wells, so I decided upon the shortest one which also happened to be the one I've seen in movie form. I think this has definitely made my appetite for his writing grow so hopefully in the future I'll be reading War of the Worlds.The Time Machine is one of those books that actually can transcend the time in which it was written. The time traveling plot actually makes the dated writing style fit perfectly, and actually made my reading experience better. It's also a relatively short and quick read, but given that the actual time frame in which this happened is also short it doesn't really detract from the story at all. The one thing that really took me a moment to get use to is the lack of actual names, our main character is The Time Traveler and other characters in his present day are known by similar titles. It doesn't really matter, as the real story has no call for his name and with the ending Wells gives you it really enriches the story. Who ever thought that not knowing the character's name would be a good thing? There is also a tremendous amount of scientific and philosophical thought that goes into this, and it really got me thinking about what will come after us and why.The main story of time travel in this one is one that most are familiar with through at least some pop culture reference. Like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory, which probably my favorite spoof.The story in itself is kind of a chilling realization. You have the kind, dainty and beautiful Eloi who live on the surface of the future Earth. They seem to live the perfect existence. Then you have the lurking, furry, and terrifying Morlocks who live beneath the surface with their machinery. The two races play pivotal role in each others lives and more importantly they play an even bigger role in showing an over the top example of what occurs when one section of human lifestyle distance themselves from another. In this case the seemingly wealthy and lap of luxury against the workers who are relayed upon and yet shunned. But if that's too much thinking for you, you have no need to fear the story is wonderful without all the insight, especially if you've seen the movie.I would certainly recommend this to anyone with an interest science fiction and time travel. It's pretty short and only took me about a day to read so it's certainly not to much of a time consumer. Also if you haven't seen the original movie from 1960 go watch it, I haven't seen the newer one so I'm not sure about it."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was in grade school, and I absolutely loved it then.

So I typically hesitate to rate any novel because with my own reassessing, indecisiveness resumes it's place and with such uncertainties come my oddly decisive resolves to distrust my immediate appreciation and replace it with something that shies from the extremes.

To answer that question, I did a bit of reading about HG Wells. He was born in 1866 to a father who was a cricketer and a shopkeeper, and a mother who was a former domestic servant. When Wells was 13 his father was injured and the family was no longer able to support themselves. This resulted in the breakup of the family as the mother had to return to domestic service and become a livein housekeeper. Wells was then taken out of school and apprenticed to become a draper and later a pharmacy assistant. He was quite unhappy in both of these endeavors, and when he was 17 he asked his mother to buy out his contract of indenture so that he could return to school. His mother had saved her money and fortunately was able to do this. Wells then returned to school where he excelled in science and in biology in particular. At 21, Wells became a science teacher at a small private school. During this time he also started writing and he wrote a short story about time travel that was published under the title The Chronic Argonauts. It is quite a good story and available to be read online. The story is about a mysterious inventor who moves to a small town. The neighbors become suspicious of him when they hear him working late into the night and he then miraculously has electric lights in his home. They come to believe he is a witch. A clergyman comes to visit him to investigate and warn him of the anger of his neighbors. The scientist shows the clergyman the time machine he has been working on and he and actually demonstrates how he can disappear. A few minutes later they hear an angry mob approaching the house with fire torches. The scientist warns that they must take off in the time machine or they will be killed. He grabs the clergyman and off they go. The next chapter opens with a dazed clergyman found in a field of weeds. People investigate and they realize this is a man who lived in another town 30 years earlier. When the clergyman gains his senses he asks \\"What century is this?\\" He is much relieved to hear it is the the 19th century. He then says that he has a story to tell. They then arrange for him to give a deposition and he tells the story of how he got on the time machine and how they visited 2000 years into the future and then 18,000 years into the future. No descritpion is given of these places. The day after the deposition, the clergyman dies, and the story ends. This short story was published by the college paper. Wells said he always intended to go back and do more with it. When Wells was 30, he was desperate for money so he returned to this story to see what he could do with it. It now became the novel The Time Machine. He wrote that he often had to stay up late at night to work on it. During this time, his landlady would be yelling at him to turn out the lights because he was wasting too much fuel.Wells has stated that he was a social reformer all his life and was always thinking about how society could be better organized to improve life for the most people. He became a member of the Fabian Society that actively sought to improve life for the the working man. Wells knew from first hand experience that an unfortunate injury could bring financial ruin and break up a fmily. Wells also knew how unusual it was for someone like him to rise from his working class roots and become a wealthy writer. When Wells had failed at his different apprenticeships, he stayed with his mother at the wealthy home where she was a resident housekeeper. I am sure that during these visits he learned a lot about the dichotomy of life between the upstairs people and the downstairs people.Even into the 1930s, Wells was trying to reconstruct society and he was warning all that would listen that he felt humankind was going to destroy itself. He was very much concerned about nuclear annihilation. Wells died at the age of 80, shortly after Hiroshima in 1946. It is ironic that Wells had earlier stated that he wanted his epitaph to be \\"I told you so. You damned fools.\\""},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I originally read this in an H.G. Wells anthology that I got from my grandfather, and found myself wanting to reread parts of it again just for the way Wells uses description. I don't want to give anything away, but that it is a very satisfying, albeit short read."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Though I'm a big fan of grand sci-fi, this is one of the those simple tales that just keeps bringing you back. It is short and brings you back time and time again to read. One of my al time favorite novels."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The plot of this classic book, which paved the way for all science fiction, is rather simple. A famous scientist, whose name we never learn, builds a time machine and disappears in it in front of his skeptical guests. He later returns and claims that he has just come back from the future, and then goes on to tell his story. The writing is clever and absorbing, and will keep you fully occupied for a few hours - all that it will take you to finish this superb novel."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a classic novel about an unnamed traveler that adventures to a different, futuristic time. He finds this future has 2 very separate worlds. One made up of the fortunate upper class that is intelligent and small in size. The other a boorish lower class of workers, forced to live underground. This timeless piece outlines the possible consequences of a growingly divided world between the more and less fortunate. And the differences between the physically superior and the mentally superior. Wells paints a vivid picture of this future world with descriptions of the settings and characters appearances. However the one thing that is most vague is the chief character that is not even awarded a name but is called simply \\"the time traveler.\\" This book outlines the conflict involved with classism and is still relevant in today's society. It is a must read for all people interested in classic literature."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine was a fairly entertaining book, although I do not like how the author wrote it. It's a good story that I would recommend it to people, but I just don't like the way he wrote it out. It was very detailed and made you think. Although there were many parts in which it got boring. Also I'm not much of a fan for time travel, I would really recommend it to those who do."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Although I am quite a fan of the works of H.G Wells, I have to say that this book was a disapointment.Unfortunately, it held far too socialist a view for me; the originallly wealthy people degenerate into a useless race who cannot do anything to stop the people of the underworld.The working people ,on the other hand ,control the people of the upperworld,and prosper.I found that the end,too, was unsatisfactory.I would not have minded if the hero had at least died in the end! Instead, the ending and the fate of the hero was unresolved. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this book;probably the only Wells book, I DO NOT like!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I had to read this book for school, and found it to be extremely boring. The whole time, one man is telling the story- he is too discriptive and is hard to understand. I do not recommend this book to anyone 13 and under."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"i felt that this was a good boinkin! book and that you should buy it and or read it , it is cool and there is a person in the story with the name of Weena.(im serious)she enjoys matches and fire and flames and so do her comrads"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old son who saw the movie. He didn't like the book and said it was too slow starting for him. He also said the movie was better."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I am a big H.G. Wells, THE TIME MACHINE; fan... If you are looking for this novel to be the official Motion Picture Tie in just because it has Guy Pierce as the Time Traveller. All of you will be disappointed. I have to rate this a 2... For several reasons...1. The cover of the novel is misleading.2. This novel again has nothing to do with the March 8, 2002 movie release.3. Very misleading Foward by Simon Wells.The reason to give this a 2 is clear. It's misleading but it's still Wells... The orginal novel. Guys save yourselves money if you really want the Time Machine novel buy the Bantam edition. ISBN 0-553-21351-2 US people pay 2.95 for the same novel... Minus the Simon Wells, introduction which is nothing more than bragging rights to the new movie.Buy the cheaper book... save your money... by not buying this unfortunate money making edition of a classic. Simon wells, is not worth 2 dollars more."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book's underlying tone is a siren to humanity. A warning as to the decay liberalism always engenders. A classic book, with a sage message."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I think its an interesting book....thats is, it would be if I could understand half of the words. Its really well written and the story is good but who does the author expect to know what he's talking about?"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book was okay. Read it carefully and try to understand it. Just try the first 20 pages and see if you like it. It's about a time traveller who goes in the future and the society isn't smart and advanced as you'd think. 5165846518"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I have read the book and seen the movie several times and i think that original or not the way he brought it about and the ideals that he had about mans future were enlightning and verry creative one thing that history has tought us is that most of what man achieves and invents usually started out as fantasy or science fiction in this case i hope history does not hold true to par or god help us all."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This is one of the few cases where a movie based on a book is actually better than the book.The movie, although dated by today's standards, brings the machine's inventor to life and lets us see that he has true concern for the welfare of people in general, and the welfare of future generations in particular. His relationships with the Eloi of the future are far better displayed in the movie.The book's writing style is stilted and at times much more difficult to follow that it needs to be. It is a wonderful story, but the writing often obscures the story."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I had to read this book for a report at school. I mainly got it for its length (it was the shortest one on the list), but i enjoyed it after i got finished reading it. This book didn't put me to sleep, but it was not one of the best one's i've read either. It was cool how Wells predicted the future, but I wouldn't want to live there. Other than that, it was an ok book"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"I don't mean to badmouth H.G. Wells; he was a talented, intelligent man. His work The Time Machine is thought to be orininal by most people. However, after some research, I realized that this novel is not as original as one thinks. Many aspects of this novel were already used, if not trite. Several scenes were similar from previously published novels; even some of the topics he discussed (evolution, time travel, class structure) were intertwined in earlier novels as they were in The Time Machine. It was, for the most part, enojoyable, but it certainly was not completely original. This really has nothing to do with the quality of the work in itself; out of the three novels I've read by Wells, this is the best one. Besides the fact of its triteness, the novel was well written and deserves to be a classic. I don't know if anyone reading this knows of H.G. Wells thoughts about sex and such, but for some reason, his relationship with Weena reminded me of his troubles/thoughts on sex."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is a truly interesting book, at least I thought. It has all the elements of a great book, and it's length is pretty short. In this case, though, I'm not so sure that that is a good thing!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine was an early novel by Wells.He is a wonderful author in his abilities to blend the elements of science fiction with social commentary and human feelings.The relationship between the Time Traveler and Weena is special.The true moral is said in the final sentance-that even when mind and strength have gone,graditude and a mutual tenderness live on."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"It would have been cool to find the experimental model somewhere in the future."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The Time Machine is an outstanding book. Everybody should read this book. Especially the people who like sci-fic, adventures, and futuristic. This book can be read by all ages. Old, or young. So come on people read this excellent book by Mr. Wells!!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The time traveler{Scientist}works in his lab on a time Machine. When the time machine is completed he asks a doctor, and a writer, with a few other professions and talks to them about it and how he made it. Well, of course they don't beleive it, but before he has dinner with these fine people he decides to take a test drive to the year 180,240,001, and there he finds things very bizarre, so bizzare that our whole humanity is changed into creatures you would never believe, the Eloi's and the Morlock's, one afraid of the dark, one afraid of the light!"},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"After reading The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, my immediate thought was that it was an idea ahead of its time because every movie that was ever made about time travel, was based on this book. Not only was the story incredible, but was also extremely well written and descriptive. All these qualities contributed to a book that I thoroughly enjoyed and now I understand why it is called a 'classic.'"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],q={key:0},j={key:1};function G(n,e,s,u,r,o){const m=w("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),i("div",x,[(t(!0),a(g,null,y(o.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,E)):v("",!0)])}const C=c(H,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-1094890a"]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/39.md","filePath":"guide/39.md"}'),B={name:"guide/39.md"},R=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[b(C)]))}});export{z as __pageData,R as default};
