His prognosis was not good because the cancer had spread to his lungs and brain. When Armstrong was told that his chance3s of survival were slim, he decided to fight the disease in ever way he could. He sought and received many different expertise opinions on how to treat the disease Armstrong gathered information and studied the disease so he was able to decide the best possible treatment for himself. Because of his cancer, Armstrong was forced to put his professional bicycling career on hold. After three months of intense chemotherapy, Lance's body positively responded to the chow, which successfully eliminated all cancer cells from his body.After Lance recovered from cancer, he began to train for the Tour de France in the challenging mountains of France. Armstrong's relentless determination and strong will propelled him back onto the international cycling circuit. The next stop for Lance would be the classic Tour de France. This book also explains the courting of Lance's wife and the birth of his son. It's Not About the Bike is an inspiring story about the spirit of Lance Armstrong's struggles and successes. You will walk away from this book with a true understanding of what strength and determination are."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not only is the book wonderfully written, it is eye-opening in every respect. Everybody knows somebody with cancer, but who really knows what they go through? This book brought me one step closer to understanding what it means to be a cancer patient. I was also fascinated by all the cycling references and stories. I finished it in 3 days."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What makes this book most powerful is that the author is not afraid to admit his faults and mistakes. You certainly don't end up thinking he is perfect (sometimes you believe his wife should be nominated for friendship).Yet when you finish, what really blows you away is the there really is a sports hero! With so many mindless sports bios where they make claims as to how many thousand women they have slept with, or why their 25 drug arrests were actually mistakes,or the whining that there hotel suite wasn't as good as the next guy, here is a guy with not only ability, but courage and honor to match.A friend gave me this book because I was a very serious cyclist. I probably would not have bought this book on my own, sports bios put me to sleep.As I was working on reading this book, the Tour de France was on, and I would tell my 4 year old that this is the kind of person she should grow up to be. The back story here is so powerful, it had me in tears when I saw him pull ahead of Jan Ulrich in his 3rd tour.This book is more than a good read, it is a great service because the story is one of hope, and the victory has very little to do with biking."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was an amazingly well written/well edited book by an athlete who manages to inspire us while staying a regular guy. I was really pleased to see how readable the book was, and even more pleased to read about the ethics of a man who has overcome great obstacles while keeping focused on a very difficult goal. We don't have many athletes to point to when trying to show our children a well-balanced, high-achieving adult. Lance Armstrong fits the bill.I would recommend this book to cancer patients and survivors, to those interested in bicycle racing, to kids needing a book to use for a report on heroes, to single parents needing encouragement (Armstrong's mother was a single parent), and to readers in general who need an inspirational story to read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most people know Lance Armstrong as the 2-time Tour de France Winner, but first and foremost, he is a Cancer Survivor. Whether you're into cycling or you are familiar with the struggle, mentally, emotionally, and physically, of battling cancer, this book will draw you into itself and not let go of you until you've finished it. It is written in a very conversational tone, which makes it very easy to read, and there are some good life-lessons to glean from his experience. You'll learn quite a bit about dealing with cancer, as well as a thing or two about the athletics and politics of bicycle racing. This is not just another athlete spending 200+ pages talking about himself - this guy has something worth saying ... and something worth reading."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the most challenging athlete's story I've read since Jabbar's GIANT STEPS. It is filled with wonderful juxtapositions. Armstrong is arrogant but honest, tremendously focused yet capable of shallow flightiness, loving and predatory. In other words, he proves to be thoroughly human.As a recreational cyclist and longtime fan of the sport, I followed with great interest the career of this young Texan. I remember hearing the devestating news of his illness and like many other people was shocked to witness perhaps the greatest comeback in sports history. This book gives the reader a behind-the-scenes perspective on these events. It is well-arranged and paced so that the inspired reader hits no dead spots. Don't, however, expect to find a completely likeable guy. Armstrong's competitive nature makes Michael Jordan look like, well, a boy scout."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is an excellent read. It is long on real-life and short on pity. There is a good look at life on a cycling/racing tour, something many Americans have never experienced. Lance Armstrong does a good job portraying his growth from a loud-mouthed, obnoxious teenager to a warm, caring adult. Although he does devote much of the book to his diagnosis, treatment and recovery from cancer, it is written in a matter-of-fact way, not a &quot;poor me&quot; way. He presents a good lesson in not ignoring unusual symptoms and getting to the doctor...had he done so when he first noticed changes in his body, he might have been spared much of the treatment agony he had to endure to save his life. This book is also a good lesson in exploring your treatment options, and seeking second, third, and even fourth opinions to save your life. This is an excellent book, easy to read, and gives us a realistic picture of the man behind the bike. Many good life lessons for all of us exist between the pages of this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A good read. Makes you think about your own life and values."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a survivor. It's that simple. His book recounts his tribulations and is extremely inspirational without being sappy.In the military it's important for warriors to read Prisoner Of War accounts so all will know that, if captured, ANY situation can be survived.Everyone should know and understand the trials of Holocaust survivors, not only to prevent a recurrence, but to learn from them. When your chips are down, you will always understand that people have survived much worse.Certainly there are cancer patients out there who will not survive, but where there is a glimmer of hope, Lance's book is a beacon in the abyss. Against the odds, he not only beat stage gazillion cancer, but went on to win the worlds most grueling athletic event. Twice!It's Not About the Bike is a fast read. You'll love it. It's too bad it took this horrific disease to turn America on to International Bicycle Racing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong has been through a lot in his life. This book is uplifting in that it shows how someone faced with one of the most dire situations - he was diagnosed with late stage testicular cancer - deals with the situation by relying on friends and family to pull through. However, he not only pulls through, he gets back in form to win the most grueling sporting event in the world, the Tour de France not once but twice. More interesting is the transformation that takes place in Lance's own outlook on life. He goes from being a brash, overconfident, naive young athlete to a man who learns that life is more than winning races. His priorities totally change and you enjoy the change in his character and priorities. If you enjoy reading about what it takes to win a major sporting event, or bicycling in general, or motivational stories you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As the title states...it's not about the bike. This is so inspiring that I recomend it for everyone. Everyone can learn and gain from this. It will raise the bar you are currently challenging yourself at both mental and physical. Even my roomate who spends most of his time in his room and can't even begin to think of competitive cycling could benifit from this. I hope he and anyone in the dumps reads and becomes a better more solid person. Lance is a true Amercian hero, as well as his wife, and many around him. As you'll learn, the top of the list, he is a &quot;Cancer Survivor&quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book speaks eloquently on many levels, and there are insightful lessons for everyone here. The difficulty of getting back to &quot;living&quot; after a battle with cancer, the disenfranchised feelings of a teenager in Plano, Texas, the value of one devoted parent, the grinding life of a professional athlete were all aspects I didn't expect from this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book mainly because I am an avid cyclist myself and follow professional cycling very closely. But true to the title, this book is not about the bike. And it is so much better for it.I found myself deeply moved by this book. I read the entire thing from cover to cover in a matter of hours. I got it in the mail around noon and couldn't put it down. I finished before I went to bed.The frank honesty and candor with which Lance describes and chronicals his disease and recovery are amazing. I can only imagine the pain and endurance it took for him to go back and relive the events of the last four years, to put them all in print. Much less the courage to invite all of us in to share and take part in it with him.I can't say just how strongly I recommend this book. Lance is an exceptional athelete, but more important he is the face of courage and strength in an abyss of insurmountable adversity. The inspiration and insight he offers are priceless."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance is a mystery to most americans who only idolize winners. In Europe, where they know cycling, he is almost universally disliked, not just because he is a doper, but because it reallyis about the bike, and his own personal fame.This book is an \\"I love Lance book\\" written by Lance! Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Touching story of beating the odds. A man, his mom, his bike, his friends, his health, his family.Armstrong matures as cyclist to world fame in France, and matures as human with epic battle with cancer.Life is precious commodity that at times we all take for granted. Lance still wrestles with the mystery of it all, not grasping its entirety, yet celebrating what comes next on the road, pumping as fast and hard as he can toward its finish line.Captivating background of his past. Especially important moment came when he lost his first pro event. His coach Carmichael had this monumental words for him: \\"Lance, you are going to learn more from that experience than any other race in your whole life.\\"Learn well, this man does. Obstacle after obstacle he pedals, over, through, around. Absence of father, youth, inexperience, cancer, comeback, new husband, fathering.He's a winner. Still yearn for him to meet the mystery to life, the one who has overcame the race we each must conquer: physical death. A great book by a leading cancer doctor: \\"Measuring Our Days\\" speaks of this doctor's experience with terminal cancer and death. He wishes someone could relate to him who has gone through and conquered it. Amazingly someone has! Jesus of Nazareth! The mystery and wonder and awe of it all! Lance is close, but not there yet. Would that the Spirit would grab him."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the autobiography of Lance Armstrong, now three time winner of the Tour de France, quite arguably the most grueling athletic event in the world. This is the story of how one man fought cancer and became &quot;the first American, riding an American-made bike, on an American team ever to win the Tour,&quot; catapulting the sport of cycling, before, a primarily European sport, into the awareness of Americans.In short, Lance was a promising biker when in 1996 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He went through brain surgery and difficult chemotherapy to eventually lick the disease, and then returned to biking to win the 1999 and 2000 Tour de France. (He's also won the 2001 Tour, but the book doesn't go that far.)But the book is not just about the cancer. For a reader who is new to bicycle racing, it makes a fairly good primer on racing, explaining the different events, the terminology, and the tactics; and introducing the reader to the big names in the sport. It is also a love story of how he met his wife, Kik, and goes almost as in-depth into the in-vitro fertilization process necessary to have their son, Luke, as it does into the cancer treatment.The book charts Lance's transformation from a young, brash competitor who usually angered the other racers, to a more disciplined, thinking stategist. It's also interesting to note that Lance, now considered the man to beat in the climbs, used to be a sprinter before the cancer transformed his body.The only thing that I found disappointing about this book is that Armstrong neither depends on a faith in God nor develops any through his ordeal, so it fails to be the inspirational story that I had hoped it would be. Despite that, I found the book very interesting, informative, and difficult to put down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The most inspiration story I have read in a long time. Lance Armstrong a world-class athlete nearly struck down by cancer, only to recover and win the Tour de France, the bicycle race famous for its grueling intensity is a winner by all accounts. As serious and difficult the race may be the race to defeat cancer is even more difficult. And that is the core of this book which includes serious medical detail from chemo to surgical procedures to his wife's in vitro fertilization, you won't be spared a single x-ray, IV drip, or unfortunate side effect. Lance Armstrong is a winner in regards to life, death, illness, family, medical setbacks, training setbacks and personal triumphs. Reading this book makes you proud.FinancialNeeds.com"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had great hopes for this book, but low expectations given the quality and content of most athlete's stories (&quot;I was abused/unsponsored/hated/injured but I won/almost won and learned a life lesson at the Superbowl/Olympics/World Champs&quot;).I was pleasantly surprised by the readabilty, human focus and voice of this book. The first chapter is gripping, and clearly establishes the &quot;this is who I am, no apologies necessary&quot; tone. Even though you know how this story plays out, it's told with enough insight and detail to make it interesting. The recognition of growth moves this book a couple of notches above the standard self-congratulatory sports fare.Some phrasing is repetitious; &quot;X was great; they were there when I needed them&quot; appeared a few too many times (I get the idea! Lance was well supported by a close circle of friends!). If you can *tolerate* writing that's not high-brow, this is an entertaining read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"you can't fight lance's compelling story: fatherless small town texas kid becomes champion bicycle racer, then is diagnosed with cancer -- a death sentence he eludes to win the tour de france over and over again. the story is certainly inspirational and benefits from lance's simple, frankly expressed emotions. however i'm only giving it 3 stars: 1. the writing is really flavorless and only picks up momentum at a few moments, lance could have really used a writer who cared; 2. with the benefit of hindsight, and with sheryl crowe now \\"decorating\\" his arm, a lot of the lovey-dovey about his wife seems like a lot of yap; 3. lance defending himself on performance-enhancing drug charges still sounds like bill clinton talking about marijuana and sex. at the end of the day this is a nice enjoyable read, good for an airport or vacation, but for REAL inspiration try lansing's Endurance, or papillon, or we die alone, or.."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My husband gave me a bike for my forty-something birthday. Before we knew it, we had a bike-trailer for our son, panniers, backpacks, and a baby-seat for our daughter. Every weekend last summer was spent on a trail. On bikes we saw our home state of Massachusetts as we had never seen it before.We know nothing of professional biking. But we would buy an occasional biking magazine. The name \\"Lance Armstrong\\" came up in them again and again.I did not know he had cancer and, despite this past summer's publicity, the words, \\"Tour de France\\" meant nothing to me. But the title of his book, \\"It's Not About the Bike,\\" intrigued me. (The last thing I want to read about is bike racing.)In the book, Armstrong describes his denial of his physical symptoms. How he failed to tell a doctor friend about how much blood he coughed up in his sink. But a severely swelled testicle and the urging of the same doctor brought him a battery of tests. Within hours, this racing-star iron-man discovers not only that he is sick, but that he may soon be dead.But his fame works for him. On the advice of a letter received by an interested biking doctor, Armstrong begins to re-examine his cancer treatment. Eventually, an aggressive series of treatments that would destroy his lungs is abandoned for a treatment that might not only save his life, but also put him back in the literal saddle.It is at this point in the book that as a reader, you realize that we continue to be captains of our own lives, even when we are extremely vulnerable. Under no circumstances is there a clear set of \\"answers,\\" even when renowned experts give us those answers.As a cancer patient, Armstrong had to be vigilant and continue to persevere more so than he had to in any race. Armstrong was a biker known to push his body beyond all limits. But to save his own life he would have to push his mind and body to levels he had never before known.But Armstrong is not alone. He has a devoted mother, a girlfriend, good biking community friends, teams of doctors, and even strangers interested in his care. It is this combination that probably not only saves his life, but saves his biking career as well.The place where I was a little annoyed with the book is when he goes to France with his new wife. He rambles on about how his pregnant wife Kik understood it when he had a bad day at work. (Riding.)\\"If we both hadn't been equally committed to the life style it would not have worked.\\" He may as well said if they both were not committed to \\"me\\" it would not have worked. He goes on:\\"Unlike me, he (a fellow biking friend) had no one to come home to in Europe. When he returned from a race or training camp he came back to an empty apartment, and some times spoiled milk. I had fresh laundry, a clean house, a cat and dog and everything I needed to eat.\\"The fact that her issues, being pregnant via in-vitro fertilization (high risk), leaving her career, leaving her town and her country, received no consideration because she had to make sure that Lance's milk was off the counter and in the fridge seemed obscene to me.Lance Armstrong seems to have an invincibility charged by the inability to focus on anything but Lance and by surrounding himself by others only concerned with Lance. (At least in his presence.) The cancer set him back, reminding him that despite his amazing lung and athletic capacity, he is still made of flesh and bone.Still, despite his self-absorption, there is something likeable about this man and certainly undeniably amazing about what he did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"this book has inspired me to be the best that i can no matter what happens in my life. with me being a male, this has shown me that something as big as testicular cancer can take something huge away and put it in the back of your mind for a long time. anyone who needs some inspiration in their life needs to read this book. it was a little shocking at first since lance was so young when all of this stuff happened to him. however i was very inspired to be the best person that i can be even if there is a lot of tough stuff that comes up in my life. if anyone is going through some tough times, whether it is cancer, death, divorce, or any other issue, read this book because you will be inspired to be the most positive person and come out on top of things when everything is back to being that way that it was before all of the bad things happened.

Few of us can say the same about cancer. In this book you can learn a little about both. While Charles Barkley thankfully tells us that he is not a role model, Lance Armstrong thankfully embraces the opportunity. This is not the book for you if you are looking for lots of details about cycling. It is the book for you if you want to read about the struggles and triumphs of an individual who happens to be the world's best cyclist. Something to think about while I ride in the rain."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read this book. I don't care if you know nothing or could care less about bike racing. This is one inspiring book.

Lance whips cancer and wins not one, not two, but three (and counting...) Tour De France's.You need no understanding or knowledge of bicycle racing to appreciate this book. Lance is a true American hero, and you OWE it to yourself to read this book. I promise you that you'll finish it in two days and after that, you will find your ears perking up any time you hear the words &quot;Lance Armstrong&quot;.I've loaned this book to more people than any other book I own.

He never gives up for anything, even though he got sick, and he stood to fight with the disease. His cancer drove him crazy, and Lance beat it in his body. He was a cancer survivor , and he had a lot of energy to fight with it. Even though he knew it was a strong disease, he wasn't scared of it, and he believed someday he will be healthy again, ride the bicycle, and do activities he did before."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This experience is about our life with an illness, like cancer. It teaches us, how we have to fight when we get problems in our lives, but the most important thing it teaches us, is that, there's nothing in the all world we can't fight, when we got the strength to keep our life the way we want it. This book teach me that I have to continue fighting for my ideals and my hopes about life, and never give up when the obstacles stop you, during your live. Keep fighting, this is the beginning of the rest of our lives."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is an example for the people who have cancer. Lance explained it, in his book how he got a cure for his illness and the courage for reaching his goal as the best cyclist in the world. I admire Lance's temperament and tenacity to survive.

It is a very inspiring book. Despite Lance's tragedy, fighting cancer, there is a lot of positiveness in his experience. It is a book that I have read in one shot while traveling from Europe. As the title says, &quot;it's not about the bike&quot;, even though there is a very interesting perspective on bike racing and training. I feel compelled to follow the &quot;Tour de France&quot; next year even though I have never paid attention to it in the past !"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is inspiring to say the least. The story of Lance Armstrong, and his dedication to his sport, his family, and his &quot;cause&quot; is uplifting. It is definitely written in the first person....definitely written along the time line of his disease. What courage he had to fight the disease in the manner he did, with his eyes open and gloves off. My hat is off to him. It isn't often that I encounter someone that I would like to meet in the books I read, but he is definitely on my list. It would be an honor to know him."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm not a big reader, but I read this one pretty fast and I was thrilled! I have never been close to a cancer patient. That's why I wonder, if cancer is such a common desease, why then all this information is so new to almost everyone. After reading the book, Lance is like a brother to you, and you'll never look at a bike the same way again. Congratulations for this great book Lance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although I was familiar with Lance Armstrong via the media, I did not know the details of his story. Also, I am not usually a fan of nonfiction, but this is one of the best books I have read in several years. It gives tremendous insight into the man that Lance Armstrong is and what has helped to make him that way. He doesn't claim to be a wonderful and great person in addition to being a wonderful and gifted athlete. What he does is tell his story, simply and with great candor.Through the book, the reader discovers what true determination and discipline are. Now, when I think that doing aerobics for an hour is sometimes difficult, I think of what Lance Armstrong and others like him are capable of. I realize I don't even know the true meaning of pain and suffering.For anyone interested in cycling, this book is a must-read. For anyone interested in a story of cancer survival, this book is a must-read. And for anyone interested in what carries a person through some of the darkest and most painful days of his life, this book is a must-read. You don't have to admire every character trait that Lance Armstrong possesses in order to admire him as an athlete and a person of great strength, courage, determination, discipline, and tenacity."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm in awe of Lance Armstrong. I was hit by a car in 1988 and know what it takes to recover. This story brought tears to my eyes multiple times. By some standards Lance Armstrong is dysfunctional. The lack of a true father figure in his life shapes him in interesting ways. I couldn't put this book down. The sacrifices his wife Kristin makes for him were phenominal and I found myself extremely disappointed that they recently split. It shouldn't be a surprise based on what you'll read. For a second, I thought Lance Armstrong might even believe in a higher power at the end of it all...the book seems honest to a tee. A must read for bikers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is life changing! Thank you Lance for sharing! It truly shows your spirit.

This book is for everyone, you don't have to have cancer or be a bike rider to understand or enjoy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a woman. I'm not a cyclist. I've never had cancer. I read mostly fiction. But this book absolutely blew me away. So much more than an athlete bio, this is a wonderfully told, brilliantly written story of a real American hero. The play-by-play cycling coverage is fascinating even to a non-cyclist and the detailed discussion of Lance's illness, treatment, and recovery is beyond inspiring. The look inside Lance's childhood, his love life, his amazing journey into fatherhood, and his role as a cancer activist is what brings the whole story home. So much more than a story of athletic achievement and cancer recovery, this is a story about triumph of the human spirit. I can't wait to root for Lance in this year's Tour de France and in the Olympics. Hopefully we'll be cheering him to victory for years to come. I have been talking about this book to anyone who will listen to me. Listen to me. Buy the book. You will not want to put it down. It is a story you will never forget."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had and beat testicular cancer just like Lance Armstrong, so I could truly relate to the incredible obstacles that he described in his amazing book.This sincerely is an amazing story. I just wish I could have read it when I was going through my intense radiation treatments in my recovery, because I feel it would have made things easier for me. In his book, Armstong brings this disease into the public view, and allows people to see that it truly doesn't have to be a part of death, but, in fact, a part of life.There are many stories within the book. His childhood, his attitudes towards his father figures, his early racing career, his battle with cancer, the stuggle to get back on top of his game, his love life, and, his extemely personal march towards fatherhood. Each and every one of these minor stories gives an overall inspirational journey into Lance Armstrong's remarkable life.The writing is nicely detailed and allows for a good, easy-flowing read. The racing-scenes are action-packed, and make you feel as if you are right there on the bike with him. Armstong tells his tale using candid language and relates his stories of life with honesty and a pure heart. This book is a true inspiration to anyone. Please read this book. You cannot go wrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a physician and a bicycle racer and when I heard that LanceArmstrong had metastatic testicular cancer, my first thought, likemany in my field, was &quot;He's dead.&quot; But Lance Armstrong's story has the happy Hollywood ending nobody expected four years ago. This isn't Shakespeare, but I found it to be compelling reading (a stay up til you finish it kind of read). I am especially appreciative of the insight into the human condition, how one responds to adversity by either giving up or fighting back. Many of his homilies such as &quot;turning negatives into positives&quot; struck a nerve with me, as I've come to expect setbacks to be followed by unexpected success because it's happened to me so many times. I'm pleased that the book is so popular, because maybe the rest of the world will stop thinking people like me aren't such freaks riding our bikes 50 miles in January. It offers a glimpse into our sport that most people don't get to see. But I mostly hope others find the human message of hope as inspirational as I did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After recently recovering from Cancer, my wife suggested that my &quot;story&quot; would make for a great book. I told her that there aren't too many people who would want to read about a nobody from New Jersey who went through a miserable experience with Cancer. I'd have to be a &quot;somebody.&quot; Well, Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins wrote my book.When I most recently saw media coverage of Lance's story and book, I was angry. I didn't want the public to believe that Cancer had a hollywood ending if you work hard and don't give up. There's nothing hollywood about Cancer and I resented the attention Lance was receiving. Then, I read the book.IT'S REAL. Through the wonderfully constructed words of Sally Jenkins, and the raw, honest sentiments of Lance Armstrong, this book tells it like it is. Lance Armstrong is just like anyone else who happens to be diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. He is not a hero. He is not superhuman. He is human. And, in this book, he doesn't pretend to be anything but that.This book takes you through all of the emotions of being a cancer patient; fear, sadness, anger, resentment, pity, hope, and so on. Though every patient is different, Lance's feelings echo those of myself and countless others who are in the survivor's club.As a marathoner, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Lance's cycling career. However, you don't have to be an athlete to appreciate his incredible drive, determination and accomplishments on a bike.His story both on and off the bike is truly inspirational.This book is for cancer patients and survivors. It is for their families and friends, who just can't fully understand what it is like to endure the physical and emotional challenges of the disease. It is for athletes of all skill levels, shapes and sizes. And, it is for ANYONE who needs a little perspective on just how precious life really is and what's important.Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"So I bought this book because I wanted to read an inspirational biography. I was happy with it until the truth came out!This was not the inspiration I was looking for, instead it is an example of what some people would do, all the lies and cheat, in order to have power and money. This book should be classified as \\"Fiction\\" instead of nonfiction biography."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book 11 years ago or so, when it first came out. Good book. Well written, entertaining. But, unfortunately, as subsequent events have revealed, the book is fiction. Because it was, well...it was about the bike all along. The bike, the money, the power, and the ego. This is a man who would stop at nothing to feed his need for power, including treating former employees, fellow riders, friends, even wives and girlfriends like dirt. The doping could be forgiven, but the bullying? Never."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the most inspirational biographies I have ever read, and comes from the truly remarkable life experiences of a determined young man. I loved every word!Early in the book, Lance Armstrong says &quot;. . . that cancer was the best thing that happened to me.&quot; He goes on to say, &quot;When I was sick I saw more beauty and triumph and truth in a single day than I ever saw in a bike race.&quot;Overcoming cancer and becoming an athletic champion in the grueling sport of bicycle racing require a toughness of spirit, mind, and body that is hard for most of us to imagine. This inspirational book portrays beautifully how one can start with the right spirit and overcome enormous obstacles.Although his doctors told him he had a 40 percent chance of surviving stage three testical cancer, this was mostly to keep his morale up. After he had recovered, his doctor admitted that is chances were around 3 percent, instead.While he was being treated for the cancer, no one thought that he might ever race again. He did decide to go through treatments that would leave open the possibility that his lungs (affected by the cancer) would still be functional and his coordination (through delicate brain surgery) would be unaffected. Within two years, he had won the Tour de France, a grueling race he had never done well in before he had cancer.Growing up, Lance Armstrong had little reason to suspect that he would become one of the world's greatest athletes. He was well into high school, still trying pretty unsuccessfully to make the football and swimming teams, before it became clear that he could become a significant cyclist. Pleased with the money that success brought, he had a tough time building the attitude of a champion to go with his remarkable endurance skills. Overcoming cancer helped him with that, as well as seeing the beauty around him.He met his wife at the press conference to announce the beginning of his foundation to fight cancer. They were married during his recovery, and recently became parents through the miracles of modern medicine.Of such wonderful stuff are role models made, something we have too few of these days.The story is told in a very open and matter-of-fact way. He is not trying to make himself into something that he isn't. Clearly, his purpose in writing this book is to help all of us fulfill our potential rather than to glorify himself.Please share this book with people who need this inspiration."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It all just sounds too good to be true to me. Perhaps this book could be re-assigned to the fiction section? Or great crimes of the 21st century?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"His claim is that he has been competing all his life so he deserves to compete once again. What he fails to acknowledge is that he never competed in his life since doping is not a competition, it is a crime. After making his money illegally by doping, he harassed, sued, threaten everyone and anyone who made any statement not to his liking and now he is looking for forgiveness. He should be sent to a prison and allowed to preach his senseless vision behind bars. He should be treated as a criminal and pay for his lies, manipulation and disregard to all rules of a sport and humanity... A white color criminal, the lowest form of human being, a true disgrace. I truly feel sorry for his siblings since they will have to endure difficulties for a sick parent like him when they had nothing to do with his actions. Wish his siblings health and happiness."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was somewhat torn as to what to rate this book. On the one hand , Armstrong does an excellent job of expressing what it feels like to be a world-class cyclist and the emotions that go into racing in the Tour de France. I particularly enjoyed his description of his training. He is indeed an incredible athlete.I was also impressed with his recovery from cancer. It was a miracle of both modern medicine and his incredible faith and fighting spirit that he not only survived, but went on to improve his already impressive racing career. He was very thankful of the doctors and staff that helped him along, as well as being appreciative of his friends and family who supported him.All of this being said, I found it hard to read at times. His writing was not great, and sometimes I found him to be a annoying. Not having had cancer, I cannot claim to understand how it feels, but I don't think it gives him the right to be a jerk as he sometimes comes off in the book. I understand that some of his cockiness is why he is so successful at cycling, but he mistreats his wife and some of his friends throughout the book as they try to help him through depression and the physical torment of his recovery from cancer. He passes these times when he is inconsiderate or selfish as \\"they understand that I it was not a time to talk to me about this...\\" or \\"she's such a stud because she understands why I need to do this.\\" I didn't find many places where he did anything for his wife/girlfriend...it was mainly about how she sacrificied for him. At other times, I disliked how he whined about how teams wouldn't pay him top dollar when he came back--\\"They only wanted to pay me $250,000 which is like the minimum for a rider like me.\\" We should only have such problems. In any case, I found it hard to like him during these times and wanted him to get back to the cycling parts.One other thing I almost laughed at everytime I noticed was that he tries to throw in a bunch of \\"one-liners.\\" They may have had a different effect when he said them in person, but when he quotes them in the book, they come off as cheesy and amateurish writing.I guess the main thing is that I enjoyed reading the book. My thoughts were that it was really incredible that a person would kick cancer and then go on to be one of the best cyclist in the world. I found the details of his training and racing as well as his cancer treatment fascinating and inspiring. However, as I read it, I wished the person who accomplished all of this would have been a nicer person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am pretty busy, so as much as I love books, I generally have to fit them into the little spaces of time here and there and it takes weeks to finish one. But this book arrived Thursday afternoon, and by Friday evening I had finished it and was wishing it could have lasted longer. Okay, the first third of it is a bit slow. It contained more detail than I needed about how he won his early races. But the last two-thirds, his battle with cancer and his comeback afterwards, were absolutely enthralling. Inspiring? Of course. I hope never to have to fight for life as Armstrong did, but if I do I know Lance Armstrong's ability to beat 97% odds will be in the back of my mind, pushing me on. Meantime, if Armstrong can cycle through the Alps with saddle sores, what more might I be able to push my own body to do?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Lance's journey really sent home the message that we can all turn our lives around. And I don't mean medically. Lance's transformation into a more &quot;human&quot; caring person, shows us what is possible for everyone. This book was a great read. I highly recommend it.Another book on personal transformation that I thoroughly enjoyed is by Ariel and Shya Kane called &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work.&quot; This book shows how, in easy to understand terms, people's lives can be totally transformed by adding a simple awareness to their way of seeing. It too is a wonderful read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you've never been profoundly effected by a book, then you have to read Lance Armstrong's story. Yes, it gives you great insight into the cycling world, but even moreso, the book opens your eyes to the physical effects of cancer and how to conquer them emotionally. Lance doesn't hide any details of his diagnosis and treatment but chooses instead to lay them all out for everyone to see. His experience has made it easier for men to freely talk about testicular cancer and to take the early steps to prevent its progression.I am not an avid cyclist or a cancer survivor, but Lance's book read so well (I finished it in 2 days) that I could totally relate to him. I enjoyed every page and even laughed and cried as I read. I have never rated a book on Amazon before, but I was so moved by this story that I couldn't help myself. I even contributed to the Lance Armstrong Foundation today through Lance's web site in order to help other cancer survivors. You can help, too. It's a good cause, and you never know.. one day you might need and appreciate such a donation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After knowing what I know, why would anyone read this lies? I for one would burn that piece of crap if I had it purchased."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong came back from testicular cancer to win the rugged Tour de France bicycle race, twice. And his emotion-drenched memoir, written with sportswriter Sally Jenkins, should be especially useful as an example to cancer patients.He rode herd on his own treatment, insisted on multiple opinions and relentlessly questioned his doctors. The book concludes with an almost inch-by-inch account of the three-week, 2,290-mile Tour de France, which Armstrong inevitably calls &quot;a metaphor for life.&quot;There's suspense and spiraling inspiration; anyone reading the book knows who won. Still, there's lots of drama, and as cancer success stories go, Armstrong --- is the champion."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance holds nothing back, in &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;. Relationships, (both good and bad) throughout his life, vivid descriptions of healthy life and competition, and of course gut wrenching detail of cancer treatments are presented throughout the book. The final chapters put the reader in the tour, exposing the strategy behind the race, as well as the battles fought in the mind, and against the other competitors.It's the ultimate comeback story of a world class athlete, young and on the rise, who is faced with his own mortality when cancer intervenes. Lance begins with his early days, competing and winning with brute force, no strategy just an all out attack. Like any competitive athlete, he expresses his feelings of invincibility, and continues this belief until cancer just can't be ignored. The medical procedures, the chemo, and it's sickening effects are described in vivid detail. Cancer becomes the opponent, and ultimately Lance wins.It's a book about growing, maturing, and pushing on in the face of adversity. Following the battle with cancer, Lance battles himself, when making a comeback to the competitive circuit. On several occasions the decision is made to throw in the towel, to retire from competition. With the support of those around him, Lance is able to dig deep within himself and find the courage and determination to come back and win the Tour.Truly and incredible autobiography, about living, learning, growing, and maturing. An amazing book!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a great reader. But Armstrong's book is hard to put down, easy to read, and incredibly inspirational. He puts real-life skin on old standards: tragedy and triumph. While Armstrong's honesty and frankness, at times, reveals a young maturity level, they also reveal a growing character, and a hard to come by balance between a satisfaction in whatever life may bring and a determination to make the absolute most with it. I cried when I read his encounter with an &quot;angel,&quot; and e-mailed the passage to my friends. The wake-up call?: Get back in the saddle... and ride."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The word \\"hero\\" is defined as a person noted for acts of courage or nobility of purpose. Being a hero is something decided by others, not by oneself. For example, when Lance Armstrong told Kelly Davidson (another cancer patient from Texas) over the airwaves from the Tour de France that \\"this [race] is for you\\", that simple but profoundly noble act certainly was certainly heroic to her. This is probably the most notable example of heroism to be found in this book, but it is not the only one. The loyalties exhibited between the author and the people closest to him as he fought to save his life are examples of heroism that we all experience.Despite the book's title, the description of the author's progress as a racing cyclist (both before and after cancer) is every bit as riveting as the story of his battle with cancer. My only disappointment with the book was the relatively little attention given to the need for a new training regimen after the cancer treatments--a focus toward maximum aerobic effort and reduced anaerobic effort. While the effect of cancer treatment on Armstrong's muscular system necessitated this change in training, it proved to be just the thing he needed to win a long, grueling contest such as the Tour de France. By maximizing aerobic effort, Armstrong was able to minimize the production of lactic acid--a definite advantage over the competition."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Being an athlete myself, this book was completely inspiring and motivating, not to mention Lance's ability to beat cancer with less than 2% chance to survive. This book is easy to read and great for ANYONE to read. It is a book about life, family, and love. He is a self-motivator and gives hope to anyone reading the book. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong in his book recounts the transformation that happened in his life out of finding out at age 25 that he had very advanced testicular cancer. Incredibly, he was able to beat very unfavorable odds and come through cancer free. The cancer in his case seems to have worked as a tool that helped him transform and wake up to the richness of his life. He discovered how loved and supported he was by his family and friends, he discovered and was able to appreciate the dedication and incredible talent of others who collaborated to save his life, he discovered his inner resources and his passion for living, he rediscovered his love for the Bike which he was taking for granted... Out of this experience he won the Big Price: Huge professional success and a very fulfilling and loving marriage. If you are interested in transformational experiences and in discovering the state of being where success, love, satisfaction, self expression and aliveness reside, I highly recommend that you also read the book WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book is a gem and it delivers all the keys to personal transformation and enlightenment. I highly recommend it to anybody who, like Lance Armstrong, is willing to challenge the limits of what we think it is possible to make happen in our lives."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I purchased this book for my son's middle school library. After receiving it and skimming through some portions, I was disapointed in the use of profanity. I could not in good conscience give this book to the school so I returned it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The writing is powerful as the authors take us deep into the world of competitive cycling and also life-threatening cancer. Lance's medical recovery and skills as an international champion cyclist are beyond refute.However, the book is marketed as something more than simply a sports memoir. Unfortunately, Lance's humility and personal transformation aren't convincing. The manner in which Lance lashed out at the employee at a golf shop, proudly labeling his wife a &quot;stud,&quot; and accelerating his automobile past 100 mph when &quot;Kik&quot; went into labor left me with the impression that he's still an obsessive, self-centered, macho jock.In my opinion, Lance's effectiveness as a positive role model should indeed &quot;not be about the bike.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As my title suggests, this was a must read from the first page onwards. A remarkable story of one man's battle and subsequent success against cancer. Apart from this, the book obviously reflects on his well known cycling exploits. Regardless of whether this man \\" cheated \\" in his achievements is neither here nor there, as the vast majority were doping in some form or other ( there has been enough documentation substantiating this subject in the last couple of years ) thereby still proving that he was the best of his generation of riders, doping or no. What really grates, is that there \\" seems \\" to be so much more to be read between the lines and the constant denials by this man, mean that the reader can never be sure what is the truth and what isn't."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was excited to read this book as I am an avid cyclist and triathlete. I was very disappointed. Lance describes his journey through his career in an almost cavalier, \\" I deserve it all\\" sort of manner. He lacks an attitude of appreciation, humility, and respect that I believe other elite athletes have shown (e.g. Mike Singletary, Arnold Palmer, Joe Montanna, etc.) I must admit his experience with cancer was horrific and I am glad that he can be an inspiration to others that face the same trials. Unfortunately, the predominant theme that I took away from the book was his attitude of arrogance, pride and self-indulgence. Before reading this book, I was prepared to root Lance to his fifth Tour de France Victory. Now I hope he looses, it would do his tremendous ego some good."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Inspirational. His journey back to life was indeed a rough one. My focus was on his illness and his road to recovery. It was truly not about the bike for me.It was a good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a huge Lance Armstrong fan and this book is great. If you are a fan of Lance, cycling, sports, or just inspirational stories I would highly recomend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book tells us of his inspiring journey back to life. He tells us of his strength of character and determination to live in a somewhat conceited way. His fight is definitely admirable. However, modesty is not the only thing missing in the book. Being a cancer patient and Tour de France winner is not an excuse for shoddy writing. I'm only seventeen and I found one grammar mistake after another throughout the book. \\"Criterium\\" is not a word that an English dictionary recognizes. Perhaps it is a cycling term that Armstrong did not find necessary to clarify for those of us who are not familiar with the lingo. Perhaps he meant \\"criterion.\\" However, either way, by not explaining it to us Armstrong indirectly meant his book to be read by ardent fans of cycling. Surely this isn't the best marketing ploy to use?Don't get me wrong, I think Armstrong is a truly great man who has seen too many hardships in his life, even if he does come across as someone who's head is so inflated that his treasured maillot jaune wouldn't be able to get over his head. I understand that his childhood was turbulent and he had to prove himself over and over again to the world. I admire his mother because I know that if I were in his situation, my mother would stand by me the same way. It couldn't have been easy for her to raise him as a single mother in the midst of Southern-belle-manners. His story truly is \\"the stuff of legends,\\" as Independent eloquently puts it. I completely empathize with him. However, he isn't the only person in the world to have gone through cancer and come out triumphant. Armstrong comes across as someone who looks at himself as God. Even his pseudo-modest moments come across as forced. As an objective critic who is analyzing the writing, and not the story, I have to say that I've seen much better. His editor overlooked some major errors.What also struck me was Lance's garbage about his wife. Had I not known about his divorce, I would have believed him to be a completely devoted husband and father. He gushes about Kristin and how she \\"is a stud\\" over and over in the book. Where did Sheryl come in, then? This bit of knowledge makes the book seem even more fake. It makes me wonder, were any of the sentiments he expressed true? Did he just make them up to seem like a victim who mustered the strength to ressurect himself from cancer? His battle is inspiring. But are all his sentiments true? Even if they aren't, the fictitious sentiments, at least, are inspiring.I remember my first thought when I finished the book. \\"You disgust me.\\" And that still stands."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"On a technical level, this book is an amateurish read despite the presence of a co-author.In terms of content, I was embarassed for Lance most of the time. He knows just enough to understand that a story like his SHOULD be inspirational, but by recounting (even relishing in) petty achievements like owning an expensive car, driving it fast, and talking down to most of the people he encounters, gives away the fact that as a human being, he's less than the sum of his accomplishments (which are limited to riding a bicycle).I have a thousand times more respect for the majority of cancer victims who fight quietly and win or lose, manage to maintain their dignity in the end."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I loved the story. But I was frustrated with the amount of errors in the book. Many times the paperback bounced around, you would turn the page and the story would be either further advanced or re-visiting previous chapters. The page numbers were all correct, but I'm sure parts of the story are missing. I went to the publishers website. It said to return the book to them and they would replace it. I called their customer service and asked if they would pay for the shipping. They said &quot;no&quot;. I said I didn't think that was a good way to do business - after all, my reading pleasure was ruined by their mistake. They said &quot;sorry, it is our policy&quot;.This is the first book I've bought with this type of problem.So beware of Penguin Putnam Inc. (formerly Berkley Books)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I couldn't put it down! I can't say anything about what's going on with Lance's career at the moment and no one can know for sure what the truth is, except Lance. That being the case I really tried to go into this book open minded. I was not disappointed. I was astonished at how much I enjoyed this book. I've never really been a cycling fan and never really followed Lance's career so I really didn't have any opinions going into it. Although I found it interesting to see what happened to him during his time of cancer, I was actually much more interested in his history in cycling. How he started, what his trials were in the beginning, the things he thought he did wrong, and the things he thought he did right. Probably the best part of the book for me though, was him talking about his first Tour win. I was literally on the edge of my seat as I read because the description of the Tour was so interesting.I know of a few people that haven't been able to read this book because of their own ideas of who Lance Armstrong is, based on his newest news coverage, but I really don't care about what the news says. Regardless of the real and actual circumstances now, he is still an amazing athlete and has done fantastic things in his life and career. I just thought it would be important to mention this because of the few people I know who couldn't get interested in this book because of current affairs."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book has many words written about his fight on cancer. It has also detailed descriptions about how the disease affected his life and his perspective of life. It is well-written in a very direct way which can be very inspirational and emotional to readers. This book scores well from the inspirational side, especially on how he recovered from the disease.For cycling enthusiast who would like to know about his Tour de France races and conquest, there are about 50 pages of stories, with scant reference to other cycling greats like Indurain, Zuelle, Escartin etc. How I wish it were more detailed and more references because this are the parts which are most exciting to read.At the end of the day, many of us know Lance as a cyclist and this is what we like to look forward in his next book........"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was truly am inspiration! Not many people have the courage to fight back as he did. It was a wonderfully in-depth look at real life for a person stricken with cancer. He has a no-holds-barred approach to every page. He writes with passion and attacks the story aggressively! A must read, especially for those who enjoy biking, wether mountain biking or the Tour de France!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"First off, this is a great story of how grim determination and luck beat the odds against the Big C and reached accomplishments far beyond the normal person's dreams. I can't imagine anyone not being inspired by LA's tale and happy for him &amp; his family. On the down side, LA's ego also appears to be world-class and as sometimes seems the case in autobiography, he tends to take every chance to point out instances where he is superior. I would have rated the story much higher had it been written by a third party, but at any rate, the Armstrong story is terrific. Good luck at the 2001 TDF, Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspirational book, especially considering his latest achievment!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book held me almost breathless throughout. It is not for any specific type of reader or person, athelete or scholar. It is a book for anyone and everyone. It is a book that can truly be appreciated by anyone that has ever taken a breath of human life. I had never thought much about cycling or the Tour de France before I had read this book and was worried that parts would bore me. I could not have been more wrong. It traces his life in an interesting and entertaining way, but most of all lets you know what it is like to face death and survive. Lots have done it, but few have put it so eloquently as Mr. Armstrong and his co-author. This is truly a book that should be read by anyone that wants to live a life of purpose and meaning."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished Lance's book two days ago and I found it heartwarming and inspirational. I can personally relate to his struggle with cancer as my husband was diagnosed with stage three testicular cancer in 1993. We went through the chemo, the fears, the blood tests, the cat scans and all the side effects. We already had a family-seven kids aged 9 months to 11 years at the time, and it was a great struggle. My husband never talked much after his remission and eventual cure. I am grateful to Lance Armstrong for being a spokesman for this disease and for his courage.

This is my first ever online review, that's how good it is. I read this book in one long sitting, and was sorry when it was over. Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thought the book was excellent. I also started the book and couldn't put it down until I had finished. Lance is truly an American Hero and everything in this book says so. From a cancer survivor to a biking legend and still going. He is going to have to look out for those walls on the way down the mountains though if he wants to continue biking. Luck lasts just so long. Greg Lemond had similar feelings about continuing biking after his hunting accident."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance, it's not about the bike. It's about generalizing your pain to other people, it is about tolerance, understanding, kindness, compassion, forgiveness. Unfortunately, you just didn't get it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As an amateur triathlete, I couldn't wait to read Lance's story. I was eager to delve into the mind of one of my heroes, hear how he survived cancer and became a legend. Boy was I disappointed! This poorly written, extremely repetitive book had me cringing early on from the style; it was easy to see the book had been hastily published and hadn't received the editing attention it deserved. And the content! Armstrong reveals himself not as a noble, courageous human but rather a selfish jerk. I expected inspiration from reading this book but didn't take that away at all. Part of it could be my recent cancer experience, and part could be that my expectations of Lance were simply too high. Nevertheless, I no longer see him as an athlete or an example-- he's just another jerk who's good at his job."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book directly from Mr. Marcus after his appearance at an all-star seminar here in Boston. For someone who has accomplished so much and is a rising self-improvement guru, he was very humble and quite easy to talk to; these characteristics are evident in his book in that it is a pleasure to read and learn at the same time. In my opinion, Marcus' greatest asset is that he examines all of his failures in life and uses the experience from them to keep on a course towards success. That is something that I am trying to do now and the book has helped a great deal. I also signed up for his free e-newsletter at cmarcus.com and it is extremely helpful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very enlighten book.

This is a story of leadership, determination and a will for life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a real life story about a man who found himself while he was challenged with the greatest fight anyone could fight. The fight that to live or die. This is a story of a hero who fought one of the deadliest diseases that kills people everyday. Lance Armstrong found out what the greastest things in life were while he was challenged with this horrible disease. This time he had to fight the cancer and get to the finish line first before the cancer could finish him off. I thought this was an outstanding book that gives everyone who is facing lives greatest challenges hope to live and to go on. It teaches you that greatest things in life are family and friends. Lance Armstrong learned that no matter how much money he was still going to have cancer. He learned that no matter how much he had in life that he was not going to able to defeat cancer if he did not have faith. He soon learned what his priorties were and he learned that the best thing that could ever happen to him is that he had to face death. He looked at death in the eye and he was not going to give up on the greatest thing in this world which is to have family and friends. He learned that no money in the world was able to show him that until he was faced with this great challenge. I rate this book a perfect ten is one of the greatest life stories I've ever read in my life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"With all the troubles in the world and just about all you read in the newspaper or see on the television set, it's time for a good story to be told. Lance Armstrong is a winner and in this book it talks about winning, not the tour de France but the game of life. Lance Armstrong can ride a bike like no other and he can also face death in the face and ride right across its path to win the Tour de France.The battle with cancer was a long one full of pain and surgeries, not to mention chemo. He fought back with everything he had to get back on the seat of that bike and win again. A must read book that will make you re-think any troubles you have and give you what it takes to win in life and in any type of game or sport.

This is for sure...I'll be tuned in to the Tour De France in July."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Meet Lance Armstrong, the illegitimate son of a single teenage mother in Texas, who became the fastest thing on a racing bike this planet has ever seen. At the height of his early career, Lance was diagnosed with testicular cancer and beat the disease and the odds to survive, thrive, and prosper, often in the face of naysayers who said, \\"he's finished.\\"I'm not a cancer survivor or a cyclist, so neither of those things drew me to this book. I wanted to read how a champion, someone who's always been a winner, handles adversity. I didn't come away with any formula for success; for one thing, Lance says explicitly in the book that he'd seen people with no strong will to live survive cancer while others who were absolutely determined to beat the illness died from cancer. Looks like it simply wasn't Lance's time to go. Since his recovery, he's helped many other people with cancer and devoted a great deal of his time and resources to those struggling with the illness. He says that once you have cancer, you are forever a member of what he calls &quot;the cancer community.&quot;Lance didn't strike me as someone with a sense of entitlement, a case of \\"that will never happen to me.\\" He was too busy pedaling. But when he was diagnosed, he wasted no time applying the same tools and tactics to fighting cancer that he applied to racing. The consistent thread between his illness and his championship bike racing was his approach to both: he's in it to win and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed. This is a man with true commitment, a very rare quality in today's hurry-up-I-want-it-all-right-now culture.This story has a happy ending-he beat the disease, he won the Tour de France, he got the girl, and the happy little family walked off into the sunset. That's the short version. But it's no fairy tale. Lance's story has given hope to many and enjoyment to others. An accessible, conversational tone runs throughout the book, and we get a sense of the Texas boy who grew up riding through the Texas prairie with a very determined will and a good sense of his natural gifts. Easily polished off in a focused weekend.*It's Not About The Bike* is also a great tribute to single moms and the power of a mother's unconditional love and support. Linda Armstrong is a champion, too, and Lance never lets anyone forget it. Right on!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike is a Hero's journey of a poor street boy who became a great athlete and a great person. The book is about the change of a Lance Armstrong and to his becoming a winner of the Tour De France, the greatest competition bike ride around. This book not only tells about stories of biking but it tells life stories and life lessons. It tells about how his struggle through testicular cancer and how he became a husband, a father, and an amazing person. This book shows what kind of stuff it takes to win. It shows what kind of hardships people must go through to have a good life and what how hard work pays off. Lance's book demonstrated that no matter how bad your life is going there is always worse so one should go through life with a smile and be thankful.I would give this book a five star rating because it meant a lot to me and I could relate to a lot of it. This book is real and gives the truth without trying to sell it self. This book leaves no secrets and shows a true hero's journey and a true hero and how he can affect the world. I shared this book with my friends and family and l have not put it down until they where finished. They all agree that this is one of the greatest books ever written. This book gives a strong viewpoint of how you should treat people. It tells that you should be nice to everyone but at the same time do what you can to get yourself and the people you love on top. Everything he says makes sense because he seems to have a greater understanding for things and doesn't write or do stuff to make people happy. He does what he thinks is right. He did not begin with a good life, he fought for it and that's what I like best about the book, the story of his struggles to get through life.I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. Whether you like biking or to read does not matter. This book will relate to anyone and it will mean something different to everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Its Not About the Bike Book ReviewStricken down by the chains of cancer, Neil Armstrong recovers to win one of the greatest events on earth, the Tour de France. This story is about one of the greatest athletes of our time. It enthralls you in emotions, good and bad, and leaves you with a feeling of self-accomplishment and joy. The fantastic thing about this book is that it is all true.In the story you hear about the difficulties faced by a low-income family with only one parent. The mother of Lance was young and barely managing, but gave Lance everything he wanted. He said, \\"she would make things like a squishy at 7-11 feel like getting a new bike.\\" When Lance was in high school he wasn't like everyone else, he was different. When people were walking to school in kakhis and Calvin Klein plaid shirts he was swimming, running, and bicycling in triathlons. When he was sixteen he was smoking 30 year old pro athletes. He was on his way and had his goals set.Years later Lance switched completely to bicycle riding and was great. He made a high income and had a perfect life. Then one night he discovered he had cancer. His life was instantly turned upside down and would be forever changed, but maybe for the better."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great Book. Shows the motivation and determination of this man, just a great book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's life is a fascinating tale and Sally Jenkins tells it very well. The basic outline is well known. From a tough background in Texas, Armstrong entered the world of professional cycling and won the world road racing championship. It appeared that he had a great career ahead of him but in 1996 he was struck by testicular cancer. By the time that he visited a doctor, the cancer was advanced and had spread to his lungs and brain. Despite the poor prognosis, he recovered from the disease and went on to return to the highest levels of professional cycling and win the Tour de France, the sport's blue ribbon event.Sally Jenkins is an accomplished sports writer and she has done a fine job to render Armstrong's story into a gripping and fluid read. I finished this book in one sitting and I think that many readers will do the same. In terms of gritty detail, there is more about cancer treatment than about the Tour de France and the detail is explicit. Reading this book will give you a vivid picture of what it is like to face a course of chemotherapy.I do not want to make a judgment on the man himself. Some readers will be in awe of his achievements while others will be exasperated by his faults. I cannot recommend this book as an inspirational read either. Anyone who can complete the Tour de France let alone win it posesses levels of physical and mental toughness that are so far beyond normal experience as to seem superhuman. Rather than being inspired, a cancer sufferer given this book to read could just as easily see the message that if you are superman, you can fight cancer. Seen instead as a fascinating tale the book is a compelling read.Even if you have no interest in cycling, this book is still worth reading. I am very glad that I read it and I think that most people who pick it up will feel the same way.You will probably want to buy one of the later editions as they contain additional material relating to Armstrong's second tour win in 2000."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Here is truly a story that can inspire everyone regardless the hopelessness of their situation. I was held spellbound by this story and the way it was told. I could personally relate to it well, as my 28 year old son-in-law was faced with a similar situation and survived and succeeded against all odds. He was striken with a yet unknown illness that kept him on life support for an extended period, with little hope from the doctors for a successful recovery. As pointed out by Lance in his book, you should never give up. Give it all you've got and you will succeed. This book is a must read for all those with major problems and certainly for those without the problems, but feel depressed by minor issues that keep them from overcoming them to greater success. It is a well written work, full of enthusiasm, emotion, the will to survive and prosper and inspiration. Read it and share it with others. We'll all benefit with a better life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read this book three times; now I feel like an idiot. Please recall this book or pull it off the selve. At least re-class this book as fiction so my childern won't buy into the lies."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As all the words devoted to Lance's racing career have turned out to be a complete and utter fabrication, I can no longer put any credibility in the rest of the work either.It's really unfortunate that what seemed to be such an inspirational story turned out to be just another scam."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lances Armstrong's book Not About The Bike: My journey back to life is an inspiring book that is great for just about any reader. This book is very detailed from the time when he was 12 years old to the Olympics and from the Olympics to the battle with cancer and from cancer to his experiences to in the greatest and most brutal bike race in the world the Tour de France. One of the most captivating parts of this book is his battle with cancer. He talks about how he struggled with the chemotherapy and how it made him feel weak, but he also talks on how all that time that he had gave him a new outlook on life and how this inspired him to race even harder and live everyday of life like the last. It also inspired him to push himself harder than he was before. The book also makes you think, is there something bigger out there and is life set out by an all powerful being; because anybody in lances condition would have died from the condition that he was in. This book also gives you some insight on lances life and shows you that lance is an extremely strong person and shows you how he beat cancer and made a comeback and won a record setting 7 Tour de France races. Over all I think this book is an amazing piece of work and I recommend it to anybody who's interested in Lance Armstrong or amazing comebacks."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I didn't know anything about Lance Armstrong until I got cancer last spring. Lying on my couch, sick from chemo, I watched the Tour de France. I was so sick, but wishing I could be outside riding a bike, too. Well, why not, Lance did it! So I bought a bike and started riding my way through chemo and cancer, motivated by this incredible man.I read his book after I finished chemo. His chapter on treatment so accurately captured the experience of being a cancer patient that I found myself crying.This book is for single moms, athletes, cancer patients and anyone else who needs a kick in the butt to get busy with the things that are important."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was an outstanding book. You don't have to like sports to enjoy this book it's also a book about life, and how to deal with adversity. Lance talks about his cancer treatments, you really get a feel for what he went through and how close he came to dying. He talks about his mom and how much of an inspiration she is to him. The part of the book where he talks about his comeback after surgery was awesome. All the hard work and training leading up to it was unbelievable. It is a fine book that will teach you about never giving up in life, and will help you to understand the affects of cancer on those who experience it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have never read a book cover to cover until this one. As an avid athlete since the age of 7 I gained a huge appreciation thru this book of what it means to be alive. This book is about bike racing but it is about so much more. I have given this book to people as a gift and they have had the same response. Read this book, then go out and bike, run, hike, walk or whatever. This book will make you happy you are even here to do those things."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book before reading a review and decided to stop by and check out what people were saying after I read it. I LOVED the book! I've always known who Lance was, but I was interested to read his story, mostly for the story of his move into fatherhood. Well, I became engrossed in every word even though I've never been a cycling fan. I had tears in my eyes several times while reading about the Tour de France. I couldn't put it down, and recommend it for everyone! This is a book about an extraordinary human being, who beat the odds, and came out fighting! You don't even have to like cycling to be able to feel the emotions shared in this book, and if you're like me, you'll form a new view of bike racing and become a fan! I look forward to his future races and can honestly say I'll always be a fan of Lance Armstrong!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not an athlete, nor interested in sports, but I am always fascinated by how different people react to what life hands them. That's why I chose to read IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE, and I was not disappointed. The book itself is very easy reading, and each chapter chronicles the changes in Lance Armstrong from cocky, maverick competitor to humbled cancer patient (&quot;I was brought low, and there was nothing to take refuge in but the philosophical: this disease would force me to ask more of myself as person than I ever had before, and to seek out a different ethic [p.99].&quot;) to the winner of the Tour de France who had learned from his suffering to be a more compassionate, tolerant, and understanding human being. Indeed, Armstrong made an acronym out of the word cancer: Courage, Attitude, Never give up, Curability, Enlightenment, and Remembrance of my fellow patients, that will hold him in good stead for the rest of his life. After reading IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE, I find myself wishing that Lance's life will be a long, healthy, and meaningful one. Something tells me that it will..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book is very inspiring, but not in the fluffy, ethereal manner of so many &quot;inspirational&quot; autobiographies. In this book you get SOME idea of what it must have been like to go through his cancer treatment in very detailed descriptions (central line removal, sperm donation, nausea...). Kudos on the technical correctness in the book from this physician. For those interested in the cycling side, it is also interesting to glimpse the strategy, training and team approach to the Tour. Even if you watched the televised portions of the Tour, you will have a much better idea of how Lance and the U.S. Postal team rode to victory. Very good book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"WOW! I could not put this book down. Truly inspirational. A must read for all Americans!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having read TUESDAYS WITH MORIE in 1998, I found Armstrong's story valuable for similar reasons. Neither book is about dying but rather about living to one's full potential. I did not have cancer, but last year I was seriouily ill and was in the hospital for almost five months and underwent three operations. This book helped me understand that my emotional state in the aftermath of this horrendous experience is not a solitary one but rather universal. This book put into words what I have not been able to articulate to my circle of family and friends. I feel anyone, cycling fan or not, would benefit from reading this story and learning the many valuable life lessons it has to offer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read a lot...a helluva lot. I am jaded and I admit it.But this book, and the story of Lance, his friends, his wife and his caretakers, and his mom, is simply one of the best reads I can remember. While Lance may not be the world's nicest guy, his story is one of love, devotion, unbelievable physical and mental strength, pain of unspeakable levels, terror, and miracles.As I write this he is winning the Tour deFrance. That achievement, his recovery and maybe even the man himself, are of mythic proportions.A most satisfying experience...the nicest part is that there are still chapters to be written."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After Lance's recovery and courageous return to cycling, I found myself swept away with the crowd. &quot;Yea Lance!&quot; &quot;Tour de Lance!&quot; In the euphoria, I even presumed to identify myself with Lance as a bike rider.This book, well written, openly descriptive and painfully private, served as an eye opener for those of us in Austin donned in yellow t-shirts and jumping around like school children. I would have been just as proud, but much more reverent, had I known at the time the history revealed in this book. Sorry Lance, I had no idea...I recommend this book without reservation. It's a quick read, yet contains the lessons learned by a man on the way to true greatness; and no, I'm not talking about the bike."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is so honest it hurts.

I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book does an extraordinary job of taking you inside the heart and soul of a great athlete whose life was transformed by cancer. From one perspective, it does not come across as great literature. As an autobiography, however, you feel is if you are listening to Armstrong himself. For anyone facing a life threatening disease, it offers invaluable guidance, especially in terms of getting second and third opinions and going to the best, however much it might cost. I read this in large part because I love cycling, but the title is exactly right!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is about surviving. It is about getting through the tough stuff and going on from there. The author appears to have achieved an understanding of his life and has chosen the direction to take from here.

Not only that, it is a moving story not &quot;just about the bike&quot;, but about a man who has an unfailing determination to live life to the fullest. What a great read it was! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great book, but he also really pays tribute to how importantit is to have a special mom to stand behind you and fight for you, Especially when your too tired or ill to do things your self--good job Lance's mom (also a hero!).Lots of all around inspiration!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a wonderful book that will make you cry, make you laugh, make you cheer. It's the best told-to book in history. Sally Jenkins has captured Lance Armstrong's voice perfectly and together they have written a masterpiece.

Maybe two or three."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Mr. Armstrong is a world-class athlete and champion, and he battled back from a deadly disease that should have taken his life. He's highly disciplined in a manner I can scarcely imagine and he regularly engages and overcomes adversity. He is an inspiration to all and especially to those in the throngs of cancer.What does not work is this underlying pretense epitomized with the book's title. He is only about the bike, or rather himself. Every other character in the book seems to be an object he can manipulate or castigate. Of course, he is no different from any other successful athlete, businessman, or president... Such success requires an intense, self-absorbed focus.I recommend this book for the inspirational value, but be prepared for the surface sentiments and contradictions."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I found the book after checking the recent Tour standings and seeing that Lance was in first place. My husband and I emailed Lance when he was first sick and have followed his career with great pride. I bought the book as a surprise for my husband, who is not an avid reader. Since we received the book, he has been unable to put it down. I walked into the bedroom last night and he was crying. He was crying over the hardship and the determination and the honor that Lance demonstrates through a very tough battle. Kudos Lance! We will continue to watch and are with you in our hearts."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a cyclist (aggressive tourist) I follow the cycling culture. Of course, a book by/about Lance Armstrong would be on my list. While watching the 2000 TdF I finished reading about the 1999 TdF.Lance had a hard but interesting youth. His bouth with cancer was a life changing experience. There is enough detail about the chemo and what happened to make anyone realized how unusual his recovery and subsequent victory in the TdF are.Pain, trial and tribulation can either destroy or make an individual. Lance was made through this trial by chemo. There are lessons there for all of us.Note: Sally Jenkins does and excellent job of telling Lance's story in a creditable manner that pulls no punches and can lead you to tears."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I never finished this one.

To cancer fighters everywhere, and loved ones who are undying in their support to those who suffer from cancer (and I am quite familiar with this area), there is a significant and deeply moving message that becomes resoundingly clear. You must harness the best medical talent available to you; dedicate yourself to the fight for survival, and stay the course with the immeasurable aid of powerful, enduring confidence and will.He is honest in his realization and expression that some sufferers survive, and others do not. There are no guarantees. Does fate always make sense? Is it fair? Of course not. (On a highly subjective note - that may admittedly tick off a few people - I do not care whether he took performance-enhancing chemicals, or not, when riding competitively. The fact that he underwent significant chemical and surgical modifications in order to survive serious cancer - imagine losing one of your testes, then winning a championship of any sort - mitigates those accusations in my book. It's sort of like admiring bodybuilders and having to accept that they take steroids; it sort of goes with the territory with most of them, don't ya think? Don't know if it's always true or not, but my attitude is grin and bear it.)Deftly and refreshingly avoiding grandiose and popular flights of fancy in the areas of religion and fantasy, Lance focused instead on intelligent, rational tools to empower him in his goals and motivate so many others. He dedicated himself to a personal win, and survival, that translated - through his highly effective global exercise in cancer awareness - to ongoing wins for the masses. He has helped a great number of people: you cannot take that away from him!Whether you're into sports or not, or whether you find Lance Armstrong controversial or not, you will discover time-lasting, monumental lessons about what it takes to become a hero: to intensely grasp life by the horns and live to your ultimate potential no matter how much time you are given. Be here now.Rock on, you infinitely inspiring and accomplished mystical man! You have moved heavens and earth; and for this we are eternally grateful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An honest and inspirational account of Lance Armstrong's struggle and triumph over cancer. Armstrong speaks candidly about all of his fears and struggles he experienced in the face of the ultimate defeat: death. I was a bit disappointed that through all the pain and personal growth he hung on to the anger he felt from childhood toward his biological as well as adopting fathers. He also hung on to anger from petty insults; I found that side of him very off-putting.I totally agree with Armstrong's assessment that winning any struggle whether cancer or Tour de France is not about the physical strength but about the heart.Armond Mehrabianamehrabian@portofinosolutions.comTwitter: @armond_m"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I BOUGHT THE BOOK FOR MY NEPHEW ,WHO IN RIDING IN THE MARIN CENTURY 100 MILES BIKE RACE AS I TYPE.

In this very descriptive account of his life as a cyclist, son, husband, father and a cancer patient in recovery, he delves into details that will both awe and inspire you. He'll take you through a journey of seemingly insurmountable obstacles which he eventually overcomes with perseverance, determination and the ample love with which he's surrounded. His story is a triumphant experience worthy of telling and it's all laid out in this book. Without doubt, this the most optimistic and inspiring book I've ever read.Being a man and a cyclist, Lance's life resonates a great deal with me. His fears and doubts are so real that I felt a chill going down my spine reading some of the details of what he had gone through both in the hospital bed and on the bike saddle. When I say he's an inspiration, I truly mean that in the most personal way.You don't need to be a man or an athlete to enjoy this book. It's is about the human struggle to overcome the hardships of life and actually succeeding. It's also about learning to see the blessing in the most god-awfull situations that life throws at you. It truly is an amazing story worth of every minute of your time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong wrote an amazing book about his life and how he was able to change it for the better. After his cancer, he was able to change his life to better suit his new life. I learned a major lesson from this book. Lance Armstrong was able to prove to the world that he was not afraid and that he would fight what was fighting against him. Lance Armstrong was also able to show a great relationsip between him and his mom. She was there for him when he needed her most and she was always willing to help him with whatever he needed. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book or anyone who wants to read about an amazing life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I first read this book in 2000 when I started grad school. He inspires through his life experiences told in his own words. It is as if you were reading his personal journal. A well balanced book filled with a lot of emotion."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have cancer (different from Lance Armstrong).

If Lance Armstong can beat cancer then so can I and he gives you the strength and drive to do so."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstong's Story is truely an inspiration for anyone that has experienced an inner struggle, sickness or just dealing with an everyday obstacle that zapped the spirit. You'll want to read it over and over. This book holds the true value of life!! A MUST HAVE!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Totally inspiring, the absolute example of human courage and strength of spirit. TRUITY Williams from Wanabelong.com Australia. A book I highly recommend to my clients!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an amazing book. It is so well written and not the usual sports biography. Lance opens his life to you in this book and speaks candidly about cancer, riding and IVF. He is such an inspiration. I would recommend this book to anyone; you certainly don't have to be a cancer survivor or cyclist to enjoy this one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike - My Journey Back to Life\\" by Lance Armstrong was truly an Inspirational Story. From the first page to the last page of the book it describes the struggles that Lance Armstrong has overcome. Lance Armstrong describes very specifically about his cancer and brain tumors. I thought that it was amazing how he overcame his disability and then went on to win the Tour De France. It really takes a lot of courage, pain and guts to live in his life. Usually everyone believes that he is rich and has the good life. Well out of all the biographies I've read. This story really changed my views on his life. It was very sad, and cheering at the same time. After reading this book, I will try to see positive in all and all that I encounter. I really do recommend this book to all age groups. It will change your life as well as it did mine."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have a new value for athletes and cancer survivors!

I enjoyed it and it is a page turner.When I was done, I was not sure if I would hand this to some one with Cancer though.On one hand he does a good job showing to fight cancer with every fiber but on the other hand he reports on his temper out breaks and lack of faith.For a book about Lance Armstrong pre Cheryl Crow and more then one child, this is a good one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was given this book by a good friend of mine in 2004. When he visits me in Seattle we climb mountains, we drink good beer - and we bike every day he is in town. He is not sentimental in the least, but gave me this book with that stoic glare that perked my interest.Well - I am reading 'It's Not About the Bike' now for the third time lol! Right before Lance rides one last time in the Tour I wanted to read it again ... and it's just as amazing and powerful as before.Please read this book - if you are not cynical you will cherish it for the rest of your life. Books like these make you proud to be no less than human.I already miss him even though I have the next three weeks to watch him in the greatest athletic sporting event in the world: The Tour de France.LANCE YOU RULE - BEST SPORTS STORY OF ALL TIME - BEST COMEBACK STORY OF ALL TIME - AND WITHOUT ALL THE DAMN BLING!!!!! YAAAA!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance is Legend & truly inspirational - Every one if you like sport or not, Must read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend who is an avid cyclist, and he loved it! The book came in great shape."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is great if you want to know why Lance is so famous. His story of the battle with cancer, love, and cycling is inspiring."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a book that is hard to put down. What a fascinating story of Lance's battle with cancer and what it takes to win, whether in life or cycling. After reading this book I wanted to know more about Lance and read two more books, another by him: Every Second Counts, and one written about him: Lance: The Making of the World's Greatest Champion, both wonderful accounts of his personal life and the incredible journey to winning seven Tour de France titles."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"STRENGTHS:Hard cover withstands most crashes.Quality paper repells bicycle grease better than most.Just fits in my CamelBak M.U.L.E.The ink doesn't run after riding in a typhoon, though it takes a long time to dry out the book.The ink smells of adrenaline.WEAKNESSES:Heavier than a paperback, making hill climbs more difficult.Dark blue cover is hard to see during a night ride--requiring the addition of reflective stickers or a flashing light for safety.\\"Hey! This book really ISN'T about the bike. Dammit!!\\"SIMILAR PRODUCTS USED:I graduated from an ivy league college, so I've read a couple of thousand books both for study and enjoyment. I could probably wear the maillot jaune in the Tour de Waterstone's, but I can only think of five books out of all of those that I enjoyed as much as this one.I am also an avid cyclist of both road and mountain bikes.REVIEW:For one thing, this book is SO GOOD despite that the writing doesn't come across as the work of a professional writer. Sally Jenkins managed to maintain Lance Armstrong's voice on the page, so that it mostly reads like a very long e-mail or conversation over beer with Lance Armstrong himself. You would never get this kind of personal-style expression and energy out a person in an interview, giving me the feeling that this really is a book BY Lance Armstrong with significant guidance and help by Sallie Jenkins. The ink smells of adrenaline.A couple of the chapters do read like professional writing, but it's not overdone and strengthens the readability and enjoyment of the book.I can only think of one chapter--which was entirely about the bike--that started to get boring because it was full of Lance Armstrong just blowing his own horn. On the other hand, it was kind of Mohammad Ali, \\"Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee\\" of him, and showed the real mind of a competitive athlete. All of us who have competed in a hardcore sport on a national or international level have that attitude about ourselves, and it just serves to show that Lance Armstrong is/was no different. It served to connect all of us jerks to the one we admire the most, to evaluate our attitudes and then get a lesson from Lance Armstrong's experience of fighting for his life and his humanity rather than just fighting to win more.What makes this book really great is that it seems like it's several books, but they're all tied together well. Yeah, it is about the bike at some points, about the Tour at others, about racing, cancer, and his mother--but it's not a jumble of these things. Nor is it some junkie book about a person who just happened to catch national attention, like The Amy Fischer Story or whatever crap is out there about Tonya Harding or some of our instantly famous heros who cash in on that first fifteen minutes of fame. It's not understated, and not overstated.Will people who are not athletes or related in some way to serious athletes enjoy this book? I have no idea. Maybe they can't relate, maybe they'll like it for some other reason, but for us titans out there--in sports or business or whatever--this is a great read.What the Book of Five Rings is to teaching people how to be more competitive, this book is to teaching competitive people to be more human.BOTTOM LINE: I had to stop myself from reading this book all in one day and managed to pace myself out to five days. I'm a rather careful reader, but this was one of those books that I couldn't put down--which is unusual for me."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The autobiography It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life by Lance Armstrong is the story about his fight to overcome testicular cancer and return to biking. The doctors that first diagnosed him with cancer said that there was not chance for him to return to biking, so he went to a different doctor who said he would try to get him back on a bike but acknowledged he had a low chance for survival. He overcame all of this to return 16 months later to ride in the Tour de France.This book about Lance Armstrong's journey is very excellent. It was a quick read and really gave me a good perspective on a cancer patient, although Lance Armstrong was way more focused than most people. The book was extremely informative as to his recovery with chemotherapy and surgery, but it didn't really delve deeply into the actual biology of the cancer on a cellular level.The book affected me a decent amount. It was an extremely well written memoir about an extraordinary journey. Since the person I really have relation to that had or has cancer was my grandfather who died 25 years ago, this book helped to fill that emotion gap. I can definitely apply the ideas in the book to my life. Armstrong just never gives up. He was only given a 20% chance to survive in the beginning. I would certainly have crumbled under such circumstances. Overall, it was a very good book that I will probably take with me throughout my life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I really valued reading this book after someone very close to me was diagnosed with the same cancer as Lance. It was informatative and emotional. Thanks to Lance for his Foundation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"as I was mid-way through this book, there were only two thoughts going on in my mind -1. this guy is human/normal like us with all frailties/insecurities2. and gosh what extremes are humanly possible!!... the triumph of human spirit! very humbling. very inspiring."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"From beginning to end, this book kept me hooked. I learned so much from it and from Lance's story. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I first read the book last summer. My stepsister was reading it and I picked it up when she set it down and we fought over who was going to read it for the next day or so. Only that long becuase by then we had both finished it. Enthralling...Tantalizing...leaves you wanting to know more. One of the best modern biographical writings. Can't wait until he writes another one to follow up on the this years tour and the last two as well.A must read for all athletes. Inspiring and motivating. Lance Armstrong writes nearly as well as he rides a bike. It does him great justice to have this fine book to his name."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is very important and interesting book. I hope this book and Lance Armstrong, personally, help a lot of people who have cancer, thanks to Lance people will find a power to fight against this disease, because Lance did not surrender and finally he won this competition where first place is life. I hope also this book will be translated into the Russian language and Russian people can read this excellent book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Perhaps the most noticeable part of the book is its sparse, honest, Texas style. In what was mentioned in innumerable reviews before, Lance discusses cancer, and how that affects his career choice, which happens to be competitive bicycle riding. Hey, we all have careers, Lance points out. The book isn't really about the Tour de France, and it is, simply, a boon for other men reading about cancer.But that's not what makes the book great. It's the sheer honesty, sort of editor be cursed personality that bleeds through pages, that makes the book special. Probably there are many books written about cancer, and how men can survive it. There probably aren't as many books written as if you were hearing it from a guy at a bar.Plus, much to the jealousy of biography and autobiography writers everywhere, there are no false, contrived moments here. Not that this dude has to make up anything anyway, but there's a honesty of what he experienced, his suffering, and hope. Simple, straightforward, honest. If you ever go to Texas, you know what I mean."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This past holiday I was looking for a real life story. I wanted to read a true story on drugs, AIDS, drinking, smoking, or some other issue that is current. But when I found Lance Armstrong's biography entitled \\"It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life\\" by Sally Jenkins, I had found what I was looking for. From the first sentence of the book, to the last one I couldn't stop reading. In the end of every chapter I wanted to keep on reading, until I finishing it. This is a book for all ages and genders. No matter who or what you like, you'll relate to his life. It'll inspire you to make your dreams come true, let your inhibitions out and not care about anyone else. Although these terms are overused, I have three other people I know that have read this book and can agree with me.This book is a flashback starting when Lance Armstrong was born, taking us through his beginnings, through his battle with cancer, to when his baby is born. It narrates every detail, every thought or feeling of him, how he started riding the bicycle, about cancer, his wife, his mother, his friends, and his life. He explains how his life changed after cancer, how everybody turned their backs at him, and had to prove to them and to him how much stronger, and valuable he was now. If you really want to read a book about a soul survivor, and his amazing life, this is the book you have to read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Inspiring book for anyone living with cancer or as a gift for anyone that is. I Have Recurrent malignant brain cancer and this book was given to me by the parents of one of my best friends who himself is a cancer survivor. I will treasure this book always!Buy it today! everyone could use a new hero to look up to!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong presents insights about his struggle with impossible adversity which clearly demonstrate a miraculous overcoming unimaginable odds. As a scientist and an endurance cyclist, my skeptical response changed shortly after swallowing whole the first few chapters as though they were but a page in length. Besides the respect most cyclists share for the 3-time Tour de France Champion, like prose set to motion, this book generated an exponential respect for Mr. Armstrong as person of heroic proportion. Very well done, indeed..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Phenomenal! One of the best books I have ever read. Not only extraordinarily inspirational, but also extremly informative and interesting. I don't think you can walk away without a thirst for more after reading this book. Lance is a winner in the truest sense of the word, and the writing is straightforward and honest. No punches are pulled - the good, the bad and the ugly are all dealt with. His triumph is truly exhilarating, and can serve as inspiration for us all in trying times. &quot;If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you've got to go all the way.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The worst thing about this book is that it ended. You don't need to know anything about bikes to read the book and become inspired. Lance Armstrong is a true American Hero - not for winning the Tour, but for using his fame from winning to help others. In the book he speaks as if he is just the guy next door, whe has gone through a terrible ordeal but was victorious."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was not a Lance Armstrong fan, until I read this book. I was influenced by (pre-cancer) media-driven statments about his arrogance and attitude, but this was before Lance became LANCE. He has changed the American perspective of professional cycling, and also given hope to people's fear of hearing &quot;I have cancer&quot;.Throughout the book, you can see how the 'old' Lance becomes 'new' through this personal attack on cancer. I enjoyed seeing his transformation into a mature and genuine human being though the thoughfulness of the other people in his life, namely his wife 'Kik' (what a stud).Whatever your physical limitations may be, this books speaks inspiration and in &quot;Rocky-eisque&quot; fasion, motivates all who are willing, to conquer the 'hills' that we overcome throughout life.Way to go Lance, you are a Hero."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By now it seems just about everyone -- certainly anyone interested in this book -- knows at least something about Lance Armstrong's story, and probably expects the full story to be inspiring. Well, this book certainly delivers, meets, and often surpasses those expectations.I think there is a wide cross-section of readers who will find many parts of this book totally absorbing. As for me, I love reading about cycling tactics and the drama that unfolds in and around the pro peloton. There are many details about cycling in this book. (Though, of his TDF victories, only the first is described in full. The 2000 tour is described in an \\"Encore\\" chapter.) Among the most interesting to me were the few pages about a heated topic that is rarely addressed by the parties involved -- Armstrong's sponsors -- which companies vowed unconditional support, and which company all but abandonned.Though I didn't expect to find details about cancer and its treatment as interesting as the cycling details, that part of the story is among the most inspirational. It provides another example of Armstrong's intensely competitive nature and astonishing capacity to remain confident in the face of unthinkable pain, suffering, and adversity. In Armstrong's narrative, the story reads like that of some insane, year-long time-trial, cooked up by TDF organizers just to see if Lance will crack.Finally, perhaps Armstrong's greatest strength as an autobiographer is his willingness to candidly describe his weakest and most desperate hours."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life was an amazing book. This book showed all of Lance Armstrong's struggles and victories. I always see him on T.V. and never thought twice that he had it really hard and his life was on the line. I am amazed by what he has done and now I am more educated by reading this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a huge Lance Armstrong fan, and I loved reading this book. It shows all the struggles that one man has endured, and not only this one man, but all the people that are around him. I'm so glad that I decided to purchase this book, it shows the softer side of Lance, and it makes me realize what this man has gone through in order to be one of the top athletes in our world today. This is a book that I have told everyone about. It changes the way that I look at my life and others around me. I can't wait to read the follow up book.LIVESTRONG!!!!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An autobiographical \`truth' of a man who overcame testicular cancer and life's disappointments to become a true bike racing champion. I was particularly impressed with Lance's easy-style and insight into life.I like the fact that he's truly dedicated to staying on top of his game by eating right and eliminating his vices like caffeine. A study has shown that coffee has been linked to pancreatic cancer. I understand he's found a coffee replacement that taste just like coffee. Its made from soy, called soyfe e, and soy has been shown to fight heart disease. I bought a bag online at www.soycoffee.c om. I simply love it.Any adult, young student, or life skills classes could benefit from Armstrong's motivational message and down-to-earth story. Sally Jenkins, author of Men Will Be Boys, and the coauthor of: Reach for the Summit and Raise the Roof (both with Pat Summitt), and A Coach's Life (with Dean Smith), go's along for the ride with Lance in this in depth chronicle of a boy-turn-man, who overcomes tremendous odds to compete and win. A must read for fellow cyclists who need to reach deep within when they climb to the summits in life. Each will experience the hard work ethic needed to win a Tour de France victory. Armstrong will be a sixth time winner of the tour in 2004, in record time"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Essentially two books in one. One is about Lance's cancer, and the surgeries and treatment of that cancer -- especially concerning chemo. If you don't know what chemo treatments and the suffering associated with this procedure is...then this part of the book will certainly open your eyes. Very informative, and readable. The other part of the book is about professional bicycling and more specifically -- The Tour de France, and Lance's wins of that tour. And though he could have detailed professional cycling more so for the reader; he does give enough overview of team racing and of the Tour, and the techniques utilized to race it -- certainly enough to whet anyone's interest to learn more. You don't have to be into bike racing to enjoy this book. Just the information concerning cancer is enough to make this a valuable read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book wasincredibly detailed, and it awesomely displayed his life beyond the bike."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"These days everyone has heard of Lance Armstrong, but before he was known worldwide he was a cancer patient. In his autobiography It's Not About the Bike, he tells the story of his youth, his rise to become a champion, and, most of all, his battle with cancer. Armstrong tells the story of what it is like to be diagnosed with cancer and how he himself dealt with it. he describes in detail his treatments and the people who helped him through the tough times during his chemotherapy.Lance Armstrong's book about his fight against cancer really helped me understand what cancer and cancer treatment is all about. He described his experiences in a way that anyone reading the book could understand. It also helped me understand chemotherapy so that I could apply it to my project. Although he never got scientific with his descriptions, he broke everything down to give you a taste of what he went through. Reading this book gave me a perspective of cancer that I had never known because I have never known anyone close to me that has gone through it.Personally, I thought the book served its purpose well. It was not a long, drawn out book, but a story of Armstrong's amazing life put into a few day's worth of reading. I also enjoyed how he explained the medical terms so that they would not go over the reader's head. Not only did Lance talk about the medical strains of cancer, but he explained to the reader how cancer can effect a person emotionally and socially. The whole book, not just the parts about Lance's battle with cancer, really taught a lesson about what it meant to be a positive human being. Overall, I felt that the book makes us look at who we are and ask ourselves what kind of person we are. It was a written lesson on how to be a fighter and a survivor."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's recovery from cancer was amazing and inspirational. This book tells you all about it, but also includes other aspects of Armstrong's life that non-bicycle racing fans might find a little boring. You already know he's going to win the race.But as a person extremely interested in recovery, I admire Lance and learned a lot from him. I quoted this book three times in my book, The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.David Spero RN www.art-of-getting-well.com"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In Lance Armstrong's book \\"It's not about the bike\\" I thought it was an excellent book.The book is very well written. He explained how he had a rough childhood and how he started cycling, he took us through his races, and he described his cancer in every little detail not a single thing was left unsaid. He made you feel like you were on the bike next to him or sitting in the hospital room with him. He took you on an emotional roller coaster ride with all of the emotions running through his head you will have the same feelings reading the book. If you read this book it will motivate you and inspire you not to give up on your dreams and when an obstacle gets in your way you have to try your hardest to get through it and eventually you will overcome it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In this book LA tells you his story... Everything from how he got his first bike, how he raced on it, what he felt, what he thought, all the way to his come back after cancer. I greatly recommend this book for inspiration and to help you understand what a GREAT athlete is made of."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's \\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life\\" is a remarkable story. Armstrong doesn't pull any punches or paint himself as a hero. He offers insight into the mind of a world-class athlete and opens up the thrilling world of bicycle racing for those who would never otherwise have any knowledge of it. He shares his life with the reader in a way that is honest and at the same time not self-critical. He shows us his best and his worst, and there were certainly times in his life where he felt horrible and it seemed to get the better of him. In the end, though, it is apparent that it has been in his nature since childhood to give it his all....It caused him to see the mundane as miraculous and view each day as a gift. This is not an unusual experience to have for people with life-threatening diseases or that have had near death experiences, but few realize they can have this experience right here and now. If you would like to learn how, I recommend \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. In it they describe the secrets to living in the moment that can start you on your journey back to life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A Man Who I Want to Follow\\"It's not about the bike\\" is a wonderful and inspiring book. In this book, it talks about Lance's pre-cancer life, cancer life and post-cancer life. His life, especially his cancer life tells us about the relationship of family, friends and the other people, and how to deal with it. His life also tells us about health and sickness, life and death, happiness and sadness, about the fears and difficulties; and how we should face them and deal with them. He told us \\"Make every obstacle an opportunity,\\" \\"Make every negative a positive,\\"..........I'm not a cancer survivor or cyclist, but I know how difficult it is to ride a bike. When I was little, I attended an elementary school, which was 15 kilometers away from my village. I had to ride my bike home to get food every week. There were a lot of ascents, it was very difficult for me to climb them. But I had to climb them to get home. Sometimes I had to ride home and then ride back to school in a day, I rode almost 30 kilometers a day. This continued until I went to college in 1994. So I had the cycling experience too. But I lost this hard spirit when I came to the U.S.A. I always thought about going back to China, because I felt it was very hard to live here. I didn't know the language; it was very hard to find a satisfying job. I always felt upset. But after I read this book, I learned from this book that the road under my feet is not always smooth, it sometimes will be up and sometimes will be down. So I must follow Lance Armstrong that I must make every negative a positive, I must conquer every difficulty I meet, I must make my road smoother and smoother.Dada"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was one of the most wonderful and inspirational books I have ever read. It says a lot for human nature and for what we as individuals can overcome. Even if you do not like biking or you have never had Cancer, you can relate to this book because you are human!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"We get to see the self-described Lance Armstrong with a large assist from Sally Jenkins on a journey from a somewhat disadvantaged childhood where Lance and his mother battled mostly economic odds to the present as a well-to-do Tour de France winner who has found a measure of contentment with a wife as devoted to him as was his mother and a newborn son.The book is pretty well balanced between describing Lance's cycling and his difficult battle with testicular cancer. There is no doubt that the book is part of an overall effort to capitalize on Lance's amazing Tour de France win in 1999 and after, but the sometimes angry, sometimes cocky Lance may be a little difficult to understand or tolerate by some.Lance acknowledges a great deal of good fortune in surviving cancer but does so rather disingenuously. The fact of the matter is that over 99% of the population would have never had the instant access that Lance had to specialists all over the country who as it turned made all the difference in his recovery. In addition, Lance was quite fortunate in that a bike store owner in Texas took Lance under his arm when he was very young and developed his cycling ability virtually from the ground up. It is vintage Lance Armstrong when he has falling out with his patron just as he is starting to gain some national recognition of his cycling talent. On several ocassions Lance benefited from the right guy entering his life at the right time to provide the right kind of help with his cycling. It did not have to happen that way.Some may find the book inspirational and it is to a degree. Others may see just how thin is the thread that separates success and even life itself from failure and even death."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a triathlete I've always been interested in Lance the cyclist (who used to be a triathlete) and never really cared for Lance the man. In fact, there are few professional athletes that I care to understanding outside of their sports realm as they are usually arrogant. Though it is their arrogance that makes them such great athletes. That was until a friend recommended I read his book. Wow! His story of survival is truly an inspiration to us all. Forget about the 3 tour victories. Here is a man who understands that we need to cherish every moment we have and take life full force. Be it good or bad, this is the only life we have so make the best of it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a true American hero. He has conquered an international sport and he has conquered a disease that affects so many people. We all know someone who has or has had cancer and this story is a message of hope. He had about a 1% chance of survival when he was diagnosed. Yet, he was able to overcome the odds and he is now cancer free. He also details his mental struggle with cancer and the trauma of returning to life. Very compelling stuff. For anyone who has ever ridden a bike or watched the Tour de France he is an inspiration. The last chapters are his first hand account of the '99 Tour. Great Stuff!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Don't make the mistake of assuming this one is only for jocks, those interested in sports, biking or memoirs written about athletes. I don't fall into any of those categories and I LOVED reading this book, which actually focuses on the positive side of having (and surviving) a life-threatening illness. Armstrong makes the intriguing argument that he came back from cancer with a new, stronger focus, a new perspective on his life and a determination to make the most of every day after that. Not only that, but he was able to win the Tour de France in spite of having NO sponsor (none of them were willing to believe he would succeed), many detractors and the knowledge that his body had endured a massive assault of chemicals, chemotherapy, etc. But his atheltic achievements are really a small part of the larger picture - his emotional and spiritual renaissance, a testimony (and inspiration) for any reader."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is one of the most moving personal success stories I have ever read. From the history of Lance's difficult childhood, to his hot headed youth, to his battle with testicular cancer, to his wife's pregnancy, to his amazing win of the 1999 Tour de France... I loved it all. The section detailing the 1999 Tour de France actually got my adrenaline flowing. Like the title of the book says, it's not about the bike. Instead, the book is more about how Lance Armstrong dealt with cancer, and what it has meant in his life. You will not be sorry you read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Received this book as an X-Mas present and two days later I was sending it back to my mom so she could read it. Very quick read and an unbelievable story. I like to think I'm a &quot;Man's Man&quot; but this guy makes me weep like a little boy on the first day of school. He is a stud and he should be the &quot;Athlete/Personality of the Century. Tiger is cool. MJ is also cool, but LA is the Bomb!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not unlike many readers, I read this book with fairly limited knowledge of Lance Armstrong. At this point, most know of Armstrong's triumph over tesiticular cancer and winning of biking's greatest challenge, the Tour de France -- we don't know much of Armstrong the man (or husband or father as the book cover proclaims). All the ingredients were in place for a typical celebrity autobiography -- trouble kind turns life around by becoming world class-athlete faces life-threatening disease and comes out on top. However, with some mild guilt, I never found myself liking Armstrong that much and in fact he was a bit of a jerk.I expected to be swayed when Armstrong's life was rocked by cancer. To some effect it did -- but Armstrong's cocky attitude towards his own life did not sway as he stard death in the face. But then I realized that there was something very refreshing to this about this. Though this could have easily fallen into the drippy sentimentality of a &quot;disease of the week&quot; TV movie (and probably will some day if Hollywood has its way), it did not. While the above Amazon review says the story will &quot;melt the most hard-bitten soul&quot; I hold true to that mine was merely &quot;thawed.&quot; I hope my soul is not alone out there, but my gut tells me that Armstrong's intention was not to have anyone feeling sorry for him.Overall, the book is an informative look at the world of bike racing and cancer treatment. I do respect Armstrong's life journey and truly miraculous comeback. I just find his machismo something that would prevent me from sharing a friendly beer with him in the real world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I like his style --- both in story-telling and life-living. His message is simple and strong. He tells us that our lives are full of challenges to overcome so we just make our mind to face it and do what we can do. On the other hand, of course, he is just a human-being like us. At first, he felt fear to face his cancer and avoided doing what he could do to prevent his cancer to ruin himself. He says in this book, &quot;I thought I knew what fear was, until I heard the words You have cancer.&quot; For him, the cancer was the real fear that he had faced. And after suffering from fear of dying of cancer, he had to get through the chemo. He says, &quot;The question was, which would the chemo kill first: the cancer, or me?&quot; The answer is clear to us because he is alive. But so to him? He says again in this book, &quot;People think of my comeback as a triumph, but in the beginning it was a disaster.&quot; Comeback to life is a problem itself. And so, what is a life? He can't be what he had been before cancer attcked him. Cancer changed everything. He has to start from the beginning. He has to re-live his life again. But he tells us that it's a wonderful experience and cancer is a part of life. Why he is so calm telling his disaster? I can answer the question, but I only hope you will read this book because he told everything in his book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is the most inspirational and entertaining you could ever find ! I have never watched a bike race. You don't need to be a racing fan to appreciate it. This book is about the MAN.If Lance Armstrong took up boxing as a kid, he would be the Middleweight Champion of the World. This guy is so tough that you gotta love him!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an inspiring book. As a cancer survivor and a cyclist, Lance hit home on many subjects. His account of cancer (&quot;You don't know it yet but we're the lucky ones&quot;)is so true. His account of Plano, TX (Not very favorable) is so true. His account of the tour was very inspiring and educational. It lets you see him as a person, and not the 1999 Tour De France winner. Read this book. Give it to someone you know fighting cancer, and hopefully they will one day realize they are &quot;one of the lucky ones&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I purchased this book at the recommendation of a cycling friend...I had been working hard to get back in shape after baby two and on a &quot;longer&quot; cycling ride (only 35 miles) I was passed on a hill by an older women on a mountain bike...I was a little depressed by the incident and my friend chuckled and immediately said, &quot;...you should read Lance Armstrong's new book.&quot; I did! I purchased this book because I thought it would give me motivation to workout, but Lance Armstrong's story gave me soooooo much more. His story is so inviting and personal that I felt it more than I read it. And although this is a book about Lance's triumphs, he's not the only extraordinary person you'll read about. I drew inspiration from many of his closest friends and family, especially his mother and his wife. When I read the last paragraph and closed the cover, it was late and quiet....and there was just one single word left in my mind and my heart....THANKS."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Amrmstrong and Sally Jenkins did a wonderful job sharing the pain of such a terrible disease, the truth behind what really happens, and how this disease can actually change you for the better!I bought this book because I work in the dot.com world and needed to &quot;get down to earth.&quot; Even though I used to cycle, my hope was to find a book that could help me create some balance in my life and provide some direction. That it did. What I did not expect, was to be so moved about this incredible relationship Lance had with his mother, coupled with the unbelieveable obstacles (even if you are a cycling fan, you will still be surpprised) he had to overcome not just to survive, but to be able to get back to a professional level of cycling.I've always respected Lance as a cyclist. But learning more about him as a son, a father, a cancer survivor, a husband, and a human being has created a hole heck of a lot more respect (even bigger than Texas!)for the kind of man that he is.You will never forget this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a heartbreaking and eventually victorious story -- a great read and I would highly recommend it to anyone going through their own cancer treatment. Even though I read it after he won his 6th Tour, I was silently cheering as I read in this book about his first Tour win. It is bittersweet to read about how much he loved Kik since they are now divorced. But, if this book is one thing, it's hopeful. Lance is more than a cyclist and a cancer survivor. He is an inspiration, and these days that is something rare and very special."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like a lot of Americans, I didn't have a clue about The Tour de France until Greg LeMond won it in 1986.After that, I became a fan.Before he won his first tour in 1999, I knew more about Tyler Hamilton and George Hincapie than I did Lance Armstrong. I watched in amazement as Lance rode, amid the swirl of publicity about his triumph over cancer. He became the embodiment of the underdog....cocky young man, cut down in the prime of his power...has doubts...finds love...tries to return...quits only to dig deep and find something extraordinary inside.I disagree with reviewers who say Armstrong is overly arrogant and self-centered. He gives all credit for his tenacity to his nurturing mother. He says he only deserves the zipper in his yellow jersey...that his team mates own the front, back and sleeves. He even gives credit to the mountains in North Carolina for helping him finds his way back to competitive cycling.In creating the Lance Armstrong Foundation, he's put his substantial profile and his checkbook where his passion lies.....in cancer research. How many other elite riders have given back like that?Professional athletes can't survive without egos. It's part of what makes them so competitive. Lance has ego to let. But, remember one thing....he has four yellow jerseys and a clean bill of health to back him up!As for his temper, I think he showed remarkable restraint when he crushed the competition in the first time trial of the 1999 race and then got to walk by members of the team who had dropped him when he was in the fight of his life. Oakley, Nike and Giro hung tough with Lance. Confidis caved. Personally, I wouldn't have just said \\"That was for you,\\" when he passed members of the Confidis team...the men who Armstrong felt \\"...had left me for dead in a hospital room.\\" I woulda decked 'em.Sally Jenkins did a terrfic job of getting Lance's story down on paper. In fact, her style was so compelling that I read the book in one sitting, not even noticing the time flying by. I can't wait to read their second collaboration, EVERY SECOND COUNTS in October.Ride, Lance, Ride. It's what you were born to do. Live, Lance, Live."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Have you ever seen a miracle before? Do you want to see another one? In this admirable book written by Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins you will read the most interesting and amazing story of fighting against odds. It is about the Lance's courageous life: his survival of cancer. You will see how the devastation of cancer changes Lance's life physically and emotionally. The disease itself brings his ego from 100% to 0%. During his disease he gets to a point of not moving because of the effects of chemo, riding another bike again wasn't important for him, he just wants to live. He goes from having everything he desires to having less material things and to really valuing the things he has. His personality also changes. He goes from being a bully in the racetrack to being a real gentleman and respecting everyone on it. During his cancer, to make matters worse, Cofidis, his main sponsor, retires and his family finds out that he doesn't have a health insurance.One day, after his five cycles of chemotherapy are done, LaTrice Haney phones him and gives him the good news \\"You are clear, cancer free\\" but the risk of still coming back was there. Lance gets strength and starts training to compete at a professional level and he does. He finishes 14th and in another similar positions in some tours. When he was riding the Vuelta (a race) he decides no to compete again he was done.With this mentality, he moves back to his home in Austin with his wife (they were living in Nice) and doesn't ride on a bike in some time. A coach, Chris Carmichael convinces him to try the bike again. He trains hard and all his training pays off when he swept the 1999 Tour de France. Training for the 2000 Tour De France wasn't a walk in the park. He had several crashes in the Pyrenees and hurt his head, but he recovered. In the 2000 Tour, he proves that he is the best cyclist when he beats his closer competitor, Jan Ullrich in a time trial in Metz.In my opinion, this is a must read book for every athlete or for everyone who would like to see how a man can change. The two main themes are: love and survival. This is not another biography; this is a life changing one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very disappointed...The book was recommended to me as a deep book on his life changing event....although a very powerful story I found it very shallow and with very little deep meaning and it leaves you understanding how his ego led to his marital affairs,divorce and abandoning his family...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong had all of the experiences and had developed all of the tools to become a great athlete and full blown narcissist. Had cancer not intervened, his views of himself and of the role of those around him might have become even more aggrandized than they did in real life.His loving and lovely wife we can see was the ultimate support mechanism, very little is spoken of what he gave to her other than the once in a lifetime chance to be with himThere is a good story about dealing with cancer and how it has the potential to change one but in his case not enough.The history of the last decade has confirmed what the book foretold"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although I really haven't followed Lance Armstrong's cycling career, I was compelled to get this book. I found it very interesting and although I haven't personally been very close to someone dealing with cancer, it was a great story of hope. I think this would be an awesome book to give someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. No matter how grim of a prognosis someone may be given, Lance Armstrong is a living example of how there can always be hope. I also think that when people are fighting cancer, they probably want to read success stories on those that have overcome cancer so that they may have hope."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have read many books in my life, but never one quite like this one. The whole time that I read this book I was thinking to myself, &quot;..and I think that I have had some bad days!&quot; If you have ever found a more inspiring example in a human being, let me know, I'll read their book. Lance Armstrong was near the top of his sport, and he finds that he has cancer. What would you do if someone told you that not only were you losing your health, your ability to work, and maybe your life? Did he quit and give it all up forever? Not only did he NOT, he battled back from cancer and beat death, but he attacked it with the same energy that he used as a cyclist. He got his life back, found a wife, and won the Tour de France. What a role model. Read this book. I hope that this athlete can become a role model and an example to all."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, this book is difficult to put down. It is not because it is fine literature that will endure the ages (it isn't, and it probably won't), but because it reads like Lance Armstrong rides...all out. It was truly inspiring reading about the impact cancer had on Lance and how his life changed because of it. He writes that he has become two different people - 1 before cancer and 1 after. As he has now won his second Tour, devotes time to raising money for cancer research, and is a proud father, he has become a inspiration for all of us. Congratulations, Lance...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This fantastic person, Lance Armstrong, faced cancer, nearly died, survived, and as I write this (July 22, 2000) is about to win his second Tour de France since his brush with death. He is a superb athlete and an extraordinary human being. The adversity of his disease and its brutal treatments changed him for the better both as a sportsman and as a person; and it is his bike that runs through this book as the unifying force and the symbolic icon for what Lance does. Yes, many of the important aspects of this book have to do with things of the spirit and not with pedaling; but it is on wheels that he first encountered fame, the lack of those wheels that brought him to near despondency, and the triumphal return to his wheels that signaled his being whole once more.There is no self pity or sentimentality in these pages. This is not a book of the \\"inspirational\\" genre; but few will be able to read it without being changed for the better. Here is a man who at every stage of his life could have yielded to excuses or victimhood, but who systematically said \\"no\\" to everything except excellence and self discipline. A true winner. An exciting, fast-paced book. A great reading exoperience; about the bike and about many other things, too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is such a great and inspiring book. It's amazing how he and Bristol Myers-Squibb allowed him to overcome his cancer. And what's even more amazing that he won the Tour de France. This book is plain great!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book because of Armstrong's amazing result in the 10th(?) stage at Hautacam. What stood out to me was his intensely close relationship to his mother, fixation on numbers (cancer, cycling, and financial), jockish attitude in dealing w/cancer like a stage race and dilemma in selecting a cancer treatment (two completely different methods of attack).Luckily, no one close to me has had any form of cancer and the outlining of his treatment was somberly edifying - a process you don't want to know about and yet you should. He also writes about something I've always wondered about - whether survival rates have any relationship to attitude and overall well being.I got the impression that he does have sort of a cocky athletes are superior attitude (he mentions on his riding w/a non-cyclist that normally he wouldn't ride w/such a novice), but that's the way athletes, professional or amateur, in general, are. I chalk it up to attitude as motivation.Overall, a good read. I can only hope that I have as good a perspective on life as he does."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Our book club read this book this month and we all agreed that it was a surprisingly good and quick read. To read how cancer took hold of his life and how he and those around him dealt with it made for a powerful story. It is especially interesting to anyone who knows anyone who has or had cancer. Well done."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My husband read this book out loud to me in a day and a half. Once he started, I wouldn't let him stop reading.

He embodies everything good about the human spirit, and he wrote a great book, too!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a avid reader and cyclist. I am generally reading two to four books at a time. When I started to read &quot;It's Not about the Bike&quot;, all my other books remained closed until I finished this one - cover to cover.

A must read, for both athletes and none athletes ."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For anyone who is going through the cancer journey, has a friend or loved one who is or even has in the past...this book will touch your heart and soul like nothing else has. It is someone's account of what it is like to be diagnosed, fight the battle of treatment and emotional turmoil and try to continue on with a normal life. It further explains how life after cancer is never \\"normal\\"...but maybe even better! It will make you laugh and cry and feel inspired beyond words. I loved the audio CD because I was able to listen to it in my car and finished it in 2 days..quicker than I would have if I had to sit down and find time to read a book!

Lance tells his own personal cancer story with such honesty, I had phantom pains! His story is truly inspirational and that he just won his 7th consecutive Tour de France is quite frankly, miraculous! Congratulations Lance.Thanks for giving me such an insight. Your positive power of the mind should be a lesson for everyone!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm female, I ride my bike for fun, I'm Canadian and I've never survived cancer and I only know where France is on the map but Lance took me through the life of an athlete, the life of a cyclist, what it means to truly survive cancer and I won a tour de Franc with him.The story of cancer survivor and cyclist, Lance Armstrong is truly inspirational. It have me new insight into meeting my goals and how fortunate I am for good health. In his twenties, Lance fought off one of the deadliest diseases out there. He fought through the chemo - he survived the chemo and he taught himself a new life lesson - life is worth living. To come back from such trauma and win not one but seven consecutive tour de franc is amazing.If you know nothing about cycling or have never experienced cancer in your life or family it doesn't matter you still need to read this book.Lance will inspire you to seek your own journey back to life!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I think this was a good autobiography because it kept me interested, unlike most boring, textbook-like autobiographies. You can learn a lot about life from reading this book, and it puts a lot of issues into new perspectives. Lance tells stories with descriptive detail in a way that makes you want to keep reading, and he projects the personalities of the characters well enough that you almost think you know them after a while. He has a talent of taking an event or situation and getting it onto paper so that it's easy to picture. Overall I'd say this is a good book for people looking for inspiration, knowledge, or just entertainment."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.I truly enjoyed the way he described his fight surviving cancer and how he one his very first Tour de France.

Man oh man I just recently read this book and all I can say is what a guy. I recommend this book to anyone who basically likes good books. Lance Armstrong tells a story of the battle against cancer that brought me to tears many a times. And the story of his first Tour de France win. This book gives so much insight into the life and personality of Lance. He is so wonderful and ironically right now I am watching Stage 8 of the Tour de France 2004.

Armstong shares his stories about battling cancer, growing up without a father, and how he won all his tour de france's. This was a great book to read. It was very informative on cancer and the reality of the disease. This book was very inspirational because lance beat the odds of surving only having about a 3% chance to live.

He gets his feelings across really well on paper. His thoughts on cancer, his cycling, and life in general are things that everyone should spend some time dwelling on.And no, you need not be an expert cyclist. Lance's dedication to the sport comes through even if you haven't ever ridden a bike in your life.I can't say anymore, you just have to get this book. It's not hokey-pokey, fairy-tale stuff.

Well this book is the equivalent of that. I read it in one sitting. Quite simply Lance spoke in brutal honesty and reflection about his experiences with cancer and world class cycling. Even though this was the focus of the book, the real story is about the human spirit.Lance is an incredible person who literally &quot;willed&quot; himself to his current position as &quot;cancer survivor&quot; and Champion Cyclist. The story lives up to the hype of the celebrity. He is the real deal.There are some other heroes in this story, namely the Doctors who helped Lance (they are amazing), his nurse and most importantly his mother.After reading this book and learning of the adversity Lance has overcome, it makes our own lives much clearer in terms of the artificial limits many of us have in place."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance's story is truly incredible. It taught me too never give up or take no for an answer. Never lose hope. It is an especially great book for athletes, but anyone could draw inspiration from it. I did not, however, like the way Lance came off in the book. He seemed really cocky and self-centered. The book also was not very well written. Overall, this book was very inspirational and thought-provoking but had the potential to be much much more.*This book may not be a good one for readers with particularly weak stomachs.**Some mature content and language is used in the book and may not be appropriate for younger readers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you want to know all about cycling, if you want to have an inside, in-depth look at the world of cycling, this is not your book, read the newer one that was published in 2004.But if you want to go inside the mind of Lance Armstrong, if you want to understand what it is like to go through cancer, and what it is like to survive after your chances of living were one in five, if you want to understand the grit it takes to win the Tour De'France, then this is your book.Lance Armstrong takes you through his childless fatherhood with a mother that supported him every step of the way. He takes you to himself as a teenager, winning triathlons while competing against older men, he takes you to himself as a young cycler, bull-headed, but full of promise, he takes you into the hospital, where nurses hook him up to bags of chemicals so strong doctors need gloves to handle it. He then takes you through his long trip on the road to recovery, and victory in the Tour.A great book, and I strongly recommend you follow it up with the recent Armstrong book written by Daniel Coyle."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book basically tells you the biography of lance armstrong.

Alot of stories about lance's childhood, his mom, cancer treatment and how he came back to win the Tour De France. Alot of many cycling and business aspects to this book as well.

And written by him--just because he is a good athlete doesn't necessarily make him a good writer (but he has Sally Jenkins there to help with that). But this memoir wasn't just about bike racing. It was about cancer and surviving it. In fact, more about cancer than racing. There was something spiritual about Armstrong's experience, both on the bike and with cancer. Even if you aren't a big fan of the sport, this is still a good memoir to read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After reading this book, I have a larger respect for the Tour de France and the athelets who participate in it. This is the story of Lance Armstrong's journey back to his racing career, and more importantly, life, after his battle with cancer. My heartstrings were pulled as I read. As an athlete I can understand somewhat of what he goes through, with the training and all. I even used this book for some of my college essays! Go out and read it, it's an autobiography like none other!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is easy to see why Lance has been so successful in his life. He has an amazing capacity for attacking any obstacle that gets in his way, whether it be cancer or the French alps. As a fellow cancer survivor, I could so relate to his battle. Mine was not as advanced as his was, and many times I felt like just giving up. I cannot imagine having to endure surgery, and chemo, and still managing to get on a bike. There are times when Mr. Armstrong comes across as arrogant and obstinate; probably what gave him the strength to persevere in the face of the naysayers who had already given him up for dead."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I red this book on a flight to Miami almost two years ago.It has became my bible: this is not about the bike at all. It's about the love of a single parent raising her only child facing so many challenges, it's about true friendship (something that is really hard to find nowadays...), it's about passion and efforts to reach a goal in one's life. It makes you think about how easly your life can change and you cannot avoid it, all you can do is find the energy to fight back as good as you can.I red this book over 25 times, I now it all. Forward and backward. And it still suprises me and I can still discover parts that give me a new impulse. It changed my life.

The book focuses on his struggle with cancer and comeback to cycling. It's really quite amazing what he did and what he keeps doing. The story is told in a very conversational manner which is very easy to listen to (I was listening to the Audio CD). I imagine it is a very quick read too.AUDIO CD WARNING - Be forewarned if you listen to the Audio CD - it is very poorly formatted. There is only one track per CD and it will immediately start repeating as you finish the CD - so you find yourself thinking \\"Hmm, this sounds familiar\\" and then notice you have started over. Most Audio CDs are savvy enough to put music or at least a pause in."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very few people will ever see the extreme lows and highs that Lance Armstrong has faced. Few fictional stories will ever be as unlikely as this true story. This book will remind you of what it is possible for a human being to accomplish.As a cyclist and long-time fan of Lance Armstrong, I found it interesting that I finished the book with even more respect for his accomplishments, but feeling like I wouldn't actually enjoy the man if I were to meet him. I see it as a credit to the writing and to Armstrong's openness in the book that I responded this way. (By the way, I fully acknowledge that he's well beyond needing to care one bit about what I think of him.)Highly recommended."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"To be honest, I didn't know much about Lance before reading this. I knew he was a cyclist and I knew those trendy livestrong bracelets that all the celebrities suddenly had, had something to do with him, but that's about it. The topic of Lance Armstrong came up after my history class a few months ago. My teacher and I were talking about positive quotes, and he read me one from \\"It's not about the Bike.\\" I was instantly moved. My teacher asked me if I would like to borrow the book for the weekend, and I automatically said yes. I couldn't put it down, I read the entire thing in under 48 hours. It moved me in ways I never thought possible, brought up emotions I never knew I had. A family member of mine passed away from cancer a few years back, and it took me back to that summer, I saw things from a different perspective. I have urged many of my friends to read this, and convinced a few of my friend's parents too. All of them have enjoyed it. Me, being a 16 year old female, who was never ever intrested in cycling, was skeptical at first to read it, but it is now one of my all time favourite books. Read it, you won't be let down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a great lesson of ambition, strong will and determination that can be useful to anybody. First, it's about fighting and beating cancer and then on a second level it is about the world of cycling. I am not and have never been a competitive cyclist or even a fan of the sport, but you don't have to be a fan to read this book - it's just a wonderful and emotional testimony of a very dedicated cyclist fighting a deadly disease.It is not a literary masterpiece, but there is a very good lesson about survival on almost every page of it.You will find this book very easy to be read, with a style that is simple and concise. But most importantly, you will find out what is like to become sick and unable to do something once taken for granted, from a very active and hard working athlete and then return to the stage and win one of the most difficult contests in the world: Tour de France.You will find that the best way to win in life is to turn a serious obstacle into an opportunity and make a negative become a positive. I think these are ideas that should guide us all the time.Was the hero's survival a miracle? Or just determination? Lance wonders himself: \\"The question that lingers is, how much was I a factor in my own survival and how much was science and how much miracle?...[P]ersonally I'm content with simply being alive to enjoy the msytery.\\"I recommend you to buy this book: I think it will change your vision of things a great deal and I promise you, you won't put it down until you finish it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The greatest books are those that captivate an audience that knows little or nothing about the subject. Before reading &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;, I had absolutely no knowledge of bike racing and (thankfully) little exposure to cancer. Lance Armstrong lays his life wide open to the reader, and the result is a touching, informative, and honest account of this man's life.Armstrong opens with the diagnosis of his cancer and the emotions he went through as the cancer spread and he was forced to decide between treatment startegies. He takes time to recount his childhood and his introduction to biking, explores in vivid detail his chemotherapy, discusses his psychological recovery from cancer, and closes with his return to professional bike racing and his &quot;second life&quot; as a cancer survivor.&quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; is written in a simple, straightforward way. It is amazingly honest and open from the start, a quality it seems fewer and fewer autobioraphies possess these days. Armstrong doesn't try to create an image for himself or attempt to hide his mistakes. He doesn't shy away from difficult subject matter or even private pieces of his life. He tells his story with dignity, modesty, and a survivor's desire to let readers know that anything is possible."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I AM A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS GIVEN THE ASSIGNMENT OF READING A NOVEL ON A CONTEMPORARY ISSUE; CANCER BEING ONE OF THE MANY LISTED. I CHOSE TO READ LANCE'S BOOK AND READ IT COVER TO COVER IN ABOUT 2 HOURS. THE PROJECT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST ABOUT 8 WEEKS. OOOPS! THE BOOK WAS VERY POWERFUL TO ME SEEING AS HOW MY MOTHER HAD CANCER, MY STEP-FATHER MOUNTAIN BIKE RACES, AND I LOVE READING. THE BOOK IS GREAT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL WHO READ THIS!!! :)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is kind of funny, I raced thru this at a pace that I usually do not read at! Like I had some race to finish! It is told with such ease and openess that you forget that you are reading! Be prepared to open some emotional floodgates! Especially if you are motivated by victory and like to see people succeed! The only problem I had was putting it down when I finished!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Up front, I am a father, husband and athlete. I say that so that my comments below do not get dismissed as being from a female perspective. Unlike many of the reviewers, I did not read this book until May, 2003. First of all, this is a great and fast read. It is very entertaining and educational. It is an uplifting story of a son raised by a single mother, who did not fit in with the popular groups in school and who chose cycling as a way to escape, both physically and emotionally. It is a great story of the American Dream come reality. He literally worked to get where he is today, a champion and millionaire. It is also a great account of combat with a deadly disease, complete with excrutiatingly detailed descriptions of the horrific battle cancer patients fight. Simply put, there is much about the book and Lance Armstrong to admire. That said, I agree with many of the negative comments about Armstrong being self-absorbed and self-centered, although that is not relevant to a review of whether this is book worth your reading. After reading a recent magazine article which revealed that he now has been separated from his wife I found the book to contradict reality, at least as it goes to his loyalty to her. There is no doubt that Armstrong suffered and had to fight for his life through cancer, and that his subsequent 4 straight victories in the Tour are a remarkable achievement. But I now find myself questioning some of the things he states in his book. I think the reader will come away with one distinct impression that perhaps Armstrong himself cannot even realize: He has been able to do what he has done due to the love and support of two women, his mother and his wife. Another thing that he seems blind to and takes for granted are the many friends who seem to bend over backward to support him. One disturbing example is his repeated accounts of his previous girlfriend's love and support during his cancer battle. She repeatedly appears at all places, then when he goes into remission, she is dismissed from the book with one or two lines about the battle having burned her out on the relationship. He never mentions her again. Then when he writes about meeting his future wife, he makes it a point to state, &quot;I know I am supposed to say the light changed when I first saw her, but it didn't.&quot; Some of the sacrifices made by his wife to support his return to cycling are almost unbelievable. But the fact that he seemingly now has chosen his bike over his family is not surprsing if you read between the lines of the book. That said, he tells a poweful story and is a role model for athletic work-ethic and drive, if not for being a great human being. He is the kind of person you'd want your son to emulate if he is going to be a world-class athlete, but for any other role, I'd avoid his example."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I know I'll catch it for this review. The book itself gets 5 stars from me. I enjoyed the read, I shed a few tears and I kept hoping that somewhere it would eventually turn Lance Armstrong into one of my heros. It never did. In fact, I pray to God I never meet Lance Armstrong and never get in his path, and I pray anyone who ever has to does survives the encounter. Sally Jenkins gets kudos on pulling off what was a difficult task. How to write his biography and story with him watching over her and to tell the truth. She did it. She pulled it off by writing between the lines like no other. She is truly the hero here. Make no mistake, the book is good, the hero is not. He is, without a doubt the single most arrogant and egotistical person I've ever read about in my life. I wanted him to be my hero so bad too. I have just gotten into cycling and was looking forward to having someone to watch, follow and emulate. Lance is not that guy. You'll read things that will blow you away. How he fully expected his French sponsor to pay him his 5 million dollar contract even when he was taking chemo and was not riding for them, they even offered to give him a contract, just not 5 million and he was outraged. He freaked on might having to sell his $300,000 worth of furniture and &quot;art&quot; to pay for his treatment. Why oh why have all forsaken poor Lance he wonders. Supposedly a boy that grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in Plano, Tx, but give me a break, there is no &quot;wrong side&quot; of the tracks in Plano. Even though he was only raised by his mother, it's obvious people took care of Lance. Riding his expensive cycles that were given to him out of the goodness of one man's heart, and then he doesn't speak to this guy for years on end. I could continue, but I think the world needs to read this book to learn about this. Lance's story is not over, he still hasn't learned what he probably was meant to learn. I do not suggest buying this book for someone with cancer or a teenager. It's not inspiring in the least, no one can afford what Lance had to get him through his terrible cancer ordeal. And, if a teen reads this, he or she will expect the world to give them everything on a silver platter just like Lance expects. One curious note I can't yet figure out. Never once does Lance tell the world he didn't check himself monthly for testicular cancer and that if he had, he could have caught it before it spread to his brain and lungs and recovery would have been comparably easy. With many pages devoted to pictures of he, his wife, his baby and mother not one single page printed a diagram on how to check yourself for testicular cancer. Seems a hero would have had that thought first and foremost in his head, especially since testicular cancer never has gotten the same PR as checking for breast cancer. I might read his other books. Maybe he's learned something along the way, but that is highly doubtful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having been on on again/off again fan of the Tour de France and knowing who Lance Armstrong is from his win last year, I purchased this book during this years race and read it while avidly following his progress.Lance is not afraid to share the most intimate details of his experience with cancer and this book touched me in ways few books have in my lifetime. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in sports and a place in their heart for the abilities of man to overcome any obstacle and achieve.I more fully appreciate the difficulty of bicycle racing and have more appreciation for the difficulties faced by those stricken with cancer having read this book. Well written, and thoughtful, even tear-jerking in spots, &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; has an important message for everyone. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in 48Hrs! Truly the most inspirational story Ive ever read. Waiting for the movie."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was excellent for both cycling enthusiasts and not. It takes you back from Armstrong's past showing where he gets his drive, determination and fight from, to his life as a cancer patient describing, in much detail, the road he followed and how he felt both mentally and physically, all the way through to conquering his cancer and winning the fight. It is both uplifting to the general public and enthusiastic for us cyclists. And now, after the book, having his first child, &amp; winning his 2nd consecutive Tour de France, all after having cancer, is even more inspirational to see that one can not only conquer the deadly disease, but go on w/ one's life and follow a positive pathway."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book on a Friday and had it finished by Saturday afternoon. Each chapter presents a new stage and an identifiable struggle, which is every bit as tangible as the challenges life serves us, even to given athletes. By the end, you will have experienced the struggle and may even taste a bit of the success brought by the '99 Tour De France rider, Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have followed Lance's progress since his Tour Du Pont days and thought that I knew much more about him than I actually did. He is an american hero and his story would be compelling enough if only for that. Instead this story moves you to tears and then has you laughing again all in one page. You will not be able to put this down and when the last page is turned you will be sad it is over and wish you had not read it so quickly. You will hope for a sequel. Maybe a 2000 Tour de France win. But you WILL NOT be dissapointed in this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Duh! I've never read the book. No point in it anymore. He confessed that he cheated. Hence, the appropriate title is: It's About the Dope."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was given this book during my fight with cancer. This book injected hope, courage, heroism, compassion, to live no matter what, humour and bravery into my blood system along with the chemo poisions... thank you for sharing your fight with the rest of us!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was incredible to read and inspired me in many ways. It was recommended to me by a co-worker. I've read many books in my lifetime, but this one tops them all. It's because of this book that I took up cycling, which I now love. Aside from what he has accomplished on the bike, his fight against cancer simply floored me. For anyone to come back from those odds is just incredible. This is an absolute must read, and not just for cyclists or Armstrong fans. It is a story of courage and determination. And don't forget his follow-up book as well. I cannot wait to read his mother Linda's book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is awesome, I recommend it to everyone. Especially those with cancer or those with loved ones that are battling cancer. Lance Armstrong is an inspiration to us all. What he has done with himself and his life is amazing. I am not much of a reader...but this book is one of those that you just don't want to put down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong, like Jeff Blatnick, has taken advantage of an international stage to show the power of faith, friends and family, combined with medical research and skilled medical professionals. As I read Lance's book, I thought of what Carl Mays wrote in A Strategy For Winning: (quote) Jeff Blatnick won a gold medal in Grecco-Roman wrestling for the United States in 1984. I think he won even greater respect of the entire world by the way he adapted to and bounced back from his bout with cancer prior to the Olympics (end quote). People such as Lance Armstrong and Jeff Blatnick make Americans proud, and make the international human race proud, not merely because they win medals."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A friend of mine passed me this book because I follow bicycle racing, but as the title implies, there's more to it then that. Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins do a great job of telling a story that one minute sounds super human, and the next, painfully human. Lance Armstrong's story before his fight with cancer would have been incredible enough. His struggle to simply stay alive and how that transforms his outlook on life is what makes this story fascinating. On the light hearted side: if you've ever listened to Lance Armstrong during a TV interview, you'll appreciate that none of his style is lost in how his story reads."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong fits the prototype of a typical jock, but he's an honest jock. This well-written account of his battle with testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain is noteworthy not only as a &quot;I beat cancer&quot; story, but as a straight-shooting portrayal of a rather arrogant young man who faced the very real possibility of death, survived, and became a better human being.Mr. Armstrong certainly doesn't try to canonize himself, and that's what's refreshing about It's Not About the Bike. He's completely up front about his weaknesses such as a nasty temper, impatience, and tendency to be brash. There are interesting and honest accounts of his bitterness toward his real father and stepfather, and the complete devotion of his mother. And while, like most Americans, you may not be a bicycle racing fan, the story of how he regrouped and eventually won the sport's crown jewel - The Tour de France - is exciting and inspiring.Mr. Armstrong has the wisdom to know that his victory over cancer had as much to do with the Gods of good fortune as it did his own determination and fortitude. He says, &quot;Some of it is not easy to tell or comfortable to hear. I'm asking you now, at the outset, to put aside your ideas about heroes and miracles, because I'm not storybook material. This is not Disneyland, or Hollywood . . . Good, strong people get cancer, and they do all the right things to beat it, and they still die. That is the essential truth that you learn. People die. And after you learn it, all other things seem irrelevant. They just seem small.&quot;There is also a relevant section about the difficult process of in-vitro fertilization that his wife, Kik, went through. (Mr. Armstrong became sterile after his cancer surgery and treatments.) Happily, the procedure was a success that culminated with the birth of a healthy son, Luke David Armstrong. The candid and sometimes graphic description of IVF is of value to any couple who would like to consider this option.Kudos also go to Sally Jenkins, the co-writer who did a beautiful job of organizing the book and capturing Mr. Armstrong's voice and personality."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Good book. Too bad, probably should be renamed -- \\"Its all about the Drugs\\". Drugs, Doping, Illegal payments, it just went on and on and on."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Those who know me, know that I am not one to have heroes. That is why I find Lance so flippin amazing...because he has certainly become one to me. I've been following his career for quite a while, ever since he became pro (yes, I'm an American male who actually follows Bike racing in Europe, from the early Spring Classics, to the late season races in October). I remember vividly the elation when he became World Road champion, the pride I felt when he won the tour stage honoring his teammate that died 2 days earlier, the sadness when his cancer was discovered, the hopelessness when it spread, and all the mixed emotions last year when he won The Tour. Now, this book IS NOT just for sports or racing fans...my Mom read it for Christ's sake. She cried. It's inspirational in a &quot;real&quot; sense...none of this mumbo jumbo garbage that is so prevalent in modern day &quot;feel good&quot; books. There is no talk of god or religion or miracles. Lance just credits Science, the Doctors, and his own incredible spirit. An easy read, funny at times, always amazing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book back in 2004 and was convinced that Lance Armstrong was a liar. I gave a review (then unpopular of course) of another of his books that also appeared to be full of lies. I was an athlete in the marathon - I knew what it took to be dedicated, train hard, and perform honestly... and most importantly to live every day with honorable athletic values that our children should be raised to expect from adults. The biggest discredit this book has paid is not even to the lives of real athletes (like Greg LeMond, who honestly won the Tour de France 3 times and who spoke out about Lance's illicit drugs and blood doping, and in return Lance destroyed Greg LeMond's biking business and attacked his family) -- that was a blight on the history of cycling that is inexcusable. But the bigger discredit is to the youth of our country and the world - the young people that deserve to know that a real athlete is true to their values and their families. Lance Armstrong brutally dumped his lovely former wife Kristin -- and their 3 children - he sold his soul long before we all had the recent evidence. It is for the youth of our world that I believe this book should be retitled or at least have some sort of correct \\"truth fact sheet\\" attached to it. No child who is interested in sports and athletics should ever be subjected to these lies by Lance Armstrong -- without a corrected \\"truth fact sheet\\" attached to this book.The worst part of it all -- it is now documented (as I had suspected) that Lance Armstrong took performance enhancing drugs before his testicular cancer - that is probably the reason that he came down with testicular cancer in the first place! Betsy Andreu heard Lance telling the doctor this while he was getting treatment for his now famous testicular cancer. WOW what a super fraud he is and this book also truly is! Our children desperately deserve to know that Lance Armstrong not only most likely induced cancer cell growth from his cheating with performance enhancing drugs (steroids kill T-cells, our critical immune cells that in turn delete cancer cells and virally infected cells), but that he made an entire cheating, lying, profit-oriented empire from this \\"oh poor me I have overcome my cancer to win the Tour de France\\" story! PLEASE put some sort of \\"corrected truth fact sheet\\" on the cover of this book so that nobody who is vulnerable will be misled again - what a fraud to our children and to the many cancer survivors that are drawing false inspiration from this fallen person's book! Lastly, I hope that Armstrong genuinely does go on to not only further redeem himself, but that he can ever make up somehow to the people whose lives he destroyed -- Greg LeMond and his family (he obliterated their Trek biking business), Frankie and Betsy Andreu, Emma O'Reilly, his many fallen and not so fallen team members, and the poor children and aspiring athletes that read this book of deceipt. Yes it's not about the bike -- it's about the truth for all our youth and impressionable athletes to read. And it's also about Lance's former wife poor Kristin Armstrong... what a super hero she still is and always has been and always will be."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"No it isn't about the bike. We know that now don't we. Not much point in reading this now can I have my money back."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Anyone who thinks they've had a tough lot in life should read this book. Lance Armstrong details his early life where he is the son of a single mother, feeling like an outcast in his upper-middle-class neighborhood and high school. He is a restless angry teenager who finds that he has the physical ability and drive to become a great athlete. He finally finds the perfect sport in cycling and relentlessly pursues his goal to be the best. Just as he is gaining some recognition in the sport, he is told that he has testicular cancer. The odds against him are overwhelming, but he researches his options until he finds the hospital which he believes will give him the best treatment. He details the agony of surgery and chemo. and the reader begins to understand just what it must be like to be a cancer patient. Not only does he recover, but he goes back to cycling and becomes the best in the world. This book gives interesting insight into what it takes to be the an outstanding athlete and is inspiring for anyone who is facing difficult odds. It shows the gradual maturing of an impulsive and restless young man who is tempered by illness and who is finally able to be a world-class athlete and a family man."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm an avid cyclist who is in the midddle of a round of chemotherapy - so I can totally relate to this book.I've read a lot of books on cancer and attitude since being diagnosed, but none drove home the point that ANYTHING is possible as well as this one did.Winning the Tour would be enough of a triumph - but to come back from chemotherapy and surgery and win it...awesome! Believe me - Lance is not overstating the affect that treatment has on your body - the comeback is astounding. It's given me a lot of courage and renewed my determination - I think it will do that for a lot of people. I literally had tears in my eyes as I read the account of his ride into Sestriere.And it's not just about cancer - if you love cycling it's a great cycling book too! The behind the scenes information of what goes on in the peloton is a great read.Thanks Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a wonderful book about how to live life. I bought it the day after I did a half-ironman, and I read it in one sitting and it even inspired me, in all of my soreness, to exercise again. This could be a book that could equally appeal to an athlete or to someone struggling with a mental or physical illness. It provides some very real answers about why we continue to fight and struggle through life. Armstrong comes across as one of the most compelling, and humanly fallible characters, that I have ever seen in literature. In addition, this book is extremely well-written. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. I recommend it both as an athlete and as a Ph.D./Professor of Literature."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life is an entertaining read that gives the reader insight into what it's like to live with cancer and lose a dream. Lance's journey back to the bike is inspirational, and it showcases his love of his sport. Lance's determination to race even after a life-threatening disease makes this a worthwhile read for anyone who is facing a significant obstacle in life.One positive feature of this book is its description of cycling races. Not only does Armstrong inform the reader of the competitive nature of the sport, such as the insults exchanged while cyclists are racing, he also describes how a team works together during a race. Before reading this book, I believed that each racer's goal was to win. In reality, racers are part of teams, and each team member works for the good of the whole so that one person from their team can be victorious.While this book is a stirring read, it has numerous faults. I agree with Bryan Castro's review when he stated that Armstrong is often annoying. While his wife and friends make huge sacrifices for him and are very supportive before, during, and after his battle with cancer, Lance does nothing to alert his reader to the ways he is equally supportive in his personal relationships.For example, Lance and his wife, Kristin, moved to France so Lance could get back into cycling after he recovered from cancer. His wife had to quit her job, give up her dog, her friends, and her entire life. They spent a few weeks in France before Lance decided to quit biking and moved back home. He then lived like a bum, while Kristin had to find a way to get her life back. This selfish act is one of many which has lowered my opinion of Lance Armstrong.In the beginning of the book, Lance describes how he excelled as an athlete from a young age by competing with older, more experienced athletes. While part of the mindset of being a professional athlete is being confident in one's own abilities, his cockiness is often overwhelming. I had hopes that after his illness he would become more humble, but that voice did not come through in his writing.Lance accomplishes his goal of telling the story of living with cancer, and how he overcame this challenge to get back on the bike professionally. Unfortunately, his egomania and cockiness subtracts from the message of the book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There are several stories in this book. Lance's battle with cancer is the most familiar. There is also a story of a suburban punk, the story of professional cycling (I didn't know this was a team sport), a story about personal growth, and more. I couldn't put this book down once I started it, then it was passed quickly through my family. Both men and women liked it equally and enthusiastically."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book will make anyone realize how lucky each of us our to simply be alive. Lance meticulously describes his cancer therapy and the people that stayed with him during his hardest times. The racing stories are wonderful, especially if your an ametuer road racer or a bicycle enthusiast. I don't read auto-biographies but I'm glad I read this one. This is the first book I read from start to finish in one day. It was hard to put down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After his interview admitting all of his lies and PED use, you have to wonder if his early drug experimentation led to his cancer, before he was able to hire the best doctors and drug experts."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"FANTASTIC book!!! I received this book as a gift right after my first chemo treatment last Christmas- December 2002. It has been my key inspiration over the past six months of chemo, radiation therapy and cranial irradiation. What is \\"breakthrough\\" about Lance and his experience is what he has achieved since. Now all Cancer patients (and people worldwide) can reset the bar for what is possible after successful Cancer treatment.My only caution to patients entering treatment is that there have been great advances in preventing the nausea associated with chemotherapy. Nausea during treatment is not as severe these days due to the addition of steroids to increase the effectiveness of nausea medicine given along with chemo IVs. I had the same chemo and very minimal/treatable nausea in 2003.When you read about Cancer, always note the copyright of the material. Treatment advances are coming daily."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I write this in early May 2002. About a month ago, I was diagnosed with cancer, and since then I have had surgery to remove the tumor and begun a series of radiation treatments to make sure that I have no remaining cancer cells. To be honest, this is not a book that I would have ever thought about reading. My reading is primarily literary and academic, and I just don't read many books about popular entertainment figures. But a friend who I thought was merely a pediatrician but who turned out to be a pediatric oncologist strongly suggested that I read this book, and I am very glad that I did.This is not primarily a book about bike racing; this is primarily a book about cancer, facts that are captured beautifully in the title. My cancer is not nearly as serious as Armstrong's was, but nonetheless so many of the emotions and feelings that he describes struck familiar chords (mine was caught very early, whereas his was discovered quite late and had spread to a number of areas of his body). I can't imagine anyone reading this book who has or is suffering from cancer and not deriving a good deal of benefit. It is comforting to know that someone else has experienced many of the same things that you have. And it is inspiring to see how at least in one case someone has come back successfully from it.Lance's story is especially valuable for men. If you look through a health section of a bookstore, you can find many, many books about women cancer survivors, but very few books by men. Let's face it: guys who are struggling with cancer are going to feel more kinship with someone suffering from a particularly male form of cancer than a woman writing about breast or uterine cancer.This book is a very interesting and easy read, which is a very good thing. If someone happens to be reading it in a situation such as mine right now, these are tremendous virtues.One of the things that struck me while reading the book was the depth of Lance Armstrong's attachment to his family and friends. In particular, his attachment to his mother and his obvious love for her is especially impressive. And unless it is merely a literary conceit, he seems to have a great deal of gratitude and affection for a very large number of people. Much of this hints of a very strong social group that helped get him through an excruciatingly difficult time.The sections dealing with bicycle racing are fine, also. But it is the sections dealing with cancer and his efforts to survive it and then recuperate from it that are the most moving, by far.I suppose that for those who want just to read an inspirational story, or for fans of competitive bicycle racing, this is a book they will thoroughly enjoy reading. But for anyone who is actually experiencing cancer first hand, this book will be invaluable."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to sit down and talk to Lance Armstrong for a couple of hours, now's your chance. Open, honest, thoroughly accessible, this book is one of the best I have read in years. It isn't a jock book and it isn't a \\"let me inspire you with my fight against cancer\\" book. But by the time you're through reading it (and just try to put it down!)you're awed by Lance's tremendous atheletic achievements and inspired by the way Lance and his family and friends looked probable death square in the eye and dealt with it the way any of us would - being scared, courageous, unsure of what to do, impatient to do something, in other words - like humans.Lance is interesting, funny, brash, dedicated, a survivor, a monster athelete, and he puts his money where his mouth is on and off the bike. When you put the book down, you'll know that the title of the book is perfect. It's not about the bike, it's about the heart of the man riding it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I enjoyed reading about Lance Armstrong's experiences as a cancer survivor and a champion cyclist. I did not know that fighting cancer or the Tour De France was as long and gruelling as he describes in this book. He has the fierce determination to be successful at whatever he does. This is what makes Lance Armstrong's story so interesting.I loved reading about the main people in his life. The influence that these people. have had on him is so interesting. Being raised by a single mother, Lance learned independence and toughness. He learned that life is precious and should never been be granted. This is of course from the compassionate doctors and nurses who treated him during his cancer treatment. The trials and tribulations Lance and his wife Kik go through trying to have a baby are very personal. Lance Armstrong's greatest victory is not winning the Tour De France 3 times. His greatest victory is his journey back to life as the title of the book states. This is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I must say after just finishing this book, I am seeing life with a new perspective. I have not had to fight the illness that Lance triumphed over with such dignity but I have had many obstacles in my life as well that I am not completely over. I also battle an illness though on a different level. From learning about Lance's childhood, his mother, his hometown, how he got into cycling, his battle and courageous win over the &quot;Tour de Cancer&quot; and the &quot;Tour de France&quot;, I have the utmost respect for this great guy!! He is an angel himself showing us all the power of perserverance and the power of positive thinking. I am so happy to hear he is healthy, married and happy, a proud father, and most of all...a tremendous HUMAN BEING!!! Thank you for telling your story. That could not be easy to open up to the whole world on many private battles and it just goes to show what a fantastic guy you are! Lance, you are the GOLD!!!! You have earned it in every way! I recommend to anyone who wants to read a heartwarming story that will inspire you..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a bike tourist, and I have never felt drawn to bicycle racing -- either for myself as a racer (ha!) or in following the accounts of others. So the title first attracted me to this harrowingly personal book. Lance is a Texas tough-guy whose daddy did him wrong; his step-dad was no prize, either. He lays it out honestly, and describes his move into the persona that could win one-day classic races on anger and defiance, but not the long-haul tours (which demand strategy and a willingness to lay back and let your team do some of the work). Cancer changed that for Lance. It changed his attitude, his place in life, his relationships, his focus, his mind, and his body. In allowing a medical team to bring him to the edge of death in the interest of destroying the cancerous cells in his body, Lance gained the ability to rely on others in accomplishing a goal. Tourists and racers who think that their team or group is everything would do well to study the relationships that deepen between Lance and his mother, his wife Kik, and his new son. It may be true that \\"everything is bicycle\\" when we're riding one, but we live in much larger networks, and most of us depend on those networks to sustain us in the parts of our life when we're not up on two wheels."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book can truely touch your life. Think you are having a bad day? Think your life is hard? Read this book! It will give you amazing perspective. After you read of Lance's journey through his disease and what the human spirit can do, your problems seem quite small.I can honestly say no book I have ever read has made this kind of impact on me. Do yourself a favor and read this book.Lance Armstrong is a true AMERICAN HERO. May we all learn from his tenacity, passion, and giving sprit.He has taught many people to realize that life is a gift that you need to cherish everyday.Brett Richard"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Prior to this book, I didn't know much about Lance Armstrong. I admire Lance's will to beat cancer and to live; However, he is a selfish and arrogant man and at times I found his attitude distasteful. Having said that, I did find this book enjoyable and learned a little something about cycling. Worth a read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most inspirational book I have read in a long time. It made all of my problems dissapear along with all of my aches and pains. The pain Lance went through in winning 7 Tour de France paled into insignificant compared to the pain of his treatment for testicular cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I grabbed this book several years ago when I was looking for some summer reading. As a teacher, I often look for inspirational, non-fiction books to give me a \\"lift\\"....bascially; success breeds success.I was on my way to summer camp (I volunteer at a camp for deaf children each summer). i sat on the veranda of my family's North Georgia cabin and read this book from sun up to sun down until I was finished....two days I think.In this book, Lance is honest, bears his soul and lets us all know that NOTHING is impossible! I am a true Lance Fan!His co-author has also published a book about Pat Summit -- Ladies Football Coach for the University of TN -- also a great read!This book will inspire you to be better, set high goals -- and achieve them!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Maybe the title of this book should have been \\"It's Not About the Doping.\\"I bought this book for my mother, who was a Lance Armstrong fan, when the paperback was first published.After reading a few pages, wondering if I should invest in a copy for myself, I just couldn't get past the man's ego.If the stories hitting the news in the past few days turn out to be true, perhaps the man's overinflated view of himself will finally crash and burn along with his reputation.Somehow, however, knowing how these personalities self-justify their lives and actions, I doubt it.On the brighter side, I did learn something useful from reading a small portion of this bio; even someone who writes for the Washington Post can write poorly."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Quite an interesting account by the man who ought to know. Found Armstrong to be quite immature and narcissistic at times. However these features have added to the power of his winning method.Lance seems to forget that there are so many people who cannot jetset around America to find the Oncologist they think is best. Many people would not get extra help from Oncologists, etc. because they are NOT Lance Armstrong.Good luck to Lance, but I'm sure there are many other 'heros' who have faced greater odds and survived...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I believe that sports fans and athletes will enjoy a lot this book because will understand how hard it is to be a professional athlete."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Dude this book was insanely awwwwwwsome. This was one of the greatest books that I have ever read. I really doubt that I could find a cooler book. But that's beside the point, the book showed his battle to be great since his child hood and through cancer. Putting down this book is like trying to walk on asphalt in the middle of summer, it was nearly impossible because this book was so good. The book goes into great detail on not only his battle with cancer but also with his childhood and his precancerous races and biking teams that he road on before his fight with cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"LikeOpen: An Autobiography, this is a sports autobiography which defies the genre and is a terrific book in its own right. Written in 2002, when Lance Armstrong had two Tour de Frances under his belt (he went on to win seven), this is the story of his early career as a cyclist, his battle with testicular cancer when his odds of survival were perhaps as low as 20%, his subsequent struggles to regain motivation and then his determination - and work - to secure a Tour de France victory. It's a fascinating and inspirational story, written in such a way that even non-cycling fans are bound to enjoy it.What I loved about the book is that Lance doesn't hide who he is - whether intentionally or not. Yes, there is much to admire: his courage in the face of cancer, his will to give back and inspire others, his single minded focus (to the point of obsession) on achieving a goal, his loyalty to his friends. But there is also the child whose mother couldn't do enough for him, who went on to treat even his closest friends like doormats on occasion. While he sings his (now ex) wife's praises, he also expects her to revolve her life about him and his needs. He is quick to take offence, bears grudges, has extremely high expectations of everyone on his support staff and is often rude to his fellow competitors.Regardless of how you feel about Lance Armstrong, he is a charismatic individual and this is a riveting autobiography written by a driven, inspiring and complex man."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I got this book from the used book store where I live. I finished within 2 days. It is very inspirational and it helps you to be motivated, strong, focused and it teaches you to value and appreciate your mother."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Appears to be an honest story, but I'm less of a fan of his.

I do give him credit for making a remarkable comeback, and his incredible drive."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Coward manI just finished reading the book, I t 's not A bout the Bike. This is the must wonderful book .I have read it in my life, and it \`s also a true story. It was talking about Lance Armstrong's family, disease, sports and love, how his mother was taking care of him alone with no father until he became profession of cyclist. Something strong and depression was happening and he got cancer how lance deal with it...!

Lance's story is straightforward . He is not above average without effort, he is exceptional because of his resilience and the support of friends and family. Also, it gives me a privileged inside view of what it's like to deal with having your life threatened from inside your body and how it's crucial to never give up. I loved everything about this book.

I read it while training to ride my first century bike ride in Claxton, Georgia. What a incrediable man Lance is. What a inspiration for me to keep riding, keep training. This was a book I could not put down. A friend who is a speed reader read the book on our flight from California to Flordia. It is worth the read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For not being a cyclist, father (or a man for that matter), or cancer survivor, it was remarkable how involved I was in this story. It is an excellent display of human courage and strength. I am now definitly a huge fan of Lance's. It is an excelent story!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's biography is one of the best told stories, and most exciting, that I have ever read. It starts out with the chapter \\"before and After\\", this chapter tells about the basis of his life as a star athlete and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He then goes on to tell about his childhood and his gimped family. He grew up without a father, and with a young, not so wealthy mom. He tells about his struggles as a kid and how his mom was always there for him. He also tells how he came by his first racing bike and the triathlons he was in with it. He talks about his first races and how inexprienced he was. When he became more exprienced, he started to win some races then he started to win almost all of his races.His career was very successful, although he was very young. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 25, on October the second. His testicular cancer wasn't just in his testicle, it had spread into his lungs and his brain. While reading about the Chemotherapy treatments he had to undergo, I felt as if though I could relate to him. He told about how scary it was to go through with his brain and testicle surgeries, and how hard it was to be sterile. After he was done with his treatments, he met and married a girl named \\"Kik\\". She was there when he was planning to race in the \\"Tour De France\\". He wrote about his training and his struggle to get on a team. It was very exciting to read about him winning the tour. Lance Armstrong then had a son with Kik, and proceeded to race in the next years Tour De France, which he won again. He then took the Bronze in the 2000 summer olympics.Lance Armstrong tells his story so well, I could imagine every situation he was writing about. He describes things in a way that readers can really understand him. And he doesn't describe anything too much so that the reader would get bored. He writes with inspiration for those who ever were against odds. If the reader has cancer, I believe this book is perfect for them. Even if the reader is a normal everyday person this book shows us how to appreciate and live life to the fullest. If I learned one thing from this book its to never give up. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been against the odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book really engaged me the whole way through. Some people mention the graphic telling of his medical procedures, but I didn't think it was that graphic. he loses a testical and freezes some sperm which later becomes his son, that's about it.It's just plain good writing, and he's someone you'd like to read about. he tells about his life all the way from childhood to the time of writing.. there's no boring spots, no blank spots, it's all proportionate, parts are dramatic but nothings exagerated.. (except perhaps how great his wife is, it's hard to imagine a woman that great, you might fall in love with her by proxy, or the closeness of his friends, it's hard to imagine that many people being that involved with ones life, but I guess that's what it is to be famous)..there's no big ego seeping through.. my resolution is that he's a fairly ordinary guy and that extreme successes become that by being extreme.. and that we should proceed in the direction of our natural abilities."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the most incredible book I have ever read. Throughout the entire book I was in total awe. It shows how low someone who is on top of the world can really go. Armstrong draws in around of any age no matter what he does, biking or writing. He uses personal situations that everyone can relate to, even if the haven't experienced them first hand. Like when he describes having testicular cancer, he describes it with such detail one can only cringe with astonishment.This book is not set out there for any one specific group but more of a book for anyone who will listen to his story. This is not a book that will preach about how to be successful or how he became famous. It's simply about a man that found the true meaning of life.He sets up the autobiography very nicely starting off with his disadvantages even before he was born. Although his mother was young when he was born he and she both overcame the odds and lived their lives how the wanted too. Next he moved onto his early stages of riding, his first steps to stardom. Then out of the blue he was struck with this life threatening disease. He felt his life was over. His sense of true character came out and he came through. This is not just something that people just snap their fingers and their body is cleansed of viruses it is a time consuming process that is very mentally and physically exhausting. The chemotherapy drains the body completely.How the book was written it felt like I came out knowing him as a person that great competitive nature that almost made him succeed not only in racing but simply living.This book is so inspirational that it will keep anyone's mind on track even when they're having the darkest times."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is not the most eloquent biography, nor is it deeply philosophical. It is, however, an honest, moving and truly extraordinary story about one of America's greatest ever and surprisingly unsung heroes. I read this book in 24 hours, I wish I could erase my memory so I could enjoy it again. If you have any sort of a heart - buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspirational story that made it hard to put the book down. A story of courage and overcoming the worst odds. From cancer to coming back to beat the best bikers in the world in the greatest race in the world, when nobody gave him a chance...it made me view life a little differently."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like many others, I picked up this book when the shipment arrived from Amazon and I could not stop reading it. It's an amazing story about facing adversity and taking control of your own life. My hat's off to Sally Jenkins for making this story so darn readable that there is just no place to stop and put it down. You won't be sorry that you read this book.."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book over the past week after not knowing all that much about Lance Armstrong. I not only feel I &quot;know&quot; him now, but his struggle and triumph are truly inspirational. I am a clinical psychologist who works with people every day in an attempt to help them overcome the obstacles in their lives, both internal and external, and find true meaning and happiness. This book embodies one brave man's successful efforts to do this and to find and maintain his integrity as well. Without any ego or pretense, he describes what all of us aspire to learn about our lives and ourselves: that we can make of our time what we want to, that attitude is everything, and that the sweetest moments are often found with the perspective of loss or injury clearly in mind. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks common wisdom and understanding in their own life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book to find out more about this brave person.I wanted to have an exceptionally brave role model in these trying times. At first, I was disappointed because the style of writing interfered with the content. It is choppy with very short declarative sentences. Then, as I continued, I realized that the confrontive style is a reflection of how he lives his life: focused and confronting the overwhelming adversities he faced.This is one of those books that sticks with you long after you've finished it. Don't be put off by the STYLE in which it is written. It is wonderful. He is so admirable. I'm glad he shared his perspective with us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is sure to inspire anyone who reads this book. He beat the odds, not only to survive, but to win the Tour De France. This tells of his hardships and ultimate triumph. Being struck with cancer, he wasn't expected to live, but pure dedication and the love and support of his family and friends got him through it. This story is one that should not be missed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For most people, giving them some paper and a typewriter is like giving them rope to hang themselves with. And this book is an excellent example. Lance Armstrong wastes no time in demonstrating his staggering vulgarity and total self-absorption.Apparently, rather than tax himself with the task of being a good person - something that seems not even to have penetrated the outer edges of the universe of his ideas - Armstrong considers himself to have made a compelling case for greatness simply by being a good cyclist. And apparently many, many readers cannot see anything wrong with Armstrong's narcissistic totalitarianism and in fact drink it down like water. You want the book boiled down for you? Lance Armstrong is a piece of ... who happens to ride a bike."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There are givers and there are takers in this world. This book clearly demonstrates that Lance Armstrong is a taker, both before and after his cancer treatment. It isinteresting to read only to have an inside view of an unabashed self-obsessed person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was hoping for more but this is a typical subpar athlete's autobiography. Lance's story is incredible because he fought and came back and should inspire those in a similar situation. However, other than the cancer, Lance Armstrong is not an interesting individual and reading about his mundane conversations with his wife was a waste of time and was out of place for subject of the book. It was very interesting to read that Lance does not love cycling - he did it because he was good at it and it was a well paying job. I can appreciate that kind of honesty."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"At the time it came out, I found this to be a very good read. It is very well written and Lance is a very interesting individual. In and of itself, I think it's likely a 5 star autobiography.That said, recent developments established that it is pretty much complete fiction when it comes to Lance's training techniques and drug use. For that, I would give it a 1.By averaging the two out, I got a 3, which is what I rated the book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who is going through a cancer battle. This book helped my husband get through his treatment for Lymphoma. Lance is an inspiration and his story is so amazing and scary. I read the book as well and have given it to 2 other people who are beginning their battle with cancer. It's a must read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"With the odds of surviving his quickly progressing cancer in the 0-5% range, Lance conquered the &quot;Big C&quot; and has shot off like a rocket since! A very informative, sometimes choppily written, always interesting autobiography and it actually leaves you wanting to know more about this inspirational man. Quite surprised he gives no credit to God, his agnostic beliefs overshadow some of his exploits, however his will to live and succeed is very evident. A great story and a great individual!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By page 50 of this book I had already cried twice. Armstrong's reflections about his early beginnings in Texas were heartfelt, poignant, and it struck an empathetic cord with me. I think this is the strongest part of the book. Later, his riveting accounts of bike racing, especially the Tour de France, left me wanting more. Armstrong's precise descriptions of what it takes to rise above the grueling tedium of riding and how to learn the discipline made me admire him for his passion. However, I was a bit disappointed with the rest of the book. I was hoping for the moving and rewarding insights of a book such as Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther, instead I felt short changed. Armstrong's words to express things became more mechanical and almost third person. While I will credit him for his perseverance in fighting for his life, he seemed never seemed to give us the readers nothing much to go on. It never felt to me that while he was in treatment that he experienced a moment of truth. In fact sometimes I thought he was kind of belligerent to the medical staff. There didn't seem to be a change from pre-cancer Lance from post-cancer Lance. His recovery then seemed to play out like a movie of the week script -- starts foundation with rich Texan venture capitalist, beautiful rich girl finds boy superstar, have beautiful baby boy and live happily ever after in Santa Barbara. It just didn't seem real anymore to me. In fact he seemed a bit full of himself. Maybe what really happened to Lance was that he just grew up and was not a boy anymore. Nothing more."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is about the money. I quite enjoyed this book until I got to the part where he refuses to work for the paltry sum of 120 K a year, three times what the average North American will ever earn. At that point the book is revealed for what it really is: a cynical marketing ploy designed to enhance his image amongst both cyclists and non-cyclists alike. Boo hoo. Poor Lance--he might not be able to buy back that Porsche."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong isn't a very interesting person. He's an athlete, who, before being struck by cancer, seemed to be exclusively immersed in his own sporting endeavours. There seemed to be nothing else in his life other than his very nice mum. Post-cancer add his wife, a son and a little more humility and wisdom. I've had the cancer brush with death in my 30s - my wife has recently undergone extensive chemo. I'm also a daily cyclist and Tour de France enthusiast. So I enjoyed the journey -envy for Armstrong's natural talent and his incredible resolve - engagement with his struggle against illness.However I ended up thinking here was a pretty boring guy with little understanding of the world and with few interesting life experiences.What prompted me to purchase the book was a fascination with how someone ravaged by chemotheraphy could less than two years later win probably the most gruelling sporting event in the world. There wasn't really much of an answer given - simply hard work and resolve. That's it. No magic potion, no special training techniques that we could all learn from.So the conclusion is that Lance Armstrong is perhaps one of those rare athletes (in the pantheon inhabited by the likes of Tiger Woods, Ian Thorpe, Jesse Owen and Pele) who is so gifted and so focused that they end up making all their fellow competitors seem like minnows.It's not a very dramatic story - but I guess the truth can be simple and basic. If Lance Armstrong was an interesting person he probably wouldn't have had the focus to be what he is - both as a cyclist and a survivor. He'd probably be dead."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong in his book recounts the transformation that happened in his life out of finding out at age 25 that he had very advanced testicular cancer. Incredibly, he was able to beat very unfavorable odds and come through cancer free. The cancer in his case seems to have worked as a tool that helped him transform and wake up to the richness of his life. He discovered how loved and supported he was by his family and friends, he discovered and was able to appreciate the dedication and incredible talent of others who collaborated to save his life, he discovered his inner resources and his passion for living, he rediscovered his love for the Bike which he was taking for granted... Out of this experience he won the Big Price: Huge professional success and a very fulfilling and loving marriage. If you are interested in transformational experiences and in discovering the state of being where success, love, satisfaction, self expression and aliveness reside, I highly recommend that you also read the book WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book is a gem and it delivers all the keys to personal transformation and enlightenment. I highly recommend it to anybody who, like Lance Armstrong, is willing to challenge the limits of what we think it is possible to make happen in our lives."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a fast, easy and enjoyable read. All I knew about Lance Armstrong before reading the book was what everybody knows about him -- 1999 Tour le France winner and cancer survivor. This book is a glimpse to the &quot;man behind the athelete&quot; or a glimpse of the humanity that makes up Lance Armstrong. I was touched by his honesty on every subject he wrote about. Reading about his upbringing and how close he is to his mother, about meeting and falling in love with his wife (Kik) and about the conception and birth of his son speaks as the completeness of Mr. Armstrong. Highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's story is one of true inspiration and is a must read for everyone. This book is not just for athletes or sports buffs; Lance discusses his childhood, his career, his fight against cancer and his quest to have a family. He tells his story honestly and openly. You feel his struggles and his triumphs. His explaination of medical and cycling jargon not only makes the book understandable but is educational.This story was so well told that I couldn't put it down. A tremendous, memorable story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A well written,inspiring story of an exceptional athlete, son, husband and now father!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I wish more people had the will and determination to accomplish what Lance does after he is diagnosed with cancer. He was an good cyclist before he had cancer, but after he was done with the chemo treatments he became an EXCELLENT cyclist and an individual. Best of luck Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I don't read many books, but this one was well worth it. First, I admire Lance Armstrong's determination. This book does a great job of detailing his path from his pre-cancer life to post. Easy, fast read, but get out the Kleenex."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Too bad there's not a rating higher than 5 stars for Armstrong's book - I read cover to cover and was blown away!

Lance Armstrong has every reason to just lay down and die. Worst yet, most people expected him to do just that!

I have told everybody I can think of about this book and they glance at it and agree it sounds great. Lance Armstrong will impress you with his arrogance and his openess and his weaknesses. This isn't a jock book that makes you wonder why it was published. This is truly enjoyable even if you are not a cycling fan. This is a book about a person with a will to live."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was like everyone else, once I picked up this book I could not put it down.

Once again Thanks Stevie!I have sat for more than one lunch hour reading this book and crying my eyes out with his stories of dispair, hope and love.I have to agree with others, this is one book not to miss and the best book I've ever read.

I highly recommend this book for everybody. It is very easy to read and very interesting book. I t is also a good source of information for bike riders and for ordinary people, because nobody knows what they may face in their future: good health or a disease.This book is hopeful, because even though Lance got sick, after he thought about himself as an invincible person, he got a good treatment. After three years he fully got back to himself and become a big winner of &iexcl;Tour de France&iexcl; for three years in a row. I hope he will win this year too. One day at the press conference Lance said &iexcl; I&iexcl;m determined to fight this disease. And I will win &iexcl;I think this is the most important sentence in this book, it is not only important for his disease, bat also for his life.

It is about Lance's real life.When Lance became a famous cyclist racer, he got testicular cancer. After the long treatments of chemotherapy, a miracle happened. The cancer disappeared. He is free now from the illnes and stil very famous because he won the Tour de France 3 consecutive years since 1999.I wonder if all cancer cases have the same happy end. But unfortunately not everybody has the same fate.I love this book and I invite everyone to read it. It's a wonderful story.You would see a beautiful end. Thanks to God for this miracle."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"AN INSPIRING BOOK June 4 2002Reviewer: J.Alfonso Gutarra NY USAI am fascinated with the story of Lance; I used to follow the la tour de France all those years when Miguel Indurain was the winner. And I know this struggle to win those inches in the race, that why when I read this book I could imagine Lance's comeback, from lying in the hospital with cancer, going through the chemotherapy, facing the death and still keeping in the heart the idea of being a champion, That is amazing.No doubts than Lance is an\\" extraordinaire\\" person, who has a very candid relationship with every person in his world, blessed of a great physical and mental strength, and I think he is going to win again in those important races in Europe.This is an inspiring book for everybody. It is, about somebody who came back practically from the dead, somebody who never gave up. Also he is a classical winner, a beloved man, No only for his mother, and his friends everybody love Lance, He is a lucky man too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book goes past the sport of cycling and appeals to all readers who like a truly inspirational and uplifting story.Lance begins his story with a brief history of his childhood and his wild ways. He moves through his triathlon career and into his early professional cycling career. In his early days, Lance was all energy and youth and would often tire out before the end of the races. As he matured, he harnessed his energy and became a more strategic racer. After winning his first Tour de France, he got the bad news.Lance's battle with cancer and his ultimate triumph is a testament to all human beings. It is proof that the human spirit goes on in the face of adversity. Lance was helped through his treatments by his wife, friends, and extended family. He emerged from cancer with a chance to rebuild his body and did so with the intensity of a man half his age.Lance's renewed dedication to his family and his career, his post-cancerous Tour win, and his worldwide success are all parts of the most inspirational story of our time. After reading this book, you will be ready to climb mountains, run a marathon, or tell your family you love them.Lance's renewed outlook on life might not be just about the bike, but his success in beating cancer and his worldwide fame are.I highly recommend this book to anyone with the time to read it. It is a fast read and you do not have to be a cyclist fan to appreciate it. There is a reason this book has been on the best seller lists for so long, pick it up and find out."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Is the Lance portrayed in the book a little bit &quot;sanitized&quot; or packaged by good PR? Maybe. Regardless, who can help but to be inspired by one of if not the most gifted and admirable athletes of our time.The book is worth it solely for the discussions of world-class cycling and the tactics involved; the story's of Lance's life and his battle with cancer make it inspiring."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a person who rarely reads biographies, I have to admit that I picked up the book and read it based on the incredible triumph of Lance at the Tour de France. It is a wonderfully written and the pages fly by. It reveals the honest truth about the horrors of cancer and the power of believing in yourself. A definite must read for anyone in need of inspiration."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I disagree with most of the recent reviews that have come out pertaining to this book. Before anybody decides to come down on me, I want to say that I am in no way an advocate of using performance enhancement substances in competitive sports nor am I particularly fond of Armstrong's decisions to cover and fight against the truth. However, the central message of the book is what I focus on and it's still what grabs me. The book isn't about winning the Tour de France, it's about a man who didn't give up. No matter if one decides to use performance enhancement substances or not, the drugs themselves do not do the majority of the work. Now the advantage the drugs gave raise the issue of ethics, the fact remains that Armstrong did fight against a lethal disease, survived and made the triumphant return to a sport that he loved. This man worked hard and gave everything he had and that's inspirational regardless of whether he won using the drugs, won without the drugs, lost with the drugs or lost without the drugs. It seems rather ironic that while we as a society tend to celebrate effort above anything else, we readily dismiss it in this case."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I heard about Lance Armstrong in health class; and because my english teacher has a picture of him in his room. Both my english teacher and I love riding bikes; however, I don't chain my bike to my desk.This is a fanastic book which I think everyone, even if you don't like sports, should read. If you read this title, you can tell it is about Lance Armstrong the 7-time Tour de France winner. Many people who have heard about Lance Armstong from his Livestrong foundation, his wins, and his finance Sheryll Crow.Here is what the book is about. It is Lance Armstrong's memior about his life from when he was little up to the birth of his son Luke. In 1996, Lance found out he had a very advanced form of testicular cancer, which left him sterile. When I say advanced, I mean that it spread to his lungs and brain. In this story, Lance explains why he became the way he is. He talks about how after experiences with his first stepfather hitting him with an old fraternity paddle for any reason is the reason that he thinks organized religion is for hypocrites. He talks about how great and wonderful his mother is. He talks about his start in Plano, Texas. And the birth of son by in-virto. he talks about being the youngest Tour de France winner. He also mentions that after his horrible battle with cancer, how he won the Tour again; however, people thought he used drugs to get that way. In my opinion, it is very sweet about how he talks about his wife Kristin aka Kik (they are now divorced) and his mother. Anyone who wants to read a good book should read this.There are only two books I can say are as good as this one; they are EVERY SECOND COUNTS BY LANCE ARMSTRONG and the RYAN WHITE BOOK. Every Second Counts is what takes place after this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is raw, candid, and often moved me to tears. I knew Lance in name only before the book. I admire his honesty in this book.Lance (and his wife) experienced seemingly more Miracles in the shortest amount of time than most people experience in a lifetime. He is blessed to have had so many people (including his wife) who &quot;put it on the line&quot; for him, yet I can't help but wonder if he truly appreciates it.Lance is a &quot;take charge&quot; kind of guy and we get to see that at its depth as he takes us through his cycling and cancer challenges. Both of which, in his case, are extremely amazing feats. When that much is demanded of you, or demanded of yourself, is something lost? Lance Armstrong seems torn throughout the book about his role in his life.Never discount a Miracle or Who it came from."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In my opinion this is one of the greatest books ever written. Lance's story is incredibly motivating, and Jenkins captures the essence of this American hero. Her use of cycling diction, race scene description, and team orientation help clarify this highly European sport for her American readers. Her use of metaphor extends the reader's understanding of how the cycling world ticks. Lance's many dialogues in the novel add substance to the work, while providing a better understanding of his battle with testicular cancer. Also, Lance's use of subconscious feeling helps the reader understand his attitude toward certain situations. He delievers a wonderful story that will touch of the heart of even the most skeptical readers. His message is clear, no obstacle is to tough to overcome with motivation, perserverence, and dedication. This book is wonderful for anyone looking for a good &quot;pick me up&quot; to motivate them to get in gear!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In Lance Armstrong's autobiography, realism is a major point. Lance puts the reader in his shoues in every situation. Even if the reader has not had an experience such as Lance had, the reader gets the feeling of going through the same circumstanceswith Lance, and at the same time as Lancedid. Lance has a graphical way of describing situations to the reader that captivate the reader with wonderment and awe. Lance wants the reader to understand and be interested in the facts of life such as cancer. Lace gives detaild discriptions of the process of chemotherapy and how it effects the body. He also describes his struggle to get back on the bike and the conditionsof his body through the entire process.The authors tone throughout the book is blunt but sincere. Lance states exactly how he is feeling at every moment that he discusses. Lance also seems to think that telling something to some one straight, they will be more interested or the point would be better understood. Lance uses his tone to express realism through the book. Tone is a way that Lance gets his point of view across while allowing the reader to expressfeelings for themselves.Complications made this book a book. Without the complications and struggles to survive them, Lance would be a normall professional athlete. Because of the trouble he went through to survive cancer and win the Tour de France, he becomes a hero and role model to many people of today's society. Lance uses his complications to help him thrive to a more meaningful life. Complications are what make Lance who he is today and without his tough times he would be like many people know, famous or not, in our world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I rate this book five stars even though the quality of the writing should put it at a three and a half or four, because of the extraordinarily inspirational quality of the subject matter. It is a real-life fairy tale. If it had been fiction, I would have scoffed at the author's unbelievable ending (three Tour de France victories). But the fact that it is real, and true, leaves the reader with a sense of wonderment and a renewed belief in the power of an indomitable spirit to conquer the impossible.This book is gripping in all its phases: pre-cancer, cancer treatment, post-cancer doldrums, and the comeback. And the sports aficionado will not be disappointed: it includes wonderful stage-to-stage accounts of the Tour victories. It is a quick read and can be read in a few days.The writing can be clich&eacute;d at times, and the tone has a tendency to get a bit self-congratulatory. However, it does not detract from the uplifting spirit of the book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"How Armstrong, a world renowned champion cyclist and cancer survivor, could turn such challenging experiences into a loathsome exercise in egomania, is beyond comprehension. His idea of 'surviving' is by showing a total lack of kindness and compassion to himself and others, treating others on a far lower level than his pedastal, and asking the reader to show mercy on his situation - only those that involved him losing his corporate sponsorship, or Porsche. With the help of co-author Sally Jenkins, Armstrong brings the concept of &quot;self-absorbtion&quot; to a whole new level. What should have tipped me (and other reader's) off was the book's jacket, which lists adjectives beneath his name: Winner of the Tour de France, Cancer Survivor, Husband, Father, Son, Human Being. The last one listed is most beneficial for the readers; lest we forget."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a purely recreational cyclist and have honored what this young man has accomplished as an athlete. I had hoped, however to see more sense of greatness and a personal transformation story than what we get in this well-written book, but no, it would seem that besides the ability to withstand the most horrific of treatments, his recovery and comeback are both the result of good medicine, a seemingly endless supply of money, and a lot of Texas-style bravado; and the proud claim to be an agnostic, after all this, is frankly beyond the realm of cluelessness. I wish him well, actually, I wish him better."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book for my wife after she had been wanting it for quite some time. As I sit here on the couch watching tv she keeps reading me little excerpts from the book because she is enthralled. She is huge into bike riding and this is a great gift for someone like that. She knows all about the accusations of Lance doping throughout a fair amount of his Tour De France wins and is somewhat skeptical of him now but says the book is a great read nonetheless."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was a good book, based on what he is willing to give up at this point. We will be waiting for the full truth in the future."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I read this Thai tranlated version , I did not know Lance and bicycle.

It is such a good book even seen."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I must say that this is easily one of the best books I have ever read, and probably the most inspirational. It delves deep into the realms of the human spirit, against the worst of odds. Lance Armstrong isn't just the single greatest athlete of our generation, hes an American hero, and he beat cancer. Yes, he did not just survive, he defeated it, and proved it can be done. I have never had cancer, I have never fought against unbelieveble odds. This man has, and he tells his story in a remarkable, touching, and humane way. Fantastic Read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life.\\" by Lance Armstrong is truly inspiriting. In the book Lance writes about his life, from the time of his adventurous childhood all the way threw his defeat of cancer. In his story, he tells of his diagnosis, treatment and recovery without holding any details back to show the true extent of his illness. In the story, Lance tries to convey that although he is most commonly known as a world class cyclist he would rather be known as a cancer survivor who beat the odds. I really enjoyed reading Lance's story. Some parts I was laughing, while other times I was on the verge of crying. There is not one part of the book that I didn't enjoy. I recommend this book for everybody to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book covers Lance Armstrong's life - from birth, to his first bike, initial cycling successes, cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery, returning to cycling to win the Tour de France, and becoming a first-time father. The book is hard to put down, and well-worth reading.Lance's mother was only 17 when he was born, played a very large role in his development, and continues to be very close to him. His father left before Lance reached his second birthday, and she worked two jobs while finishing school and raising Lance. She taught Lance never to quit.Lance got his first bike at age seven, and loved it. In high-school he tried football (not coordinated enough), then swimming (the 12-year-old was initially put in with 7-year-olds) and soon became quite good. At age thirteen Lance entered and won his first jr. triathalon, followed by another in Houston, and by age 15 was entering adult competitions, going from 15th place the first year to 5th the second. Lance began earning $20,000/year as a competitor, and then ended up winning the World Championship in Norway. Before this happened, however, Lance had to learn racing tactics (eg. saving himself until close to the end), and as often as not became too eager and faded before the finish.Then came cancer - described by Lance as the \\"best thing that happened to me.\\" Early symptoms were attributed to \\"bicycle injury,\\" or \\"flu.\\" However, after coughing up blood, Lance sought help - eventually resulting in the diagnosis of advanced testicular cancer which had spread to the lungs (12 locations) and his brain (2 locations). Initial testicular removal and chemotherapy took place in Austin, with little adverse impact. Getting a second opinion took him to Houston, and a third in Indianapolis, where brain surgery and much more aggressive chemotherapy were undertaken. Lance not only lost all his hair, but also ended up with prolonged daily retching.Along the way, Lance clearly conveys his worries, willingness to confront the disease and question medical authorities, and ultimate bond and admiration for his medical team. His negative blood marker (HCG count) went from about 50,000 at diagnosis to 92,000 at peak, and then down to 9,000, and finally 96.Recovery, however, had only begun. Lance recounts being passed by a 50-ish local woman riding a heavy mountain bike, and the nagging worry that the cancer would return. After about a year, he returned to Europe, and quit almost immediately. Finally, in 1999 he was able to sustain a return to cycling and go on to win the Tour de France.Other \\"high points\\" include Lance deciding that he had a higher purpose than cycling - helping others through cancer and cancer research. Organizing his first charity event resulted in meeting his wife (\\"Kit\\"), and the eventual birth of their first child - Luke (via previously stored sperm).Reading the book reinforces the reasons Lance Armstrong gave for quitting cycling - to spend more time with his children, and to pursue his \\"responsibility to help others with cancer.\\"Truly an inspirational story and individual!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong was a very brave man.

This book is an excellent introduction into amazing life and times of Lance Armstrong. It is important to remember that this story is told from Lance's perspective, and therefore can not necessarily be expected to be totally objective; he occassionally uses the book as a platform to \\"correct misipressions\\" created by others.

He has overcome a lot in life and I guess that led him to be so egotistical but none the less he did it so he can say it. This book is well worth the read as it is inspiring and motivating and really gives you a sense of what it takes to perform at the level he does.

It is inspiring, motivational, and touching all in one. Definetly a must read for any literate person on this earth, as well as Lance's second book, Every Second Countssupport cancer research, visit [...]"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I can't remember exactly what I was thinking when I started reading this book, however, whatever it was, I am happy that I was thinking it. I was not a cycling fan at the time and will most likely never be a hard core fan and that is what is great about the book. It's not about cycling. Well, some of it is, but the parts that are about cycling are more inspirational than anything.I had absolutley no idea that Lance's fight for cancer was as grueling as it was. I didn't know that it had spread and that he wasn't only fighting testicular cancer. I also had no idea what he went through to get rid of the cancer. I know now and that is why I have such respect and admiration for Lance. He is a true fighter and is what we all should strive to be when faced with the adversity that he was.If you are looking for some inspiration then this is a good choice.With that being said, Lance's personality is somewhat brash and most likely a side effect from being famous, however, it appears to me that he stands up for what he believes is right and will let you know when he thinks you are stepping on his values or morals."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The Lance Armstrong story is well known. His triumphs in cycling as well as his fight with terminal cancer are the stuff that newspapers are made of. Trying to elaborate about those triumphs had better be compelling, or the whole account in book form becomes a dead letter.And, Lance Armstrong is definitely not a dead letter. His autobiography, 'It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,' keeps his legacy, just like his life, fresh and alive.As I accidentally fell upon this book at the library, I discovered early and often that Armstrong gives plenty of evidence his story is worth retelling. From the first chapter, the narrative is accessible enough for readers to take his journey vicariously: Riding the Tour de France and recovering from cancer was grueling for Lance Armstrong, but while the details take one vividly and perceptively through his life, one never feels that reading about it ever is. Never is there a wasted word, scene, or explanation.Deciding how this can be so is the crux. My first impression is that Lance has great expression. Even though he's down-to-earth, his color, flair, and personality are conveyed throughout. He's able to elaborate well about his life. He's good with words, and he's closely in touch with his feelings. He's able to describe life events in a fluid fashion, and his choice of what he tells is a constant exercise in good judgment.Speaking of details, without giving away the store, Lance is great at recounting when he was first diagnosed with cancer, remembering his feelings, the reactions of significant others, and what they said at key moments of his life. He's also an able writer, recalling the challenges of racing in general as well as for each individual race. His memories of dangers, competitors' strengths and weakness, and the fabric of all his personal and career ups and downs are varied and complete.It is an intimate account (enough to fascinate) without being merely a long, drawn-out addendum or answer to gossip tabloids. Furthermore, he integrates the fossilized charges of \\"doping\\" skillfully (including an honest account of what went through his mind before, during, and after his press conferences) and without overdoing it.Without diminishing his writing accomplishments, one can imagine that whenever Lance faltered in his writing, co-author, Sally Jenkins, reinforced his efforts with excellent feedback and editing. Just like his fellow team members for the Tour de France, Lance has singular achievement, but nothing he has done has been without group support..As a whole, 'It's Not About the Bike...' is a terrific read, a lucid account by an articulate man who's generous and resourceful with information. This is the best jockography I've ever read (although I\`ve only read about six.). The mere fact that he had me in suspense nearly every step of the way for an autobiographical story I've already known is a fact that speaks volumes.(*My title is a quote from Armstrong himself who is speaking about bike racing during his recollection of his first Tour de France triumph. It's a bit of a misnomer, for, as anyone who has completed the book can attest, all the suffering he recalls is very significant to him.)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong gives us details and insights on his life growing up, winning races and dealing with cancer. It is these details that let us look at someone who rises to a champions level not only on the bike, but in life. Sure there is an ego, but who among us achieving what Lance has would be totally humble? We all can learn from this book about never giving up and be willing to focus our efforts on going forward to reach higher levels acheivements.

It really gave him hope!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's more then just an autobiography. It is about life, it is about surviving. It is about the unfailing human spirit that never say die. It is about hope when everything goes wrong. It is about learning how great athletes are made. It is about suffering, it is about pain to the top of the ladder. It is about rise of a \`Phoenix' who never said die.There are parts in the book that reduce you to tears of sorrow and to the tears of bliss and joy. It is about sharing the toughest time of one of the pioneers, a role model, a warrior, a saint...My life is never same, after reading this book.All I can think about is \\"How did he do that?...\\""},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was sixteen and in hospital with an eating disorder when my friend gave me this book, and I read it in two days. It turned my life around.While I was on the verge of quitting swimming (I had to forfeit the World Championships that year due to my poor eating habits - my own fault, I know) I suddenly felt a new lease of life after reading about Lance and though it sounds lame, if I hadn't read the book I would never have made the Olympic team for Athens.Lance got told he was gonna die and he pretty much laughed in everyone's faces when he got back on his bike and subsequently won seven TdFs. If you read one book this Summer, it should be \\"It's Not About The Bike\\". If you ever doubted the man, you won't after reading about him. I hope he wins the NY Marathon"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read Lance's book right after I read James Frey's book: A million little pieces. Unfortunately, the former makes the latter look silly, especially in light of what we've learned about Frey's book, which is admittedly, still significant if he was being completely honest about the depth of his addiction and his struggles to get clean. What seperates this book is, obviously, the fact that we know that Lance is telling the truth, and the complete truth. I cried about 8 times when I read this book. And alot of light was shed on my previous preceptions about Lance's personality as a cocky, rude, hot-head. And while, indeed he IS still a cocky hot-head, I now have a more complete idea of who he is fully, as a man, a truly sensitive person, and a father. He also happens to be a great writer, and I'm already looking forward to reading his 2nd book. His details of the strategies involved in training and racing are just as fascinating as the survival aspects of his story, and I also got a complete crash course on in-vitro fertilization and childbirth. Lance Armstrong just shot straight to the top of my own personal list of the most significant athletes ever to live. I can't recommend this book more highly, for anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book is really a combination of two books, one about bike racing and that whole scene and the other about the author's experiences with cancer. I think by combining the two, the author dilluted both books.I picked the book off a rack at the MD Anderson Cancer center who as one might imagine had several copies available. I thought the book was definitely a mixed bag. Armstrong while certainly corageous to beat the cancer comes off as a real selfcentered person who likes to use the first person singular pronoun a lot, and doesn't miss many opportunities to tell the reader just how great he is. His account of the 1999 Tour de France was enlightening for folks like me who don't pay much attention to professional bike racing. However, I was struck by most of the book being about biking rather than beating cancer, this after the title of the book would lead one to think otherwise. And, not much attention at all was given to Armstrong's wonderful foundation that has provided significant dollars for cancer programs.I will admit to Armstrong's later splitting with his wife and kids and hanging out with Cheryl Crowe and the Beautiful Crowd probably affects my objectivity. And then there are those nagging drug allegations fom the 1999 race ( can we say Raphel Palmeiro )."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's autobiography \\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,\\" is a great book for anyone out there. It appeals to anyone who likes to read because it has many different stories. Lance tells stories about his childhood and growing up with his mother when he first started to bike. He then writes about his life after his childhood leading up to when he finds out that he has cancer and his life during his cancer and chemotherapy treatments. After all of this, he then goes on to tell stories about post-cancer life, and how he has become the worlds most dominant cyclist, the worlds best athlete, and how he has inspired many young kids to always try as hard as they can and never let life's obstacles stop them from getting to their dream.This is probably the best book I have ever read because it had all of the elements that a book needs. I do enjoy cycling and mountain biking, so I can make that connection to myself. But the rest of this book and Lance Armstrong's life has a completely different background than mine. I have never had cancer, I live with both of my parents, I go to a good school with many teachers that care about me and what I do in the future. Lance Armstrong had cancer, he lived with his mom and her husbands that she would marry then divorce a few years later until he was about 18 or 19, and he had teachers who didn't think he was headed in the right direction in life because all he would do was go to triathlons and cycling events.For Lance Armstrong to accomplish as much as he did in life is still amazing in my mind. I don't know anyone that could amount to anything like that when they have all those things happen in their life and survive cancer when given less than a 10% chance to live. This book is very inspirational and anyone who reads it will automatically become one of Lance Armstrong's many fans, even if you have never touched a bike in your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a Dutchman I am almost naturally interested in cycling. When Armstrong first started riding his style was attacking and funny, though not always very smart. He got better at tactics and started to race better. Then all of a sudden he was gone from the newspapers, having been diagnozed with cancer.This book is a fascinating account about how his career evolved, became pro and was diagnozed. And of course how he got back and won the Tour de France, the sports hardest race.His fight against cancer is something which is a big and important part of this book. People who have never been around cancer patients and never read about but like cycling or sports will have a chace to read about what it is like, it opened my eyes.it may also give people who don't know a lot about the sport a good insight in how it really works. Cycling is a teamsport with its own unwritten rules and Armstrong talks about this a lot.It's a good story about an American in a European sport (think a Frenchman pitching for the Yankees) and how he managed to survive,"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspiring book. I learned alot about cycling and cancer and the treament of cancer. It is a book about sticking with something, seeing it through and being very strong willed. It also shows the importance of having a support system in family and close friends. A good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you are looking for a book to get you off your but and moving this is the book for you. I have never felt as lazy as I did after reading Lance Armstrongs story. He will not only inspire you to be more active he'll make you see the value of trusting yourself, loyalty, and taking control of your life. Im not he fastest reader around but I read this book in one day! This book is a must for anyone who likes true stories of determination and inner strength winning against all odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What a story. This book is for everyone and anyone. Even non sports fans will love this."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before reading this book I knew that Lance Armstrong survived Cancer to win a bike race, how naive I was. First off, the Cancer was mostly in his brain and required an incredible surgery and a large amount of painful recovery. Secondly, the bike race was the Tour De France which is a 2,000+ mile race around the circumference of a nation. His tale is so much more than that of an athlete trying to complete a dream. This might sound cliche but this was a story about the power of the human spirit to overcome social, emotional and physical odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong was a strong, single, 25-year-old world-class athlete that was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October of 1996. It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life is his story. Through x-rays and severe symptoms, the doctors finally pinpointed his disease and Armstrong embarked on the most aggressive form of chemotherapy as soon as possible. Although being testicular cancer, it had metastasized through his entire body to even his lungs and brain. This man even underwent surgery before his chemotherapy treatments and afterwards. Before his treatments to remove the cancer his chemotherapy could not and afterwards to fix and smooth out complications brought up by the chemotherapy. You will have to read to find out what exactly those complications were. Even before his final chemotherapy treatment on December 13, 1996, Lance began to ride again, but this time for a different reason, for the love of it, not because it was his career. He even said, \\"it was something I had to do for pleasure--like poetry.\\" After Armstrong's grueling fourth cycle of chemotherapy he began to ride again and train. Yes, as a career, but with a new sense of passion and accomplishment. He had married a woman he had met one month after his treatments and went on to race in the Tour de France, which you all can guess the outcome. Lance was now a \\"record-breaking seven-time winner of the Tour de France, a cancer survivor, a husband, a father, a son,\\" and of course, \\"a Human being.\\"Although this book does not go into extreme details of how cancer forms and specifically testicular cancer, it does talk about the multi-cellular level and what stages this cancer undergoes. With this absence of information, the reader is able to concentrate on the emotional appeal brought up by the spreading of cancer, treatments and the overall affect of this great athlete's life. However, overall this book was extremely informative. It gave great experiential information and therefore a chance for the reader to understand the steps of a process such as cancer and how it affects the person who has it but the family and close friends as well. As the book progresses reader's began seeing cancer as monster, and questioning its reasons for taking over a man's life and why it would inhibit the natural ways of life such as marriage and reproduction. But as readers, we are triumphant over cancer just as Lance Armstrong was, because we are with him during this time, and through his description we are able to understand closer to what cancer truly is and how people overcome it, even when its at the most dangerous stage and the survival rate is only 3%. Anyone can read medical pages with boring facts, but to read this book is true meaning behind the word cancer.I personally have not had cancer, but I have had plenty of family members that have, including my cousin having testicular cancer. Although he overcame it in the early stages and before I was old enough to understand what was going on, this book really came me a true insight to a little of what he and other victims of this disease must go through if they want a chance at a normal life afterwards. Armstrong writes in an empathetic way, not only for himself but in a way that makes people want to help everyone in their own lives and societies. Lance Armstrong even did this himself by creating the Lance Armstrong Foundation which helps to research for cures and treatments for cancer. After reading this book, the word cancer has an entirely deep, empathetic, and different meaning."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A frank and honest portrait of one mans struggle. This is not a 'wow, aren't I great' book, but one that shows the awful journey people have to take and what gets them to \\"over come the odds\\".The achievement of the subject of this entertaining read is his amazing recovery from cancer which was followed shortly afterwards by spectacular sporting success. The book is undoubtedly compelling, and was simply, clearly and strikingly written.Even if you're not into cycling you will love this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The story of Lance Armstong's life up until 2001 will be a challenge to put down for even those who are not fans of cycling. This story unfolds as an enthralling voyage taken alongside one of the greatest athletes in history from his very low points facing apparent death by brain cancer to the high points of full recovery and winning the Tour de France.Lance is extremely strong willed, bold, determined, and presents a story for the ages with his first autobiography. His story is so compelling that I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a great book for his fears, fight, hope and established interest in cancer. It is an inspirational story for those with cancer as well as their friends, for information and support. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a little bit about the bike, but it is an excellent book to give hope to those with cancer to be cured and survive."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance's book was an inspiration to read from the stand point of overcoming obstacles and also remembering to stay passionate about your work. In his book, Lance portrays himself as the quintessential underdog, fighting against great odds to become somebody important, a goal that would materialize in the form of winning the largest bicycle race in the world seven times -consecutively.Lance seems to have the deck stacked against him with challenge after challenge in life. Each obstacle in itself seems like it'd be devastating to any normal person, but Lance tells how he used trials to build mental grit that would be required for the ultimate challenge -the Tour de France. He shows how he compartmentalized and attacked each problem using what he refers to as \\"a dumb focus\\", which is also the unique character trait that inevitably ushers Lance to the podium, stage after stage, and race after race.As I read his book, I thought it should be called \\"Racing from behind\\", not only because Lance started from behind in life as he portrays, but also because that is how he likes it, -racing from behind. I really think Lance enjoys positioning himself behind the leaders, where the pressure is off, where he can observe, calculate, strategize and plan his swooping attack to the finish line. No matter what Lance is doing in life, he always has his mind focused on some sort of finish line; that's where the performance really counts. It's a philosophy that while very successful at leading to victories in the most popular bicycle race, probably isn't the best approach for life in general.As enjoyable as it was to read about one of my personal heroes, it was sobering to realize that Lance is not as super human as I have made him out to be in my own mind. I will like to see a more complete picture of Lance Armstrong written at a later date reflecting a well rounded character, a little closer to the super human image I have built up of him."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this, yet i am not an athlete, nor do i know much about the sport of bikes.Cancer is the devil,and Lance doesn't back away from the ugliness of it.Yet, he survived it,and you can to.I have given this to 2 friends who had life threatening illnesses,and both said they loved it.Be good to yourself, and think positively! I think we can all benefit from that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"well worth a read although its a little disappointing to see that by the time i finished the book he had already left his wife (a long time before)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I love cycling, I love underdogs that come back to crush the competition, and I love how candid Lance was in this book. It tells almost everything about him, and the book even captures his cockeyness through the way he portrays himself. It's am emotionally moving book, and it is a must read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Its Not About the BikeI thought it was a pretty good book. I thought lance Armstrong's arrogance and egotistic views were a little much at times but it was a very emotional book, all about his hardship fighting cancer and how badly he wanted to survive. I thought the story about him going from a nobody to a legend interesting. The chemotherapy and Lance having to get surgery done had to have been really hard not only on him but also on his mom and all of his friends. All in all it was a good book it really opened my eyes on the hardship of cancer and how scary it would be to have to face it. I thought Lance was very persistent he was always in a good mood and ready for the next trial and tribulation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I liked the book, because the part about the cancer was interesting. At first i saw Lance Armstrong as some sort of superhuman. But after i read the book I saw him a normal guy. His description of chemo and the hospital stay was enlightening, but kind of scary. HE obviously has a lot of passion and that really comes through in the book. I found his arrogance somewhat refreshing for moments of comic relief when he was on the verge of death. I would recommend this book for someone who does not like sports books, but does like to be told and incredible story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Detail is reserved for the chemo and select personal highlights. Other than that the TDF is boiled down to a few chapters with scant detail and pre-cancer cycling is a prologue to the stages of cancer and its treatment. The story is compelling. Its a quick read. It lacks substance and good writing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Highly motivating story of one of the world's elite athletes who suffered cancer throughout his body, conquered the cancer, and came back to win the Tour de France, the most grueling, physically demanding sport event on Earth.

This book is about Lances diagnosis, his struggle to accept his new reality, the aftermath of living as a cancer survivor, and trying to have a baby using frozen sperm. Oh yeah, and also winning the Tour De France.I enjoyed the book because I like the \\"overcoming really bad odds and still becoming a champion\\" type of story. I do not cycle, unless you count the sporadic bikes rides with my kids. I was hoping the book would not be loaded with unrelatable stories and details about the bike, training, and the actual races, and luckily for me it wasn't.This book was a personal account of a serious athlete struck with cancer. It gets a little whiny in a few places, but I have to give him points for being honest. I am sure I would be whiny if I was struck down in my prime and had to endure the horrors of chemo and brain surgery.The writing is excellent and you can almost feel the rain hitting your face during his grueling training rides in the mountains of Europe. My legs are burning right now just thinking about sitting on a bike for 6-7 hours of non-stop riding. Wow.To me, this book left the message of be happy because it can all change fast. Enjoy what time I am given and try to forget about the small stuff. Its a great book with a great message."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The achievement of the subject of this entertaining read is his amazing recovery from cancer which was followed shortly afterwards by spectacular sporting success. The book is undoubtedly compelling, and was simply, clearly and strikingly written.Through the many flaws of this character portrayed in the story you learn that our heroes are actually human after all. But this is something we never seem to remember. What was critical was this man's drive to succeed, his confidence to ensure that he would beat the odds, and his determination to leave no stone unturned. As an athlete he had the potential to perform, and he captured the necessary requirements to make it happen.The story makes little reference to Lance's partner through his period of cancer, Lisa, which leaves a big gap in the story. I can only suppose this was out of respect to his wife at the time, Kik. However, we miss the chance to explore this important relationship.I can recommend this book, as a chance to learn something about a sporting hero. It's a good opportunity to learn some lessons of life, and the exposition of our lives' stories make for valuable education - for the stories of us mere mortals though they be just as valuable will never see the print on the pages of our books.I sincerely applaud Lance for his efforts on behalf of those affected by cancer. That is the key message of this story, and I hope that people do get the message, its not a book about cycling!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong makes you want to get on the bike yourself and try what he's done. Even after I read the book, I felt as though I'd just been through all of the races, being right up there with the almighty Lance. If you want to know about starting a bike career you should try this book. It explains about his emotions in life while speeding up and down the hills. He brings you in-depth, further than you could imagine, into his racing and personal life. It's quite a heroic book for road bikers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My son has recently been diagnosed with testicular cancer.I bought the book for him, and he reads it over and over again.It prepared him for the surgery and gave him the courage toseek tratment at the cancer ceter in Illinois.The book was open and honest and gave him the support and courageto face the future.

It has a lot of information about what testicular cancer is, and Lance Armstrong's life as a Tour de France racer. The message I got from this book is to never give up if things don't go your way. Lance just kept going and going, even when he had cancer and even when he got hit by a car. He just gets up and keeps riding and never gives up. This book also gives you a lot of information about bike racing and how the races work. I learned a lot about determination and what it takes to be the best. I give this book 4 stars because it is such an awesome book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was probably the best one that I've read in a while. The reality of what Armstrong went through and how he triumphed over it is an amazing story.

I was blown about the fact that after surviving cancer he was still able to win the tour de France. The details about his first encounter with cancer are very graphic. At first I was taken back about what he was explaining. I never knew what type of cancer he had until I read this book. He gives you a pretty detailed outline of each stage of testicular cancer. After reading this book, I concluded that if you don't give up hope and with determination there is always a chance to over come the hurdles in our lives. Overall, I would recommend this book and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who had to face cancer or any other hardship."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Absolutely the best attitude adjustment book I have ever read!It's about the yoga of bicycling: the union of body, mind and soul while riding a bike.

Lance Armstrong provides a heartfelt look at his amazing life, including his cycling feats (of course), growing up without a father, his illness, treatment, and recovery from cancer, his struggles to have a child (wife's vitro fertilization), and more. He outlines his triumphs and challenges, setbacks and victories in a compelling and interesting manner. I'm a martial artist not a cyclist and frankly have very little interest in the sport. Regardless, I could not help but be inspired by this fascinating book.Lawrence KaneAuthor of 'The Way of Kata' and 'Martial Arts Instruction'"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you think Lance is an awesome cyclist - you are correct.

And if you think you are having a bad day go back and reread this one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I myself have gone through a family crisis, quite similar to that of which the great Lance Armstrong endured. My uncle had testicular cancer and most of my family had been devastated. Although it wasn't life threatening, he had yet to be married and won't be able to have children. But I purchased this book for my uncle and it's inspired him to look beyond the cancer and lift himself up. He is no longer lying in his bed all day complaining about life. He reads this book with incredible attentiveness. Matter of fact, he's lying in the living room reading this and he doesn't know I am writing about him. I've read portions of this book and it is a great book to read on your off time. Very inspiring is all I can say and it will lift your spirits.I recommend this book to all even if you're not a fan of bike riding or the Tour de France. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was written very well and was an easy read. A very touching story of one man's struggle in life and a man growing up during a fight to survive a fatal disease.The 7th tour had just ended, with me watching every minute it was shown and the book just touched me even more after seeing the accomplishments Lance acheived after the struggles he was forced to face head on without a choice in the matter.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in cycling, Lance Armstrong or even someone who may not be especially a sports buff as I am. Because it was written with a definite story to tell and losing a parent to cancer as a young teenager, I could form an association with his fight for life and knowing the tour as well as I do, the visualization was easily obtained of the first win in the final chapter.Judy Trueblood (I was the one who ordered the book) but both of us read it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's an interesting,book fill with love,depresion,and hope,it's abaut a men that is an example for everyone.I love this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is highly recommended!

You'll learn about the horrors of cancer and the intricies of cycling. When I was reading the book I couldn't believe how horrible the cancer was and what that and the chemo did to his body. You'll also learn that cycling is much more than riding a bike and what really goes on in the races. I think anyone who reads this book will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike is the story of an up and coming star, cut down in his prime, only to return with more passion and fury than before. Lance Armstrong had just won the World Cycling Championships, and was receiving contracts from some of the biggest sporting companies in the world.Suddenly, he becomes aware of his body starting to give way on him. Concerned, he goes in for testing and is diagnosed with a severe form of Testicular Cancer. Within a few weeks he is undergoing intense chemotherapy, and left to reflect on his life thus far. He is faced with the realization that his life, if not over, might never be the same. His friends and mother stand by him through the entire ordeal, and after months of fighting, he is in remission.He struggles as he pieces together a new life, but meets his future wife, Kik, who helps him back on the bike. He doesn't perform like he had in the past, and drops out of the sport for a while. Kik, once again talks him back into riding. This time though, he was determined. He focused all of his energy into winning the Tour de France. He trained smarter, and lived healthier. He was no longer the overbearing and egotistical boy of his past. He was a man now, one with something to prove, to himself, and to those who said he was finished.He wins the Tour de France, but quickly changes his focus to the future. He wants to spread his story, and live a more complete life. He and Kik look to have a child. Lance's chemotherapy had made him sterile, and the process is long and hard trying to get Kik pregnant. It required multiples surgeries, countless needles, and a supply of Lance's banked sperm from before his fight with cancer. He later becomes a father to Luke Armstrong, and his life is reshaped.After all of Lance's success though, there is still some doubt among the cycling world. To put an end to the speculation, he again sets himself up with intense training to repeat as champion of the Tour de France. He, in a way only Lance Armstrong could, succeeds.It's Not About the Bike is a very well-written and personal story. It is very articulate, and in no way falls under the expectations of an athlete's autobiography. It does not bask in the glory of athletic achievements, nor does it try to leave the reader feeling as thought he athlete was immortal. The story takes the reader down a long hard road of Lance's life. He builds up his immortal status in the beginning, simply to shatter that thought in the reader's mind. It is a very well thought out, and crafted book. However, it does truly live up to its title. It focuses deeply on the feelings and motivations that surround Lance, rather then the actual actions that are taking place. Even in the two chapters of the book that are dedicated to him winning the Tour de France, they focus much more on his thought process then telling what happened. There was also a large amount of detail placed in his reminiscence of childhood. However, this same level of detail is not matched during more critical times in the book, such as the meeting of his wife, or birth of his son.Overall, the book is inspiring and personal. It leaves the reader with the feeling that they truly know Lance, and have a bond with him in some tiny way. It is an almost addicting book, and an absolute must read for anyone who's life has cancer surrounding it. It was a book made by Lance Armstrong the man, not the cyclist, and it carries a message for us all to take in."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Amazing, inspiring, even life changing. Every person should be required to read this book, if for no other reason than to appreciate life a little more and to gain some inspiration to accomplish those goals that just seem impossible. He made me feel nothing is impossible."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Sometimes, someone, writes a book &amp; it really inspires you. It's Not About the Bike does just that. This guy won the Tour De France, big deal or so what you may say? But winning the Tour de France after having cancer, unbelievable, incredible.

Me kid you not !!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have to write to this review because I thought it was an awesome book. Unlike the other reviewer from Miami who chose to review the person, not the book (hint, hint, read the &quot;reviewer guidelines&quot; next time, idiot!). In a world of negativity, it's terrific to read such a life inspiring book. And yes, even if the subject of the book decides to go Hollywood!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong writes with utter candor about his biking abilities, chemotherapy, growing up in Texas, and traveling Europe all with an equal ability to fascinate. An autobiography of a man who survived testicular cancer and won the Tour de France as well as many other races internationally Mr. Armstrong is able to do something that many people cannot when writing about their lives-delve into the minutiae of many areas of his or her life equally and take us with him.I hadn't expected to learn SO much about what makes this man tick but after reading the book I feel that he has written one of the best autobiographies or biography that I have ever read.Presented NOT in chronological order the style of the book works well because picking up the book we're thinking &quot;Lance Armstrong, Cancer Survivor&quot; but there is also much more to him. We feel the impact of some of the many people who have influenced Lance's life including his wonderful mother, many friends and one helluva nurse as well as the Doctors who treated him for a disease that would have killed most of us.He's right. It is in part about the bike and biking but mostly it's about so much more. It's about living and surviving and learning to appreciate life so much more completely that=n you ever though you would or could."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armostrong displays tremendous courage to recover from cancer and then go on to be a 4 time winner of the tour de france.

My brother was suffering from \\"Colon Cancer\\" and he'd always been SO Athletic all of his life? I wondereed HOW could this happen? Why? How can I help. He was quietly depressed.I saw this book and thought maybe he could relate and I just wanted him to know I cared. I only know...that from speaking to his son that he did read it. He talked about it. Talking and expessing your feelings is always a good thing. That is probably the first step in dealing with it. Talk about your feelings...let them out. Don't let them \\"fester\\" inside you.I think it's very safe to say that anyone who has any form of cancer...could relate.

I have recently started to enjoy cycling for exercise, and although I am not one for speeding down hill, I love the challenge of climbing up the hills. Anyway - she told me to read this book. Which I did. Although I generally knew the story, but getting the first hand account, and in so much detail of Lance Armstrong's illness, recovery and subsequent Tour De France wins (he talks about 2 in the book, but he actually won 7 altogether) was really enlightening!The intensely personal account, coupled with really interesting insights into how cycling races work was riveting. I stayed up way past my bedtime a few nights in a row to finish this easy to read, compelling book. This book shows how resilient the human body and spirit is."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The first of two of Lance Armstrong's books, It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life, is so inspirational. By all accounts of his battle with cancer it's amazing that he is alive today. I have marked pages so I can go back, re-read and receive a great dose of uplifting. It's amazing he is not only alive but living so well and energetically. He does more in any of his slack days that most people do in their most energetic days. He overcame adversity and international criticism to become the supreme athlete and human being that he is today. He's an example of how to live life to the fullest. As soon as I finished this book I had to order his second book Every Second Counts from Amazon. An amazing follow-up to the first book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just couldn't put this book down!A right riveting account of a champion's fight with cancer and the social and business relationships that were supportive and the one's that left him for dead.If you think you have insurmountable problems, wait till you get half way through this book!He not only conquered his bout with cancer but returned to professional bike championships and won the Tour De France, twice!now, that is 'true grit.'"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What it means to live...what it means to survive....what it means t thrive....this book is a testimonial to these thoughts!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A great story well narrated not boring not too dramatic not too optimistic of far fetched not romanced well balanced instructive near entertaining a great dose of conscious hope.happening to every body looking at how challenges can be over come in life more when it is about heath family work and sportBuy it it is good money spend for a great time lapse.you will end up empowered and not unshaken"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Armstrong's candid and inspiring story helped me every day through four months of surgeries, radiation, and chemotherapy. I recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who have decided to fight cancer. It is a guide book for courage and perseverance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong writes a touching memoir of his struggle through cancer in his self-proclaimed novel \\"It's not about the bike.\\" it doesn't take long to get absorbed into the dialogue included; I immediately became entranced with Lance's story and how he had accomplished so much, to only learn that he could possibly die from testicular cancer. I've personally never became accustomed to the art of cycling, but the grueling measures and long hours that bikers must pursue, make it one of the hardest sports known to man. Despite that, Lance went on to win the hardest race, the Tour de France, not once, but six times. He had quickly become an international superstar, and had all the fortune he had ever dreamed of. However, I felt the biggest point that he wanted to make was that cancer can happen to anyone, even the most privelaged and talented of people.One of the best aspects of the book was the simple diction. It made it one of the quickest reads I've come across, but also depicts what it is like to be battling cancer. Cancer is not an easy concept to understand by any means, as I quickly learned in AP Biology, but Lance is able to put his situation in better perspective to those that haven't taken such a challenging course. Cancer information needs to be spread to the general public, and awareness needs to be spread to all so that hopefully cases can be prevented. Knowledge is our biggest advantage over the fight against cancer.Just as Lance ignored all of his symptoms, telling himself it was simply a sore or bruise from riding, many cancer cases are not able to be cured because people ignore their warning signs. His life could have ended any time during his illness, but he ended up getting top-notch help to cure him, along with a few miracles and prayers. Cancer is very real and a large part of our modern society, and people need to start treating it like it is. Don't wait to go to the doctor of you're suspicious, go right away. If Lance wouldn't have been so determined and lucky, we may not have been able to experience one of the world's best cyclist."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Two years ago after being diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer, an RN friend recommended I read this book by Lance Armstrong. My first reaction was that I didn't even like riding bikes, why would I read about him at a time like this!I understand, now. Lance's journey through cancer was amazing and encouraging to say the least. His honesty and forthright attitude about himself and the disease was comforting and very encouraging to me. I admire his courage and found his recovery to be a true miracle. If he did it, so can I. Subsequently I've recommended the book to several fellow \\"survivors\\" and now this book was sent to a very dear friend just diagnosed with cancer in her lungs, brain and bones, in hopes Lance will inspire yet another cancer patient to fight the fight and join the \\"survivor's club\\". I highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I love autobiographies and this was a great one. I'm not a cyclist or athlete either."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is by far one of the best books i have ever read. Lance Armstrong is the best role model any kid could have after seeing all that he has gone through. As shown through his autobiography it is definately clear that it's not about the bike. An amazing and inspiration story!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was a huge inspiration to me. What I got from this book was: no matter what struggle I go through in life, I can always overcome it. Not only was this book a huge inspiration, but it was a great read. It gave tons of information about his life experiences, and his fight through cancer. I thought his story about how he became a cyclist was extremely interesting, and his accomplishments of being an American rider in European countries. This book did a great job of explaining why he was a cyclist, and how the pain pushed him to try harder and be the best. Its extremely hard for an American to be a succesful rider in European cycling, but Lance made it sound easy. I highly recommend reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I truly appreciated the intense honesty with which Armstrong shared the darkest days of his life as a near terminal cancer patient (with a 3% chance of survival).Be forewarned that at times the story is very tough to read, and that nothing is left for the reader to mentally conjur up regarding not only Armstrong's battle with cancer, but even artificial insemination.I was not a cycling fan before I read this book, but I became a Lance Armstrong fan about 20 pages into this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In this book, Lance Armstrong opens up and lets the reader really feel what he felt. Personally, I was never a fan of reading, but I am currently reading this book for the 5th time in the past year. It truly changed my life and the way I feel about life and illness. Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was by far one of the best books I've ever read. It is very inspirational, and proves the fact that absolutely no one is invincible. It moves very quickly for a biography, and it allows you to relate to the author and his problems. Pick this one up if you can."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Never I've heard of a celebrity discuss his negative sides also in such a detail. He never hides the fact that he, too, was really afraid that he'd die because of cancer. It may be an obvious fact, but how many of the so called &quot;celebrities&quot; are willing to accept their weakness? Though the author blatantly criticizes those who were unsupportive during crisis periods, he heartily remembers everyone who have played a major role in moulding him as a person. This is very rare to see even in ordinary guys, leave alone a person of world fame.One thing this book teaches is that even the people who have made it big are still human beings with all kinds of joy, sorrow, weakness and other countless emotions. It instills belief in the reader. After reading it, I feel life is a great gift and make it truly joyful for myself and others in the world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Anyone who's remotely interested in leisure reading should make a bee-line for It's Not About The Bike. Along w/ Sally Jenkins, Armstrong paints us a picture of his life starting as an angst-filled up and coming athlete to his cancer diagnosis to his physical and mental battles and finally to his first Tour de France victory.The book is funny, candid, action packed, and truly moving. I mowed through its 270 or so pages in one evening. I couldn't put it down. When he described the searing pain of chemotherapy, I winced. When he talked about the thrills of hurtling down the Alps at 70 mph, my eyes widened. Lance exposes himself not as a hipper than thou athlete, but a regular human being humbled by life itself. He's blunt, but not preachy. Funny a lot of the times, but serious when need be. And he never forgot his roots.I can see why people drew such inspiration from Lance by reading his book. When you've been to the very brink of death, a place where the odds are crushed against you, and then you come all the way back to not only beat cancer, but also develop into the best athlete in your sport, you can't explain it. Instead, you just hope. You fight. And even if you don't make it, at least you get to go out in a blaze of glory. Lance gives hope to people who have none, because as bad as they think they're in for, he's been in worse--and he beat it.Read the first few pages of it here at Amazon.com. If you're not drawn in by the time you're done, you have no soul."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong, whose basic story will be well known by nearly anyone who picks up this book, surpised me. I of couse knew that he was a multiple winner of the Tour de France and had conquered cancer, but this story delves much deeper into the incredible hurdles that faced him in both situations. His honesty about the disease, his relationships and the consequences of cancer (sterility and a failed romance most notably) was refreshing and made this story much more immediate and moving then I had expected. It also made him much more real and seem more amazing then I already imagined him to be. Of course, this is a biography and Armstrong has a healthy ego to begin with, so it is of course biased in his favor, but at no point did that lessen my appreciation for what he has suffered through or accomplished.This book is not very well written (though there is nothing wrong with it at all, in fact it is very easy, quick reading) and it is a bit self serving at times, but its message of hope and can-do spirit is inspiring. I respect Lance Armstrong a great deal after reading this book and appreciate what he'd done more then ever before. I think everyone will appreciate this book and get something from it, whether you are a biking fan, a cancer survivor, an endurance athlete looking for motivation or someone who is interested in pop culture and notable people. It is a very well presented story and does not require much time or effort to complete."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After reading Lance's book, I felt I could accomplish anything if I set my mind to it. Lance is an incredible athlete, although, this book reveals the humanness of Lance. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 16. If it weren't for the bad language and other negative parts, I would recommend it to anyone. I learned much about Lance, the Race, life and even childbirth from this book. You will too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like the title says this books is not (all) about the bike. Since you probably know the story, I won't rehash it here. I'll simply repeat that it is an unbelievable story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not the most avid reader, but I like biographies of sports &quot;Heroes.&quot; This book is in fact the best I have read. The story flows well chronologically and tells a truely heartfelt story of overcoming struggles. The action vs. emotion is very well done. It is not about the bike and I could not put it down. AWESOME!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excellent ! If cancer were to strike us ..could we handle it as well as Lance did ? Before reading this book I had doubt ! when I finished reading its not about the bike ...and jumped on my bike the hills of the road had now become my medicine ."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in honest courage. The Tour De France has been called the most grueling of all athletic events and Lance Armstrong's comeback is argueably the greatest in all of sport. I could not put this book down. I bought several books for friends."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I never really took the sport of cycling too seriously until I started riding myself. Now I look at it in a different light. These athletes have strength and stamina I only dream I will one day achieve. But in Lance, the strength and stamina is multiplied by 1,000. I have read many biographies and auto bios; this one is without a doubt the most touching, sincere, and thought provoking book I have ever read. In at least three different points of the book, I cried (a feat that can only be done by a song or a movie for me and being a guy). First, when he found out he had cancer, he wondered if is was going to ride again (not live). Secondly when he came out of surgery, he asked for his mom. Thirdly, when he visited a very young cancer patient, after Lance won the Tour de France, and the child asked him for the box of cereal with his picture on it. &quot;Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day.&quot; Lance makes us believe in the human spirit and the belief that we can beat anything. Nothing is greater than the spirit; and Lance helped me find it again. Lance is the GREASTEST AMERICAN HERO; and a hero to me."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a cancer survivor, I was told this book was inspirational and 'not about the bike'. I was disappointed- because it is about the bike and the huge ego of the rider. Yes, his fight was amazing and his Foundation is a thing of beauty for all survivors - but the book was too much cycle for me. It's also hard to read about his commitment to his family - written before the divorce and multiple girlfriends. Some of his experiences with the medical profession, made it worthwhile for me."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike; My Journey Back To Life, written by Lance Armstrong himself, was an incredible book. Lance Armstrong had to overcome many hardships in his life. Cancer being the key element. I could not imagine living life through all the bicycle pain, then, on top of that, having cancer. I don't think I could endure the bicycle pain, alone. He had to deal with a lot of it during his races. He had to live through so much pain before he got cancer. It is amazing how he battled through it. He said that cancer has changed his life, and I agree. He said it was the best thing that had ever happened to him. I was confused. How could cancer make you happy? BUt I realized soon what he was talking about. His attitude changed dramatically after he had cancer. He found joy and triumph that he couldn't find in any bicycle race. He knows he was lucky to have survived cancer, because most people don't. I think that from this book anyone can realize that you should take life for granted and appreciate all the things you have. It was not only a great book, but a great story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Sure, Armstrong is a walking (riding) miracle, and his book is an interesting story. However, I certainly didn't like the Lance Armstrong that was described in the book. This man is totally egocentric, self absorbed and lacking in appreciation for what he has and for those around him. He has three great achievements: beating cancer, staging a great comeback, and becoming one of the best bike racers in history. I give him credit for the last one. As for beating cancer, his doctors did that. His wealth and celebrity status got him those, along with financial help from sponsors he later trashes. As for his comeback, he quit in the middle of it. His business manager, his wife and some friends gave him the will to persevere. It wasn't him. He loses his temper at innocent people, makes unreasonable demands of his wife, friends and sponsors, and shows no remorse whatsoever. It's a shame that so few people can maintain humility and a perspective when they become celebrities."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When you feel death is around the corner, because you are suffering a fatal sickness, you really must be experiencing a lot of transformation, feelings you have to deal with, from love to hate. LANCE who was a professional bike rider, many time winner in different circumstances of his life, a strong body, is facing the greatest challenge in his entire existence; running against his more dangerous rival CANCER.This book shows us, how a human being can fight against any obstacles, no matter how difficult they are. Love played a strong role in his cure, in which his family, friends and doctors were involved, even if his real love was to ride a bike and to be the best professional cyclist in the world. When this fatal disease came to his life, he realized that life is not only a bike-It has many other ingredients such us children, wife, the beautiful world beside the bike.I compare Lance's stages of life with the different bike races in which he has participated,--because in both he is supposed to show self determination, courage, endurance and how to work together in order to get his goal."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's auto-biography with Sally Jenkins, It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, is an inspirational story anybody could enjoy. In It's Not Aboutthe Bike, Lance Armstrong is a hero for anyone to look up to, since not only is he an amazing world renowned cyclist, he is also a normal person, who was forced to overcome many hardships to prove his heroism. I think the title itself symbolizes theproblems Lance was forced to go through, and the hardwork heused to overcome them because it states that it was his strength and ability that got him through, not the equipment or luck he had. Since he was forced to grow up fatherless in a lower classfamily, had to endure going through cancer while at the peak of his career, and then fought his way through recovery to becoming the great cycling entity he was before, he was well tried before finally accomplishing dreams like winning the Tour De Francethree times in a row and ever even being able to perform again in his career of cycling at all.Lance Armstrong at first sight would seem like a very privileged man for all of his accomplishments and his amazing strength and physical ability, but that wouldn't be true.Lance grows up in a poor family with just him and his part time working mother after his father left him at a very early age. Along with school, Lance was forced to work at a country club to keep bringing money into the family, along with his mothers income from her two part time jobs. Lance owes much of his life lessons to his mother, since she worked two part time jobs, still went to school and studied, and took care of her sonwhile he was growing up. Lance grew up cycling in the small amount of spare time he had, working very hard and training on his own. Lucky for him, he lived near the local bike shop, and soon became friends with the owner, Jim Hoyt, who would later help him to get into races and purchase bike equipment. Even though he did not have the best living situation, along with hard work and a little luck, Lance was able to start ridingearly, and eventually was noticed as a natural athlete, especially at endurance.Cancer is a problem not many have experienced, so not many know the pain and suffering it causes, especially on a person who's career is based on athleticism. At thetime before his diagnosis, Lance had just broken into the rank of one of the top five cyclists in the world. Lance Armstrong's case of cancer was a severe form of testicular cancer which was diagnosed extremely late and spread quickly into his lungs and brain. To fight through the cancer, Lance has to undergo serious and painful chemotherapy along with many surgeries. Continually Lance repeats the phrase \\"You have to fight\\" in his book and it is a strong belief of his. He says that if he wouldn't have fought and been optimistic, he would not have survived. Armstrong never gives up, even though the doctors tell him his chances are less than 50% and that his career is almost definitely over. Lance shows strength and bravery all through his cancer episode and throughout his life, since it is one of his most possessed traits.Armstrong claims that the time after his cancer went into remission was worse than when he still had cancer in his body and he was undergoing painful chemotherapy.When cancer goes into remission, there is nothing patients can do except wait to see if it returns, and once it returns, there is basically no way to treat it and it is a death sentence.During remission, Lance found extreme pain and psychological problems, because he knew he had no power over treating the problem. This problem test's not only Armstrong's bravery and strength, but his wit also. While he is waiting in his first year of remission, he starts training again, and attempts to get back into his life. He does so with the help of his friends and his newly-wed wife. This trial tests another of Lance's traits,wit, proving his ability finally as a hero, and allowing him to win.Lance Armstrong's auto-biography is a brilliant story. With the help of Sally Jenkins, the writing in the book keeps the reader hooked, talking about cycling, the disease of cancer, the problems faced by everyday person and how Lance overcame them. It's a complete cover of life, and shows everybody that anything can be accomplished, if your strong and willed. Lance Armstrong fought and beat many problems, and passedthem all to win himself hero status, by finally winning the Tour De France. The story of Lance's life can be enjoyed by a cycling enthusiast, cancer survivor, or the everyday person looking for a good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's a good story but written a bit too much like a movie and also sounds like a 3rd grader wrote it. I liked his struggles and triumphs. Sucks it's somewhat of a lie now..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book is about his early promise as a great cyclist in a sport that is not well-known or admired in his home country, the US, his affliction with cancer by the time he was 25, his recovery and subsequent stunning and courageous comeback as a champion cyclist to win the most gruelling of all endurance sports - the Tour de France. Along the way he writes about his mother who loves him and stands by him all along, his many many friends who stand by him during his illness and comeback and also about Kik, his wife who gives him everything without so much as asking a question or voicing a complaint. There are also the many specialist oncologists to whom he owes his cure and a special nurse - La Trice - who comes off as a very special person.The book brings to life the many nuances and dangers and thrills of a gruelling race like the Tour de France. In his writing, you can feel the thrill of a bike racing down the Alps and the Pyrennes at more than a hundred kilometres an hour and its associated dangers to the cyclist. One can feel the viciousness of the French press in trying to discredit him by accusing him of using performance-enhancing drugs during his stunning victory in 1999. One can get a grasp of how cycling is a team sport and how much a winner like Lance Armstrong is possible only because of the sacrifices of other cyclists in the team in providing the best possible conditions for their prime rider to win. One can feel how much he loves his mom, wife and friends. He also brings out vividly the intensity of 'feeling ill with cancer', the pain of chemotherapy and the uncertainities of survival after the illness and the cure.However, there are a few tedious and jarring notes in the book as well. His elaborate paragraphs about his wedding and the birth of his baby are of interest only to him but writes about it as though his experience in this domain is so unique. I also wish he hadn't portrayed himself as one who had it hard and made it to the top in spite of his background.He rants against the French firm Cofidis for wanting to renegotiatehis contract once he was down with cancer. Unlike most people in their lives, he had a mother,a wife and friends who have all been very loyal and supportive of him ina self-sacrificing manner. He had Nike stand by him thru thick andthin. He had the CEO of of some big firm threaten the insurancecompany that he will take his business elsewhere if they don't coverthe costs of his cancer treatment. His friend Bill Stapleton stayedwith him in spite of his unfair complaints about Bill not doing hisbit as his 'agent'. And he had endorsements running into millions. Butin spite of all this, he can't handle one company wanting to keeptheir relationship as 'business first'. Most people in much poorercountries accomplish as much without having any of these supportingstructures.All in all, it is a very good book to read and should give everyone hope that one must keep trying in spite of being afflicted with a deadly disease such as cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book will motivate you no matter who you are or waht you do.

It was a gift for my brother who has cancer and I thought he would enjoy reading about Lance Armstrong's struggle."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was truly fascinated with this book, and for different reasons. I went in to this one knowing only that Armstrong won the Tour de France a gazillion times and that he survived cancer. With every turn of the page I was fascinated with the life that he had lived to that point.What blew me away the most was learning that he was a world class athlete before he was diagnosed with cancer and that he hadn't even competed often or well in the Tour de France at that point. We see a string of podium finishes and a lucrative career, but for the most part Lance was an unknown quantity in the United States. So Lance had to build his story. Learning that he was a great runner and swimmer as well surprised me, and to learn that he was placing against grown adults when he was 16 took me back. You read about child prodigies but I certainly didn't think Lance was one. Then the meat of the story: cancer. The title of his autobiography says it all. The bulk of the book focuses on his bout with cancer and what it did to his life before, during and after. This is what made Lance into the person that he is today.He was literally broken down and torn apart. This was another great aspect of this biography because he was able to shed light on cancer, something most people don't know about, myself included, and to make people aware of what not only he went through but what other cancer patients were going through as well. This was the eye opening part and, in fact, was what I most interested in reading about once I got in to it. I mean I really enjoyed reading his day by day account of his first Tour de France victory, but his story was much more captivating as you read about him struggling against impossible odds.This bio is certainly \\"Not About the Bike\\" and is more about cancer and what it did to him. The main focus certainly kept my interest and book ending it with his riding career made this bio a nice and polished account of an accomplished man. A definite recommend, for the cancer experience more than his biking credentials.5 stars."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am an 18 year breast cancer survivor.

Every oncologist should read and recommend this book. Every family member there to support a cancer patient should read this book. Every mother should read this book. Every wife should read this book. His struggles and battles are mine and yours. His fears and shortcomings you will relate to. The best part of this book is the rise to hope as you experience his physical shortcomings in his remission. His fear of cancer returning is honest. My only wish is that I could get a signed copy for my oncologist. His physical and emotional battles you will relate to.Alice DollarhideSan Bernardino, CA"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a big Lance fan so it's no surprise that I loved this book. However, I was surprised at how good the writing is and how well the story flows. Very remarkable story.

Definitely recommended for people who want to read about a true champion and a cancer survivor."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have read over 300 bios.

WellsI was finally able to get around to reading this book. It has been on my to-read list for a long time now. I considered not reading this thinking it may be outdated since he has gone on to win The Tour de France six more times since it was published; however, I am glad I did.There are basically two parts to the book: his racing and what it takes to win, and his fight with cancer. I learned quite a bit about the Tour, about cancer and chemo, and even about in-vitro fertilization.I thought the book was well written and easy to read but I can't help wondering how much was Lance and how much was Sally Jenkins, the co-writer. Makes me wish I would have paid more attention to the sport while he was still actively racing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an inspirational book, it is a must for any cyclist, cancer survivor, anybody who wants to get inside the head of a world class athlete who came from humble beginnings."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A great look into the life of one of our greatest athletes. It was strange though having him talk about being a good husband..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was much better written than many celebrity autobiographies, and provides a compelling view into the struggle required to overcome cancer. We begin with Lance's somewhat troubled childhood and his early successes on the bicycle before we delve into the real meat of this book, his fight against the cancer that almost took his life. Armstrong is quite candid about personality flaws and early bad behaviour, which provides an air of honesty that makes this book all the more powerful. His comeback to the pinacle of the bicycle racing world is truly remarkable, but given his personality, perhaps it shouldn't surprise us as much as it does. Here is a remarkable athlete, and a man who appreciates the second chance he's been given. A truly inspirational and enlightening book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a former and current cancer survivor (I am currently going through my second bout with cancer)and having lost my mother to cancer I can relate to Lance's experience with this dreaded disease. His childhood memories of him and his mom parallel some of mine. The father that wasn't there, having mom take all the responsibilities of raising a child and then marrying someone whom you really didn't care for. That also happened to me. I escaped that by joining the Navy and making a career out of it. But back to the book, chapter five \\"Conversations with cancer\\" puts it all in perspective for anyone battling cancer or having a family member or friend suffering from cancer. He puts it best on page 113 and I quote \\"Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day. And it will beat you. I didn't fully see, until the cancer, how we fight every day against the creeping negatives of the world, how we struggle daily against the slow lapping of cynicism. Dispiritedness and disappointment, these were the real perils of life, not some sudden illness or cataclysmic millennium doomsday. I knew now why people fear cancer: because it is a slow and inevitable death, it IS the very definition of cynicism and loss of spirit. So, I believed.\\" That pretty much says it all."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I usually do not read biographies written by people (mainly athletes) with less than 30 years-old. It's simply arrogant, selfish, preponderous to write a \\"biography\\" when you barely began to live, when youhave not even (in most cases) become a mature and complete person.But, in this case, I allowed myself to break my own rules, because in reading Lance's biography I could win two games: I would know a lot more about a great champion's routine and history, and at the same time I would know a lot more about batlles against cancer, that damned adversary that takes so many of us out of this world.That said, I must saythis is a great book. The \\"real\\" writer, Sally Jenkins, did a very good job, and the book is almost a page-turner (exception being the boring, VERY boring chapter about in vitro fertilization... ugh..!). Also, since the book was written in 2001, you should not take into consideration about a lot fo the wonderful things writeen about his marriage and his wife, since in 2003 they were already divorced.A good book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like many others have said here, this is a book about triumph over hardship, the battle fought against an adversary like no other-cancer. While reading this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"Lance Armstrong was a jerk.\\" But, then you can almost see him grow and mature as the stroy unfolds, you can see the bitter battle he fought and won.I am a fiction lover at heart, but this book drew me in and held my attention. I consider myself an athlete, but what Armstrong went through pushes the envelope of human endurance. Read this book, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike\\" is mostly not about the bike. Lance Armstrong spends the better part of his book talking about his fight against cancer and how it changed him as a person and as a professional cyclist. It's easy to get swept up in Lance-mania, hearing the guy describe his awful experiences with his illness and his improbable return to athletic greatness.Despite the catchy title, the bike really does matter. Cycling is so central to Armstrong's life that his bicycle is always with him. He sees it as part of his treatment, whether riding between chemo treatments, or discussing the nuances of bike parts with his nurse. Just as interesting are descriptions of key races that he competed in both before and after falling ill. You'll feel like a real dweeb when you learn all of that cycling vocabulary, particularly if you use it around the office. You may also take a keener interest in next summer's Tour de France, whether or not Lance is there to compete.The book's key weakness is that it's tough to reconcile Lance's personal life with how he describes himself in the book. He barely pays lip service to an erstwhile girlfriend who was with him during his battle with cancer, but he fawns incessantly over his now divorced first wife Kristin. Sheryl hadn't shown up yet. Oh well, that's the elephant in the room so it had to be mentioned. But don't let that stop you from reading this book. It's a good read and it'll give you a profound respect for those who have battled and survived cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Keep RidingBy: Lance ArmstrongLance Armstrong is the best bicyclist in the world. I chose to read this memoir because I've heard of Lance's survivorship from cancer. Lance grew up loving the sport of riding fast on a bike. When he got older and more experienced, he became one of the legends in cycling.Lance had a tough childhood while growing up. His birth father, whose name was Gunderson, divorced his mother when Lance was only two years old. Then after they moved, they lived across the street from Richardson Bike Mart. His mom (Linda) got a deal from the owner (Jim Hoyt) and Lance got his first bike. At the same time came a new step dad for Lance named Terry Armstrong. Lance became very good at riding a bike and also at swimming, so when he saw a flyer for a triathlon he went and tried and won. Terry Armstrong didn't last very long as Lance's stepfather, because when he and Lance were going to one of his triathlons, he was secretly writing to another woman. So not long after it was just Lance and his mom. Meanwhile Lance was beginning to excel in cycling winning triathlon after triathlon. He was also earning prize money along the way and then he bought a car. Then in one of the bike races Lance got in a fight, and Jim Hoyt, his sponsor, got so angry that he took his car away. So Lance skipped town and joined the U.S. National cycling team. Lance was winning a lot of races and training and racing in Europe. Then when Lance was at the high point of his career his life fell apart- he found out that he had testicular cancer. In his mind Lance thought he would die but luckily there was a doctor in Indianapolis that treated his kind of cancer. It was Dr. Nichols, and first Lance started taking sessions of Chemotherapy. After eating healthy, and with more sessions with chemo and drugs, Lance and the doctors thought he was cured, but there was still a chance the cancer could come back. It did not, so Lance started his rehabilitation. To show his thanks to his doctors, he hosted a fundraiser: The Ride of the Roses. There he met Kik, his future wife. He started cycling again and slowly worked his way up to the point to where he could race again. So he went to the Tour de France, one of the most grueling races of cycling, but few people believed in Lance. Lance showed everyone that he had made it back by winning the Tour de France. After he won this race, he became a father, when Kik had their son Luke. Lance talks about picking Luke up from his crib and when Luke cries and kicks, Lance whispers to him \\"Yeah, that's right, go on\\", meaning that he should try hard to make it in life, whatever it takes.When he rebounded from cancer Lance was determined to accomplish one of his goals, to win the Tour De France. Lance was in shock when he first got cancer and he almost fainted when he heard the odds of him living. Lance took cancer seriously, not breaking any rules and taking his medicine. He said, \\"Let's kill this stuff. Whatever it takes, let's do it.\\" That quote says that Lance just wanted to be well, no matter how painful or difficult the treatment.When Lance Armstrong walked out of that hospital he was in remission from his cancer.Lance showed that some people survive cancer and can continue with what they began before being diagnosed with cancer. He learned a lot about cancer and how it takes a lot of hard work from dedicated doctors to treat it. But sometimes that doesn't work and the cancer kills them. He also learned that you have to believe in yourself and to not give up something that you have always dreamed about. I learned that you always have to believe that you must try your best. I have some uncles and aunts and friends with cancer, and I hope they will keep fighting."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong survived Testicular cancer, and had less than 3% chance of living, and post-cancer won two Tour De France Champion titles for two years in a row. This man is a hero. I am not the only one to say it as well. There are over 100, 000 thousand spectators at each stage of the Tour de France, and 75% of them are there to see him. I have seen him before, racing down the hill and it is unbelievable to think how he survived. I always wanted to learn more about the American Champion who wins so many years in a row. This was my opportunity to read about one man who is a true American hero.Lance Armstrong was born and raised in Plano, Texas by his single mother Linda, who was seventeen when she gave birth. In Lance's last year of high school he was invited to join the US National Cycling team which train for the Olympics. After participating in many aces with his team he decided to turn Professional. He signed a contract with Cofidis, a French racing sponsor. His first race was the San Sebastian Classic. Unfortunately the day of the race it was cold and foggy, it is the worst condition to ride in race. It is a day long but you go up and down many hills. He arrived in last place, because he was so uncomfortable with the conditions. He continued riding and won first place in The Tour Du Pont in 1996, which ranked him as number one cyclist in the world. He then raced in the Tour De France but dropped out because he could no longer continue. That year in October he found out he was diagnosed with Testicular cancer.He was feeling a lot of pain in his left testicle, but thought it was only normal because of biking. Until one night he started to cough up blood. He had a neighbor who was a doctor and contacted him immediately. His neighbor made him an appointment to go and see a doctor that night. The doctor had to take x-rays and did a very thorough exam. Lance didn't understand why they were testing so much. After all the evaluating was done the doctor told lance that he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and it had already spread throughout the body; most importantly the lungs and the brain.The doctor had already made an appointment for his testicle to be removed and for them to bank sperm cells. After his surgery he said, \\"I spent the rest of the weekend on the couch recovering from the surgery, the anesthesia made me woozy, and the incision was excruciating (pg.84).\\" He had support from his mother and all his friends. His main concern was that he wouldn't be able to get back on the bike, and that his career was over. Lance immediately started searching for ways to cure his disease. The best play for him to go was where the first cure of testicular cancer was discovered, Indiana University School of Medicine.The two surgeons who were to help him were Dr. Scott Shapiro and Greg Nichols. They had a plan for Lance so he could still go back on the bike afterwards. Lance and his mother were surprised to hear that because everywhere else they went, they were telling Lance they had to use chemo that would destroy his lungs, which meant good bye biking. The plan would be more to fit Lance. They would have to give him certain type of Chemo and a brain surgery to remove 2 lesions in his brain.Lance was strong throughout the whole process and wanted the cancer to go away more than anything. When his brain surgery came he was scared because where the lesions were located, could be a tricky spot and were near the vision field and the part of his brain that controlled balance, so if Dr. Sharipo messed up, he could loose his sight and his balance.He woke up from his surgery alive, and he could still see. He was relieved that the surgery went well. After the brain surgery he had to go through chemotherapy. He had cycles and would have it injected in his body 5 days a week. LaTrice Haney was the nurse who would inject it into his body. Everyday Lance would ask LaTrice questions, at first about what was going into his body, then if he was going to live and as well about everything else. Lance describes LaTrice as an angel.Chemotherapy wasn't exactly a party to Lance. He would suffer from nauseas, vomiting, and weird looking spots on his body. He said it was a lot worse than climbing up an Alp during a stage of the Tour de France. After his long treatment of several months, the doctors said his cancer was gone. Sadly there was still chance of it coming back so Lance would have to watch out. The doctors would continue to check up on Lance throughout the year, but his blood tests only proved to be better and better. After one year since he was diagnosed, Lance was cancer free.Post cancer Lance decided to start a foundation, The Lance Armstrong Foundation. Their first event was called Ride for the Roses, it has now become and annual event since 1997. As Lance was organizing this event he met Kristin Richard, better known as Kik (Keek). At first Kik and Lance were only friends but several moths later they started dating each other and decided to get married. They were very in love.Lance decided to start to train on his bike again. His goal was to win Le Tour De France. They moved to the south of France in a city called Nice (Pronounced Niece). At first Lance was having a hard time getting back on the bike. So he gave up and they moved back to Texas. Kik was very supportive and left Nice, even though she had a difficult time. When they moved back to Texas Lance became a TV Bum. He stayed at home doing nothing and eating Mexican.Kik finally convinced him and said to him you should stop wasting your time and mine because I am bored to. If you really love biking, go back to the bike. Lance and Kik moved back to France and Lance began his crucial training for Le Tour De France. He practiced every day with his U.S. Postal Team, because Cofidis ended his contract because Lance was ill. He pushed his limits everyday, practicing all the routes he would be doing in the stages.When the race finally came he was prepared. He was not a favorite to win. No one thought he could win because he had just gotten over cancer. But deep down inside Lance knew he could do. This is what he has been training for. In the Prologue race you each go once at a time. It is more like a time trial. Whatever place you get is the place you start out with in the ranking during the tour.When Lance went he zoomed through. He described his experience, \\"I was pushing to hard, not realizing it. I sat down, and focused on the execution and on the science and technique of the ride (pg. 231).\\" He finished that stage at 1st. Place. He had one the maillot jeune (Yellow Jersey) for the first time in his career. He had called Kik to share his happiness. \\"All I hear on the other end of the line was \`Oh my god, Oh my god, Oh my god!' and she burst into tears (pg. 231,232).\\"Lance continued to win throughout the stages. At the end he had won, overall, best time out of all the other cyclists and wowed the audience. News reporters went crazy. Nobody could believe that Lance had won, he just survived cancer. It was a true miracle and it proves how hard somebody works to follow their dreams, no matter what gets in their way!Kik and Lance had a baby boy a year later. They had to go through a long process in order to have the baby, because Lance's sperms were in a bank and frozen. After a long process though they were able to conceived a boy named David Luke Armstrong.Lance discovers that the hardest event he had to go through was cancer, and if he had to choose over cancer and winning the Tour De France he would pick cancer. \\"If you ask me to choose between the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer. Odd as it sounds I would rather have the title of cancer survivor than winning of the Tour, because of what it has done foe me as a human being, a man, a husband, a son, and a father (pg. 265).\\" Because of cancer Lance learned not to take advantage of life, all he did was wanted to win and didn't respect other cyclists. He didn't realize how many people died every day of cancer. Lance learned not care about how much money he has or what car he drives, but to care about whom he is and that's what he needed to find in himself."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Daniel Dupon9/ 30 /05Period 4Keep RidingBy: Lance ArmstrongLance Armstrong is the best bicyclist in the world.

Lance reveals his childhood -- including his struggles as a swimmer and his wild antics -- the rejection he experienced, his triumphs, his battle with cancer, and his relationships with two very special ladies -- his mother, and his wife. The photos are fantastic; like the text, they portray the very human side of a champion. I highly recommend this book to everyone -- and most especially to athletes and cancer patients.-- Graciela Sholander, http://dreamitdoit.net"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I live in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. I do some Olympic-distance triathlons (in other words, small potatoes). The bike training I do would be considered a ride around the neighborhood by Lance Armstrong. I read this just before a hospital visit for surgery. I have a couple of friends who are cynical enough to announce that to be such a champion in the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong uses drugs stronger than aspirin. This is the same kind of thinking which inspired the idea that the 1969 moon landing was a hoax created for television. Doesn't anyone believe in greatness anymore?This book is enough to make you go back to church and renew your belief in a higher power. Lance tells it like it happened and he leaves little out. He talks about his upbringing, his initiation into the cycling world, his first races, his arrogance, his discovery that he had cancer, his experience with treatment and medical personnel, the reactions of the cycling world and of his sponsors, meeting his future wife, his first child and his winning of the Tour de France. It's a long road to cover and it never flags for one second. No wonder it won Sports Book of the Year for 2000. This book is so compelling I bet it Mr. Armstrong didn't relax until he finished it.When Lance Armstrong talks about his cancer nurse LaTrice who said to him \\"I hope someday to be just a figment of your imagination,\\" I was deeply moved. I'll be watching the Tour de France in 2004. I won\`t miss a day. And guess who I'm rooting for?!

Yes, I am one of those people who didn't know who he was until then. This year, while he was after win #5, I thought I would pick up this book and hear his story. And what a magnificent story it is!He doesn't go into detail about his childhood. He tells you about the stepdads that he had, and the father that he didn't. But he doesn't dwell on it. He and his mom are a team working together to support each other. He goes into detail about his cancer diagnosis, and the treatment. He doens't plow you over with big medical terms, he puts it so every one understands. He goes into detail about his recovery, both emoionally and physically, and his comeback to the podium. He tells his story, and doesn't hold anything back. He doesn't want you to feel sorry for him, he just wants you to know what exactly he went through.This is a great story for everyone, not just the cycling enthusiast."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a man of character and integrity. But it took a chronic illness to change him into the human being he is today. His story about his bout with cancer is not one of great inspiration or motivation but of survival. I finished the book the same day I started it. It is a quick read and an invigorating tale of one man's struggle not only with a physical illness but a mental battle to overcome all obstacles."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance touches your heart with the real details of his life...he is honest about being an amateur cycling cocky Texan; he is honest about his motives to win; he is honest about what he went through mentally and physically with cancer. He intimately describes the fear, the uncertainty, the determination to recover from his diagnosis and the cancer treatments. Lance opens the door to his life to help others understand the reality of being diagnosed with cancer and the mission to overcome the fear and get on the path to life again....A path to a better life...a more successful life than he would have had or REALIZED if he had not had to take a new perspective because of his cancer diagnosis. Thank you!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance offers a bit of something for everyone in this book. Something for the athlete that needs motivation, something for those overcoming serious illness, something for kids to admire, and a wake-up call for adults who think life is so damn rough.His childhood is somewhat slow reading but does make the point that even the most under-privileged kid can make something of themselves. Highly recommended for the young who just need the realization that everyone can overcome life's obstacles."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have followed Lance's career and still can't believe what he has overcome and what he has accomplished. He didn't have an easy life as a child, but he refused to make excuses. Some might call him cocky, but you don't get to be the best by being a patsy. My friend gave this book to a co-worker who was dying of inoperable cancer, and it provided a great lift for her. She's still in dire straits, but everytime she feels like giving up, she picks up Lance's book and it provides her with the needed passion to continue her fight. The Tour de France may be the toughest physical test there is, but Lance conquered it four times, just as he conquered cancer. Is he bitter? What would you feel if your boss fired you while you lay on your death bed, leaving you with no medical insurance? Unbelievable strength and inspiration is what this book provides."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"He may be a d--- in real life, but you have to hand it to him about the journey he has taken. In reading the book it was refreshing to believe that he was writing the book in his own voice (very personally with anger, vulgarity, and fast paced). The book was inspirational to the point that here was this guy who had the chips stacked against him and although I don't think most people will just roll over and die at the news (most people do choose to fight the cancer), he not just survived but was able to rebuild himself to become the best at what he does. He pays tribute to the other cancer patients he meets and vividly describes the battles he and everyone else has with the cancer, the treatments and the 'loss of self'. He doesn't paint a pretty picture about anything that happens except in the network of patients, survivors and some healthcare professionals he mwt along the way. Another refreshing aspect to the book that adds to its validity is his honesty about his roller-coaster of emotions, where at times he wanted to give up certain pursuits and had to rely on the strength of those around him to go on. It is a strong dose of reality for everyone who reads it, and educates those of us fortunate not to have cancer on the debilitating effects on the body and soul it has. The bike and racing is a side-bar story that just adds to the strength of character that many survivors have after they beat the disease, on their \\"new lease\\" on life. This was a great and humbling book that I could not put down when I started it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a good book to read when you are feeling &quot;blah&quot;...While I wasn't annoyed when Lance got resentfully back at some people that he feels let him down in life (after all, he is human, just like all of us!), I read with much interest his accounts of his battle with cancer, and of the Tour de France.Whether you like Lance Armstrong or not, whether or not you are into cycling,you have got to admit he's got guts, drive and resiliance. I don't think Lance aimed at being depicted as perfect in this book. Rather, he aims at being the best he can be. And for this alone, the book is worth reading.This is a good reminder of what you can accomplish if you work hard enough for it. Remember the famous quote &quot;never, never give up...&quot;?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One must honor this guy. And you have to love this book. Here's the story of a teenage smart aleck who transformed himself into an authentic human being. Basically, that echoes every kid's journey into adulthood. But not everyone becomes a first rank athlete and gets cancer along the way. Testicular cancer transformed Lance Armstrong into a mentsh. Thank god, luck, chance, and science he survived. His are the lessons for being a better man.Bikes are for kids but this isn't a kids' book. It's difficult, even excruciating, when we witness the physically weakened cyclist -- in the company of his mother and his devoted friend Lisa -- seeking and then enduring the medical torture that supported his survival. Yet it's part of an uplifting lifestory. Armstrong was secretly given a 2% chance of survival. To his credit he had a child's ability to ignore the odds and percentages. &quot;I had two options, medically and emotionally: Give up, or fight like hell. I had no other choice but to hope.&quot;Although I've made it clear this isn't a children's book, I can't resist thinking that writer Sally Jenkins does for Armstrong what E.B. White's Charlotte did for Wilbur. Charlotte &quot;wrote&quot; in her spoked web the saving words that hailed Wilbur to the world as &quot;Some Pig.&quot; Jenkins introduces the reader to the sensibility of a world-class human being who is some man: A caring, responsible, and brave adult.Lance Armstrong isn't a saint. But, as you will discover by the last page of this life enhancing sports biography, he knows how to offer comfort in the dark.Picture a teenage boy pedaling his bike out into the Texas countryside -- under open skies, hope rising off the ground. In a few days, we will have the opportunity to see that kid's adult incarnation competing with his Amerikan teammates in the 2000 Olympic Games. Good luck to him, them -- and all of us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you thought you liked Lance Armstrong before this book, you will fall in love with him after you read this book. If you want to be inspired, truly inspired, read this book. It's not about bicycles, it's about life and what can happen to you, to me, to anyone. It's about survival, failure, truth and identity. You will also not put it down. Run, do not walk to the nearest bookstore, (or online store) and buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I've read many biographys about many athletes. This is without a doubt the best one yet!!! I couldn't put it down. I'm not a tremedous cycling fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy this pageturner because &quot;it's not about the bike&quot;. It's about courage, determination, strength, and perserverance. When he crosses the finish line at the 1999 Tour de France, you'll get chills up and down your arms. Lance will inspire you to get off the couch and get on a bike. He'll inspire you to make the most of your life. A Great read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is fascinating on several levels: First, it's a very frank analysis of Lance Armstrong and his rise from a less than ideal family situation to his perch atop the cycling world. Second, it's an amazing account of his mother's strength and devotion in raising a son, often as a single parent. Third, it's a troubling account of the overwhelming difficulties facing cancer patients -- from insurance runarounds to loss of jobs to contradictory assessment and treatment recommendations from the doctors entrusted with their care. This is truly an incredible story. Four years ago Armstrong dropped out of the Tour de France and bombed out at the Atlanta Olympics. Over the next year he discovered he had a very advanced form of testicular cancer,tumors in his lungs and two in his brain, underwent brain surgery and four rounds of chemotherapy. Not long after, he was competing in Europe again. The rest is well-known: Tour victories in '99 and 2000 and a real hope for Olympic gold this time around. This is a frank, well-written account of Armstrong's incredible journey. I think it may be especially well-received by those undergoing cancer treatment or their families. The story goes far beyond an account of two-wheeling through the Alps."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like Lance, I too am a cyclist, but this book is not about cyling. This book is about taking each day by throat and living. It's about not ever giving up, regardless of the odds. It's about reveling in your family, friends, and loved ones. It's about living your life on your terms and only having to answer to yourself. It's about not stressing over the little things that no one will remember ten years from now. Every human being whether they're an athlete or not, a cancer survivor or not, should read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the most talked about books on the scene today and for good reason. You learn a lot about bicycle racing which subject I was most ignorant and...it is interesting. You learn a lot about intestinal fortitude, focusing, planning and goal setting; and you learn about facing and beating a killer like cancer and what you have to go through to beat it. A number of times throughout the book tears dripped down my face sometimes in sadness and sometimes in joy. A book to treasure and help one appreciate their fellow human beings."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an inspirational book! It proves that your life isn't that bad after all and that you can overcome some of the biggest hurdles of a lifetime. Well written and even with pictures for a personal touch, I admit I shedded a tear or two. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is wonderful. Not only does it take you step by step with how Lance dealt with cancer, it takes you step by step into the competition to the Tour De France. I couldn't put the book down. It teaches you never to quit and to go after your dreams."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read the book in one sitting...it's that captivating! Whether you are a cycling fan or not this is one you shouldn't pass up! At times I felt myself angry over the way Armstrong treated his friends, coaches and family but then...you have to consider what he was going through at the time. Yes he is brash but when you're as good as he is and have been through what he's been through it's not without cause. A truly inspirational and uplifting story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book because I got caught up in the 99 Tour de France and Lance Armstrong's story. What I discovered was much more interesting. The will to live...The fight of cancer patients...The struggle of the cancer patient's family.Not long after reading this book, a friend's son in law was diagnosed with testicular cancer. I gave her Lance's book and sent her the Lance Armstrong Foundations web address ... so that she could get further information on the disease."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a huge Armstrong fan, and have been a fan of cycling for years. I really like this book by Lance, as it's honest, and real. Lance does have an ego, but it's one he's earned. He talks about his younger days, family, his mother, racing, and his struggle with cancer. At moment's he can be a bit unforgiving, and tend to think the worst possible things in people. Something about him seems distant, and hard to relate to. But, at times he's weak, open and honest. The book is interesting on many levels, him as a person, his childhood, racing, the sport iteself, cancer, and so much more. It's a great read. Lance is an American Legend already, and the book is written so that it's easily read, and is interesting. Like many American hero's Armstrong has had his share of difficulites to overcome, and look where he's gone in life. It's motivating!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a truely inspiration book. After reading what Lance Armstrong encounted through his child hood and battling his fight against cancer it shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is somewhere around 3 and a half stars. I bought the book not because I am a cancer patient or, knows somone who is. I bought this book because I thought it would be nice to try and understand what drives a Lance Armstrong. Lance lets us into his life of how he prepares for cycling races and how he trains for six or seven hours straight! I learned some things about cancer treatment that I did not even realize nor would I have thought about before.Side bar: To become an elite athlete is the ultimate dream to me because you get paid to workout and be recognized so, just to read about the lifestyle of Lance was worth the cost of this book which I bought used.I suggest you buy it used as well."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Kyle WilliamsIt's not about the bikeLance ArmstrongThis book about Lance Armstrong describes how he went through things in his life that changed the way he thought about life. He tried his hardest to live and set a record for the Tour de France. Many struggles caused him to try as hard as he could that changed the way he will think about things and that life isn't perfect. You must undergo challenges that will pay off sooner or later. What challenges will he go to in order to live?When Lance was a kid he was given his first bike and he loved it. One day he saw that the bike shop that he always went to had a sign for a triathlon. He signed up and he started to ride his bike, swim, and run so that he could win. On the day of the triathlon his mother came to watch and he ended up winning. As the years went by he started to go to more triathlons and the bike store started to sponsor him with all of his bikes. His mom and him started to travel to places such as New Mexico.He got sponsored by Oakley and Nike and got a coach by the name of Chris Carmichael. He started to travel to foreign countries to join bike races. He joined the U.S. team and would always ditch his team and gun ahead of everyone. Lance came is first a lot but then he started to come in 11th and 12th place because he would lose energy early in the race for trying to go ahead. His coach was always encouraging him to take chances and go for the win. That is exactly what he did and he ended up winning more in foreign countries.Then he got cancer! One day while he was riding his bike he started to feel pain in his right testicle. He quickly went home and looked at it. It was three times larger than normal. He went to the doctor and instead of it being a twenty-minute appointment it ended up being over two hours long. They took x-rays and the doctor told him he had testicular cancer and they would remove the testicle the next day. The testicle was removed but the cancer had spread to his lungs. He went through chemo and brain surgery and the cancer was removed. He went to win three more Tour de France's before he married and ended up retiring.In this book the author learned that life is more important than the bike and that fighting through will help you get through it. Lance learned that being the best would get you somewhere but that your life is way more important then being the best. When you get a disease your life can become more important and your family members are always by your side even if you are really sick. They will always care for you in any struggle during your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a great book ... especially since Lance has now won seven Tour de France races ! I admired his perserverance getting through cancer and climbing back on the bicycle to continue training. He is definitely right that cancer makes you think about the people near you much more -- his girlfriend / wife and eventually his son. The details of his emotional reaction to learning about his cancer were very helpful to understand what cancer patients go through."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's not about the bike was so inspirational.It was real ,it was touching.A book that gives HOPE."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life\\" by Lance Armstrong is one of the best classic books I have read in my life. In it, Lance describes his journey through childhood, his first years of cycling, cancer and his return to cycling after being cured. I am a huge fan of Lance Armstrong and after reading this book my respect for him has grown even more. The best thing about the book was the way Lance Armstrong presented the bike races. His detailed part-by-part descriptions were truly fascinating. It made me feel that I was there riding the bike with him.The book would be a great source of inspiration for everyone because it inspires within us the \`great spirit' to achieve higher and better things. The book also motivates us to overcome all obstacles without wavering in our path. Moreover, this makes \\"It's not about the bike\\" an apt title for the book, because it is not only about Lance's great achievements, but it's about the immense value of life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Well...I won't rehash what everyone has written...but I will say that I love the story. Hollywood could have never written a comeback story such as this...no one, and I mean NO ONE would ever believe it!I love Armstrong's description of his saviors...his Doctors and especially his \\"Angel\\", La Trice Haney. I could feel his vindication as he walked by the management of Cofidis Racing at the Tour. It is especially interesting reading his fondness of Kristen \\"Kik\\" Richard, his future wife. Now that he is divorced it is interesting to see how one's perspective on another can change so dramatically.If you are either an Armstrong fan or interested in him, this is a great read. If you are an Anti-Armstrong person, avoid this like the plague as you will think it is only propoganda..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life by Lance Armstrong is an amazing book. After reading this book, I looked at life differently. This book teaches a human a lesson about how you have to live your life to the fullest and complete every journey through life in a positive way. I thought this book was mind-blowing, and I couldn't believe that one famous human being could have dealt with all this. After reading this book, a person learns the beauty and truth of life. It teaches a human being that cancer cannot be cured by a miracle but by an ordinary person but all they need is courage. Not only is this book sad but happy at points, the character Lance Armstrong gives humor and sorrow at the same time. Armstrong never stays in the same lane, he makes it emotional at times and then at other times he makes it adventurous. This book is so wonderful that giving it five stars is so less, not every author or writer can tell their life to everyone and reveal it, but this book let's out Lance and us out into the world too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is probably my favorite athlete on the planet because he's won the most grueling test for human endurance 7 times. He explains how his bout with cancer changed his perspective on what is really important in life. Remind me that I never actually want to be diagnosed with cancer, because he went through hell in order to live, but I respect how he views it as a blessing. My father recently went through it this year, and I see that things have changed in him as well. I'm sending him this book as a gift for him, which I think he'll love. Everyone should read this book in order to get some form of insite on how a person who is extemely ill feels during their ordeal. Even though you only get a small glimpse into his trials, you see how it has truly changed him. It really isn't about the bike, just like it's not about the stuff we accumulate. Read this book!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One word. EXCELLENT!It doesn't matter if your a fan of bike riding or not. Lance's book is just plain excellent and he is extremely inspiring!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an excellent book about an outstanding person. Yes, Lance is a cycling hero by any standard, having already won the Tour de France four times, but to have showed such perseverance in the face of life threatening and body wrecking cancer is just amazing. Most people would have never considered making a comeback after something like that, but Lance not only came back- he triumphed. This book gives the reader all the details of the battle with cancer, and much much more. By reading it, you get to know Lance as a person, and get inside the psyche of this great champion. The book is a real page turner, too, as I hardly put it down. An excellent read even if you have no interest in cycling. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I liked this book very much. The reason I chose this book was because I like watching the Tour De France and my dad wanted me to read more. The book is about Lance Armstrong's life through his child hood through his battle with cancer and through him winning the '99 tour. My favorite part of the book was when they talked about his's childhood."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In my best professional opinion, this book will go down in history as the best books ever. I've never read a more touching story. I was brought to tears many times. I've never had the luck of experiencing cancer, first hand, and let me tell you, now I don't ever want to. This book inspired me like nothing else before. He has given me strength to overcome a number of my problems, including rickets and ADD. Without him I don't know what I'd do. I used to hate vitamin C. Now, with Lance's encouragement, its not so bad. I've read many autobiographies in my day, and none are as deep or interesting as this one. His writing style is very easy to read. This is important to someone with ADD, like me. It also makes it fun to read. This book is a good bathroom reader, which is where I do the majority of my reading. I've read this book twice so far, and I plan on reading it again. I truly love this book. Anyone can read it, not just bicycle enthusiasts. Because, as we know, its not about the bike. If you want to be taken on a journey, a journey back to life, I suggest you pick up this book. Lance Armstrong is a great writer, and I'm no slouch either. Well, I shouldn't sell myself so short. I'm a fantastic slouch. Happy reading! BEANS!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had seen this book on the top sellers list for the past few months so I figured it had to be good. I'm not a cancer survivor nor a current patient. I picked up this book partly because I am fascinated by world class athletes but mostly because I wanted to become better aquainted with Lance Armstrong(one of the best American athletes ever).I figured that Lance would go through the entire book commenting on how he was able to survive cancer. The fact of the matter as he so brilliantly brings to life is that he is no different from so many other cancer survivors. He has no magic powers because he's a world class cyclist. He suffered like everyone else. He didn't die simply because he wasn't ready to. He must have been heeding the words of another famous cancer patient - Jim Valvano:\\"Don't give up, don't ever give up.\\" The biggest reason Lance gave for not giving up was that he was without a family (i.e. a wife and kids). This would later change with his marriage to Kristin (Kik) and birth of son Luke (through IVF).We all hear about his accomplishments at the Tour de France but there is so much more to Lance that many people don't know. Lance has grown up without knowing his biological father and like so many other athletes before him, many people could see greatness in him even before he reached his teens.This book is not solely for Cancer survivors/patients. It is the ultimate self-help book without self-help as it's primary goal. You not only learn about his struggles through Cancer and life, you learn about Lance the person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"About six mnonts ago I read It's not about the bike: My Journey back to life. Since then I have devoloped such a deep appreciation for Lance and the sport of cycling. I did not know much about Lance or cycling before I read the book, but now I feel that I truly know Lance. It is my favorite book, and Lance is my hero as a human and also as an athlete and cyclist. I think of him as such a hero. So many children and adults alike have heros because they score a lot of touchdowns or score a lot of homeruns. But it's not only about that with Lance Armstrong. It is all that he overcame and proved to everyone. He not only broke records, but he broke them as someone who went through hell on earth! In reading the book, I learned, to sum up something indescribeable, how terrible chemotherapy really is. For Lance to not only survive, but to come back and win four Tour De France races, makes him, in my eyes, and ideal hero for everyone. I would recommend this book to anyone in this world who wants a heo."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A hero is one of the most respected positions a person can be. To be a hero means to have people look up to you for help in times of trouble. Defined in the dictionary a hero is: a man of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds. Lance Armstrong is my hero and a hero to many others too. Sure he has his enemies, but are they only enemies because of jealousy? His book not only made me eye Lance in a new perspective, but the entire world opened up before me. I learned what life should be, and view my strengths and weaknesses differently. Lance is my constant motivation, and the book led me to view him in a new, better way. Before I read his book, Lance was just the guy they talked about on t.v. that won the Tour de France. Now, after seemingly getting to &quot;know&quot; him through the book, he is my hero."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What can you say? Dead man walking. To have survived advanced stage testicular cancer that had spread to his brain was a story of pain and suffering and self doubt that no one wants to endure in their lifetime. The writing style was pretty choppy, which made it sound like a jock wrote it, and I enjoyed it all the more. It was like Lance was talking to &quot;you&quot; and not some writer telling the tale third hand."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a 14 year old, and Lance Armsrong is my hero. This book is about Lance's life, his fight against cancer, riding and being a good father. Anyone who loves bicycling as much as I do should love this book.

Up to his win in the Tour!I don't want to give it a way all I have to say is, Way to go Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am an avid runner and a recreational biker. I understand what it takes to train and to push when you really do not feel like it.After reading this book, I was so inspired. The subject of the book makes you realize how precious every breath you take really is. This is an amazing story about an amazing man. I just kept saying over and over again, &quot;How did he do this?&quot; Where did he get the guts to come back from this? It is very hard to understand how the heck this man was able to come back and win the Tour de France after what he went through.After reading the book I vowed never to complain about running in bad weather, or blow off a run when I didn't feel well.It is truly a book you MUST read. It will help you in ways you never thought possible.

It gave her inspiration and gave me valuable insight on what she was going through.

Looks like my sister was victorious in her battle too. May they both continue to be winners."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was very good if your looking for the life of Lance through his words. Obviously not a literary masterpeice, but it was nice to get the personality from Lance through his book. You can tell he is a very arogant and gruff kinda guy, but you gotta hand it to him for all hes made it through. Having been a Lance fan before I read the book, I left with some disapointment to find out some more personal opinions of Lance that I felt were a bit misguided, but hey, its not for me to judge. Anyways if you really want to know who this guy is, read the book. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I never realized what this man went through.

An incredible story of determination, guts, and pure inspiration!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a long-time cyclist, and past Olympic hopeful who lost sight of the dream, this book has motivated me to get back on the bike and do my best in competitive cycling once again.As the grandson of a cancer survivor and the friend of a few others, the vivid description of his triumph over tragedy and his fierce determination has inspired me to get off my duff and do something about it. I am proud to join the multitudes of others who have joined Lance's Peleton Project and Ride for the Roses cancer projects.The book is well written. It brings you to tears out of tragedy in some areas, and brings tears during some of the triumphs. I read this 280 page book in 3 days - never regretting a moment of it.If you have an interest in cycling, the Tour de France or cancer - pick up this book.

I've already written my review, but now I can add that my kiddo loved it too -- and Lance is such a hero that I was happy to share it with her. It's a great book to promote parent-child discussion -- &quot;so, what did you think about Lance's relationship with his father? His step-father?&quot; is a great opportunity for all Dads-at-a-distance (and moms too) -- and a great opportunity for single parents when the other is absent; to show a kiddo that someone else has overcome this adversity. &quot;What about his mom?&quot; &quot;What did you think about his 'homeboy', the guy who owned the local bikeshop?&quot; -- these are great questions to discuss good parenting relationships and mentors. &quot;What was different in his attitude toward other racers before, when he was good but erratic, and now that he's a great champion?&quot;This is truly a great book to read with kids, and provides wonderful character teaching lessons along the way.

It's been a little over a week since we heard the diagnosis. On that night, I was not in good shape; upon hearing about this, my good friend walked to my house and gave me the book for me to start immediately. The book holds nothing back. There are details in there regarding Chemotherapy that make one cringe, but for some odd reason I respect the honesty. Because through this honesty came a way of educating. The book rollercoasts you up and down - from the bottom of Chemo, to the tops where he celebrated the birth of his child and winning \\"the Tour.\\" I reccommend this, and I now look to the book for Inspiration."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is truly the most inspirational book I've ever read. I've read it twice in three months. And I plan on reading it many more times.I knew of Lance as the young, cocky cyclist with attitude. And I know of him now--someone who cares about the sport, and, above all, people. I did the Ride for the Roses for the first time this past April, and I will participate for sure in the future. People came from all over the nation to participate, and after reading this book, I know why. If you have a chance to take part in it (the next one is in October 2003), I suggest you do so.For someone to take time off of his professional career to take part in something he feels so strongly about, I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for this man. And if his wife and mother are 1/10th of how he describes them, wow.Go Lance-a-lot!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a three-time winner of the Tour de France, an achievement that in itself is extremely praiseworthy. But what is amazing about Armstrong's victories is that he achieved them after recovering from cancer - at one stage the doctors had believed his chances of recovery were less than 20%. It's Not About the Bike is the story of Armstrong's life - his growing up, his riding, his becoming a father. Most of all, it is about his battle with cancer, and how it changed him for the better.Don't fear - this is not some airy-fairy new-age hope story. Armstrong is very down to earth about the whole process that he went through, and is not afraid to share details (gory, icky details). This book achieves a lot that other autobiographies miss - he drops some pretty big names and doesn't shy away from comparing himself from the greats in cycling, yet you never feel he is boasting. You get a lot of detail - what goes into chemo treatments; his wife's injection &amp; drug regime for IVF; a run through of his 1999 ride of the Tour de France - but it never feels boring or superfluous. Rather, Armstrong comes across as a guy that manages to be amazing and reassuringly normal at the same time - he likes to kick back and drink beer, he loves his Mother, he is proud of being a Dad. He just happens to be one of the greatest sports people competing today, and after reading this book you realise how hard he works to be so good.You don't need to be a cyclist to enjoy this book - while there are sections on his riding, nothing is too technical, and all cycling terms used are explained. As the title says - it's not about the bike. It is about an amazing man that went to hell and back, and made the best of the second chance he was given. I guarantee this book will manage to make you laugh, make you think and inspire you all in the same reading. And there's not much more you can ask from in a book than that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I went into my read of this book practically worshipping this guy. His accomplishments both on and off the bike are nothing less than extraordinary. The book does have an inspirational message, but I found myself often distracted from it by a constant thread of egomania. Where there is modesty it tends to ring false. If anyone is entitled to feel good about himself it is Lance, but enough already."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is full of inspiration in creating and maintaining a meaningful and rewarding life. Lance's story of his physical and emotional struggles and triumph over them is a true motivation. I am an investment banker living and working in New York, and have a great life which at times has disappointments. I particularly found encouragement in how Lance chose to see his illness as part of his life and not as a departure point from living and enjoying his life, bicycling, family and friends.If you enjoyed this book, I recommend you read another great book called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book has facilitated a consistency in all areas of my life as being rewarding and satisfying. Both these books are full of insights into how to enjoy the uphill as well as the downhill on your bike ride, where you are the winner over the finish line of your life! ps If you like audio tapes check out the Kanes' &quot;The Roots of Satisfaction&quot; it's great."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a truly amazing novel. Lance shows no signs of being avaricious but isn't afraid to tell it like it is. The book begins talking about Lance's childhood and racing before cancer. It painfully documents his onerous battle with cancer. But the reader is rewarded at the end with a truly uplifting payoff. I enjoy this novel so much that I could not put it down. I don't recommend to children under twelve because of the cursing. It is more of an adult book. But other then that, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What a book! I defy anyone with a modicum of sensitivity to put it down willingly before getting to page 275. Lance's wonderful closeness with his mother, his resounding praises of the extensive medical team that oversaw his treatment and recovery, his description of the other riders and promoters of road cycling, his delight at his marriage and birth of his son express the essence of one fascinating young man. It doesn't take a rabid cycling fan to appreciate his recapturing of the '99 Tour de France. Masterful, Ms. Jenkins."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I wasn't prepared for the emotion that poured out of Lance Armstrong, but I was totally captivated. It is a superbly well-written book that tells a harrowing tale of authentic heroism and true bravery. I couldn't put it down and for four days, carried it with me everywhere I went, until at last I was regrettfully finished. It stayed with me long after I was through, too.He's right when he says it's not about the bike. It's also not about cancer or toughness or amazing support and courage. It's about life, and there are not many books that can say that.Buy it. Read it. You won't regret it. And next year, you'll find yourself up at 3am to watch the most fabulous sporting event on the planet--the Tour de France--and cheering on our own cowboy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although not a literary masterpiece, this book will leave you inspired if not teary eyed. It is easy to pass judgement and call Lance Armstrong arrogant, self absorbed and self centered(descriptions I noticed that other reviewers used to describe him) How can we truly judge anyone unless we have walked a mile in their shoes? I can't fathom how I would react to the news that I have cancer. I don't know for sure that I won't get it. I just pray I have as much strength as Lance Armstrong does. This book reminds us that we need not get cancer to truly LIVE. The only way you will be disappointed with this book is if you come with preconceived notions, and a judgemental attitude. Lance Armstrong may be an agnostic but who are we to criticize him for his beliefs. Anyway, cancer doesn't care what religion you follow."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a cyclist, and I do not follow sports or athletes on television. My fiancee is an avid cyclist with an injury that has prevented him from riding for the past 12 months, so some of the terminology in Lance's books was somewhat familiar. However, I can honestly tell you that this was one of the top books I have ever read. I do not generally read autobiographies, I generally read fiction, brain-candy type books. The only reason I read it is because my fiancee purchased it. He didn't encourage me to read it, he didn't suggest that I read it. I simply picked it up one afternoon and could not put it down. I finished this book in just a few days and I will be recommending it to many people and will be purchasing it for friends. Lance's story is so honest, raw, inspirational and real. It is incredibly well written. Thank you to Lance Armstrong for sharing his deeply personal and inspirational story with us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It amazes me how such a man can go from Cancer to TWO TOUR DE FRANCE WINS in a matter of 2-3 years. This book that he has written explores how he came in contact with the disease and conquers it and then doesn't think &quot; Oh i will never ride again&quot; and takes us on a journey through his eyes of his tour de france victory. This book is so Inspirational and keeps you cheering at every page you turn. This motivates me to accomplish and excel in every thing i do. Thank you Mr. Armstrong for so a wonderful book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was written with such simple language and words, yet the message is direct and strong. Read the words and look deep into their meanings. These are the confessions of a proud man, a fallen man, a revived man and a victorious man. Although we might not be able to associate ourselves in Lance's situation, we all can learn one lesson here : Hope and Willpower can sustain life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a bike rider, but I am a cancer survivor. I really liked the positive message from this book; having cancer does change your life, and it can change it for the better. I have given this book as a gift to several friends undergoing cancer treatment as well as their family members in the hope that they will benefit from that positive message."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"We bought this book on tape for a long road trip - thought it would be good inspiration/a good role model for our daughter; however, within minutes were exposed to foul language. I recuperated from that but before the end of side A of tape 1 were subjected to foul language 2-3 more times. I had to eject the cd and we listened to the radio for the remainder of the trip. It is a shame that we cannot be warned of these things in advance. I am not opposed to this type of language, per se, but I choose not to expose my daughter to it and am so upset at the lack of a warning, will probably never finish listening to the audiobook."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"To be perfectly honest, Lance Armstrong, has (with the help of Sally Jenkins) written a fine memoir about his recent battles (mostly bike races). His close call with cancer was extremely close and a heartwrenching, touching experience. I certainly feel for him. I used to be an avid cyclist, so I was quite interested in the book after a friend from Ireland (Paul Gourley) told me he loved the book. It's worth reading for anyone dealing with cancer or who loves bicycling. It's just not on my HIGH list as far as literary achievements go. If there's one thing I learned it's that Lance loves to WIN--no matter what the race/game/fight. Now I hear he's dating Sherly Crow, so I wonder what happened to 'the love of his life', the woman who had his child, Luke (wonders never cease as time goes by)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like Lance's mother, I'm a single parent in Plano, Texas. I know well the streets and schools, the apartments and swimming pools and ice cream shop he talks about. I've bought bikes for my kids from the guy who gave bikes to Lance. Perhaps ghost writter Jenkins was playing up the &quot;struggle to grow up&quot; angle, but chapter two really ruined the book for me.At seventeen, Lance was racing his new Z28 Camero through the streets and had sponsors sending him on trips to compete. He cut school for 6 weeks and then pitched a hissy when the school officials told him he'd actually have to do the school work to graduate!At seventeen, my daughter doesn't cut school and drives a five year old Geo Metro back and forth to a $6 an hour job. She didn't learn how to swim at a country club, and she doesn't wear designer labels. I've personally met hundreds of Plano kids like her over the years. Many have imigrant parents with limited English; they walk and ride the bus to school, work and study hard, shop at Walmart, and nobody sponsors them but God.I see two main differences between the young Lance Armstong portraied in &quot;..About the Bike&quot; and the Plano kids I know: 1. The kids I know don't have world class VO2max, like Lance, and 2. unlike Lance, they don't constantly whine about not being treated with the deference they think they should be treated.It would be easy to write this off to the immature perspective of a teenage boy, but the city of Plano has been trying to name a park after him and have a &quot;Lance Armstrong Day&quot; for the past year. Neither Lance or his agent will return their phone calls or answer their letters."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading his amazing story.

Through this book, we could see how lives are difficult and incredible. You read Lance's story for learning about his fight with testicular cancer or to learn about training for a bike race. You can learn many new things from reading how he faces life's challenges. Also, as a mother, I learned even more from Linda, his mother and how hard she worked. She always was strong and supported Lance in everything!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Ever wondered what drives a champion? Do you liked being inspired? Then this book is for you.It would suprise even Lance Armstrong to know that he was able to win 6 Tour de France in a row. But reading his book and realizing what he does to prepare for these races. One can see the heart and dedication it takes to go from champion to legend. The book chronicles the progress of a champion cyclist and the making of a cycling legend."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike\\" is an autobiography of Lance Armstrong, a world champion cyclist, and how he dealt with cancer. Lance was born in Plano, Texas where he grew up fatherless. Consequently, his mother was a very important part of his life. As Lance went through high school he was never part of the \\"cool crowd\\". This was mainly because he didn't play football, and that was not socially acceptable. Basically, any game that consisted of a ball (basketball, baseball, ext...) he was not good at. Lance joined the swim team at the age of 12. He was so bad at swimming that he was put in the class of seven years olds. Lance as he did with most things in his life gave it his all and within a year, with the help of his coach, Chris MacCurdy, Lance became the 4th best in the state in the 1,500 meter freestyle. Lance was swimming about six miles at practice, and was riding 20 miles on the bike to get to practice and to get home, everyday. Lance enrolled in his first triathlon after he saw a sign at his school. A triathlon consisted of swimming, running and biking. Those were Lance's three strengths. Lance blew the competition out of the water. He entered every triathlon he would find. Most were with adults much older than him. He always won. He eventually moved to Russia to compete, which caused him to miss much of his schooling, forcing him to graduate somewhere else. Lance did poorly in Russia because he was a beginner racer who had no sense of pacing himself. Eventually, he was called by Chris Carmichael to be part of the U.S. Nation Cycling Team. Lance went to Europe with the team.Cancer hit Lance when he started doing well in cycling. He won a few races in Europe and was starting to make a real career in the sport. The first cancer he was diagnosed with was testicular cancer; that devastated him. He had to have his testicle removed. Following this he found out he had 11 cancerous tumors in his lungs. This was devastating for him to hear. He called up his cycling team and told them his career was over. To him, hearing those words that he had cancer in his lungs was the most devastating thing he had ever heard. He learned everything there was to know about cancer and ultimately went to Indiana to be treated. There he learned that he also had two cancerous tumors in his brain. There was one tumor right next to the vision portion of his brain and one directly over his coordination center of the brain. He had surgery to have them removed and luckily his doctor was one of the best in the world. The operation went smoothly. Lance still had tumors in his chest though, and they were growing at an amazing race. The treatment he went though was chemotherapy. Chemo was the worst thing that he had ever experienced. \\"It literally felt like fire flowing threw my veins, burning everything in it's path\\" as Lance states in \\"It's Not About the Bike\\". Chemo would be so intense that he would lose all of his hair and drop over 20 lbs. He was already in perfectly lean cut muscle before he started the treatment, and he would be known to be lying in the fetal position very often. He would vomit numerous times a day, and he often thought he was going to die. It was so intense that Lance decided to quit cycling. He thought his body couldn't' handle it. He would never be the same again. This was all untrue. Lance called this phase \\"survivorship\\" because it was how someone thinks they will never be the same after cancer. This was completely untrue. After a year or two of doing nothing, his family convinced him he needed to be back in cycling. It was where he belonged. When Lance finally did come back to cycling, he did it with a bang. He was horribly out-of-shape but he worked and worked. He would ride 7-8 hours a day on his bike. He was finally making a miraculous comeback. He ultimately won the Tour de France to complete his life dream and show everyone with cancer that there is hope for recovery, no matter how stacked the odds are against you.Lance Armstrong's autobiography was truly an amazing book to read. It moved very smoothly from topic to topic and gave a full overview of his life. It showed Lance's emotions through every phase of his life. It showed how great he felt when he first went to Russia to win his first major bike race, to his devastating feelings when cancer struck. Cancer is such a horrible thing. It is hard to imagine for someone hasn't had it. Lance did an amazing job of showing every last emotion. Lance was able to tell exactly what he was feeling throughout the whole book. I also got a taste of Lance's gut wrenching character though the entire book.The book did have some minor negative points though, don't get me wrong, they took no joy away from reading it. The only thing I did not enjoy was how it got graphic in some points of the book. Although it might not be pleasing to hear about a person's battle with cancer, it is the honest truth. Some of the things that happened to his body, like vomiting, are sad and gross, but a reality. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone. It was enjoyable and always kept my attention."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"No doubt this is one of the best biographies I have ever read.

In this book Lance is a real lance, even his name is very similar to his success.Lance had a lot of endurance to fight the life, the cancer, and the chemotherapy. Really he was lucky in his life when he was saved from the death, from the cancer and got his life back again. He is lucky when he has a mother like Linda, when he has a friend like Bill, when he has a doctor like Nichols. Rarely, we know people like that.When you read this book, you know that, there are champions around the world make a surviving thing over the history, like Lance Armstrong.

Lance Armstrong, a great figure of cycling, had to deal with all the consequences that this disease brought. It's so terrible to know that meanwhile he was a healthy man everybody wanted to sign a millionaire contract with him, but after his sponsors knew he had cancer, they didn't want to know anything about him. Was this fair? No, I think it wasn't.But Lance wasn't alone. In this world there were so many good people that were able to help Lance. To mention some of them, Bill Stapleton, who always tried to understand Lance when because of his frustrations he became bad-tempered. Dr. Craig Nichols, and Dr. Shapiro, because they showed they loved their career and they gave the best of them to cure Lance. I think this was a wonderful experience for Lance to be surrounded by good friends and good professional people.Lance Armstrong had had a good example from his mother. She had taught him always to see every \\"obstacle as an opportunity\\". I believe these positive thoughts helped Lance to deal with the adversities he has found in his long path.All what I can say to Lance is: GO AHEAD BOY!

When he got testicular cancer, how you can imagine he didn't believe the doctor's diagnoses and try to get different doctors opinions and they were always the same \\"cancer\\", When he realize the truth his life became different to him, he knew that he wasn't the person he thought and he could really know that life it's more than the race; the bicycle; and any material thing he had and he realize his life wasn't only about the bike, was a race to life.I want to encourage you to read this book because it can make a big difference in someone life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Even for me, someone who wasnt into the sport of Bicyling- It was so intereting from start to finish.

It's a book for kids, but it's also a book for adults. Sports fans would enjoy this book, anyone who has been touched by cancer would enjoy this book, and anyone who has had to overcome great odds would enjoy this book.Lance Armstrong accomplished probably one of the greatest comebacks in sports history, winning the Tour De France three years in a row, after surviving cancer. His descriptions of his races were very entertaining. As a young kid Lance was a striving athlete. He won all the races, and events he entered in. He was a swimmer, a runner, and a biker; he even did all three, a triathlon. He did all of that despite many odds. He won the Tour De France despite many odds, one being cancer. Cancer destroyed Lance's sports life. He rebounded from his cancer and returned to his sports as a better athlete, but also a better person. Lance inspires the reader to do the very best they can at everything they do. \\"Make an obstacle an opportunity, make a negative a positive.\\" Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of those books you could go on and on about. &quot;It's Not About The Bike&quot; Exemplifes all that an inspirational story should be.

Lance Armstrong's autobiography is for all readers, it is not discriminatory to any walk of life. I would suggest this book to anyone, no matter the type of reader they are. The writing allows the reader to just flow through the entire book without even knowing that the hours are flying by, becuase that is exactly what happens-I picked up the book thinking that I would get a good start on it and before I knew it I had finished it.The Book is divided into eleven sections or chapters. Every chapter deals with a different perspective of Lance's life. The majority of it is devoted to cancer and it's effect on his life and the ones around him. This book is well written all of the way through especially the sections that deal with cancer. The detail that he goes into will make anyone realize the severity of cancer. At the same time, he never writes too graphic or too detailed, so as to keep the reader interested. Along with doing an excellent job describing his experiences with cancer he also describes cycling extremely well. Going into this book my knowledge on cycling was limited, after finishing this book I feel like I have a better grasp of the sport and find myself looking for anything that will tell me more about cycling. Lance Armstrong begins the book with a \\"Before and After\\" chapter that explains the diagnosis of his cancer. This is a wonderful explanation of his life changing experience with this death sentence of cancer. Following the introduction chapter Armstrong explains his cycling career and this is what allows the reader to really understand the kind of person he was,the hated American athlete with a huge ego in an European based sport, before the cancer and how he changed his ways into those of a wonderful humanbeing that anyone could consider their best friend following his diagnosis.My overall view of the book is that it is very well written and keeps the readers attention. Throughout reading it I felt as though I was watching a made for television movie based on a true story. This book will hook the unsuspecting athletic fan and turn them into a supporter of cancer patients. It will also hook the reader who picks it up to read about cancer and turn them into a cyclist fan. No matter who the reader, at the end you will be a Lance Armstrong fan."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Based on all of the fabulous reviews, I purchased this book in its used state. It was worth reading, but it is not a great book. The story is honest and miraculous, but lacks sentimentality. The quality of writing appeals more to the average cyclist than the average reader, with lots of slang fragmented sentences and intentional arrogancy. I find that annoying, but you may not. I race and love Lance, plus I'm glad I read it, because I now know the story. Not a great read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Yes, I agree with all the other reviews that it is GOOD. However, it's VERY CUTESY, CUTESY when it comes to descriptions of his wife (is he sucking up or what?).I am a HUGE Lance fan, and have followed his career for the last 12 years or so, back when he was a triathlete.Yes, buy it. However, it can be corny at times."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"He might have lied about doping but he didn't lie about surviving cancer or about what he went through. I know because I've been through it. However, if you can't over look the cycling parts in exchange for his will to win at everything including cance, then it might not be for you."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong book, is an amazing book. It tells about his life and how he overcame adversity to become the champion cyclist he is today, but it also tells what he went through to survive cancer. He provides incite into a sport most people don't know or understand and makes it easy for non cyclist readers to grasp the fullness of the sport. Its about how his mentality changed almost instantly after the realization he had cancer.Early in the book he talked about turning negatives into positives and that line really stuck with me. Then he went on to say how cancer was the best thing that had happened to him, because it opened his eyes. Most people would not imagine cancer as something good let alone the best thing in their life, but that's because, like he said \\"I saw more beauty and triumph in one day than I ever saw in a bike race.\\". He opens up this extremely sensitive part of his private life to the public to show that even when the odds seem down you can still make it back and win, and that's not just in a cycling race.This is one of the best books I've ever read. The book is not about telling a story in the most poetic language but it gives you the truth strait and you wont want to put it down till you've reached the back cover. I'm glad its popular because it could really help someone trying to cope with a life changing disease. It can also inspire and motivate you to go out and give everything you've got to win something you desperately want.I highly recommend buying and reading this book. You will probably find yourself reading it more than once and it might even inspire you to go out and change something in your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A riveting quick read, that can make a reader think.Before I read &quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; I knew virtually nothing about the sport of Cycling. This sport is definitely one of the more physically grueling and mentally demanding. Mainly because of the lengthy races, and the lengthy training time required to compete at the professional level.A dedicated hard working athlete that trained relentlessly, Armstrong also had a genetic advantage, like most world champion athletes: he has enormously high levels of VO-2, which is the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the body from the lungs. He also produces extremely low levels of Lactic Acid, which is the natural chemical in our body that causes a burning sensation in our muscles when we exert them strenuously (Spaghetti legs and burning, for example). That is why when many of the world's top cyclists were burning out at the end of a race, Armstrong could charge up a long and steep hill to overtake them, or strategically sprint to the end.Some of the Cycling lingo a reader will learn: pulling, Peloton, sitting on someone's wheel, fricking, dafting, &quot;Give an inch, gain a friend,&quot; and &quot;bonking out.&quot;To train for events and stay in tip-top shape a cyclist has to obviously ride a lot. 6 hours straight, at times. Getting run off of the road in Texas by a Ford F-250, crashing onto the pavement, and getting actually hit by cars happened to Armstrong several times. I could relate to him tell how he shook his fist and middle-finger at a passing vehicle as he lay on the ground, gravel embedded in him, with his bike on top of him. Crashes will happen, and one of the most dangerous parts of a race are the descents. Racers go at high speeds, through hair-pin curves. I slight error can mean serious injury, or even death, as one team member of Armstrong fractured the back of his skull and neck.Cycling was significant but not exclusive part in this this book about Lance Armstrong's life. He shared a lot about his private and personal beliefs, fears, tragedies and triumphs. I liked the fact that this auto-biography didn't paint just the pretty pictures that most auto-bios do (after, these people are writing about themselves). Armstrong often candidly provided the reader with interesting little things about him, as well as his thoughts and feeling about issues, both big and small. This info. on the little stuff is what I am often most curious about. Armstrong is a Gen Xer, and this is evident throughout the book. Quoting from the movie &quot;Goodwill Hunting,&quot; Armstrong has a favorite quote from a dialog between Matt Damon and a Harvard preppy after they have an intellectual debate. This quote means a lot to Armstrong, and he applies it to his life:&quot;You like apples?&quot;&quot;Yeah, I like apples.&quot;&quot;I just got her phone number. How do you like them apples?&quot;As for the sport the reader will learn the tactics, strategies, and politics of Cycling. Like any popular and lucrative sport with many athletes participating and dedicated fans involved, there is hard-core and fierce, competition. In Italy, some local fans were so unsettled with the fact that an American was beating their favorite son (Armstrong in the lead), they threw tacks onto the road hoping to pop Armstrong's tire. In another incident, a person sprayed pepper spray into the Peloton (pack of racers), causing some riders not to be able to finish the race.CANCER &amp; CHEMO:When he began to feel pain and have diminished energy he thought it was just another part of being sore from training and racing, because soreness and pain came with the extremely demanding physical training. After going to the doctor he learns out of the blue that he has a terrible prognosis. He is knocking at death's door. The cancer had spread to his lungs and his brain. 24 years old. A world-class athlete. Facing death.Lance takes us through his fight and the reader will learn a lot about the disease, what it does, and what is used to fight it. After he beat Cancer with a combination of foods and 4 cycles of Chemo therapy, he recovered, then returned to training. The cancer and it's destructive effect made me cringe and Armstrong described the chemicals, methods, and side-effects of chemotherapy.Caner: up close and personal. What it does to your body. How it kills. How Chemo kills you, and how it kills cancer. What is it like to look death in the face? Everyday. Most of us have not experienced this.Another scary scenario was that when he was diagnosed with Cancer and was to begin treatment to save his life, his insurance company refused to pay. He technically had no health insurance, even though he had had medical insurance (he was switching jobs and there was contractual &quot;fine print&quot;). Only in America.After he beat the odds, he got back into Cycling: Victories started to come again. Armstrong eventually triumphed in the Tour De France, the most demanding of all Cycling competitions. People had wrote him off as dead. When he returned to Cycling, some previous sponsors would not even tough him. They thought he was finished.After Armstrong's success, funny, that the French media began spurring rumors and unfounded allegations that Armstrong was taking performance enhancers, without having any proof at all. In fact, Armstrong was one of the very few Cyclists to live and train in France, which has the most comprehensive drug testing laws regarding athletes in all of Europe, while other riders trained elsewhere, avoided the possibility of random tests. Yet, the French media had to start false rumors.Armstrong noted the suburban isolation of the &quot;soul-deadened&quot; alienation of the suburb, Plano, Texas. Home to wealthy polo shirt wearing country-club members, yet Plano has one of the highest rates of teen heroin addiction and teen suicide in the U.S.&quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; will make you think...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was easily the best book I have ever read. You honestly do not have to know anything about biking or even like the sport. This book is about way more. You feel simpathetic and have a great respect for Lance Armstrong after reading it. It is amazing what all he went through and what is even more amazing is how he survied it all. I highly recomend this book to everyone that can read. Your whole life prospective will change after reading it. It is a must have"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I didn't expect to finish this in a mere 24 hour time period and I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I know virtually nothing about pro bike racing except that I've heard of Lance, obviously.Reading the book, you can just picture exactly what Lance is like. He reminds me of an irritating stubborn brother, but one you can't help but love and admire. It seems hard to imagine, but he explains how cancer was something POSITIVE that happened to him. You have to read the book to understand what he's talking about.The book has also made me more likely to watch the Tour de France next year. I never knew it's such a chess game and so grueling!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book truly isn't about the bike, it is about life, family, cancer, courage, compassion, fear, commitment, and a host of trials, tribulations and successes. It is an inside look at the man who won the Tour de France and the challenges and obstacles that he had to overcome. The book is well worth reading, even if some of Armstrong's comments do appear to be somewhat on the macho side.From his youth to his recovery from testicular cancer, this is the story of a man whose greatest victory was not in a bicycle race but in the battle for his life. The majority of the book deals with his fight against cancer, and throughout the book, the reader will marvel at his courage, emotional strength and unwavering family support. For anyone who has cancer, this book will, no doubt, be inspiring; however, those who have escaped this horrific disease will benefit from the lessons learned. They will realize that life takes on a new meaning. One has a deeper understanding of how important it is to live each and every day to the fullest, to appreciate the simple things in life - a beautiful sunset, the smile of a child, the touch of a gentle hand, and the importance of living for today and doing whatever good one can possibly do, for tomorrow belongs to no one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An interesting book about the simple life of a sportsman fighter.His cancer ,pain ,fight,love and anguish.Easy to read its a good reading for young people who have there projects of life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an exceptional biography. There is nothing this book witheld. I read it quickly and cherished every moment. I cried, and cheered and laughed, and I was proud to be an American and a Texan. What courage and determination this young man portrays. I feel like I know him; like he's my friend. A remarkable story indeed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book chronicles bicyclist Lance Armstrong's battle with cancer and his return to professional bicycle racing. Lance Armstrong is a 4-time winner of the Tour de France, husband, father and most importantly a cancer survivor.The book is very interesting, but does include offensive language."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It;s not about the bike is a typical, supposedly inspirational, typical \\"american dream\\" book. It is just another book written by a typical American for other typical americans.Yes sure to fight cancer and then win the most difficult road race on earth is amazing, but not as amazing as this book makes it out to be. Lance Armstrong was privileged as a child - he had the opportunity to become what he became! People who do not have the opportunity (the money maybe) to pursue their talents and then to create an opportunity, and in the end, win, THAT's inspirational! This book is about Lance Armstrong, and only about how great Lance Armstrong is, period. It is boring and uninteresting - just another person's life story, except this one had talent and used it - yay! for him!Sorry to be so cynical, americans should wake up out of their perfect little \\"american dream\\" world, and maybe read about something that describes what is really going on in this world, and maybe even something that is really inspiring!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Can we all get our money back? What a book full of lies. Why is this even published now? Good going Lance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The events described in this book are mostly fiction. A true account would describe a mediocre cyclist who couldn't win a race without cheating. So he made it his life's work to be a cheater, liar and fraud. More like a gangster than a competitor, he bullied, attacked and sued anyone who dared speak the truth. He organized a drug ring within the U.S. team, so that his teammates would be as fraudulent as himself, and he would be able to keep them in constant fear of being exposed. There is no winning behavior in this story. It is a sad and vile tale of pathological liar corrupted by greed and evil. This is not about surviving cancer, it is about being a cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's \\"It's Not About the Bike\\" resonates with the boundless, Tour de France-winning energy of its author. Armstrong tells his story with honesty and simplicity in a way that made me want to hear and know more, and not shrink back from the details of what it's like to have testicular cancer. As he talked about the person he was before and after fighting cancer, I could feel the post-cancer Lance emerge in the book - a person who woke up to what a difference people make in our lives, and what a difference we make to other people and to ourselves. I really like the following quote from the book: \\"The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt --more than any experience I\`ve had as an athlete--is that we are much better than we know.\\"I owe a great thanks to a reviewer of this book from Jersey City. The review spurred me on to read this book as well as another book she recommended \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. I've read many books that have pointed the way to a great life, but this one went right tothe heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in the places you'd like get out of, but getting into the moment will set you free. Don't miss either of these books."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For those not inclined to reading anything, this is a quick read, not because it is simplistic (which it is not), but rather because the story is engrossing and ultimately, uplifting. For those not knowledgable about the world of competitive cycling, after reading this book you may find yourself tuning into this summer's Tour de France just to watch Lance do what he does best - living life.From the opening sentence, Lance Armstrong makes it clear to his audience that this is not a book about the Tour de France (even though it is the subject of the longest chapter in the book), nor about cycling (though it serves as the constant backgrop of his story). Lance takes you with him, day by day, into his personal struggle with cancer, chemo, and near death. But he also shares the romance of finding true love and the personal gratification of winning the ultimate cycling challenge, the Tour de France. The book is filled with personal lessons found previously in other writings such as &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; - enjoy life, love those close to you, never quit.In a time when role models are scarce, Lance Armstrong emerges as a true hero for all generations."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a biography, this book is clearly a total fraud. As the fiction we now know it to be, it is mediocre at best. Sally Jenkins got played like the rest of us. The difference is we get it while she is still delusional in her defense of this creep."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After the events of the last few weeks, it's obvious to all that this is a complete and utter fabrication. Lies upon lies. Deceit upon deceit. DO NOT BUY. Every cent Armstrong earns from this book should go straight to the people he aggressively sued and took money from. You're right, Lance, it's not about the bike. It's about the disgraceful, unethical lie you lived and the arrogant swagger you had for so long. No more. No more."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Wow! I just now finished the last page of Lance Armstrong's incredible story, and I had to share my thoughts and feelings. At several times throughout reading this book, I found tears welling up in my eyes (a bit self-consciously, as I did most of the reading in public places). I was touched and moved by the honesty of Lance's telling of all the aspects of his experience, as a champion bike-racer and as the conqueror of an almost-surely fatal disease, but mostly of his growth and unfolding as a person, his expanded awareness of the difference he has made and continues to make in peoples' lives.In the last chapter, Lance says &quot;The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt--more than any experience I've had as an athlete--is that we are much better than we know. We have unrealized capacities that sometimes only emerge in crisis.&quot;This statement sums up the sense he gives throughout the book, that it is not in fame or unparalled achievement that we can experience life's greatest satisfaction, but in the simple connections with our fellow human beings, in sharing our weaknesses and strengths, our joys and fears, life's daily triumphs over whatever &quot;obstacles&quot; appear. It is a lesson in living day by day, moment by moment, and not giving up, no matter what.I expecially enjoyed the description of traveling in Europe with his future wife during his recuperation from chemotherapy, and really seeing the places that he had only raced in before, experiencing them in a totally new and unexpected way, by sharing them with the love of his life and seeing them through her eyes.Another book that has profoundly impacted my life is &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work, a book about Instantaneous Transformation&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. In a remarkably open and relaxed style, the Kanes explore through their own experiences what is possible when living in the moment, which is: love, satisfaction, joy, health, wealth, success in business and personal relationships, and freedom from the mechanical patterns that we all acquire as we grow up. I have seen all of these aspects blossom in my own life, without &quot;working on&quot; them, since reading the Kane's book. I am embracing the miraculous life that shows up every day, rather than bemoaning the one I thought I should have had. Buy and read this book! It's a personal handbook on having a great life!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in one day because it was damn good. I wanted to covet every word written; it's about hope, it's about survival and it helps to know a little about the most grueling athletic event in the world - the Tour de France. How this man survived a major illness with a 2% chance of survival and got on his bike the very next year and won is a force of determination beyond human comprehension."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was filed under \\"Sport\\" and \\"Biography\\", but should instead be under \\"Fiction\\" and \\"Fantasy\\". Good read once you get that sorted."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"read this 10 years ago. what a liar he is. he used EPO and other performance enhancing drugs to win 7 titles. they were recently stripped from him. amazon please take this book off your shelves."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read the book, what a fake, fiction at best and can only say, better books to be read, better time to be spent."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"While most people are probably somewhat familiar with the Lance Armstrong story, assuming he's like other professional athletes who have encountered adversity would be such an underestimation of this incredible man. His story, written in first person style sounding very much like he probably speaks, is awe-inspiring. He doesn't gloss over those years when he acted a bit like a jerk, or ignored coaching advice. He's honest with his readers when he speaks of past mistakes which are probably rooted in an unclear vision of who he really is. The cancer that almost killed him he now describes as \\"the best thing that ever happened to me\\". He doesn't spare any detail when describing how sick he was, nor does he try to make us think he was some big tough guy cancer patient, putting on a happy face through countless days of torture. His cancer story is very real, and this is a person that could not have come much closer to death. But he chose to embrace life, and it was this choice that brought about all the changes that made him who he is today. Anyone who is procrastinating about anything in life needs to read this book for that kick in the butt that will get them moving. Need to lose a little weight? Change jobs? Run that first 5k? Get out of a bad relationship? READ THIS BOOK. You will realize how soft your life is, and how choosing to LIVE, rather than exist, will make you the best person you can be. Oops, did I make this sound like a self help book? It's not at all, just an inspiring account of one person's life and how he fought back to become, in my humble opinion, the world's greatest athlete, and an amazing person. He is on the verge of winning his 4th Tour deFrance. Listen to what he says when he does, it will tell you what kind of person Lance Armstrong really is."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book on a whim. I am not a cyclist nor have I really followed the sport. Inspite of that, I found Lance Armstrong's biography to be incredibly inspiring. I read it while on a plane coming back from Jamaica and found myself utterly enthralled with his story of self-discovering and growth that gained as a cancer survivor. I was also moved by the parallels he described in battling the pethelon and conqueoring cancer. His love for the bike and what it has brought to his life is equally impressive. I felt as though I was with him as decribed cycling through harsh weather, pain and all the wonderous nature of the French countyside.Oncology nurse Ms. Latrice Haney, whom he calls a real life angel, was also inspiring. Her dedication to her patient and her profession was moving. If am ever sick, I also hope encounter an angel like her.Life is miracleous. Lance Armstrong's testimony bears witness to this fact."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a lie. Lance Armstrong cheated his way to 7 Tour wins and used his money, power, and fame to bully anyone who dared speak the truth about his drug use. I can get over the cheating and lying in a sport where most riders did the same. But the bullying is another issue. The bullying of former best friends, trusted colleagues, and others who literally gave their all to put Lance on the podium is despicable. This shows his true character and anyone in the press who continues to support him should take a good long look in the mirror."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a long-time and obsessed cyclist, and huge fan of the sport, I picked up this book as a feel-good prelude to this year's Tour. However, upon completing it, I find myself surprisingly conflicted.On the one hand, it would laughably arrogant to say that Lance is not an admirable person. He is peerless as a cyclist, tireless in his training, relentlessly determined to win and has become one of the sport's true sportsmen over the years, most famously by pausing on a fierce mountain stage of the Tour to allow his main rival, Jan Ullrich, rejoin him after a crash. His fight with cancer was nothing short of heroic, as was his desire to help others by setting up a foundation and charity event.And if you doubt the man's courage, consider this: in his mid-20s, he could have retired quite comfortably. He would have been recalled as a hero, a world champion cyclist and brave cancer survivor. He had the wife of his dreams, the house of his dreams and could have made a very tidy living as an inspirational speaker and cancer spokesperson. What's more, he would have collected almost $2 million in disability for sitting on his butt, playing golf and drinking beer-I don't have to tell you what I would have done. Instead he threw away the money and gambled everything for what at best looked like a few years of obscure mediocrity as a domestique.If that's not guts, I don't know what is.However, on the other hand, I found his portrayal of himself as a lonely, hard-luck outsider absolutely absurd and moreover, insulting to both himself and the mere mortals who have faced some of his struggles.Lance's days as an outsider ended the moment he won his first triathlon. The day he started crossing the line minutes ahead of his rivals, he stopped being one of us and became the ultimate insider--he became Lance. He whines about the tough life he had growing up, but let's face it: he was mommy's special little man from the get go and never truly went without. He may not have played football, but he was a star athlete in every sense of the word, making an adult's salary at 15 and driving a fancy car throughout high school. Once he graduated, his life was almost completely managed by a cadre of professionals and powerbrokers, the connections were made, the money poured in and the models had their hearts broken.And again, while it would be obscene to minimize his cancer experience, he did have it better than many. Lots of people get cancer, lots of people don't have health insurance, but few people have white knight CEOs blackmailing insurance companies to pay their bills, a tribe of lawyers and corporate honchos flitting around in jets to cater to their every need, or the top cancer specialists in the nation tripping over each other to treat them.So in ready this book, I found Lance almost greedy; isn't it enough to be a genetic superman, a champion, a survivor, an inspiration, a hero? Why do you also have to a victim? What about those of us who do that first race and come in last? Who never win? Who never get sponsored or trained or handled and still keep at it? What about the cancer victims with no insurance who quietly die a slow, painful death, leaving their families in debt? If you're an outsider, and underdog, a victim, what does that make them?So in reading this I found Lance's life to be extraordinary, a triumph, an inspiration. I only wished he'd acknowledged this good fortune, taken the chip off his shoulder and left it behind for someone who really deserved it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Now in January 2013, Lance Armstrong has been backed into a corner and has finally confessed to using drugs and doping in all seven of his Tour de France wins and has admitted that he is a bully and liar. George W. Bush and Lance Armstrong are good friends. Now we see why: they both are pathological liars who don't mind destroying people's lives. Can we believe Armstrong's version of his struggle with cancer or is it filled with exaggerations and fabrications?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If Lance Armstrong isn't the Greatest Sports Hero Ever, who is? Those overpaid ballplayers with gold chains who think they're heroes if they play with the sniffles? Lance Armstrong came back from DEATH to win the world's most grueling sports event three times in a row. And the only chain Armstrong wears was given to him by his friend who later died of cancer.Although Lance Armstrong gets the byline, the book was obviously written by his talented co-author, Sally Jenkins. But the combination of Lance's inspirational story and Sally's engaging writing is unbeatable. Sally weaves Lance's Texas childhood, his horrifying experience with cancer and his European cycling career into a compelling story of man's triumph over adversity. I competed against Armstrong in his first Triathlon in Dallas and can assure you that this book describes cycling perfectly. And, as the clich&eacute; goes, a Hollywood producer could not have invented a better story.Lance Armstrong remains his own person. He doesn't pander to the press, hawk merchandise or make stupid appearances at the local mall. He leads by example and gives hope to cancer patients. When you're shopping for sunglasses, remember how the CEO of Oakley forced his insurance carrier to cover Lance when he had lost his previous coverage. And what of Cofidis, the French company that dropped their sponsorship of Lance when he was coming back from cancer? Examples like this show us the true nature of companies and their leaders as opposed to their advertising, PR and celebrity endorsements.And while athletes like Patrick Ewing visited the Gold Club when he was at the last Olympics, Lance Armstrong is completely devoted to his wife and son. When Lance trains in Europe, he brings his family along. I wonder if Ewing took his family to Atlanta?The book deals with sensitive subjects like Lance's testicular cancer and the in vitro fertilization of his wife. However, there is no time for self-pity. Does the book idealize Lance relationship with his mother? Yes, but so what? It's not Lance's fault that he's the son of an angel.Some critics say this book is not about the bike but about Lance. Of course it is! It's his biography. And that Lance has been arrogant, self-absorbed and egotistical. So what? Can an underprivileged kid raised by a single mother climb to the top otherwise? And what do you think brought Lance back from death? My father says his attitude carried him through his own experience with cancer. Like my father, Lance just refused to give up. And they're both alive today. Those armchair experts who criticize Armstrong or accuse him of doping should watch bowling instead or maybe go for a little bike ride of their own.Every cancer patient, every cancer survivor and every person facing adversity can look up to Lance Armstrong. I've respected him since he dropped me in that Dallas triathlon years ago. My father admires this young guy who also beat death with a combination of luck and attitude. And we can all look up to Sally Jenkins for crafting such a wonderful book. This is one of the most inspirational stories of all time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars! This is one of the most inspirational biographies I have ever read, and comes from the truly remarkable life experiences of a determined young man. I loved every word!Early in the book, Lance Armstrong says &quot;. . . that cancer was the best thing that happened to me.&quot; He goes on to say, &quot;When I was sick I saw more beauty and triumph and truth in a single day than I ever saw in a bike race.&quot;Overcoming cancer and becoming an athletic champion in the grueling sport of bicycle racing require a toughness of spirit, mind, and body that is hard for most of us to imagine. This inspirational book portrays beautifully how one can start with the right spirit and overcome enormous obstacles.Although his doctors told him he had a 40 percent chance of surviving stage three testical cancer, this was mostly to keep his morale up. After he had recovered, his doctor admitted that is chances were around 3 percent, instead.While he was being treated for the cancer, no one thought that he might ever race again. He did decide to go through treatments that would leave open the possibility that his lungs (affected by the cancer) would still be functional and his coordination (through delicate brain surgery) would be unaffected. Within two years, he had won the Tour de France, a grueling race he had never done well in before he had cancer.Growing up, Lance Armstrong had little reason to suspect that he would become one of the world's greatest athletes. He was well into high school, still trying pretty unsuccessfully to make the football and swimming teams, before it became clear that he could become a significant cyclist. Pleased with the money that success brought, he had a tough time building the attitude of a champion to go with his remarkable endurance skills. Overcoming cancer helped him with that, as well as seeing the beauty around him.He met his wife at the press conference to announce the beginning of his foundation to fight cancer. They were married during his recovery, and recently became parents through the miracles of modern medicine.Of such wonderful stuff are role models made, something we have too few of these days.The story is told in a very open and matter-of-fact way. He is not trying to make himself into something that he isn't. Clearly, his purpose in writing this book is to help all of us fulfill our potential rather than to glorify himself.Please share this book with people who need this inspiration and encouragement to take on the pain of giving life all you've got."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is fascinating on several levels: First, it's a very frank analysis of Lance Armstrong and his rise from a less than ideal family situation to his perch atop the cycling world. Second, it's an amazing account of his mother's strength and devotion in raising a son, often as a single parent. Third, it's a troubling account of the overwhelming difficulties facing cancer patients -- from insurance runarounds to loss of jobs to contradictory assessment and treatment recommendations from the doctors entrusted with their care. This is truly an incredible story. Four years ago Armstrong dropped out of the Tour de France and bombed out at the Atlanta Olympics. Over the next year he discovered he had a very advanced form of testicular cancer,tumors in his lungs and two in his brain, underwent brain surgery and four rounds of chemotherapy. Not long after, he was competing in Europe again. The rest is well-known: Tour victories in '99 and 2000 and a real hope for Olympic gold this time around. This is a frank, well-written account of Armstrong's incredible journey. I think it may be especially well-received by those undergoing cancer treatment or their families. The story goes far beyond an account of two-wheeling through the Alps."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Even if you aren't normally interested in sports memoirs or medical-miracle tales, this combination of the two is well worth reading. It is informative, moving, and often funny account of Armstrong's battles both as an cyclist and as a patient, distinguished by his refusal to slip into arrogance as a champion or into self-pity as a cancer victim. Rather than recite platitudes, he tells us in fascinating and often gut-wrenching detail exactly what he has had to do to beat his cancer (I found the medical sections fascinating, as good as any science book you'll read on the subject). The cycling parts are, as you might suspect, a little bit lighter, but also very enjoyable. Buy this book. Read it. You'll be entertained, you'll be informed, and you might even be a little bit enlightened."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Teens and adults will enjoy this captivating and moving biography about Lance Armstrong. It's a roller coaster tale that takes readers through the highs and lows of Armstrong's life, beginning with the absence of his biological father, experiencing his mother's hardships to provide a decent living, adolescent struggles of acceptance and self-identity, maintaining personal relationships, disappointments and triumphs of becoming one of the best in professional bike racing, and the infamous battle to defeat Cancer. The story is told through the eyes of Lance himself, and readers will discover a refreshing candidness that makes this a revealing, provoking and inspirational book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"First of all, I wasn't sure about buying this book. I'm an avid cyclist and therefore felt obliged to buy this book as Lance had just won the third straight championship of the Tour de France.I ordered this book from Amazon along with few other books in different genre--beat poetry, real estate, investing, etc. I figured I'll read this book last, becasue I was never sure whether I should have really bought this book or not. I flipped though some pages as I took break from reading other books, and I just couldn't stop. I ended up reading this book in one sitting, before I finished reading any other book.This book really grabbed me by the heart. As the subtitle suggests, this book &quot;is not about the bike&quot;. I must admit that my interest in cycling helped me get into this book right at the onset. But as I read on, I really enjoyed this book as a &quot;story&quot; of one man.In that, I would like to send accoladates to Sally Jenkins, the co-author. The underlying story of Lance is definitely an excellent material for a book; however, Sally took the story to a higher level and made this book more novel-like, an excellent read for just about anybody.If you are a cyclist, you will definitely enjoy it. If you aren't, I THINK you'll also enjoy reading a wonderful story written in such beautiful verse.Oh by the way, I deducted one star because Sally's writing is so sensitive that it definitely downplayed the true jock-like character of Lance Armstrong. (OK, nothing is perfect.)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I FOUND HIS STORY TO BE VERY TOUCHING AND ONE THAT IN A WAY I CAN RELATE TO.

Lance survived cancer not because he was strong physically or spiritually, but because it was made to be so.His book taught us how to fight the negativity in our lives. He fights the good fight and afterward the Light shines upon his head. Human beings don't like to suffer, but sometimes it's good to have this kind of experience.I believe everyone of us experienced some kind of problem. If it's not sickness, it can be a friend or a member of your family who is trying to harm you. At this point, you need to have 1) faith, 2) self confidence, and 3) courage to face whatever obstacles that happen in life.Lance is a world class champion in biking, but now he has become one of the best humanists in the world.All human beings are scared of death. Who knows? Life might be better over there, where there is no jealousy, no envy, no enemy, no hatred."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I think this is one of the most amazing book about one og cycling's living legends.

I found a few inaccuracies, (such as when he stated he won the 1995 Clasica San Sebastian before the 1995 Tour, when in reality the Spanish race is in August or September, while the Tour de France takes place in July).These minor inaccuracies do nothing to detract from the far more powerful and more important part of his story, which is his struggle with testicular cancer, how he met and married his wife, and fathered a child, in addition to overcoming his disease and callous French employers and journalists who first thought he was finished as a professional cyclist, and when he proved that he wasn't, accused him of using drugs. Lance overcame all of these to win the 1999 Tour de France, 10 years after Greg LeMond's (the only other American to win the Tour) own incredible comeback after being shot and nearly losing his life in a hunting accident.Like the title says, &quot;It's not about the bike.&quot; This story should prove to be inspiring not only for bike riders and racers, but for cancer patients and anyone who has overcome ultimate adversity to achieve a dream."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I got this book for inspiration from a high-visibility athelete. I thought it would be interesting to read about Armstrong as a top representative of the athletic commmunity and a cancer survivor. Armstrong testified to his early problem childhood which I can understand. Frankly, though, I am glad he wasn't a neighbor! As I read along, I was hoping that his cancer experience and the blessing he had with remission would show in a changed person, somebody I would want to see emumlated in others and someone better for himself and his family/friends; someone who had truly changed and was thankful to the Almighty that he had gotten a second chance. He certainly had plenty of time and money to spend thinking about life. I waited and waited and finally gave up midway through the chapter on the Tour. His language was foul before and after his cancer and I wouldn't want a young person to read some of this stuff. I gave up when he added his own foul-mouthed enhancement to Matt Damon's answer to &quot;Do You Like Apples?&quot; in that chapter. This book could have been so much more to inspire those beseiged with cancer and for amateur athletes. Instead, it is a self-serving testimony of a boy high on himself."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One of the most amazing books I've ever read. Once you begin, you can't stop. An excelent opportunity to rethink your problems and focus on the good side of things."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was looking forward to reading Lance's book for a long time and was not disappointed when it became available.Being a competitive rider for over 20 years and having followed Lance's career and done the Ride For The Roses in Austin a few times, I thought I knew the story but I didn't. This book sets the record straight.From his difficult upbringing, his early days in Europe and then as his career began to take off, this is a great account of his story. The behind the scenes look at what he went through with his cancer treatment was a real eye opener.....Also some great accounts of the Tour, from his perspective.A great book for anyone who has been influenced by the accomplishments of Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is about surviving. It is about getting through the tough stuff and going on from there. The author appears to have achieved an understanding of his life and has chosen the direction to take from here. As the author states at the beginning it is not a pretty story. I highly recommend this book. It is especially insightful for those with a chronic disease. I found it inspiritional."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The appeal of this book should extend beyond the usual audience of bicycling enthusiasts. The story is compelling: man climbs the ladder of sports success only to be stricken with life-threatening disease. Man fights disease and returns to greater success.The prose manages to remain true to Lance's he-man attitude, but is also quite readable. The first chapter alone is a stunner. Definitely should be on your summer book list."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong shows us the entire range of his incredible life: stratospheric places where mere mortals cannot tread -- inside a peloton in the Tour de France -- and tortuous places -- the carpet inches away from his face --- where near-fatal levels of chemotherapy toxins force him to crawl to a bathroom sink to cough up blood. The levels of courage and generosity Lance shows are stupefying. This individual who defines excellence in a superhuman arena writes an entire book to say that it is neither his genetic heritage nor his good fortune nor his bad fortune that he has chosen to define his life. Rather it is his conviction that his life is his own, that plain incremental action is the tool to achieve that life, and it is his actions that define it. Author Philip Gourevitch in the July 1993 issue of Harper's says,&quot;The absolute ...is a treacherous place to seek lessons. By definition, it does not yield. Like the God of Exodus, it is what it is and it shall be what it shall be. For that reason, the absolute is useless as metaphor. It is incomparable.&quot;Cancer is an incomparable occurrence in anyone's life, as nonsensical as an asteroid strike. There is no way to compare it by any standard of fairness, humanity, or reason. But there is great value in adapting, growing and becoming stronger. Lance says that in the face of adversity, the concept of acting heroically and the strategy of plea bargaining soon resonate with the thud of pewter. Simple, definitive action gets the job done. Los Angeles psychiatrist Robert J. Elstad says, &quot;We experience ourselves by what we do.&quot; Lance Armstrong says, &quot;Move.&quot; A fascinating glimpse into the life of an excellent member of our species."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a winner. Lance brings you through every aspect of his thoughts and feelings. I could not put this book down. If you are not touched by what he has to say, then you must be dead. What a great read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished this book and I can honestly say that I have not been so emotionally moved by any other book. Of course I am a huge LA fan but this book will take you through emotions comparable to the ascents and descents of the Alps and Pyrennes encountered in the Tour de France. Bold and matter of fact writing that keeps you interested from cover to cover. Great insight into two of the most brutal struggles put to man-the Tour de France and cancer. As the book says,&quot;VIVA LANCE!&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"just an amazing book. Lance's battle and story he has to tell is just amazing. A must for any cyclist or anyone interested in bike racing, and learning about Lance Armstrong"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book on a Friday and had it finished by Saturday afternoon. Each chapter presents a new stage and an identifiable struggle, which is every bit as tangible as the challenges life serves us, even to given athletes. By the end, you will have experienced the struggle and may even taste a bit of the success brought by the '99 Tour De France rider, Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in one day. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It WASN'T just about the bike-- it was about Lance's struggles--his trials and tribulations as a person. I truly hope Lance Armstrong wins again on the bike, and continues to &quot;win&quot; in life. I recommend this book! I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A well-written, compelling human interest story. I'm an avid cyclist; my wife is not. But we both devoured the book in one weekend. Long-time fans of Lance will appreciate the insights into his life both on and off the bike. Those who know nothing about bicycle racing will get a very readable introduction to a great sport. And anyone who knows and loves someone with cancer will appreciate the warm and human portrayal of those who face this all-too-common disease with courage and hope. This is a great book for anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Have you ever wondered if it is possible to survive cancer and become a famous athlete? Well in the book Lance Armstrong written by himself along with Sally Jenkins just that happened. Lance got cancer when he was at the height of his biking career. Fortunately, he was able to recover and start his career again from scratch, not even knowing if his cancer was going to come back. This book represents a good role-model,is new, and is full of details. I really liked this book and I would recommend it to anyone to read.One reason this book is so good is because is represents a good role-model. If everyone was like Lance, we would be living in a perfect world. Everyone would be full of motivation and get around any obstacle that gets in their way. Crimes would be washed away and crimes would fall along with them. Everybody needs a little Lance Armstrong inside of them.Another reason this book is so good is because it is so different. This book is much different then any other book because the author tells you everything. The author even tells you personal information that most other author's wouldn't share with the reader. Lance's life is also different than many other lives because many people don't live through cancer then build up a healthy life again. I found the diversity of this book very interesting because I learned many new things and didn't hear what I expected. This book is really different than most other books.This book was filled with many details which makes it very exciting and interesting. The book gives you Lance Armstrong's entire life story within such a small book and still makes you feel like you know everything about him. The detail are so clear and precise, they make you feel part of the book and experience Lanes life along with him. This book was really interesting with all of it's details.Readers will enjoy Lance Armstrong. The book represents a good role-model, is different, and is filled with many details. If you are tired of reading the same old books with the same old endings, this is the book for you. This excellent book is perfect for anyone and should be read over and over again!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was an amazing book. Lance did such a great job writing it. He did indeed give credit to those who deserved it. His life story touched my heart. As an runner and biker I can relate to him. However anyone, whether you are an athlete or not, will view life differently as you read about his couragous battle with cancer and his journey back to his bike and life. I can't say enough great things about this book. I think everyone should own a copy!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Yes, this is really that type of book. I know that I echo most of the opinions here when I say that it was hard to put this book down. Hardly fifteen pages would go by where I didn't get my eyes all watery - this book is triumphantly emotional, heroic, fascinating.Lance isn't the best person on Earth, and he doesn't hide it. Yet he's strong, and always a fighter, and succeeds despite having all the odds placed against him.This is not a complete, exhaustive biography. It's a quick-paced read - no unnecessary details are included, just what's easily digestible and most interesting. No wonder this book was on the New York Times bestseller list for so long; it's easily a crowd pleaser.I was disappointed a bit in the last chapter, because Lance doesn't delve into much detail about his Olympic experience in Sydney. But who cares - I got more bike and Tour de France excitement than I thought I would. At times, Lance puts you on the seat and tells you how painful, how incredibly arduous it can be to climb thousands of feet of mountains, pedal at speeds of up to 70 mph, and stay on the bike accident-free for 7 hours a day.Amid all the remarkable stories in the book, some are especially worthwhile. When Lance had cancer and his insurance wouldn't cover him because of a pre-existing condition, the CEO of Oakley, one of his sponsors, stood by him and told his insurer to cover Lance or he'd take his business elsewhere. They covered him.The back cover, and other reviewers, tell you exactly what you need to know: it doesn't matter if you love or hate sports, or even if you've heard of Lance. This book will touch you because it's very human, very real, and very relevant to our days."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I simply could not put this book down. I stayed up until the wee hours following Lance's childhood adventures, his preliminary successes, his youthful brashness, his discovery and struggle with testicular cancer and his long road to recovery. Every part of the narrative is gripping -- his struggle with cancer (he was one of the most severe cases the doctors had ever seen) is brutally described from the chemo \\"poison\\" to the horrible catheter which practically became a part of his body. Although he doesn't lionize himself, his struggle and conquest has to be an inspiration for all who have suffered with the disease. I love biking too (although for me an hour is a long ride -- Lance says real bikers don't bother to take out there bikes if it's for under 5 hours) so I loved the descriptions of his training and races, particularly his focus on climbing mountain after mountain in the freezing rain to prepare for the Tour de France.In short, this book will give anyone an appreciation for athletic endeavors, but more important for the human spirit. We are spared no details of the medical horrors - a soberting account. Plus, I worship his wife Kik after reading how she dealt with all the various moves and life events. She's even more of a hero at times than Mr. Armstrong proving the maxim that behind every great man is a great woman."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have melanoma and bought this book with an eye toward my own issues. Unlike dozens of other books that have been given to me or purchased, this one &quot;tells it like it is.&quot; It was great! Lance Armstrong has an amazing ability to capture the essence of the experience, whether bike riding or cancer. I found myself re-reading passages to help me clarify my own thinking. I am very grateful that this book exists."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's biography is one of the best told stories, and most exciting, that I have ever read. It starts out with the chapter \\"before and After\\", this chapter tells about the basis of his life as a star athlete and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He then goes on to tell about his childhood and his gimped family. He grew up without a father, and with a young, not so wealthy mom. He tells about his struggles as a kid and how his mom was always there for him. He also tells how he came by his first racing bike and the triathlons he was in with it. He talks about his first races and how inexprienced he was. When he became more exprienced, he started to win some races then he started to win almost all of his races.His career was very successful, although he was very young. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 25, on October the second. His testicular cancer wasn't just in his testicle, it had spread into his lungs and his brain. While reading about the Chemotherapy treatments he had to undergo, I felt as if though I could relate to him. He told about how scary it was to go through with his brain and testicle surgeries, and how hard it was to be sterile. After he was done with his treatments, he met and married a girl named \\"Kik\\". She was there when he was planning to race in the \\"Tour De France\\". He wrote about his training and his struggle to get on a team. It was very exciting to read about him winning the tour. Lance Armstrong then had a son with Kik, and proceeded to race in the next years Tour De France, which he won again. He then took the Bronze in the 2000 summer olympics.Lance Armstrong tells his story so well, I could imagine every situation he was writing about. He describes things in a way that readers can really understand him. And he doesn't describe anything too much so that the reader would get bored. He writes with inspiration for those who ever were against odds. If the reader has cancer, I believe this book is perfect for them. Even if the reader is a normal everyday person this book shows us how to appreciate and live life to the fullest. If I learned one thing from this book its to never give up. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been against the odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"just finished the book. i could not put it down. i am a cycling fan and the in depth portrayal blew away my romanticism about the tour de france. i am also striving like most people to be a decent human being. lance's sbook does not hold out on the truth. he is honest and factual about life and the struggle we all endure. i am sure i am not alone in feeling humbled by this amazing man's survival against the odds. i feel i have a duty much to the publishers horror, to pass this book on to the next needy soul i meet. we all need a lance armstrong in this world. he is an extraordinary human being with an extraordinary story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a tour de France, I mean, a tour de force. While reading, it was like he was right there talking to me. I enjoyed the book so much that when it ended I felt sad that I would no longer be able to listen to Lance speaking to me. His last sentence was like poetry: \\"I keep riding, into the highest peering hills...\\" I know nothing about biking, but his descriptions made it fascinating. And his description of his battle with cancer held me glued to the book. What a nice experience to be able to spend time with this great man! Thank you, Gutenberg."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is truly interesting and inspirational. I picked it up one Saturday evening and was finished by Monday morning. Armstrong's honesty is refreshing and, at times, shocking as he tells the story of his past, his fight with cancer, the grueling road to recovery, and his many journies. He captured my attention and my heart as he described his rides through the European mountansides, US plains, his love, marriage, and fear of never being able to ride again. A must read for all who need a pick me up, or a reminder of how wonderful and fragile this life is. Guaranteed to please!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a definite page-turner that starts with his childhood through his first victory at the Tour de France. I now feel a renewed sense of admiration for the sport of cycling, which has been marred by blood doping and other scandals. To read a book about someone who was nearing the top of his sport before being stricken down and then coming back to reach a higher level of performance will certainly inspire hope and growth in its readers in some way or another."},{"Title":"Treasures of Womanhood: Timeless Words of Faith and Inspiration","review":"should set off warning lights in your head. This book is not terrible but my advise is to pass on it. You see, this book was terribly boring. I found it neither timeless or inspirational. I find it pathetic when a book has to feed the reader the review in it's title. This book revels in own mediocrity. She is nothing more than a pleasant mormon writer."},{"Title":"Treasures of Womanhood: Timeless Words of Faith and Inspiration","review":"I was given this book by my mother when I visited her in Provo, UT. It is virtually impossible to find outside of that State! I think it was purchased at a deseret book store. Here are some tales that will reacquaint women with a sense of what it is to be one! Only a woman with a firm sense of her own power as a woman could have written it. You can bet I will be checking into other books she has written. I made my husband read it too!"},{"Title":"The Port Chicago Mutiny","review":"This excellent book details the aftermath of the Port Chicago ammunition ship explosions during WW2, with particular emphasis on the \\"mutiny\\" of Black sailors detailed to handle the loading of ammunition ships. Those familiar with Port Chicago will find the book brings back details of the operations there, which had changed substantially in the years leading up to the Vietnam Era, and will provide interesting insights to the way Black sailors were treated. Their tragic end and the sacrifices of those who organized and participated in their work-stoppage made ammunition handlingsafer for those who came after them, and as an ammunition ship sailor once assigned to Port Chicago, I'm included. A movie was made which closely follows this book's story."},{"Title":"The Port Chicago Mutiny","review":"I give Allen credit for writing about a little known event in our nation's and WWII history. This was the explosion caused by the mishandling of ammunition at the Port Chicago Naval Station in California. Over 300 people died as a result of this explosion, the majority of them black ammunition handlers. When the Navy tried to redirect the remaining black ammunition handlers to another yard, they refused to handle any more ammunition. If I were them, I would too. The Navy then selected a representative 50 of the 250 soldiers who refused to handle any more ammunition, and court martialed them with long prison sentences. That was injustice.This is an interesting story. However, Allen's leftist rantings tended to alienate the reader from the story. Bob, most people agree that what the U.S. Navy did to these 50 sailors was wrong, but why slant the story so radically. Allen's writings was not as smooth as most writers, so I tended to slog through this very interesting story. The story could have been better written and the slant should have been left out. More detail about the explosion could also have been included in this short book, without slighting the main theme of discrimination of the U.S. Navy."},{"Title":"The Port Chicago Mutiny","review":"Credit to the author for bringing to light a little-known incident of WWII. The problem is point of view; written from a sociological point of view rather than an historical point of view. Other reviewers give you the jist of the book so I won't go there. The author misses the point that all the armed forces were segregated during WWII, as was society in general. Blacks in the Navy were routinely assigned as stevedores [in the Storekeeper Rating] or messmen, stewards, and cooks. Unfair, of course, but we can't allocate present day values to the past, I believe that's called \\"presentism\\" and should be avoided when doing history or semi-history. There has been a question concerning Port Chicago; was it a mutiny as mutiny is understood in military law? An individual refusing to obey a direct order is somewhat different than an entire group refusing to obey a direct order. When you have group action refusal; that would, in most cases, be considered mutiny. Military law is very different from civilian law for obvious reasons. The military has never been a democracy, and never will be. The armed forces were desegregated by President Truman in 1949, sort of. The Navy was probably the last service to fully comply and some ratings were still closed to Filipinos until the late 60's. There were various layers of responsibilty at Port Chicago and violations of about every standard concerning handling ordinance. A more interesting book would have focused on any investigation done, or not done. It would appear from the extent of the explosion that the men were loading fused ammunition which is not done under any circumstances. If that was the case, those responsible, from the captain on down would have been immediately relieved of duty and faced criminal charges [dereliction of duty]. A mutiny trial may have brought all that to light, which is probably why there was no mass mutiny trial of all the participants.

Pardoning them befouls the good names of the men that died there and the other 200+ men who went back to work. This whole movement is simply an NAACP backed propaganda story to later recover some monitary value from the Navy and the government. It's ridiculous! Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"This is an earlier work by John Toland about the gangsters of the early Depression period such as Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde. Surprisingly for Toland, who military histories have been well reviewed, this book seems to fail both as a history and a narrative. It seems jumbled and meanders at times. There are other good histories of this period and I so I wouldn't recommend this book for the casual non-fiction reader."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"If this were 1963, I'd advise you to buy this book. However, it's 2007, and while John Toland did an admirable job researching his material and visiting the various sites made notorious by the public enemies whose exploits he depicted, the fact is that much of the book's contents is old news and simply inaccurate. A fantastic read at the time, but, simply, outdated today."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"When first published in 1963, Toland's The Dillinger Days seemed to be the definitive work on the public enemy era, as both a biography of John Dillinger and as a sweeping chronicle of the whole Midwest Depression crime wave, also including &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd, &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson, the Barker-Karpis gang, &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly and Clyde Barrow. Indeed, Toland may even be credited with launching a revival of interest in the Barrow gang. The scattered passages on the Barrows, whose fleeting fame was largely forgotten outside Texas by 1963, was largely the inspiration for the later movie Bonnie and Clyde. Toland's main subject here was of course Dillinger and the sections on the other gangs are scantier and often erroneous. Errors also appear in the Dillinger chapters. The &quot;second Dillinger gang&quot; was really &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson's, which Dillinger joined after the Crown Point escape, the exact details of which will never be known with full certainty though subsequent research--by Girardin and Helmer, Joe Pinkston and others--indicates that Toland got it wrong. The &quot;Dillinger&quot; letter to Henry Ford was long ago proven a forgery. As a straight Dillinger biography, Toland's book is actually far less detailed and accurate than the slimmer work, nearly contemporary with his own, Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life by Robert Cromie and Joe Pinkston. Still, as a history of the Depression crime wave, it was about the best volume available in 1963. Subsequent research has turned up much new information in recent years. Other authors have corrected Toland's errors. But the fact remains that Toland's work inspired a great deal of this research. Many of us gangster buffs got our start with Toland's book, so a lot of the new information available today probably wouldn't have surfaced without it. And for all its flaws, Toland's book remains a useful starting point for anyone interested in the gangster era--the Dillinger days."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"I can't comment on the veracity of Tolands account, so this review deals with the book's impact on someone reading about the 30's American Gangster era for the first time. The book is fast &amp; furious. It has a style &amp; pace that seems totally in sync' with the wild events &amp; full-blooded characters involved. Dillinger &amp; Company come alive here. The accounts were thrilling, detailed &amp; totally enjoyable. Although the author is commendably non-judgemental, not unsurprisingly, Dillinger comes over as the Class-Act of the the mobs. Whilst he certanly had a style, I use the word &quot;class&quot; with some reservation! The rest were just out &amp; out villians! I was pleased to see the lawmen get a fair share of the action. The dedication &amp; bravery of these men is in the most part commendable &amp; a credit to their profession. The thought of facing up to a gang, including such vicious characters as Baby Face Nelson &amp; Homer Van Meter, armed to the teeth with automatic weapons, is chilling indeed. The bank escapes give the reader a good feel of the times. It seemed that a five minute chase from any city centre bank would find the fugitives deep inside a maze of unmade roads. An almost total lack of communication between law enforcers, plus State Line jusridiction restrictions made the already fraught pursuit of these characters difficult indeed. I thoroughly enjoyed the book &amp; recommend it very highly. I also agree that it is a good &quot;appetite whetter&quot; for more books of similar genre."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"I give &quot;The Dillinger Days&quot; by John Toland 3-Stars for research and photography. Although this book is not the most accurate, it does display information that was available at the time of this publication. Today we have a better factual picture on events of the Dillinger era. Over the years many have bred mythology, speading fictitious imaginary stories creating false beliefs. However, I have to agree with historian and author Rick Mattix, The Dillinger Days is a good starting point for first time Dillinger readers. Good Book!"},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"In the late sixties, when the popularity of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; at the box office ushered in a renewed interest in the period, this book was a compelling, concise account of a period when some of history's most ruthless criminals became cult heroes. From Machine Gun Kelley and John Dillinger to the Barrows and Pretty Boy Floyd, the Depression spawned its own brand of anti-heroes, placing them forever in a crude infamy of greed and murder. Toland is an excellent storyteller of the War era and plies his trade to new levels in this book. A highly recommended read to anyone interested in the period or exploits of some of American history's criminal element."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"This fast-paced narrative looks at underworld life in the USA during the Great Depression of the 1930's, when bank robbers were considered folk heroes by a surprising number of persons. It's primarily the story of John Dillinger and his gang, known for prison breaks and bank holdups. Dillinger was an anti-hero and celebrity (he played the role to the hilt) as were certain other criminals of that era such as Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd. Readers get a feel for the criminals, the top FBI personnel on their trails, and for life during the hard times of the Depression. Alas, many came to a violent end, suffering the same fate as some of their victims.Author/Historian John Toland (1912-2004) had a way with gripping prose, and this effort is no exception. Some attack this book for glamorizing vicious criminals, while others point to a handful of inaccuracies. Whatever your take, this book still makes very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"I already have plenty of Dillinger books decided to get this anyways. Best decision I could of ever made on a book. This is kind of like public enemies if you've read that but way better, easier read, more info and more accurate information. I've been trying to find a book on the Karpis-Barker gang and so far this is the best I've seen. Although I am confused now because all the books I've read said Ma Barker was a sweet old lady that new nothing of their criminal lives. This book is totally the opposite saying she mastermind alot of the bank jobs and even got her hands dirty in killing her ex- husband (I think thats what he was) Dunlope. So know I gotta figure it out myself."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"All of John Toland's histories enthrall the reader, with a kind of \\" you are there\\" feeling. The Dillinger Days puts you right there with John Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde, Ma Barker... It is at once entertaining and highly enlightening. EXCELLENT !"},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"John was pretty much on the money in dexcribing that this is not a book entirely about Dillinger but about the crime wave that hit the Midwest in the mid 30's and the various gangsters that were a part of it. My complaint about the book is that it read more as a travel log or calendar of events of the various gangs exploits, ie Dillinger and company went there, robbed bank, went here to hide out. It does not in any detail investigate the personal motivations of each of the gangsters or the people that helped and sympathized with them or the social situation in the country that helped spawn them. In other words, its not a very deep book. If you are looking for a timeline or an introduction to the events that made up this period in US history, its ok. If you want to understand why it occured, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"this book was a bit disappointing because the author seemed more intrested in making it into a fantasic entertaining story than giving you correct facts."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days","review":"John Toland is probably best-known for his military histories, particularly those dealing with World War II. He is often praised for his narrative style, but has been criticized for his occasional lapses in historical rigor. Both commentaries apply to The Dillinger Days. Though it primarily deals with John Dillinger, this book encompasses all of the major figures of the Depression-era crime wave, including Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barker gang, among many others. Toland gives more than adequate background on all of the major players and their various associates, and does an excellent job of keeping the reader from getting confused by the large and revolving cast of characters. He also is on point when it comes to humanizing his subjects without excusing their crimes. This book is a great starting point for any reader who wishes to learn more about these colorful criminals and the ear they helped define."},{"Title":"From a Pebble to a Rock","review":"This book like several others I have read are a help to many of the wives and a great help for morale. I also read and recomnmend Homefires:War through the Eyes of a Military Wife which I found very eye opening as to what the families go through in times like these. I also recommend My Daddy is a Soldier which was a great help to my grandson and the other militry children in his school."},{"Title":"From a Pebble to a Rock","review":"Patti did a great job in compiling stories from all walks of life and to bring out through them the strength that these military spouses have demonstrated throughout their trials during their military life. One of the hardest thing as a new spouse is to realize that \\"we\\" will always come second and his \\"job\\" will always come first. The title of this book is so descriptive of how a new spouse develops over the years. It was over 18 years ago that I was a little pebble but throughout the years I became the rock in my family. During these times of constant deployments this book will be an inspiration to new spouses and hopefully will help them become the rock in their family."},{"Title":"From a Pebble to a Rock","review":"While the stories Ms. Correa compiled may very well have been inspiring and heartwarming, I was unable to even get through the first one without putting the book down. The quality of the writing, or lack thereof, and the even basic mistakes (using 'to' where 'too' should have been used) made it apparent that this book had to have been self-published. In my opinion, no self-respecting publishing company would have published a book with such errors. And such errors tend to, unfortunately, take away from the stories of such amazing women. I was really looking forward to reading this book, until I opened it up. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Medical Education in Oklahoma: The University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and Health Sciences Center, 1964-1996","review":"I attended the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine longer ago than I care to recall, but I am personally familiar with many of the doctors and incidents depicted in this well-researched and interestingly written book. It contains more facts per page than anything I have ever read (with the possible exception of the Yellow Pages), but that's the way it should be in a history that documents the key years of an institution that changed from a small medical outpost on the prairie to--as the authors brand Oklahoma taxpayers' expectations--a &quot;Harvard on the plains&quot; medical complex. While the school perhaps never achieved that level of academic excellence, it certainly rose far higher than the Oklahoma state legislature and it's turf-protecting politicians had any right to expect, given their meager level of support both financial and political. Politics aside, the 50's and 60's were great times to be living in Oklahoma City, and this book brings back many of my fondest memories--and reminds me of the many brilliant and industrious men and women I met and worked with at the Medical Center. The book captures it all beautifully, and I highly recommend it for anybody interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Medical Education in Oklahoma: The University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and Health Sciences Center, 1964-1996","review":"I found the book to be extremely interesting, and even humorous at times. The book offers a play by play event listing of the establishment of the medical school and tells a candid story of the founders and individuals that were ultimately responsible for what kind of medical facilities, Oklahoma has today. A &quot;must-read&quot; for Medical Students, Educators and generally any History Buff that would enjoy the &quot;inside&quot; story behind the Oklahoma Medical Center. The photographs are a plus."},{"Title":"The Politics of Presence (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"English writer Anne Phillips is among the best feminist political thinkers of our time. In The Politics of Presence, she develops a major issue present in some of her previous books, notably Engendering Democracy and Democracy &amp; Difference: the shift in democratic thought, when the politics of ideas (where the identity of representatives is not a concern) is challenging by a politics of presence. Since Hanna Pitkin's famous attack on what she called \\"descriptive representation\\", in the sixties, political theorists usually see the search for typical representation-that is, the parliament as a microcosm or mirror of the whole society-as a minor task. The question was not \\"who\\" the representatives are, but \\"which interests\\" they defend. Enhancing their accountability was the way to improve democracy. This view was compatible with the hegemonic liberal affirmation of \\"equality before the law\\", regardless the individual's identity. And compatible, too, with Socialist analysis, both Marxist and social democrat, that saw political access as dependent on changes in social and economic conditions. As Ms Phillips shows, this view was challenged by an alternative politics of presence, which emerged with the demands for the political inclusion of silenced or excluded groups, specially women and ethnic minorities. These groups don't judge \\"equality before the law\\" is enough; and they are not willing to wait for always-postponed structural changes. With such demands for political equality, they focalize on institutional mechanisms that could achieve more immediate change in their life's condition. Thus, political equality is now a crucial issue in political battles. However, this approach to democrat reform is not free of problems, and The Politics of Presence extensively discusses such problems. A mirror legislature gives no certainty about protecting minority's interests; accountability mechanisms can't be dispensed. And more, determining which social cleavages, among countless ones, deserve to be considered in order to promote fair representation is a controversial issue. The book studies a number of cases that illustrate some of these difficulties-electoral quotas for women in Europe, race-conscious districting in the USA, and Canadian politics, emphasizing the problems of Quebec and native population. Clearly written, full of intelligence and passion, The Politics of Presence is a valuable book to anyone who wants to think about contemporary challenges of democracy."},{"Title":"The Politics of Presence (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"Phillips does a good job of raising some important and often ignored problems about representation and presence in her book. I originally read this for a feminist political theory class as a graduate student, and hope to go back and read it again. Her discussions of what representation means and looks like in contemporary US politics is excellent and brings home the problems of \\"representative\\" democracy when those elected to represent do not in fact do that, and perhaps, as many scholars have argued, never can.An excellent read for anyone interested in feminist scholarship, social equality issues, political representation and accountability in modern politics."},{"Title":"The God Experiment: Can Science Prove the Existence of God?","review":"I first got acquainted with Stannard's work when he appeared on a popular BBC program as part of a panel of distinguished scientists. The panel was assembled to comment on the problem of creationism in American public schools. When Stannard spoke I was intrigued to hear of an experiment that an organisation he was associated with was conducting: \\"The God Experiment\\".When I saw a copy of the book with the same name at a local book store, I bought it immediately. I had hoped that it described in detail the results of the \\"prayer\\" experiment that was out to \\"prove\\" (or disprove) God's Existence. Unfortunately mention of the actual experiment, conducted with the assistance of hundreds of patients about to undergo heart surgery, was quite brief and had not been completed at the time of publication. Instead, Stannard proclaims that the actual investigation into the existence of God requires multiple sources of evidence in addition to the actual empirical \\"prayer\\" experiment.Stannard commences by examining whether miracles can indeed occur. After a long discussion, he ultimately confesses that it is up to the individual to make up their mind. He then proceeds to dicuss the views of two psychologists regarding religion. He sides with the theistic psychologist and attempts to discredit the logic of the non-theistic one by employing some very simple, unconvincing arguments. His discussion on why suffering exists in the world is quite amusing. He turns the tables on the reader by proclaiming that in some instances evil and suffering are \\"necessary\\" and \\"good\\". In the light of this proclamation, he continues to say that it is plausible that God can exist in a world full of suffering. However, once again he concludes by falling back on his favourite expression: \\"It's a mystery\\".In later chapters Stannard discuss such topics as biological evolution and the big bang theory. He argues that at the fundamental level these scientific theories require the existence of God. Although I didn't agree with some of his conclusions, I was fascinated by his theories regarding God, time and Quantum mechanics.Stannard's book was an enjoyable read. He is a physicist that knows his material and may convince some readers of God's existence on a scientific level. However, his theological apologetics are very weak. Stannard should stick to particle physics."},{"Title":"The God Experiment: Can Science Prove the Existence of God?","review":"Russell Stannard is a scientist with the heart, mind, and soul of a theologian/minister and seeks to explore the compatibility of science and religious beliefs. He presents science that the intelligent layperson can understand, including quantum physics and relativity. In presenting evidence for the Big Bang and evolution, he goes beyond the intelligent design theories I have heard before, to include new ways of understanding God's role. He gives wonderful scientific/theological views on miracles, evil and suffering, the resurrection, how the world began, the physical laws of our world and how God relates to them. His exploration of the dimension of time that we live in, but that God is beyond, is wonderfully enlightening and mentally challenging. The analogies he presents when discussing complex issues of science or of God's relationship to us are wonderful new ways of understanding age-old questions.I highly recommend this book for those seekers or scholars who are trying to comprehend how our concept of God fits with today's scientific knowledge of the world and our place in it."},{"Title":"The God Experiment: Can Science Prove the Existence of God?","review":"The author's scientific credentials are impeccable, but his knowledge of Christianity is pretty dismal. For example, he writes that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. I'm no Biblical scholar, but I know that, not only is there no Scriptural authority for that claim; there is no evidence whatsoever. If a \\"creation scientist\\" claimed that the dinosaurs were animals that Noah forgot to put on the Ark, he would be ridiculed as an illiterate Bible pounder. When a man of learning chooses to write about religion and science, he owes it to his audience to be as careful about his religious data as he is about his scientific data. The author accepts the Resurrection on faith, although he says that if it turned out that Jesus didn't rise from the dead, he (Stannard) would still be a Christian. The truth is, if Jesus didn't die and rise again, his whole mission is pointless.I was disappointed, but others might enjoy this book. It's not the worst book in the world; I may have set my hopes too high."},{"Title":"The God Experiment: Can Science Prove the Existence of God?","review":"To flesh out what one previous reviewer hinted at, this book attempts what several philanthropic organizations are paying good money for: To meld religion (Faith/Un-reason) and Science (Reason / Unbelief). It is a mildly interesting read, yet Stannard ends up doing a dis-service to both particle/ Astro-physics, and Christian Apologetics. There is a sound thinking behind epistmilogically seperating physics and meta-physics: one is academic, one is artistic. The last culture to wed them with success was the Greek, and we are long past Athenian philosophical treatises on objectivity and subjectivity. Try reading Stephen Hawking, and Debates between Dan Barker and William Craig on The Secular Web. At least it was short, though."},{"Title":"The God Experiment: Can Science Prove the Existence of God?","review":"I dont recommend you waste your money on this book. Rather than accept the biblical accounts of Jesus life as written, the author modifies them (adopting the theories of the most liberal scholars, and manufacturing some strange theories of his own) to fit his ideas of what is possible.He allegorizes everything from the virgin birth to the resurrection, discounting the disciples eye witness accounts as mere story telling."},{"Title":"Skadden: Power, Money, And the Rise Of A Legal Empire","review":"Mr. Caplan has gracefully provided readers with an exquisite portrait of the life and times of a twentieth century law firm. Compelling and balanced, the book joyfully tracks the highs and lows of a group of &quot;young turks&quot; who have defined what it means to be a lawyer in corporate America. I am grateful to Mr. Caplan for the time he put into this project, as it gives tremendous insight to law students as to how a law firm operates and what the culture of a law firm embodies. This book is worth reading, worth printing and well worth recommending. Caplan's Tenth Justice, his recording of the Office of Solicitor General is brilliant as well. Joe Flom and Sheila Birnbaum and the rest of the Skadden crew can rest easy as the bard who records their triumphs and tribulations does so with zest and intelligence."},{"Title":"Skadden: Power, Money, And the Rise Of A Legal Empire","review":"Skadden is an excellent history of both the rise of the modern law firms as well as one of those firms which epitomized that movement. Lincoln Caplan uses an indepth analysis of the practice, politics and people of Skadden Arps to analyze how and why law firms, which had traditionally been small parterships have since grown into businesses as large and competitive as many of the corporations they represent. The story is very well written and insightful and it is obvious that Caplan did extensive research both inside the firm and in legal libraries. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in legal history and it is a good insider's guide to people who do not have experience in a law firm, but are considering working in one or are simply curious what goes in them."},{"Title":"Skadden: Power, Money, And the Rise Of A Legal Empire","review":"Ever wondered where the suit and tie brigade known as corporate lawyers originate their quirky self-image? Well look no further. Lincoln Caplan's \\"Skadden...\\" is undoubtedly a modern legal classic up there with Michael Stewarts \\"The Partners\\". Delving inside the history of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher and Flom LLP is congruent to understanding the changed corporate world. From Joe Flom's initial proxy battles and rivalry with Marty Lipton to multi-billion dollar, cross-border transactions to the evolution of the new breed of corporate law firm. Skadden's history is inseparable from that of Wall Street and business in the US since its post-World War II founding and as a consequence is a must for all those interested in business as well as those interested in a legal career. A great no holes barred look into the modern law firm."},{"Title":"Skadden: Power, Money, And the Rise Of A Legal Empire","review":"If you like legal history this is a great book! excellent background and information on some of the largest law firms and corporate deals."},{"Title":"Skadden: Power, Money, And the Rise Of A Legal Empire","review":"There's usually something important to be learned by the absent minded habits of the great and powerful. This book includes one about Joe Flom: He likes to fill the margins of his notes with tightly wound, intricate geometric patters that are uniquely his own design. The author doesn't read much more into it, but there's no reason we readers can't. According the author, Mr. Flom can also be a little brusque in private.For law students in particular, this book is a good dose of reality if they are wondering what it's really like to work in a big firm. Interesting critique of the usefulness of this book: I recently asked a Skadden associate (not in their NY office) how he liked this book, and he had not read it. He had to look it up on the firm's website to determine what I was talking about. So this book can help the non-Skadden population understand the Skadden firm perhaps better than the firm understands itself. That would be the ultimate tribute to the author, and a Delphic oracle to Skadden's leadership.Since reading this, I cannot help thinking of Joe Flom whenever I'm trapped in some boring meeting, or sidelined in court, waiting for my case to be called. \\"Can I doodle as well as him?\\" I ask myself. Then the case is called, or the meeting accelerates, and--poof!--the evanescent reminder of old Joe Flom disappears along with it."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"Gene Sharp has captured most of his ideas on planning a struggle to non-violently overthrow dictatorships in this book.

If I get too specific in here the comment will not stay and the rip off will continue."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"Gene Sharp has done more to advance our understanding and practice of strategic nonviolence than anyone except perhaps Mahatma Gandhi himself. Waging Nonviolent Struggle is a compendium of his wisdom developed over half a century of serious study, writing, and consulting. If I were to recommend one volume on nonviolent struggle to newcomers and experts alike, it would be this one. Its argument is nuanced with deep social and political theory and also includes a practical guide to strategic planning for activists.During the past five decades, Sharp has analyzed and systematized historic examples of types of nonviolent direct action; he has observed, advised, and learned from contemporary movements, and charted directions for the future. Waging Nonviolent Struggle is the culmination of that work. It begins with an instructive autobiographical preface that reviews the evolution of his thought, proceeds to a concise introduction to the underlying theory of power and nonviolent action and then provides 23 short case studies that illustrate its efficacy. The finale of the book is a practical guide to strategic planners that draws on Sharp's research and experience, charting the future of nonviolent direct action as a reflexive and deliberate strategy rather than improvised response to concrete historical situations.This will be the foundational text for introductory courses at the nonviolent equivalent of the war academies; it will teach scholars and guide activists. It contains the information one needs to have to understand the tectonic shifts in geopolitics of recent decades, in which nonviolent people power rather the military brute force has been primarily responsible for reshaping the globe. Yes, freedom is on the march, but not for the reasons trumpeted in the halls of political privilege."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"As I become more familiar with Gene Sharp and his work, I am increasingly convinced that he is a tremendously important scholar.The title aptly describes the raw basis for this study: the application of organized, efficient strategy to active nonviolent struggle instead of to destructive violent pursuits.Don't be apprehensive about approaching this book, despite that it may appear to be daunting or complex subject matter. Surely, it is large (at over 500 pages), but Sharp uses efficient, clear language that all students and readers can understand. His authority on the matter is encyclopedic and makes this long text rather joyful.Visit the Albert Einstein Institute website ([...]) to read about the author, as well as to download a few shorter PDF books about nonviolence and politics.These downloads are free and present a practical way to preview Sharp's intellect before you purchase Waging Nonviolent Struggle.And, especially if you're a natural leader, I hope you that you do buy this book (or rent it from a library). We need more leaders equipped with the courage to be humane and nonviolent. We've had our fill of leaders who are warriors, soldiers, warmongers and tyrants. Those kinds of leaders resort to the fist or the gun or the missile instead of using our spectacular brainpower to compromise.The intelligence is present in the human genepool. We just need to practice using our intellects to safeguard human rights, rather than to abuse them.Reading Gene Sharp's books is an important step in the direction of a better world, for people and animals alike.Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"Senior scholar at the Albert Einstein Institution of Boston, Massachusetts Gene Sharp and his team of like-minded researchers apply 50 years of history, academics, and practical experience to present Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential, a meticulous accounting of how nonviolent methodologies can combat dictatorships, war, genocide, and oppression. Waging Nonviolent Struggle is particularly valuable in its use of logic and close analysis of specific historical cases of nonviolent struggle to debunk common myths concerning the practice. Such myths include the contention that nonviolence is ineffective against dictatorships and genocide, or that nonviolent methodologies rely upon an appeal to the moral character of the opponent (in fact, nonviolent coercive techniques such as economic boycott and social noncompliance have an impact regardless of the humanitarian stature of the regime in question). The high value of properly applied and disciplined nonviolent resistance is demonstrated, in particular because nonviolent methodologies have the potential to bring successful results at a lower overall mortality rate than violent methodologies, and uninvolved third parties (a.k.a. \\"innocent civilians\\") are less likely to suffer collateral damage. Scrutinized case studies, overviewed and documented by a variety of different researchers, range from a successful protest of German women in Berlin to save their Jewish husbands (who had intermarried) from deportation and execution during World War II; the 1989 student uprising in China that ended in a tragic massacre; the successful defense of democracy in Thailand after a long succession of military coups; the successful removal of genocidal dictator Slobodan Milosevic from power in Serbia; and much more. In addition, Waging Nonviolent Struggle offers a \\"handbook\\" concerning how to coordinate nonviolent resistance with an eye on practical results and success. Written especially to answer the demanding need for realistic alternatives to violent conflict, Waging Nonviolent Struggle succeeds admirably in its mission and carries the absolute highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"This is a great book.

The way it is now, Amazon is simply losing business."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"It's tough to know what finally pushes people over the edge, to take action to oppose oppression or economic predation.But this is a time when, increasingly around the world, those conditions are being met. People who have finally decided to resist- those who say, \\"I'm sick of this, and I won't take it any more!\\" need this book.This book does not tell you what to think. Rather, it tells how sleazebags like Slobodon Milosevic can be removed while bloodshed is minimized, how the power recognized by Ghandi, King, and many others can be harnessed to make a better world. The case studies are powerfully revealing of what works, and some of what doesn't. Gene Sharp's earlier book about the mechanics of nonviolent revolution, \\"198 Methods of Nonviolent Action\\" was written in 1980, yet we are told it was widely used by the resisters in Egypt, and elsewhere it still exerts a powerful influence on brave people, young and old, who want to change the world for the better.People who do not wish to fall into the degrading trap of becoming as barbaric as their oppressors.Not surprisingly, his works are correctly seen as dangerous radical heresy by the oligarchs, and are hard to find in the US, and in other countries where the power elite have a solid grip on the media. It's the same here in France- Amazon.fr does not have this book, and has apparently no plans to get it.Get it. Read what the elite do not want you to read- that YOU are the ultimate power, and that resistance works."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"Don't expect to be entering into a world of entertaining opinions or crafty jargon. This is a text book and it begins by breaking ideas and facts about nonviolent struggle into small parts."},{"Title":"Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice And 21st Century Potential","review":"In 1992 I was the second-ranking civilian in Marine Corps intelligence, and with the support of the Marine Corps, sought to get National Intelligence Topics moved from denied areas that were few in number and declining in importance, toward \\"low-intensity\\" threats and conditions in the Third World. The Marine Corps also tried to shift the US intelligence collection system from \\"priority driven\\" (collect over and over on the same limited set of targets) to \\"gap driven\\" (do a first pass on everything, then start over focusing on gaps). I've been thinking for a very long time about the deficiencies in US diplomatic, information, military, and economic (DIME) predispositions, bias, capabilities, and Achilles heels. I had more or less given up on the US Government specifically ever coming to its senses, when a bolt of lighting came out of the blue -- Admiral James Stavrides, Supreme Commander for NATO, gave a TED talk about \\"open source security.\\" That is code for a complex range of things called Operations Other Than War (OOTW), Stabilization & Reconstruction (S&R;), Public Diplomacy, and International Assistance, among other things. The US stinks at all of them, in part because we do not have a Whole of Government strategy, operations, intelligence, and logistics approach to anything -- stovepipes, each badly managed and crossing wires, seems to be the standard.While I have read many other books relevant to the ideal of creating a prosperous world at peace, a world that works for all, this book was recommended to me as a starting point for avanced thinking in non-violent peace and prosperity operations, as I like to think of them, along with the author's previous work,The politics of nonviolent action (Extending horizons books).This is a practical book with very specific case studies and very specific itemizations (198 of them) that may replicate some of the author's earlier work, but easily make this one book a stand-alone reference work for advanced studies by diplomats, warriors, and policy wonks long isolated from the real world. This book is not a replacement for Howard Zinn'sA Power Governments Cannot Suppressor Jonathan Schell'sThe Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People. The three go well together.For the grand strategic view I would suggest Philip Allott'sThe Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State; at the operational level, Mark Palmer'sBreaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025, and at the tactical level,Out of Poverty: What Works When Traditional Approaches Fail (BK Currents (Paperback)).This is a multi-purpose volume. One can skip the case studies and ingest the beginning and the end, which is what I did, or one can use the volume as a distributed reading and research exercise--if I were using it each case study would be the foundation for a student paper on what never happened -- the obliviousness of the UN, NATO, the US, etcetera, to the non-violent intervention points and the importance of NOT persisting with support to dictators and foreign military sales. As an aside, the dirty little secret of the CIA is that they are never serious about deposing evil, they just like to toy with dissidents on the margins -- the best documentary on this long-standing fact isCharlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times.I value the book for the brevity of its main point: non-violent power is real and practical and has many manifestations (most of them not really known to me in a coherent scheme before reading this book). State power is context dependent, and much -- *much* -- more subject to public will than most realize.The author is a deep student of Gandhi, and summarizes some of Gandhi's wisdom. I would also point the reader to my own summary of the work of others, augmented by my own original matrix for analyzing preconditions of revolution, easily found by looking for &lt; 2011 Thinking About Revolution in the USA and Elsewhere (Full Text Online for Google Translate) >.The author outlines three main situations where non-violent changes of power can occur:01 Non-violent protest and persuasion02 Non-coperation (economic boycotts or labor strikes, political)03 Non-violent intervention -- it is in this arena that I believe the USA has wasted 50 years and allowed corruption to displace good will.I note with interest the author's emphasis on openness versus secrecy as the underlying value for non-violent resistance, as well as his emphasis on solidarity (cultural) and discipline (moral and physical) as essential to facing down repression.Chapter 4 \\"The Methods of Non-Violent Action (pp. 49-65) is for me, at the age of 60 and generally well-read, a wake up call on how little I actually know. In 14 pages the author has distilled the essence of what could be, should be, the forms of democratic non-violent protest that a truly democratic and serious USA might plan, program, and budget to support.198 specifics, I will not list them here, but since these reviews are also my aide memoires (I now travel light and donate all books after reading), I will list the principle headings to inspire the use of this book by others.I Actions to Send a Message / Nonviolent Protest and Persuasion+ Formal statements (1-6)+ Communications with a wider audience (7-12)+ Group presentations (13-17)+ Sympolic public acts (18-30)+ Pressure on individuals (31-34)+ Drama and music (35-37)+ Processions (38-42)+ Honoring the dead (43-46)+ Public assemblies (47-50)+ Withdrawal and renunciation (51-54)II Actions to Suspend Cooperation and Assistance / Methods of Non-CooperationA.

Preparing a Strategic Estimate for Nonviolent Struggle -- this is an intelligence reqwuirements document! What needs to be known before beginning.B. Glossary - non-trivial, I think to myself that non-violence has the same need for standardization of terminology as does NATOC. Preparing Translatons on Nonviolent StruggleD. Sources for Further ReadingThe index is solid.This book was written before the Arab Spring and before Occupy, and it clearly is not being read by either group, but one can only hope that as time goes by, the absolute merits of non-violence and of diversity of non-violent methods -- 198 and counting -- may proliferate. I put the book down pensive about the 5,000 secessionist movements around the world (27 of them in the USA), all with very legitimate grievances, all with legitimate aspirations I would hope they could achieve with the non-violent methods in this book.I will end with one observation: I did not learn until recently that Gandhi and Martin Luther King agreed not only on the importance of non-violence, but also on the value of violence if non-violence is not successful and continued oppression is in store. Those who would diminish the non-violent approach should be well aware that non-violence is an alternative to violence but in no way does it preclude violence. Governments can abuse some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but they cannot abuse all of the people (99% will do here) all of the time. The Industrial Era is OVER.

For my own purpose, I found chapters one through four, chapters 29 through 39, and appendix A of Waging Nonviolent Struggle to be very relevant to my learning goal. These chapters and appendix A yield a straightforward and thorough, if abstract, understanding of the purposes and methodology of nonviolent direct action. By abstract, I mean that the methodology is discussed with almost no attempt to provide specific real-life exammples for the reader. Real-life examples of nonviolent direct actions are cataloged, and thus segregated in, chapters five through 27 of this book. I found chapters five through 27 to be not relevant to my learning goal, so I did not read them, although some one else, with differing learning goals, might find these chapters very useful. Waging Nonviolent Struggle certainly improved my general understanding of nonviolent direct action, yet it did not yield the deep level of insightful personal understanding (\\"I've got it!\\") that I had hoped to learn from reading this book. Therefore, I award Waging Nonviolent Struggle a good, a four-star, rating. Probably the best way to gain an \\"I've got it!\\" understanding of nonviolent direct action is to not only read about it, but also personally participate in it, as a group member involved in nonviolent direct action. Let the dedicated scholar sometimes liberate himself from his books, and seek further understanding from living wisely, in more active and immediate pursuit of the beloved community that peacefully and equitably binds us all together as one.John"},{"Title":"The Wall Street journal guide to the metric system","review":"I can only second--nay--third, dbsf's take on The Metric System.

It provides practical guidelines towards channeling one's passion in an effort to obtain profit."},{"Title":"Turn Your Passion Into Profit","review":"Ive seen a lot of motivational books (such as Tony Robbins stuff) and this one is VERY different. What you don't get is the typical fluff and puff of most motivational writings that only temporarily make you feel inspired yet leaving the reader with not knowing really how to apply it. This author actually describes the \\"HOW TO\\" in coming up with your own passion ideas for making an income stream based off what you know and what you are passionate about. This is the KEY difference.He describes the step by step process and even shows how he markets his books too. I haven't seen other motivational books that do that. This author is very direct, real and down to earth which is what I think makes him so credible. Its real life common sense stuff that he teaches you how to act on and a lot of \\"make sense\\" philosophical creeds\\" to go along with it all. I give this book the highest possible recommendation. It can be a life changer to those who read it!"},{"Title":"Turn Your Passion Into Profit","review":"I thought this book was going to be another \\"practical\\" guide to setting up a business - just instructions for the non-business person in regards to getting started, organizing an office, raising capital, etc. Wow! It is so much more than any book like that could ever hope to be. Mr. Goodridge surprised me with a look into the true foundations of profiting from your passion. So many of us hear negative noise about pursuing \\"non-traditional\\" careers. If you are able to open your mind and consider Walt's philosophy, it just makes sense. I discovered a new outlook on spirituality that I never really thought about and while there is no religious association in the ideas presented here, instead of conflicting with beliefs I hold, it actually confirms them in a way I did not expect. This book gets to the heart of finding your passion, allowing yourself to pursue it, and how to best turn it into profit. It is so well writting and easy to understand, yet packed with so much information and guidance, it will change your outlook and your life."},{"Title":"Turn Your Passion Into Profit","review":"I recently received my paperback copy of Walt Goodridge's \\"Turn Your Passion Into Profit\\" book. I must say it was better than I expected. The book is easy to read, fun, interesting, witty, inspiring, motivating and makes you see things in a way you never thought of before. It's not just a how-to guide, but a guide on transformation in consciousness. As you read it, you feel inspired - like suddenly you feel and sense a world of possiblities you never knew existed. This is the kind of book that is priceless. It's not just a book, it's like an \\"experience\\", one that you have to sit down and go through to understand what I mean.Goodridge truly has a gift of teaching and guiding in this area. He takes a difficult, complex and broad subject and handles it like a Zen master, using simplicity and elegance to convey his teachings and guidance in everyday layman's terms. I'm quite impressed, and it takes a lot to impress me.While reading this book, it seems apparent that Goodridge was made for this role of Passionpreneur teacher, kind of like how people say that David Carradine was made for the Kwai Chang Kane role in the \\"Kung Fu\\" series, and Kevin Costner was made for his role in \\"Dances with Wolves\\". Likewise, Walt Goodridge was made to be a Passionpreneur guide, teaching people how to turn their passions into portable businesses one can live off of. He is like the \\"Kwai Chang Kane\\" of the Passionpreneur lifestyle. When you see this book, you will understand why.This is not just a practical how-to guide, it guides you in transforming your consciousness to another level, where you are better able to manifest your wishes and desires. I think this is important, and what other books about starting your own business lack. You see, for the law of attraction to work for you, and for the universe to begin helping you, you've got to operate from a higher plane of consciousness which allows it all to come into possibility. True change begins within, and that's where Walt starts. That's what makes this book special compared to others. I know that might sound a bit New Ageish, but it's true. I've experienced this in my own life, as a successful self-employed \\"Passionpreneur\\" myself, so I know what it takes to become one.Walt is one of the few gifted writers who understands this inner transformation one must go through to change one's life, because he too, has had to undergo a transformation in consciousness in order to live a life of freedom, authenticity and abundance. You see, changing your life is more than just about doing practical how-to steps in the physical world. One must move from a state of being locked in fear and limitation into one of abundance, possibility. That requires a transformation in consciousness, for true freedom begins in the mind. At that point, the inner change will manifest into the outer.Walt has a gift for helping people in this area. He was tailor made for this role. This book is his best work. And it's a MUST HAVE for sure. I tend to be very skeptical and cynical about things, so for me to praise something, it's gotta be really good for sure. And this book definitely fits the bill.Every page is filled with motivation and wisdom which helps you to discover yourself, your true potential, who you really are, and how you can awaken to an empowering truer, more meaningful and more authentic life. I liked how Walt used analogies from the film \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" with Morgan Freeman, a great masterpiece film, and explained how the lessons from it apply to our lives.After corresponding with him, I would say that Walt is one of the most awakened people I've ever talked to. While most people in the world are energy leeches and vampires who suck the energy out of you, Walt is one of the few that radiate energy and give it to help others, for he draws his from some \\"cosmic source\\" of abundance, rather than from ego or illusion. That makes him a lot more authentic than most people I've met.You've all heard the saying, \\"Do what you love. The money will follow.\\" Well this book is the epitome of that. Once you read it, you will understand more than ever the wisdom behind that saying. It's true in more ways than you might think. You see, if you only live to work, then you don't have a true purpose in life. The most authentic lifestyle is to follow your passion, and make a living while doing that. That is the TRUE way to live true to yourself and live freely. This book will help you do that, in many ways.So anyway, if you are tired of living a robotic life working for others as a slave to make a living, and looking for other alternatives and answers, then get this book. It's inexpensive and priceless. It is truly life changing and transformative, as well as a masterpiece work of inspiration. Even if you've already begun your journey of awakening, this book will help bridge the gap between your new awakening and the steps you can take to manifest your inner changes into your everyday life that will allow you to live in freedom, abundance, authenticity and passion.If that sounds like you, then this book could be the catalyst that marks the turning point in your life, and the next stage in your evolution of being as well.Thanks for reading my review which comes straight from the heart.Sincerely,Winston WuAuthor of Happier Abroad"},{"Title":"Turn Your Passion Into Profit","review":"Walt really understands passion and the role that it plays in the success of your life and of any business venture. He walks you through all the thought processes that are required to find your passion. He supplies poetry that really gets you thinking. He also provides thought-provoking questions to help you along the way.I love how he incorporates all the great concepts from the most successful people and ties them all together. He explains the concepts in simple, very easy to read sections and provides insight into why these concepts are important.I bought this book with the intention of using it to get ideas for my business to help other mothers to start a new business, but I found myself realizing so many things about myself in the process.This is a great book to keep in your library.

The first third gives the basics of going with your passion, and the rest of the book is about starting a business. Nothing new, but a nice little package.But. The author lets us all know he's Jamaican-American (which we already know from the two photos on the cover). I refuse to call him an African-American because he is from Jamaica. His affirmations include \\"despite racism\\" and \\"because of racism,\\" etc., which is completely and utterly unnecessary. The affirmations (and other advice) applies to everyone, but the author just can't drop the racism card.I'm a native of a suburb of Los Angeles and I'm lily white. Here, we \\"European-Americans\\" can be accused of and called anything, with no repurcussions to the accuser or heckler. But heaven help any of us if we're socially and/or policially incorrect.Another problem is the nasty habit the author has of putting stupid and childish little rhymes on every other page. He writes them, and seems to think they belong in a book on other people's passions. They don't. If this man's passion is poetry, let him write a book on poetry. Don't inflict nursey rhymes on us when we're trying to learn about business. It's annoying.I hope the author reads this review. Yeah, we allllll know about slavery and understand the problem of racism. As a personal victim of physical racial abuse by African-Americans against myself, a \\"European-American,\\" I'm offended by the references to racism in this book.And, buddy, if you want to write nursery rhymes, stick them in a children's book and sell them to toddlers.

Usually I read a book, get maybe 1 or 2 helpful ideas and then move on to the next. THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT because it combines so many of the concepts from other books into one volume. It combines ideas and exercises for discovering your passion with examples of people who have done it and moves into marketing, selling, and even filling out IRS forms! The section on making money on internet alone is worth the price of the book. The writing style is simple, clear, concise and the book is well organized.

Although there is information that is relevant to residents of New York state, anyone in the US can use this book to take their \\"passion\\" and convert it into profit.What was helpful to me was his thing about \\"reality reconstruction\\" and how when one chooses to pursue the entrepreneurial path, everything that does not serve the \\"endgame\\" must be removed.

Penney is a powerful advocate of applying the teachings of Jesus Christ to his life. For example, he writes, \\"I believe wholeheartedly that, without God in our hearts, we have nothing, and can achieve nothing of true value.\\" He talks about going from obscurity to prominence. Writing of such a personal nature perserves the intimate thoughts of individuals in a generation. Penney captures the mindset of a progressive era in American history, a time of growth and transition to urban living.One thing that bothered me was the way he lumped Christianity with other religions in some sections. The teachings of Jesus Christ are unique and have no parallels. Read them from the primary document, the Bible. Penney was wrong to try to superficially tie all religions into one lump."},{"Title":"May the Best Man Die (Carnegie Kincaid, Book 3)","review":"I had almost quit reading this series after the first book which I did not particularly like, but decided to continue with the other two books that were available and now that I have read the third book, May The Best Man Die, I'm glad that I did. This book I believe is a great improvement over the first two books.Veiled Threats: Carnegie Kincaid is a wedding planner who seems to have a murder along with each of her events. I would think clients would be reluctant to continue coming to her. I knew who the killer was almost from the beginning of the book and the plot was so convoluted I wished everyone had been killed by the end.Died To Match: The second book was a slight improvement in that the mystery was much more interesting, but was ruined by what I thought a not very well thought out killer. Even when the book was over, I didn't believe who the killer was.I wasn't sure I wanted to tackle the third book, but it turned out to be very good. The mystery was interesting, the killer was a complete surprise but fitted in perfectly with the storyline. I love the relationship between Carnegie and Aaron her on again / off again reporter boyfriend. She has some great supporting people, Boris the florist, Her best friend Lily and the hilarious Buckmeister family, whose first appeared in Died to Match and are still planning their daughter's Christmas wedding in this book. The plans for this wedding gives new meaning to the word tacky.Even though I didn't find the first two books to be very good, I think it's important to start with them, because they do give you a real feel of the characters, their backgrounds and explanations as to why they are doing certains things in later books."},{"Title":"May the Best Man Die (Carnegie Kincaid, Book 3)","review":"Deborah Donnelly has a great series with her sleuth/wedding planner - Carnegie Kincaid. The plot/subplots are great and her wedding and party planning ideas are pretty good as well.I would not have missed reading about the Christmas wedding for anything. The &quot;Killer B's&quot; were great. I am going to miss them and hope that somehow they'll be included in the next book if only slightly.

It is a joy to find another great read."},{"Title":"May the Best Man Die (Carnegie Kincaid, Book 3)","review":"Who can resist a wedding?

She is understandably perturbed to get a call from her bride ordering her to go to the Hot Spot to straighten something up for the groom. When she arrives at the famous club, the best man asks her to make a liquor run. She walks out in a huff and when she returns to her office, she looks out her window and sees the best man and her best friend's brother fighting.The next day a policeman comes to her office asking her to identify a body at the morgue because Carnegie's business card was found in his pants pocket. A reluctant Carnegie identifies the body as Jason Kraye, the best man. She then goes on to tell the police officer about the fight she witnessed and the police arrest Darren. Lily is furious at Carnegie for ratting out her brother and a remorseful Carnegie swears to her friend she will find out who the killer is. Her promise almost costs Carnegie her life.Each book in this funny and fascinating amateur sleuth series is better than the one before. The author, a talented writer with a wicked knack for creating crisp dialogue and sharp characters, allows her heroine to grow and change so that readers feel she is believable. Despite the fact that two murders take place in MAY THE BEST MAN DIE, there is no violence in the novel so fans of cosies will want to obtain this weeding bell blues novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"May the Best Man Die (Carnegie Kincaid, Book 3)","review":"Seattle-based wedding planner Carnegie Kincaid has a lot on her plate. Dry rot has forced a temporary evacuation of her home and office, a rented houseboat moored on the east shore of Washington's Lake Union, and from her interim quarters she is overseeing the final preparations for two end-of-year nuptials. Preparations for the Buckmeister/Frost Christmas Eve wedding aren't unusually problematic, but the blowout Carnegie's planning for New Year's Eve proves to be a trial. For one thing, bride-to-be Sally Tyler--the daughter of renowned conductor Charles Tyler and his superstar CEO wife Ivy--is a spoiled rich girl with the people skills to match. For another, the groom's disagreeable best man turns up dead the morning after the bachelor party, and Carnegie--spying on the debauch for her own reasons through a pair of binoculars--may have witnessed the prelude to his murder.May the Best Man Die is the third book in Deborah Donnelly's series of Wedding Planner Mysteries. (I have not read the first two books in the series but plan to remedy that fault.) It's a tightly-plotted mystery with a likable protagonist and good, breezy writing: \\"So, roundly cursing Ms. Tyler and the stack of wedding magazines she rode in on, I climbed into my van [the Vanna White Too, by the way] and drove south.\\" Readers looking for a quick, well-written cozy will find Donnelly's series delightful.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"May the Best Man Die (Carnegie Kincaid, Book 3)","review":"This is the best mystery I've read in a while.

Normally she doesn't plan stag parties. She plans weddings. But, her new client insisted. After she left the party, she ends up looking through binoculars to watch the party. Why? Her significant other, although they're currently having trouble, is at the party. What she doesn't know is that a killer is there, too.The next day the best man is pulled from the canal. Who could have killed him? What did she see in those binoculars? Anything important? After she tells police what she saw and gets a friend in trouble, she decides she'd better look into things herself before telling them anything else. She gets Aaron, her significant other, to help her.Not only does she have this New Year's Eve wedding to be planning, she has another Christmas wedding to plan. And now Ivy, the mother of the bride for the New Year's Eve wedding, has asked her to plan another party.Since the murder is related to that wedding, she wants to spend as much time as possible with the parties to try to determine who could have been the murderer. Can she do that before anyone else is murdered, including herself? Plus what about her new love interest? Will this muddy the waters?Carnegie is a great character. She is a lot of fun, and she gets herself into predicaments throughout the book. I felt it was a very believable story, and a lot of fun to read.

The book is written in the style of a travel guidebook to give the reader some idea of what it would be like, actually to be present at the many unique places on the worlds around us.The main thing I learned from this book was how \\"modest\\" our geological features on this planet are, compared to those of some other planets! For instance, our Mt. Everest pales in comparison to Mt. Olympus on Mars and many mountains of Venus, our Grand Canyon is a shallow valley compared to Valles Marineris on Mars, and even a huge cliff on the tiny Uranian moon Miranda dwarfs any on earth! Unlike a technical textbook, this book is more of an informal tour, which both informs and stimulates the imagination and inspires wonder for the other worlds near us.My one criticism concerns the pictures. The book does contain some excellent pictures, real and simulated, which complement the text well. It could have used more, though. Now that so many more are available since the Cassini probe reached Saturn and Titan, and the entire surface of Venus has been mapped, perhaps such pictures will be included in a future edition.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in geology or planetary science, or is just curious about the Solar System. It's easy to read even if you don't have much background in science and will open your eyes to the great variety and beauty of worlds beyond."},{"Title":"Higher than Everest: An Adventurer's Guide to the Solar System","review":"Written like an informal, rather breezy guidebook, Higher than Everest describes how future adventurers might climb the highest mountains and cross the most dramatic landscapes on other planets and moons in our solar system. The author provides some general factual background for each destination, keeping the language simple (intelligent high school students could read this book easily). He gives only the briefest description of the technical needs of such expeditions, blurring distinctions between relatively straightforward ventures such as climbing the Moon's Mount Pico and much more difficult challenges like descending into Jupiter's atmosphere or landing atop a Venusian peak. Most of the real images of these destinations are helpful, though one wishes the author had given us more of them instead of his own photographs of similar landscapes on Earth. In one case - the ascent of Mars' Mount Olympus - the author shows us a proposed route for the expedition.

That said, now about this book, if I could give it a minus rating it would have been -5 stars, on pg 160 Kirby Whitman RAPED his wife, Alix.What started out as Alix's mother Mrs Ingram had been worried about Alix, because she was so run down after having a bout of pneumonia and she wasn't responding as well as she should have. Dr Burns wants Alix to go to a warmer climate, and her estranged husband, Kirby who just happens to have a plantation in Queensland, Australia. Having contacted Kirby, Mrs Ingram tells Alix about her action. Kirby comes on the scene only to make Alix become hysterical. But the next time he comes to the hospital Kirby is ready to take his wife back to his home.Only Alix doesn't want to go back to what she left, a jealous Melanie Gordon, who is also a very possessive woman, who will do anything to get Kirby, only he doesn't listen to Alix his wife. Not only that but he takes everything Melly says as scripture. And each time the two women are together Melly starts trouble, then runs back and tells Kirby a edited version of what was said, of course making Alix out to be a woman scorned.Until Melly slips up and shows Kirby her real face.Meanwhile Kirby is paying Alix back for living him by treating her with disrespect, hatred, sarcasm and as I said earlier he rapes her on pg 160. But be of good cheer Alix tells Kirby on pg 161 that she is alright with his raping her and 187 she is expecting his child.From the back of the book: 'Return to Maiyatta? It was unthinkable. But a long bout with pneumonia left Alix Whitman too weak to argue with her estranged husband, Kirby. Despite her objections she was being whisked off to recuperate at his plantation in North Queensland.Four years earlier Alix had left Kirby because of his secretary attractive Melanie Gordon-and now she knew that Melanie was still very much a part of Maiyatta.Alix felt she was being forced to return to a heartbreaking repetition of the past.'"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"In his remarkable masterwork, Ivan Turgenev gives a Russian face to a phenomenon that re-occurs throughout history. As sons rebel against the ways of their fathers, the sons search for a better life. In 19th century, the conflict is only differentiated by its setting.The novel centers on the friendship of Bazarov and Arkady, who becomes friends at the university. In their travels, they on separate occassions stay with each other's families as well as a upper caste people. In these travels, Bazarov's thoughts on nihilism are put to the test. Often, he tears at the fabric of society. Though Arkady is somewhat naive, he struggles with his friends ideology.There is little doubt that Bazarov is an educated man as he explores medicine at each destination. Yet the beauty of the story lies in the fact that the simplest things elude him. Though his parents and Arkady's father are portrayed as being simple, they possess what Bararov lacks. The way the story leads into it makes the ending that much more appropriate.Even as history repeats itself, many will learn the lesson of this beautiful story before ever reading it. Some will never learn it. Yet the poetic realism of this masterpiece reminds readers that even a story of failure can be worthy."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"I read this for fun, and it wasn't a waste of time. It was a little a slow, but the passion for life Trugenev has is clear and beautiful. This is a classic as good as anything I've ever read.It does have slow points, and some of the plot may seem clich&eacute;. But, at the time it was original, and even now the dialogue is never (NEVER) clich&eacute;.I was shocked by how much I loved this book.Read it. Use a library if you can't afford it."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This is a true Russian literature classic. Turgenev doesn't seem to carry the same heft as Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, but he is not in any sense inferior in his genius for writing. The story is tight and dramatic, and deals with the timeless issues of family, love, relationships, war and politics, with a good dash of Russian miracle. It describes the transformation of Russian society 250 years ago, but Turgenev does so in such a way, finding a common center in our experience, that he could be describing a 21st Century San Francisco family. My book buddy Marcia Makepeace describes the building anticipation in Fathers and Sons, which keeps the reader glued to the book, as expecting old fashioned chills and thrills on every next page.It is indeed one of those books that is hard to put down once you start. But it is a quick read, and therefore an easy introduction to the Russian classics."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"The way this story is told and the characters drawn is like watching a movie with a camera moving in and out of focus. We are allowed inside a character's thoughts for a certain period of time, then he moves us up and out of them and onto another scene. The transitions smoothly lead the reader through the story. I didn't want it to end. The story is relevant to issues people face even today. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Turgenev was a supremely devoted artist and his characters truly shine in this novel, his masterwork. I like to think of him as the Russian version of Hemingway, because Turgenev writes in such a beautiful, engaging manner. However, the comparison ends there...besides, Turgenev was a better writer than Hemingway. Very highly recommended for all lovers of Russian literature...belongs in your collection right next to Crime &amp; Punishment, Dead Souls, War &amp; Peace, etc."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Following a link from Hamsun to Gogol found Fathers and Sons. Like the manic haunted heroes of Hamsun's Mysteries and Hunger there is Turgenev's Bazarov - a nihilist passionate - a hero of a kind. Take the path from Turgenev to Lermontov then to Dostoyevsky or criss cross paths and return to Hamsun. For this reader Turgenev's beautiful Fathers and Sons is but one part of this world of inspiration and Bazarov but one example of the gift these authors had for characterisation. Turgenev's novel - the cause of furious debate in its day and long beyond - is a powerful, challenging, emotional, wonderful book. Read it. Read them all."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Like many of the laudable Pre-Revolution authors, Turgenev's writing poignantly depicts the emotional and political unrest of a nation tearing itself apart. The book focuses on the deterioration and restoration of the relationship between the nihilistic Bazarov and his father. However, this central family relationship also mirrors the larger themes of social movements and progressive ideas. Turgenev's work remains a classic not only because of its historical significance, but for its timelessness as well. Like most great literature, the themes pertain to our culture as well. The dialectic between the older and younger generations will always exist, but Turgenev leaves the reader with the eventual hope for a synthesis. . ."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"FATHERS AND SONS treats Nihilism far more succinctly than any book I can think of and brought the idea to the ordinary mind through true to life characters that we can relate to. It is important because the ideas and methods of the most notorious Nihilists-Nechayev is considered to be very important by Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.Bazarov who is the hero of the novel, is skeptical of people, institutions, ideas, and all the other trappings of civilization and does not hide his willingness to go about bringing down what he rejects.Friedrich Nietzsche put forward an argument that the corrosive effects of Nihilism would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history. Nihilistic themes such as epistemological failure, value destruction, and cosmic purposelessness--have preoccupied artists, social critics, and philosophers in the 20th century.The fact that patterns of nihilism were indeed a conspicuous feature of collapsing civilizations, means it should be taken seriously. Its resurgence had an effect in the collapse of states, especially in Eastern Europe. Overall, this poetically written and entertaining classical novel deserves the highest of respects. In addition to The Union Moujik, classic Russian Stories like Crime and Punishment, A hero of our times, are recommended reads that not only expose the depths of ideas, but also the effects they have on political minds."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Ivan Turgenev was the first of the Russian writers of the XIX Century to make a name for himself outside his country. His novels influenced many of the great writers of the first half of the next century, such as Conrad, Virginia Wolf, Galsworthy and Henry James, who admired the Russian writer deeply. In his most famous novel, \`Fathers and Sons', the writer focus on the never-ending clash between generations.Although it is set in the XIX Century Russia, the narrative has universal and timeless connotation. \\"Fathers and Sons\\" focus on the conflict between younger member of Russian society that longed for reforms, and old intellectuals who were committed to political and aesthetical ideals of Western civilization.Turgenev is known as one of the most objective writers ever, and it is clear in this text. However matter-of-fact, his narrative is meticulous e fulfilled with details and important background information of most characters. His choice of words is precise, and it is clear mostly in the dialogues.As it is known, Turgenev kept a journal as if it were written by one of his main characters, Bazarov. This character has become one of the most important heroes of literature and his figure has influenced many writers. He repudiates everything that cannot be scientifically explained, and personalizes the spirit of revolution. On the other hand, Pavel Petrovich is his contrast and very conservative.\\"Fathers and Sons\\" is a symptomatic novel exposing where Russia was being let to. As some characters know, the society had to change, and not become the same (like in \\"The Leopard\\"). Drastic changes were necessary and they came some years after Turgenev's novel. As we all know, this change is called Revolution."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Turgenev is a master story teller, whether it takes the form of a novel or his shorter stories. This book, however, takes on special significance. Not only is it well-written, displaying the craft of the novelist as it matured in the mid-nineteeth century, but like many of his fellow Russians, he captures the imagination, themes, ideas, and sensibilities of presence that make Turgenev a twentieth-century joy to read.This alone is sufficient warrant to read the book. But, there's equally important social reasons to read it. Turgenev is to the novel what Nietzsche is to philosophy, and that they were cotemporaneous is no mistake. &quot;Fathers and Children&quot; is a novel about nihilism, despair, and raw will to power in a vein too similar to Nietzsche to be ignored.What makes Turgenev singularly important is his writing one of the truly &quot;post-modern&quot; novels as far as his themes go, but writing within the classical tradition of a well-developed plot, story, characters, ideas, and psychology. In many ways, Turgenew anticipates Freud, Kierkegaard, Joyce, and Eliot, while retaining the style of Hawthorne, Austin, and de Balzac. It's a wonderful synthesis -- a masterful story with critically important ideas and themes."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"One of the best Russian novel by Turgenev.

Bazarov, the book's central character is a nihilist, he claims to depise art, social institutions of any kind and any sort of emotion. Turgenev illustrates his contempt for people prepared to embrace nihilism at this expense with bazarov's ultimate disillusionment and unhappiness; as such it is a very political book and it had him labeled a conservative by his contemporaries."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"\\"Fathers and Sons\\" might be Turgenev's most referred to piece of work. And it is an intelligent and well-written piece of literature, but there were a few things about the book I didn't like. Now naturally who am I to criticize the work of Turgenev. To me one of the greatest Russian authors.Before I read this book I thought it was about the generation gap between a father and son. Demonstrating the changes which evolve generation after generation. How the young challenge the social conventions of the times. And that is a theme that is played in the book. But, here's comes one of the faults I have with the book. While reading the beginning pages I began to notice who the book starts to revolve around. Mostly the characters Bazarov and Arkady. And the older characters namely Arkady's father Nikolai and his uncle Pavel are not used enough. And this creates a conflict. Throughout the book we read about the younger generations view of life. But we don't get to read about the older characters views enough. There can't be much of a conflict if we don't get to hear both sides. We mostly hear Bazarov's views but he is rarely \\"challenged\\" to defend them. One of the best chapters in the book has Bazarov and Arkady arguing with Nikolai and Pavel about where society is now and where it was.Another problem I had with the book deals with the characters Anna Sergeyevna and her sister Katya. At first both Bazarov and Arkady are both taken by Anna. But we come to know very little about her. We only see her through the eyes of both men. And since they are both in love with her it seems a very lovely portrait is made of her. But, is she really the person they both think she is? We are not given a strong back ground story about her past. The only thing concerning her past that is mentioned is her first marriage. Some detail is given about her father but nothing about her childhood. The same thing happens with Katya. And never once does Turgenev try to put us in both of these women shoes to see what they think of the men. That would of been interesting to know.And finally I didn't like the way the book ends. By telling us exactly what happens to each character. I thought it was too neat. He was trying too hard to carefully wrap everything up with a bow on top. I would of preferred some mystery. It gives the reader something to think about.I suppose many might feel I'm nit-picking. But, if it does seem that way it's only because over-all I did enjoy the book and became involved so naturally I would of liked to know more about some of the characters. And naturally I would of liked to read more about other characters.Turgenev does give the novel a certin poetic feel. Many chapters are touching and heartfelt. I enjoyed the chapter where Nikolai thinks about his first wife. It is so vividly described. It's full of emotion. Another chapter deals with Bazarov visiting his parents and then suddenly leaving. The parents are heartbroken and so are we.Though for all the touching moments in the book there was one chapter I found quite funny. It deals with Pavel challenging Bazarov to a duel. Pavel informs Bazarov that he \\"detest\\" him. They then start to discuss the formalities. Pavel suggest that they fight at six in the morning with pistols at a distance of ten paces. Bazarov says \\"At ten paces? That will do; we can detest one another at that distance.\\" Later Bazarov starts to get a bit nervous and declares \\"I risk having my brains blown out.\\" I could almost picture Woody Allen saying these lines with his stammer. It reminded me of his movie \\"Love and Death\\".\\"Fathers and Sons\\" is an enjoyable read. It has it's rewarding moments. And I do recommend it to all Turgenev fans and those who love Russian literature. Though I admit I do perfer his novel \\"First Love\\" and his play \\"A Month In The Country\\".*** 1\\\\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Poetic well-written piece of work by Turgenev. Has many touching moments are does create a nice mood throughout. Flawed but interesting."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This was required reading for my Russian literature class because it is considered a classic. My favorite part of this book is the fact that it gives the reader a glimpse of what life was like for the average nobleman of the day...(in the 1850's) It has some interesting descriptions of Russian family life, the life of the peasantry and how the younger generation interacted with the older generation (hence the title, &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; although the original Russian is called &quot;Fathers and Children&quot;). One of the main characters, Bazarov, is a self proclaimed nihilist who rejects all forms of authority, causing problems for the older generations (his parents &amp; his friend's parents), but attracting the attention of the people of his (the younger) generation. This book has no real plot...it is merely the story of how one man brings his nihilist ideas into other peoples' lives &amp; it gives accounts of everybody else's reactions to these nihilist ideas. It is an interesting book &amp; a pretty quick read, but it can drag in places...especially if the reader is waiting for something interesting to happen. All in all, I believe this book is worth reading, if just to get a taste of &quot;Old Russia&quot;, but if you are looking for an exciting &quot;can't-put-it-down-sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-page-turner&quot;, you won't find it in this book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Fathers and SonsFirst off, I love Russian literature.

It far surpasses most of Dostoyevsky's works and possibly, in my opinion, could outrank even Tolstoy. A reader with a good knowledge of Russia will not fail to appreciate &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; and will not at all regret the cost of this book. I was not able to put it down, not so much from being riveted to an adventurous plot, but from being captivated by the sublime, marvelous beauty of Turgenev's prose (and, of course, Rosemary Edmonds' wonderful translation). &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; is a very powerful book, eye-opening and profoundly sad, which every reader will appreciate."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Isn't it so true! -- and it always will be so, as it has in the past. Perhaps Baby Boomers reading this review will recall what their parents thought of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc. ... and what many of us, at the same time thought about the Nixonian \\"Establishment\\" *.* Who was right? I'll encourage you to answer this one.But, as to this book, it's one of the finest Russian Classics I've ever read (and I've read many -- see my listmania lists on Russian works). It's a MYTH that all Russian novels are dreary -- you can even find humor stowed away here and there in Dostoyevsky if you actually read him. You'll find this book especially upbeat, for the most part. It has its serious moments but it also conveys notable hilarity and absurdity as well, ergo, \\"the duel\\"!Two young educated men: 1) come into philosophical conflict with their respective elders, and, 2) fall in love with their respective female fancies. \\"It's as simple as that,\\" as Tolstoy would say!The ending is one of the most compelling closings I've ever encountered. It's quite moving and the Hallmark of a shrewd novelist. I think that the ending, in particular, makes this work as savoury for women as it is for men, perhaps even moreso. At 157 pages, it's a pretty fast read.Michael Katz, (Professor of Slavic Languages, University of Texas), did a fine job on this particular translation -- very fluid and smooth reading. There are also some very informative, but brief, footnotes in this edition which are imperative for the reader who is not much apprised of Russian culture of this period (it takes place just prior to the elimination of Russian serfdom which happened in the early 1860s).This work is also a good warm up prequel, as some have mentioned, to the Russian Mother of All Novels: \\"War and Peace\\" (Tolstoy). However, I will point out one chief difference between the writing styles of Tolstoy and Turgenev... Tolstoy is DEEP, psychologically speaking and exudes tons of sub-plots. Turgenev is straightforward and he writes directly that to which he has witnessed in life... nothing more. It's infinitely readable to all.This is a fine novel for anyone who enjoys peeking into the daily inner-workings and inevitable peccadillos of the average family. If I have a complaint with this edition, I confess to finding myself squinting at the notably small fonts.But then, I am getting on in life and I can't see as good as I used to *.*"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"The multitude of reviews for this very famous book...Well, son, there's nothing new to say in this review. So, here are a few of the things (some trifling) that gave me such pleasure when I read this back toward the end of high school.1. The scene early in the book between Fenitchka and Pavel Petrovitch. Later, Fenitchka confesses discomfort around Pavel, due to Bazarov's romantic advances in the garden. Was I alone in seeing a bit of the ole wist of the bachelor (which is refered to several times in the novel, apropos of Pavel) in Pavel's appreciation of Fenitchka and babe?2. The duel between Pavel and Bazarov is masterfully and elegantly rendered. Piotr cringing behind a tree in my edition's woodcut was a bonus.3. The melancholy that pervades the entire book. Yes, I've weaned myself on Faulkner and Chekhov, where all humor is black humor. Bazarov dying of typhus from surgical infection, Anna Sergeyevna appearing at the Illyitch abode dressed as a mourning wife, though she earlier spurned Bazarov's romantic advances...All minutely and beautifully portrayed.4.

Turgenev comments on topics ranging from social conditions in the Russian Empire to the transitory nature of philosophical systems of belief. The tone of the book is gentle, even affectionate, toward its characters, hardly the tone that one expects from a highly controversial novel. I believe that its is what makes it so effective in communicating Turgenev's meaning. Perhaps it is this, in turn, that made it so controversial."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"The art involved in creating this novel is what makes it a truly amazing and valuable piece of literature. Each character has characteristics that are very human. The thoughts,ideas, and ideals of the very different characters are the entirety of the plot. Turgenev does such an implorable job of creating conflict, that he doesn't need to place the characters in any action in order to attract the reader. This is a must read for any fan of Russian literature!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"In this novel, Turgenev names, defines, and discusses the concept &quot;nihilism.&quot; This book belongs in the same league with Dostoyevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and Camus' &quot;The Stranger,&quot; as a masterpiece that successfully marries literature, philosophy, and valuable psychological insights. Through the character of Bazarov we also get a whiff of the character of the Russian society--and not just of the mid 19th century, but also of the Russian society today--a society chosen by history to be a place of drastic measures and extremes. It is no wonder that since Turgenev's time, Russian society and its intellectuals have oscillated between anarchy and tyranny, idealism and cynicism. Turgenev, who came from a wealthy family and never needed to write to make a living, nevertheless was a prolific author, and with this novel he made a significant contribution to Russian and world literature."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"It's easy to get lost in a sub-plot and believe that this book is about a sociopolitical clash between the old and the new, with the new being a nihilist forerunner of Russian revolution. But the book is extremely weak in the area of political discussion. As a political statement this book would be a dismal failure. Fortunately, the little bit of oversimplified politics that was tossed carelessly into the book is fairly irrelevant to the story.This book is as good as anything ever produced in Russian literature, in the class of Solzhenitsyn, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. It's good because it's emotional.For me, the main character is one who appears for a very short time and seems to be a minor character - Bazarov's father. His love of his son, and the relationship between Arkady and his father, are what the book is named after, and what it's about. I love the protest that Bazarov's father makes to God.Two school graduates, Arkady and Bazarov, return home to their families after years away at school. Nihilist Bazarov clashes with Arkady's traditionalist uncle, but don't all generations clash a little over something. That's part of the relationship. Both young men fall in love with local women. I think Arkady and Katia would be great together. She would treat him like a king and lead him by the nose, and he would adore her his whole life and do whatever she told him to do."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Henry James wrote of Turgenev, \\"No one has had a closer vision, or a hand at once more ironic and more tender, for the individual figure . . . all its particulars of weakness and strength, of ugliness and beauty, of oddity and charm.\\" This ability to create characters simultaneously flawed and admirable (or, to put it crassly, likeable and unlikeable), James correctly believed, helped Turgenev stay clear \\"from any peril of caricature.\\"The young intelligentsia who were Turgenev's contemporaries, however, failed to see beyond the barbed myopia of the two lead characters of the book, Arkady and especially his friend Bazarov. Unable to look past the zealous pretensions of the nihilists in the novel, Russian youth read it as a mockery. (That the older, liberal generation of the book doesn't come off any better seems to have been lost on them.) \\"I was struck by hands I wanted to clasp,\\" the author lamented; his sympathies had actually been with his younger characters.But the satire, both perceived and real, of the political and intellectual trends of the day are not what make \\"Fathers and Sons\\" so powerful. The struggle between the new ideas of the young and the status quo of their elders is eternal; Turgenev could substitute \\"nihilism\\" with virtually any philosophical or intellectual trend and still have a similar novel, different only in the details. Like Austen, he weaves his plot wholly from the relationships between his characters: the older Pavel's disdain for the two young nihilists, Arkady's love for Katya, Bazarov's thwarted overtures toward Madame Odintsova, the tensions of both young men between each other and with their parents. Each of these relationships generates its own power on the page; for example, the scene in which Bazarov leaves his parents, whose traditionalism and backwardness embarrass and aggravate the newly minted dilettante, is one of the most heartrending in literature, and Turgenev pulls it off without resorting to undue sentimentality.When I read the novel in my youth, I was fascinated (and distracted) by the Russian historical setting--the serfs and the landlords, the importation of Western culture into St. Petersburg society, the philosophical trends of the day. Although all those things are wonderful elements of the novel, I now realize that's a little like reading \\"Oedipus the King\\" and focusing on life in Thebes. A more recent second reading revealed to me the universality of Turgenev's story. As its title suggests, \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is a masterpiece not simply because it is a great novel about Russia, but because it is a great novel about families."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Every since the beginning of time there has been generational conflict but also love between parents and children. In his classic Russian masterpiece of 1861 the novelist Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883)illuminates these issues in a short book of 225 pages. We see different philosophies from the characters ranging from skepticism to pious Christian belief.The novel is set shortly before the emancipation of the Russian serfs in 1861. Arkady, a young graduate of the University of Petersburg, and his friend Barzhov, a medical student, arrive at his father Nikolai's small run down estate. Barzhov and Arkady are nihilists who wish to eschew every form of romanticism in life. They claim to disdain music and poetry believing in materialism and scientific progress. Barzhov is a pre-Bolshevist in his disdain of traditional religion, morals and Russian society. He is influenced by Hegel and urges revolution in Russia. Arkady is a shallower and weaker young man. He loves his father, his old roue of an uncle Pavel who lives on the estate and is a follower of Barzhov. The two former students learn Nikolai has a young mistress who has produced a child. They cast no scorn on Nikolai for this reality and wish the old man well. It is obvious that Arkady is a man who loves his father, mourns his mother and old nursemaid and enjoys the beauty and simplicity of the Russian countryside.Later in the novel there will be two romances. Barzhov feels attracted to the wealthy and beautiful Anna while Arkady falls for her younger sister. Barzov dies helping peasants during a typhoid epidemic while Arkady weds the young lady he has been courting. Father Nikolai weds the mistress and the couple live happily together on their estate.The novel is famous for its introduction of nihilism in Russian fiction. Barzhov is a fascinating and complex human being. He speaks against marriage and love but it is clear he is a man who loves and feels deeply. His deathbed scene is short but powerful. The picture of his weeping parents visiting his grave is a high emotional mountain in the land of literature. It is a scene not easily forgotten. This is a book calling out for a modern screen treatment.Turgenev is excellent in his lyrical descriptions of the Russian peasants, the changing seasons and the flora and fauna of the countryside. Despite several readings I always enjoy this powerful prose work of a master of the art. If you are just beginning to read Russian literature this is an excellent short work to begin your journey. The long introductory essay on the life and works of Turgenev and the liberal agenda in nineteenth century Tsarist Russia is also a classic deserving of your attention. Excellent and moving. This is a novel to be cherished!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev.

Turgenev is a wonderful stylist - economical, precise, and lyrical when it befits his characters."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Turgenev definitely writes with a lighter touch than Tolstoy or Dostoevsky--which is not to say he's lightweight, just that he doesn't dwell on the heavy (maybe ponderous) \\"God and Man\\" issues of the other two. Many Russians see Turgenev as more Western than other Russian writers, almost French, and his writing does have a certain elegance to it. There are social themes but it seemed to me the social issues were a backdrop for the inner lives of the characters. Bazarov is indeed a nihilist but that seems incidental to the nuances of his personality, which Turgenev develops masterfully. Each of the characters could easily lapse into typecasting but Turgenev has a fundamental sympathy for and awareness of their personalities, so the writing is good even if you have no particular interest in the historic dynamics of the dawn of post-serfdom Russia."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Like almost every Russian author on the planet Turgenev writes in a heavy, dense style, and, yes, you can expect to trip over a couple dozen names in the first few pages. But if you struggle through the first few chapters you'll find a truly good book.One thing many readers will like is its comparatively diminutive size: compared to some of Turgenev's later compatriots this is a very small book but like his fellow Russian authors there are elements of love, religion, philosophy, social commentary, and politics throughout the book.The book centers around the differences between progressives and conservatives in relation to the generation gaps between young and old and the new progressives (nihilists) find their logic and science fails in the light of love.I found the book to be very readable and accessible and a good story that still has relevance."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This book is about generational conflict in 19th century Russia, when the moderate liberals of the 1840s generation are confronted with their radical sons from the 1860s.Given the upheaval in Russia in the 19th century, this has the potential to be some very interesting reading. However the radical sons in this case are portrayed as being nihilists and to the best of my knowledge (and the publishers introduction confirms this) very few of those creatures actually existed in 19th century Russia. There were lots of Social Democrats, Socialists, and Anarchists of all shades among the Russian radicals, and all of them shared a common hatred of the establishment, but they all had detailed visions of what they wanted to put in its place.The young heroes of Turgenev's novel believe their duty is simply to destroy everything in front of them, and leave the new society up to the next generation. They repudiate the serfs and the peasants, the traditional heroes of the left, just as much as the church and the Tsar.In my opinion, since the philosophical basis of the story is so far removed from the actual reality, the novel looses a lot of its punch. I had a hard time swallowing the idea that these young men would seriously take nihilism as a philosophy. Of course the idea of nihilism itself isn't supposed to be central to the themes of generational conflict in the novel, but I found that was the stumbling block I couldn't get past.At the very least though, this novel is very short, compared to the epics of Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky. Less than 300 pages, and (about a third of that the publishers introduction) you could easily read this book in a week and then brag to your friends how you got another Russian classic under your belt.Speaking of the introduction...Like all republished classic books this contains a lengthy introduction, in this case about 1/3rd of the actual book. The edition I read was introduced by Isaiah Berlin (whose biography on Marx I just recently completed), and contains an interesting summary of Turgenev's own political views, and the big controversy this book caused when it was first published. According to Isaiah Berlin, one of the reasons the philosophy of this book is so muddled is because Turgenev was under pressure both from his radical friends and his conservative publisher. In some ways I found the introduction more interesting than the actual book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"I recently read the novel Fathers and Sons (underlined title) by Ivan Turgenev. Turgenev uses vivid imagery to accurately portray life in 19th century Russia, pre-emancipation of the serfs. At this time, people were tired of the tsarist rule and were demanding reform. As society was on the brink of change, many different political theories were emerging such as nihilism. The main character of the novel, Bazarov, is a nihilist who doesn't accept any principals or believes. Bazarov is just one example of many nihilists who existed in his time. They denied and wanted to destroy the government, yet offered no way to rebuild anything. It makes sense that Turgenev kills Bazarov at the end of the novel.Turgenev didn't see Bazarov as having any plans for the future so he had to be killed at the end.Turgenev shows the eternal conflict between the older generation (Bazarov's and Arkady's dad) and the younger generation (Bazarov and Arkady) and their clashing views on reform. Yet this book can be applied to any time period because there will always be different views between the older and younger generations. The famous Russian critic, Pisarev wrote, \\"Turgenev's novel, in addition to its artistic beauty, is remarkable for the fact that it stirs the mind, leads to reflection.\\" Turgenev does not assume a critical attitude and let's the reader come up with their own opinions and judgements. I recommend this novel to anyone who has their doubts about buying it."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Friedrich Nietzsche once said, \\"The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.\\" In the book Fathers and Sons, by Ivan Turgenev, two friends, Arkady and Bazarov, learn just this. At first the two are best friends, close as brothers, but by the end of the book, they go their separate ways. Reading along, it is surprising to see the initial love between the protagonists turn to distasteful resentment. Analyzing Arkady from the beginning of his relationship with Bazarov, through his period of doubt, and to his final hatred of Bazarov, Turgenev clearly depicts a significant change in his life.We see Arkady in fascination of his friend Bazarov at the beginning of the story. When describing him to his father, Nikolai, in a carriage on their way to his home, Arkady says, \\"Please, dad, make much of him. I can't tell you how I prize his friendship...he knows everything\\" (6). Bazarov studied medicine in college and is a firm believer in nihilism. Arkady idolizes these philosophical beliefs and takes them as his own. An interesting point to note is that in his conversation with his father we find out that Arkady had only met Bazarov recently, within the past few months. I'm sure everyone can recall a person who we met and instantly liked, accepting their beliefs and values without second thought, blinded by their charisma. Arkady was indeed blinded by Bazarov and quickly jumped into a close relationship with him.Bazarov and Arkady's belief in nothing causes friction when they get home. In a scene where the two young graduates are conversing with Arkady's father, Nikolai, and his Uncle, Pavel, there is immediate tension between generations. Naive persistence versus acquired maturity. Nikolai is an old farmer, and Pavel is a bonafide aristocrat, of whose kind Bazarov detests. Bazarov is quite alright with being rude to Pavel, and disrespectful towards Nikolai. Turgenev describes Bazarov in the conversation at the table as \\"not only not overawed, he gave abrupt and indifferent answers, and in the tone of his voice there was something churlish, almost insolent\\" (19). Even though Arkady subscribes to Bazarov's nihilistic beliefs, he still maintains respect for his family, despite their different beliefs. Arkady comments to his friend, \\"I must say...you weren't nice to him...you have hurt his feelings\\" (20). We see here that even though Arkady is following his friends lead, there are moments where we see the difference between the two. For instance, in a scene where Nikolai is heard playing the violoncello, Bazarov bursts out in laughter (due to his belief that art, literature, and music are irrelevant), yet Arkady does not feel the same. Bazarov simply thought it was foolish that Nikolai, the old farmer, would be playing music, and he \\"went on laughing; but much as he revered his master, this time Arkady did not even smile\\" (34).Bazarov and Arkady decided to travel to a certain town about twenty five miles distance from Arkady's home. While at the home of Sitnikov, Bazarov's old friend, we get some insight as to how Bazarov sees himself as godly. We hear it straight from Sitnikov when he is talking to Arkady and says, \\"I am an old acquaintance of Yevgeny Vassilyitch (Bazarov), and, I must say - his disciple. I am indebted to him for my regeneration....\\" (50). Arkady must have been starting to question his own value of Bazarov. While at a ball that the governor of town was holding, Arkady has further doubts, yet he can't verbalize them at this point in the story. Arkady is asked to introduce Bazarov to a woman named Madame Odintsov, a free thinking, independent woman. Bazarov describes her as having got \\"a pair of shoulders such as I've not set eyes on for a long while\\" (60). Arkady knew that Bazarov thought he could get any woman he wanted, and \\"was wounded by Bazarov's cynicism, but - as often happens - he reproached his friend not precisely for what he did not like in him...\\" (60). Arkady criticizes his friends low view of women, not his cynicism. This suggests that Arkady has serious doubts about his friend, but is somehow insecure in letting him know that. Arkady is continuing to realize that he does not hold to the exact beliefs as his friend.Their differences continue to be seen in their conversations with various people. Talking to Madame Odintsova at her house, \\"She turned the conversation upon music; but noticing that Bazarov did not appreciate art, she quietly brought it back to botany, even though Arkady was just launching into a discourse upon the significance of national melodies\\" (62). Arkady must have felt that he was but a shadow to his \\"friend\\". Why would he continue to be persecuted by beliefs he did not wholly accept to be true? It is painfully apparent that Arkady has a love for art. While at the home of Anna and Katya Sergyevna, two sisters they had the pleasure of meeting, Arkady was able to hear Katya, the younger sibling, play Mozart. Unlike how Bazarov would likely feel, Arkady has emotional ties to the music, for he \\"was particularly struck by the last part of the sonata\\" (69). Nihilists are not supposed to be \\"struck\\" by anything that has to do with music, art, literature, etc. Turgenev describes how Katya and Arkady would take walks together, how \\"Katya adored nature, and Arkady loved it , thought he did not dare to acknowledge it\\" (73). Needless to say, Arkady has a war going on inside of his soul. He is changing.A bit later in the book, Bazarov and Arkady travel to the former's house. In a scene where the two are resting on a haystack, we see some tension come out. We discover that it is not only Arkady who feels resentment. Bazarov outright insults Pavel in front on Arkady. He called him \\"very justly, an imbecile\\" (106). This infuriates Arkady, but he still tries to not have an argument, but Bazarov says, \\"let us quarrel for once in earnest\\" (106). Interestingly enough, it is Bazarov that wants to fight, he obviously feels hatred towards his \\"friend\\" when he says, \\"you'd be no match for me. I'd have you by the throat in a minute\\" (106). Turgenev actually describes Arkady as being afraid, after he heard this. Bazarov was so upset that \\"there was such menace in grim earnest in the smile that distorted his lips, and his glittering eyes\\" (106-107). Thankfully, Bazarov's father showed up rather unaware, just in time to announce that dinner was ready.Returning to his own home with Bazarov in tow, Arkady is troubled. Arkady changed. He was melancholic; \\"he actually was dull and longed to get away. He tried going long walks till he was tired, but that was no use\\" (115). Even in his own home, he felt disdain for life, for his relationship with Bazarov. Last time he brought Bazarov to his home, he couldn't stop singing his praises, yet now he sings a lament. So troubled Arkady travels to Nikolskoe, the town in which Anna and Katya reside, to ease his mind. He finally breaks free from Bazarov. He finds comfort with Katya, freedom from the chains of idolatry. He \\"looked more tranquil\\" (137). His peace is disturbed when Bazarov shows up to the house, and they quarrel again. Bazarov adequately puts it when he says, \\"a sentimentalist would say, \`I feel that our paths are beginning to part,' but I will simply say that we're tired of each other\\" (142).And how true Nietzsche's words are for these two comrades. They love one another as enemies, and hate each other as friends. Arkady started his journey with Bazarov on a positive note, idolizing him and his beliefs in every way. Slowly throughout the story there brews a war inside his soul. He begins to have doubt. He wants freedom from his cell, and that is what he gets in the end. He is finally able to overcome his fears and be honest with Bazarov. So in the end the two friends part ways, one ever naive in his cynicism, but one changed for the better."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Russian society has been prone to tremendous repudiations from all sides. There is a point in life at which intensity about certain things can shape the future, but woe to the character who falls in love with someone who has already become set in her ways. Nietzsche thought Socrates had more irony than we usually expect from philosophers because Socrates was married and sent the weeping women away when it was time to drink the hemlock. I sympathized with the characters in the novel Fathers and Sons, even at the point when one becomes incredibly fond of a woman he can't have. Expecting to change the world can stand in the way of having fun and prosperity. I like the song Coming Up Close by 'Til Tuesday which hardly has anything in common with this book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Not exactly a connoisseur, I would say I am definitely a Russian literature enthusiasts, and rank the writings of the Russians up there with the greats. Doestoyevsky is tops, and Checkov for drama, though after reading Father and Sons, I am apt to squeeze Turgenev in front of Tolstoy. It's a difficult read, no doubt, one that requires determination, perhaps equal to the determination of that protagonist Bazarov and his scientific determinism. As in any good novel, the weightier aspects of the story are gradually revealed, the more potent, effectual details saved for last. I found certain sections a bit winded, particularly some of the exchanges between the protagonist and his enamored disciple, and close friend Arcady. The copy I read is the Signet Classic, translated by Reavy. Russian literature is effective because it always seems to ruffle the feathers of the litterati elite. I'm not sure if modern America can provide a similar experience (maybe South Park?)"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Upon completion of this novel I have found that this piece of art by Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev uses not only flawless story lines, comprehensive translation, but an awsome use of beutiful phraseology, that masterfuly paints not only a picture but a 207 page tale in your mind. a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Fathers and Sons is an extraordinary tale of generational conflict, but it is also a book of ideas. It explores not only the conflict of old versus new, but it also explores the conflict between rationalism and science and emotion, the arts, and the humanities. Don't let the big names scare you."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Making a new friend in college can be exciting. It can be especially thrilling when you meet someone you consider to be a kindred spirit, a \\"bosom buddy\\" who shares your beliefs and ideals. In a mere matter of days, it is possible to feel as though you know everything about the other person and that there is nothing they can do to terminate the friendship. If, however, you take the next step in your friendship, and decide to live with the other person for a period of time, sharing living quarters beneficial or harmful to the established friendship. Such is the case for young Arkady in Ivan Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, who invites his college friend, Bazarov, to stay with him and his family for a period of time. Despite the close kinship and admiration Arkady feels for Bazarov at the opening of the novel, through living with him, Bazarov's poor relationship with Arkady's family, his arrogance, and ultimately, Bazarov's nihilist views, causes a rift in the two young men's friendship.At the commencement of the novel, Arkady is described as being young (14). Arkady's voice is even defined as being youthful (14). He calls his father, Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov, \\"daddy\\" when greeting him after arriving home from college, which also makes him seem a bit childish. He becomes \\"a little flurried and overcome with shyness\\" when introducing his friend, the \\"great Bazarov, about whom {he} has written so often\\" (14). Arkady's deportment is staunchly different from Bazarov's self-assured and intelligent demeanor (15).Shortly after Arkady arrives home, during dinner with his family and Bazarov, Arkady avoids calling his father daddy. He also tries to drink more. It seems that he does this because his family still regards him as a child, even though it seems that he clearly has now begun to regard himself as a man, despite the fact that he still does things that make him seem like a young child, like referring to his father as \\"daddy\\" (24). He does, however, seem to resort back to calling his father \\"daddy\\" when Bazarov is not present.The first disagreement Arkady has with Bazarov seems to occur shortly after the aforementioned dinner when Arkady tries to prove that he is no longer a child. Arkady does not share Bazarov's views on his uncle. Bazarov says that he finds his uncle, Pavel Petrovitch Kirsanov, \\"funny\\" but Arkady tells him that \\"he has a really good heart\\" (24).Throughout the novel, there continues to be more tension between Pavel and Bazarov. After discovering that Bazarov is a nihilist, Pavel makes a negative comment about Bazarov of which Arkady disapproves. However, when Bazarov and Pavel argue over art, Arkady seems to take his uncle's side. He tells Bazarov that he was \\"curt\\" with Pavel, and when Bazarov misunderstands something he says, he tells him to not be \\"so exasperating\\" (34). Arkady takes his uncle's side again when Bazarov speaks reproachfully about Russians. Arkady says that his uncle not far off when he accused Bazarov of having a low opinion of Russians (49). The second time Bazarov and Pavel have a heated discussion, Arkady even becomes embarrassed by some of Bazarov's remarks to his uncle (80). By the end of the novel, Bazarov and Arkady have a heated discussion regarding Pavel, and Bazarov expresses the desire to fight Arkady because of it.Bazarov and Arkady also differ on their views of Arkady's father. First, he disagrees with him on his father's relationship with Fenichka, who is Nikolai's housekeeper and mother of Nikolai's son. Arkady believes that his father should marry her because she is the mother of his child. Bazarov, being a nihilist, and not believe in marriage, does not agree. Bazarov even tells Arkady that he did not expect him to \\"attach some importance to the marriage tie\\" (49).The second point on which Arkady and Bazarov disagree regarding his Nikolai is on Nikolai's romanticism. Bazarov laugh at Nikolai for playing the cello, but Arkady does not share his amusement over the situation (50). Bazarov also says that Arkady's father is a \\"backnumber\\" and that his day is over (51). As he does with his uncle, Bazarov points out that Arkady does not truly know his father (51). The only point on which they agree when it comes to Nikolai is that he should read more intellectual books. Arkady even takes about his father's book, and gives him something more academic to read (52).The second factor that causes a rift in Bazarov's and Arkady's friendship is Bazarov's arrogance. Throughout the novel, Bazarov seems to make several comments that seem to suggest that he has an unflattering view of most people, but things rather highly of himself. He tells Arkady that he hates people (132). He tells also says to Arkady that attractive women have no need to understand their conversations, and seems to always be surprised when he finds himself in the company of a somewhat intelligent woman (74). The two women he seems to have high regards for are Madame Odintsova, who is a young widow whom he eventually falls in love with, and Fenichka.Bazarov also seems to believe that he is a god. While at Nicolskoye, Madame Odintsova's residence, Arkady expresses frustration over the fact that Bazarov's acquaintance, Viktor Sitnikov, came there unannounced and uninvited. Bazarov says that he is aware that Arkady is \\"still stupid\\" because he \\"needs such louts\\" because \\"it is not for the gods to glaze pottery\\" (112). This causes Arkady to question whether Bazarov considers him to be a god, also. When Arkady asks Bazarov, he merely says again that Arkady is \\"still stupid\\" (112). It is through this conversation that \\"the whole bottomless pit of Bazarov's arrogance is revealed to him\\" (112). Shortly after this, the two men leave Nicolskoye, and Arkady feels as if the 16 miles ride is actually like 30 (115).Finally, what truly causes the most major rift in Bazarov's and Arkady's relationship is one of the points on which they initially agreed. Bazarov is a nihilist, Arkady claims to be one also, but it is clear throughout the novel that he does not hold to the principles of nihilism as firmly as Bazarov. While at Nicolskoye, Arkady finds that he enjoys the company of Madame Odintsova's sister, Katya, even though he initially seems to express interest in Madame Odintsova. Katya plays the piano, and as a nihilist, Arkady should not enjoy listening to her play, but he does. Bazarov almost makes Arkady try when he accusing him of playing the piano, himself (104). This would have been a major slight to Arkady, because by accusing him of expressing interest in the arts, Bazarov was indicated that he did not really believe Arkady was a nihilist, and nihilism was the philosophy Bazarov conclude holds the most truth.Much to his chagrin, Bazarov finds that he has fallen in love with Madame Odintsova. Because of his views, however, he cannot truly allow himself to love her. He recognizes that he does not view her in the same manner as he does other women, but also knows that they do not align with his nihilism. Arkady, also has interest in Madame Odintsova, but by the end of the novel, realizes that he truly loves her sister, Katya (181).After Arkady announces his proposal of marriage to Katya, Bazarov and Arkady discuss the end of their friendship (186). As a nihilist, Bazarov cannot truly accept Arkady's marriage, but he does express that he believes that this is the best choice for Arkady. He says that he believes that Arkady is not really cut out for their nihilistic lifestyle (186).Despite their close relationship at the beginning of the novel, the two college friends, Arkady and Bazarov find themselves distant as the book closes. Bazarov passes away, and before his death can barely remember his friend, Arkady. Arkady marries Katya, and has a child with her. It is apparent by the end of their friendship, that Arkady and Bazarov are completely different men who cannot really relate to one another. The relationship between the two men could not withstand Bazarov's mockery of Arkady's family, arrogance and nihilism. Their relationship could not adapt, or bend, rather the men found that in the end, their relationship was broken."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"In so much of Turgenev's finest fiction, love fades, slips away, vanishes before it can even flower; the mood of these stories is melancholy, nostalgic; the writing, delicate, precise, almost translucent. Turgenev was to be the only Russian writer with avowedly European outlook and sympathies.The objectivity of Turgenev as a chronicler of the Russian intelligentsia is apparent in his early novels. Unsympathetic though he may have been to some of the trends in the thinking of the younger, radical generation that emerged after the Crimean War, he endeavoured to portray the positive aspirations of these young men and women with scrupulous candour. Their attitude to him, particularly that of such leading figures as the radical critics Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov, was generally cold when it was not actively hostile. His own rather self-indulgent nature was challenged by the forcefulness of these younger contemporaries. He moved away from an emphasis on the fallibility of his heroes, who had been attacked as a type by Chernyshevsky. Instead, Turgenev focused on their youthful ardour and their sense of moral purpose. These attributes had obvious revolutionary implications that were not shared by Turgenev, whose liberalism could accept gradual change but opposed anything more radical, especially the idea of an insurgent peasantry.Turgenev's greatest novel, Fathers and Sons, grew from this sense of involvement and yet succeeded in illustrating, with remarkable balance and profundity, the issues that divided the generations. The hero, Bazarov, is the most powerful of Turgenev's creations. A nihilist, denying all laws save those of the natural sciences, uncouth and forthright in his opinions, he is nonetheless susceptible to love and by that token doomed to unhappiness. In sociopolitical terms he represents the victory of the nongentry revolutionary intelligentsia over the gentry intelligentsia to which Turgenev belonged. In artistic terms he is a triumphant example of objective portraiture, and in the poignancy of his death he approaches tragic stature. The miracle of the novel as a whole is Turgenev's superb mastery of his theme, despite his personal hostility toward Bazarov's anti-aestheticism, and his success in endowing all the characters with a quality of spontaneous life. Yet at the novel's first appearance the radical younger generation attacked it bitterly as a slander, and the conservatives condemned it as too lenient in its exposure of nihilism.Turgenev's novels are &quot;months in the country,&quot; which contain balanced contrasts such as those between youth and age, between the tragic ephemerality of love and the comic transience of ideas, between Hamlet's concern with self and the ineptitudes of the quixotic pursuit of altruism. Always touchy about his literary reputation, Turgenev reacted to the almost unanimously hostile reception given to Fathers and Sons by leaving Russia. He took up residence in Baden-Baden in southern Germany. Quarrels with Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky and his general estrangement from the Russian literary scene made him an exile in a very real sense. This book will give you the climate of Russia at the time, it's like a keg of powder waiting to explode!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Read today and out of context Fathers and Sons hardly seems like a classic next to Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, etc... However, understood as a template for the greatness to come in Russian literature, Turgenev masterpiece must be appreciated for the complexity of its characters and its bravery in exposing Russian society. Beyond this, it is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Because there are several editions of this novel available to buy, and some much cheaper than this one, I first wanted to highlight that I believe this one is by far the best to date, for two reasons: the translator, Rosemary Edmonds' version, is elegant and smooth, and her own introduction is excellent - providing meaningful reflection and understanding not only of the novel, but Turgenev's talent, other works, and the political and literary times he lived through. The second major reason is because this edition (I think) is the only one that contains Isaiah Berlin's brilliant, insightful lecture on the novel that he first gave in 1970, and was included in this edition from 1975 onwards, and that offers much insight into the novel's historical context and background in terms of philosophy and politics in Russia during Turgenev's lifetime.While I also love the fiction of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, having read this, still Turgenev's most famous and popular novel, followed then by reading Edmonds' introduction, I was not surprised to learn from her that it was Turgenev who proved to be the most popular Russian novelist in Europe during the shared lifetimes of these three giant authors and, throughout the 1850s and 60s, Turgenev was likewise and the most famous and popular in Russia - while, fascinatingly, also being the most controversial - there was passionate debate both for and against Turgenev and this novel - that continued at least up until the 1950s! - despite having spent most of his life abroad, living in Paris, in particular (while always devoted to Russia and its people, he was definitely a passionate Europhile).Turgenev's greater popularity, compared with his two most famous counterparts, I feel, rests on the deeper humanity and, thereby, psychological and emotional complexity, he breathes into his principal characters from their first introduction; whereas with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, it seems to me that their own characters' complexity originates more from subsequent experiences of trauma, crisis and conflict in their lives.Of the characters themselves, there is much to enjoy, be engaged as well as challenged by. Bazarov and Arkady, university students, take a holiday together, visiting Arkady's landlord and liberal-minded, caring father (Nikolai) and uncle (Pavel), formerly a distinguished army captain, at Nikolia's farm and home, with whom Pavel also lives. The conflict between \`fathers and sons' is played out primarily in this holiday, arising because of Bazarov's deepseated nihilism and his insistent, relentlessly stern advocacy of his negative, annihilistic views as he expresses them towards Nikolai and Pavel.The story is worth reading just two characters alone: Bazarov himself, who is vividly infuriating and an anti-hero one will never forget on reading. He is supremely arrogant and contemptuous of others; recognising no rules of conduct or recognition of anything of value, save that which he himself defines and determines; is rude to his charming and much devoted friend, Arkady, who is himself in such awe of Bazarov and he can't help but give allegiance to him and his negative vision and attitude towards society, history, life in general (and particular). Even though this allegiance, along with Bazarov's comments, confound and upset Arkady's father - and frankly infuriate Pavel, ironically it is Bazarov's nihilistic own rejection of Arkady's friendship that brings Arkady to his senses, thereby explicitly reaffirming his humanism, empathy and love he always felt for both his father and uncle.While Nikolai and Arkady are also very well drawn, besides Bazarov, the other character who is memorable, amusing - with a caustic sense of humour and irony -superbly realised, and great fun to read about - is Pavel. He's a Russian who, while now elderly, remains as he was from his youth: distinguished, handsome, a reputation as a \`lady-killer', with an aristocratic flair, and besotted with English bespoke and colourful tailoring and fancy accoutrements (handkerchiefs, cufflinks, neckerchiefs). He's also deeply civilised, graceful, yet in no doubt of his views, with a strong and independent viewpoint and depth of character. He is also deeply generous and caring, having giving much of his money to Nikolai, to help him keep his farm and land.And the intense debates between Pavel (increasingly infuriated), and Bazarov (bored, steely, deeply rude and negative), are worth the price of the novel many times over."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Turgenev's Fathers and Sons is a rare classic novel that combines a story set in an era of social and political change in feudal Russia with a theme regarding generational conflict that has a timeless relevance to any age. His characters capture the tensions of youth filled with passion over new ideas clashing with the established ways of their elders.It is classically Russian in that the flow of the novel is driven by dialogue between the various characters rather than significant action on their part, although there is a romantic element to the story that fits perfectly as a subplot echoing the family tensions between the 2 young men and their fathers.Bazarov , whose introduction into the home of his friend Arcady sets the story in motion, is a self-proclaimed nihilist and his idealism and passion are the straw that stirs the drink of much that follows. Some of Turgenev's characters are reluctant to face the obvious changes taking place in their society and the resulting gap between modern and traditional beliefs and ways of life underly much of what drives these characters to act in the way they do.Fathers and Sons is a relatively easy book to read and enjoy when compared with the more challenging works of other Russian novelists but it is as extremely rewarding as it is accessible. I found it to be memorable, enriching and a good investment of time."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Having been introduced to Turgenev through his \\"Sketches From a Hunter's Album\\" -- a most enjoyable, lyrical collection -- I decided to read \\"Fathers and Sons\\" and was not disappointed. Turgenev's insights into human thought and behavior are as incisive here as they were in the other book. This relatively short book seems simple, but it really isn't. There is a lot going on here, reflective not only of how people interact with each other, but also of Russia at a certain period. The wordsmithing here is masterful, either a tribute to the author or the translator or both. But the real power of this novel is the classic story of the interaction between generations, between the sexes and between the classes. This is a book well worth your reading."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This is a book about the effect of 1 man on his peers who represent the new culture, and their parents who represent the old culture.

While is presents a slice of life in Russia in the 1800s, the theme of the older generation's impatience and lack of understandng of that of the younger generation is timeless. It is peculiarly Russian, with much of the heated exchanges between the main characters being about the need for social change in the Russian aristocracy of the time. And, as is typical of youthful views, (or of change and revolution perhaps), the two positions are at extreme odds with each other. If you enjoy social and political history, families, and intellectual debate, this is a fine piece of literature."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"'Fathers and Sons' by Turgenev is no doubt a very importnat book - considered to be Turgenev best work, it features beautiful poetic descriptions, very sharp and wiity dialogues, poignant characters - some spiky and some very soft, and conflicts that will never die and remain relevant until today (like that of nihilism - the term which was coined by Turgenev in this book). It is very captivating and i found Bazarov to be a very interesting charcter (although it seems less original when you look on the literature of the last century. We must remember Bazarov was the Father of the Nihlisits to come. and the originality is his). However, I feel somewhat ambivalent about Turgenev - first of all because his ugly way of treating Dostoevsky at the time, and the way he mocked the young Dostoevsky. Secondly, i'm not sure if it's merely deformed hazy memory but i belive if found his book 'home of the Gentry' to be a better book - maybe because it was more naive and sublime. Anyway, it's certainly a very important book, maybe even a masterpiece - but for me it is not in the level of the great masterpieces of Tolstoi and Dostoevsky. That is because in my opinion his messages and his way of giving them are inferior in it's profoundness to those of the previous two."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"A must for human beings who want to understand and realise the importance and the value of relationships."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"A great book, in my estimation, is one that touches your heart and causes you to change for the better. Ivan Turgenev's novel, Fathers and Sons is, in my view, such a book. Turgenev was not well liked in Russia in his lifetime and is not now, even, regarded as among the foremost of Russian novelists and for good reason. Turgenev scorned his mother country, spending much of this life in France living with the woman he loved and her husband. In the novel he also has a son (Arcady) gently remove from his father a book by Puskin he was reading, substituting for it a book by a German writer no less--high sacrilege even in 19th century Russia. More to the point, in the two young men who are the focal point of the story, Turgenev created characters who display a negative and even hostile view of Russia.The novel has three settings. The first is at the country estate of Nicholas Petrovich Kusimov whose son, Arcady has just graduated from the university and is returning home accompanied by his fellow graduate and mentor, Eugene Vassilich Bazarov. It is Bazarov who becomes the lighting rod and center of the plot. He instantly quarrels with Nicholas' brother, Paul, an aristocratic defender of the status quo. Arcady shares Eugene's nilistic view of life, but is clearly softer and less critical than his intense friend.After a time the pair go to town where they meet Madame Anna Sergeyevna Odinizov, a youngish (29) widow living in relative luxury with her younger sister, Katya. Both young men fall in love with the widow, Arcady with the sort of hopeless puppy love attraction for an older woman and Eugene without admitting it, in a more mature manner. Madame Odinizov is drawn to Eugene's mental acuities and intensity, but it is not clear that she loves him. Arcady, for his part, finds solace with the younger and more submissive Katya. Finally Bazarov blurts out his love for Madame Odinizov which she seemingly rejects and the two young men leave to visit Bazarov's parents.Vassily Ivanich Bazarov is a retired army doctor who now lives with his kind-hearted wife, Arina, on a farm. Both parents, especially, Arina, are thrilled that their son has returned home, but Eugene scorns them as he has all others. Finally after some days he says he is bored and wants to leave. The parents are heartbroken, but understand that their son has greatness in him and cannot be confined to living in obscurity. Arcady then returns to Madame Odinizov's and develops his relationship with Katya, while Eugene returns to the Kusimov estate to resume his biological experiments.The greatness of the book, where it leaves an indelible impression, comes in the last 50 pages. The tragedy that occurs comes suddenly and unexpectedly and touches the lives of all the characters. It will touch your life too and leave you with a greater appreciation for life in all its wonders and futility."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"I can't believe this is the best Turgenev could do for a nihilist character: a grumpy geek who loves frogs.

I think this book should be taken out of libraries and boostores etc."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This is the first fiction book I've read in a long time, and I have to say I'm not too disappointed. Fathers and Sons relates not only the generation gap in 19th century Russia, but also shows how fragile and fake the entire Russian system was in that time period. Every character symbolizes an important facet of Russian society. Paul Petrovich is the old slavophile nobility, convinced that Russians and their ways are the best in the world while they wear English clothing and speak and read in French. His brother Nicholas is the bridge between the old world and the new world, trying to fit in with the new ways while he only understands the old customs. Arcady, who represents those in society who outwardly follow the latest trendy beliefs but can't shake their emotions or their humanity. And Barazov, who represents youth, with its eternal promise of new ideas and ways, but who are blind to their own naive hypocrisy. Certainly there are other characters, but these major figures shape the plot of the book.Turgenev manages to leave no stone unturned, casting withering attacks on peasants, psuedo-intellectualism, government officials, corruption, and conventions. The book mentions that Turgenev alienated and angered many in Russia with this book, and the reader will quickly see why.Turgenev recognized the backwardness of Russia, and that it must change if it were to survive in a new world. The big question was how, and Turgenev shows that while idealists like Bazarov may have new ideas (Bazarov's idea was nihilism, a belief in nothing), those ideas mean nothing if not backed up with solutions to the problems.An excellent book, and very readable. The price is low enough that most people really don't have an excuse to give this one a shot."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"In Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, as in most of Chekhov, nothing much really happens. People talk a lot and that's about it. Should be dull, right? But it isn't. The talk, and the characters revealed, reflect the profound changes that were being felt in Russian society at the end of the 19th Century; changes that would set the stage for much of what was to happen in the 20th Century. But more important to a modern reader, the ideas and the real life implication of those ideas are as current and relevant as when Turgenev wrote. Bazarov, the young 'nihilist', sounds just like the typical student rebel of the 60's (or of the Seattle WTO protests just recently). He has the arrogance and the innocence of idealistic youth. He is as believeable, and as moving in his ultimate hurt, as any young person today might be confronted with the limitations of idealism and the fickle tyranny of personal passion.I loved this book when I first read it as a teenager and I enjoyed it even more on subsequent rereadings. It makes the world of 19th century Russia seem strangely familiar and it gives many a current political thread a grounding in meaningful history."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"The one factor that keeps being brought up in other reviews is the apparent lack of plot. A key point is not being brought in; the nature of Russian literature is to create a socially conscious society. While American and European authors can enter whatever realms they choose and write vivid, thrilling stories, Russian novelists enter a more subdued state. Their concern is not whether their readers are on the edge of their seats in suspense, their concern is that society be made aware of the changes and problems that are arising.'Fathers and Sons' achieves that very well, pitting old Muscovite traditions against the new Western ideas. It's not a page turner, because it isn't supposed to be.I thought it was a brilliant piece. Turgenev outlines quite clearly using only a handful of characters just how opposed the two sides of Russia are. And in the end, he makes very clear that one will have to give. The story is made better because Turgenev shows no favoritism. He carries out his job as an author to the letter: to present the problem, without offering the solution. That is for the reader to decide.And as the book draws to a close, the reader is left wondering, 'Which direction is better?'"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This is such a wonderful novel about two young men returning home from University - Arkady Kirsanov and his friend, Yevgeny who is known mostly as Basarov. Firstly they stop at Arkady's father's poor farm - but he is a landowner. Arkady's father's name is Nikolai and living with him is his brother Pavel. What contrasts we immediately meet - Nikolai whose wife has died (Arkady's mother) but who is living with one of the local peasant women (Fenitchka) and has a son by her, and Pavel whose playboy life collapsed when the princess he hoped to marry rejected him.So here we have two young men with all the potential of their living beings contrasted with Nikolai and Pavel and their strange life outcomes. What complicates the matter is that Basarov is a nihilist - someone called him the first 'angry young man'. He is cynical and argumentative - prepared to accept Nikolai's simple innocence and honesty in living, unprepared to tolerate Pavel's Anglophile airs and graces.The young men move on to Basarov's parent's place (simple folk living a traditional old age) but on the way meet Madame Odintsova - quickly called Odintsov (presumably because she is widowed). They spend some time with Odintsov and we learn her name is Anna Sergyevna. Anna lives with her younger sister Katya and and older aunt. The contrasts are once again evident. Anna has no feeling for Arkady at all and quickly Arkady and Katya become friends as Anna and Basarov fascinate each other. But Basarov is appalled at his romantic feelings - not what he expects a nihilist should experience! And when Odintsov's flirting causes him to express that love he has to flee to his parent's place horrified by what he has felt.But he is no more at home with his parents whose love and affection overwhelms him, so the young men return to the Kirsanov's farm, stopping briefly at Odintsov's country residence where they are not really welcomed. However Arkady, home again, is ill at ease and has to return to Odintsov, leaving Basarov behind. What happens at Odintsov's residence is perhaps not unexpected, what happens at the Kirsanov's farm - with Fenitchka and Pavel is remarkable. Eventually Basarov joins Arkady at Madame Odintsov's before returning home. The outcomes I will leave to Turgenev.As a mid-fifties person myself I can readily identify with Nikolai and Pavel who see themselves as old, although they too are only fiftyish. But we all have memories and I can see myself as Basarov and Arkady - in some ways each of them, but in no ways entirely either of them. While, as a young man, I too had ideals (anarchist rather than nihilist) that I used to obscure other things in my life, subsequent experiences in my life have lead me to regret that path my life took for a while. Turgenev's outcome for Basarov is entirely in accord with my view. But what then of Pavel?Perhaps the most extraordinary thing for me about this beautiful novel is that at the end - but not during the novel - I loved each and every one of the characters. The title of this review is a quote (p203 Konemann edition) and it is my feelings that are immensely positive from reading this book.Other recommended reading:For a non-Russian view of Russian people read 'Under Western Eyes' by Joseph Conrad"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This book is known mostly, perhaps, for the character of Bazarov, widely considered the vanguard of nihilism in literature, especially in Russia. Bazarov is a significant fact of fiction, a sketch of the young middle class intellegentsia developing in Russia in the second half of the 19th century. Brash, self-confident, iconoclastic, educated young men like Bazarov were popping up all over Russia. Turgenev finds a way to tie this into a rich tapestry of love, familial relationships, and simplicity that Arkady and Bazarov, the young men, succumb to. Even in his determination to change the world by destroying it so it can be rebuilt, Bazarov does not overcome the strong bonds of family. Love and family has the sort of redemptive power found so often in War and Peace, and indeed, Turgenev writes from a similar perspective and on a similar wavelength as Tolstoy. This book, while not big on plot, is to be appreciated for blending its simple prose with a poetic passion in showing how love between fathers and sons is ageless, and love between men and women occurs. I found the last passage very moving."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Turgenev's Fathers and Sons is a timeless novel. Set in mid-19th century Russia it follows a few weeks in the lives of two young men, Arkadi and Bazarov. Turgenev sets the characters beliefs against each other and against themselves.Fathers and Sons operates on many levels, a story of generation vs generation, of ideology vs love, new vs old and friend vs friend. Turgenev takes the pair on a journey through rural Russia. Each stop along the journey sets up the scenario for the tensions and revelations of the characters.The character of Bazarov is one of the most vivid characters in literature. The timeless representation of a brash bright young man ready to teach the world everything it's doing wrong.When Fathers and Sons was first published it caused outrage on both the right and the left in Russia. Both sides believed their characterizations were overdone and many never forgave him.Fathers and Sons is highly recommended. Easily one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Turgenev's novel is a poignant portrayal of life's transition: of young men and women entering adulthood, and parents entering old age and possible obscurity. The parents, like Nickolai and Vassily, seem to venerate their children like paupers to princes, seeing them as heirs to the world. The old Romantics seem lost in the new Nihilist world that Bazarov, Arcady, and even Sitnikov are preaching. The generations are at a crossroads: while the older generation tries to understand and leave the reigns for its descendants, the younger people feel invincibly wise and superior, and yet unknowing of what to do with their lives.Bazarov assumes too much. His arrogance is overwhelming and irritating. He talks to his hosts, including parents, like they are children, and yet takes every luxury and resource they offer him. He never fails to take all that is given. His father showers him with love and kindness, shelter and money, and yet Bazarov will not even allow his father to hold a conversation with him, and stops him each time his father wishes to express himself to his son in his own way. Even more aggravating is Bazarov's action toward Fenichka. Nickolai offers him a roof and room, food, comfort - all for a virtual stranger - without complaint, and yet Bazarov sees fit to seduce the mother of his child. His regret is short-lived, and pride follows.At this point most would tend to like the aristocratic character of Paul, who defends his brother's honor without anything to gain himself. While a duel is a rather foolish affair it nevertheless let Bazarov know that there are consequences to his unremorseful actions. And in the end, the reader can see the sincere kindness that Arcady had tried to convince Bazarov that Paul had, but that his mentor did not believe. Bazarov is certainly a force in the book, but Paul seems to be the most effective catalyst to the rest of the characters. I did not quite understand the reference in the book to Paul being a corpse at first, but I supposed it meant that he had changed forever, that he would never again see his aristocratic pretenses in the same way again.Arcady is another likable character in the book, although his maturation and break with Bazarov seemed frustratingly slow at times. He keeps to a truer degree an idea of equality among classes, while Bazarov says it but doesn't seem to really believe it, and talks to them more as an aristocrat at times than an equal. Yet at the same time, Arcady retains his father's Romantic nature, and is thus able to function more effectively throughout the book. Bazarov, in contrast, seems to feel the need to move on to a different place each time his strict belief system is compromised. It is no coincidence, I'm sure, that most of the Romantics seem to go on living extraordinary lives in the end while Bazarov does not and Sitnikov is miserable, and even Madame Odintzov, who was infatuated with and much like Bazarov, does not find true love or happiness. Indeed, it is the end of the novel, being Bazarov's fate, which gives the story its true emotional weight. It is a well-written tale of generations that is certainly worth the journey."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"I'm still a little disoriented at this Amazon site. I'm not sure if this is the Edmonds translation circa 1960s or not. That is when I first read this novel and it is the copy I still own. The Penguin Classics version is the one I am referring to. I've written other critiques, thinking I was talking about Penguins, only to subsequently discover I was on the wrong entry. If this is indeed the Edmonds-Penguin edition, let me first refer the reader to the eloquent and unsurpassed introduction by Isaiah Berlin. It runs for 50+ pages, but is the most precise, uncorrupted look at mid-19th century Russian literature that I have come across. If you want a supreme overview by a great thinker on a great subject, go directly to this introduction, do not pass go. If you have even indirectly perused The New York Review of Books, you know who Berlin is, and how revered a thinker he is. Here he sums up pre-revolutionary Russia in a few pithy phrases. He also speaks for me and for those of my particular generation who are caught between ideologies, as the &quot;liberals&quot; in Turgenev's time were. On Turgenev, the author: &quot;He went on believing - perhaps this was a relic of his Hegelian youth - that no issue was closed for ever, that every thesis must be weighed against its antithesis, that systems and absolutes of every kind - social aand political no less than religious - were a form of dangerous idolatry.&quot; This is a novel about a &quot;superfluous&quot; man who was trapped between ideologies in 19th centrury Russia, when the young &quot;nihilists&quot; were at odds with the old-line liberals. This is what makes the novel so relevant in any age. There are always going to be clashes between generations and between those who hope for the &quot;de-struction&quot; of an old edifice for an only partially imagined design for a new one. Turgenev presents us with perhaps the most truthful representation of this timeless, generational conflict. Russian literature is essentially a triumvirate : Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev. If I were a manager, I would probably have Turgenev bat leadoff. He gets his point across better than the other two, though he doesn't have the bat speed. Chekov or Pushkin (though not in the triumvirate) could bat second, depending on who was hot at the time. I would have a really difficult time deciding between Tolstoy or Dostoevsky for clean-up hitter. E-mail me for your votes. I would also like some reader feedaback as to the origin of the word &quot;nihilst&quot; or nihilism. I doubt sincerely whether Turgenev coined the term. It sounds more like Bakunin or Herzen to me. What are your thoughts on the subject?"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"I think the thing I enjoyed most about \\"Fathers and Sons\\" was that it was short. The great Russian classics we generally think of are \\"War and Peace\\", \\"Crime and Punishment\\", etc. These are all long, drawn out books. \\"Fathers and Sons\\", thankfully, is short(er), with fewer characters and less confusion as to which person is which, especially since few have similar last names. Confusion does arise between Nicholas Petrovich and Paul Petrovich, his brother. There it is important to remember who is who, but luckily, their personalities are very different and it becomes clear very soon.Another thing that is nice about \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is that it's different. It is not a book of great dramatic fighting (though there is one). It feels human and realistic. All the characters have both virtues and flaws that are easy to relate to. The ending is sad, but at the same time it is happy. It doesn't feel over-done, and I especially liked how the romance stuck in was sweet and not too out-there.The book also reflects the difficulties Russia had during that period of time. Things were changing and some didn't welcome the change as much as others. Things that had once been acceptable became strange, and the people who believed in the old things became outdated. This book shows the concept of a generation gap beautifully while maintaining an interesting plot and characters.I recommend it, partially because it's simply a good book, and partially because it shows that not all Russian classics must be long, drawn-out, and with lots of complicated names. Turgenev, who came before Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, will hopefully remain with them on the literary level for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev, who lived through 1818-83, is thought to be one of the finest Russian writers. He studied in Moscow, St Petersburg and Berlin, then became a strong advocate of Russia's westernization. Here we see his masterpiece \\"Fathers and Sons\\" which I personally came across through the recommendation of a close friend.Turgenev is a master of engaging the reader through the complexities of his characters. While you may initially feel contempt for some them, the more you learn of their contrasting personalities, you will eventually love them all in the end. If not for their beliefs and actions story-wise, then for how deep and well thought-out their various histories are. You may find yourself endlessly devouring page after page, wanting to know more about these fascinating people he's created.For me, reading this book was like opening my eyes to a world I long neglected. In the next few days, I will no doubt find myself hunting down more of his works. In \\"Fathers and Sons\\" he focuses on every character's humanity and principles, then lets it all play out with such craft and unmistakable skill. From their conflicts and influences with each other, every character develops and yet remains the same.Every scene he creates, is depicted vividly, with descriptions of subtle details in the backgrounds bringing his world to life. From the effortless way he lets the reader see his visions, we can easily grasp the character of his creations, their moods, their thoughts, and how we can relate to their emotions. It is certainly a crime for someone who's even remotely interested in novels not to read this book.

It is a desire that most find hard to resist and few are ultimately able to withstand. One can imagine all kinds of fads, including forms of entertainment and styles of dress. All of these things bring pleasure for a time, but eventually lose their luster and novelty. But there is another kind of fad that spreads among friends, and that fad is in following unusual philosophical beliefs. This trend was responsible for Arkady's temporary fascination with a friend named Bazarov. But, as hobbies tend to go, once Arkady began to see the disadvantages of following his friend's new philosophy, he gradually pulled away from Bazarov and turned back to his family. The key moments which altered Arkady's relationship with Bazarov - and nihilism - were Bazarov's insulting Arkady's family, his utter arrogance in thinking himself a god, and his disdain for love.In order to set the context for the story, it is important to take notice to Arkady's relationship with his family. From the very beginning of Fathers and Sons, it is made evident that Arkady has a deep love for them. As soon as he reunites with his father, the first words out of his mouth display his childlike love for his \\"daddy.\\" We begin to understand his simple love even more when we read that \\"he gaily responded to his father's caresses\\" (4) as they hugged. Again, as they load up their carriage for the ride home, Arkady \\"[turns] round quickly to his father, and [gives] him a sounding kiss on the cheek\\" (6). His love extends to his Uncle Pavel as well, and he soon asks about the man's well-being (5). Uncle Pavel also receives a hug from his nephew (16), and Arkady talks highly of him to Bazarov (6, 21-23, 25). The deep-seated affection of Arkady for his family is easy to identify.As with most college-age students, Arkady is at a point in his life where he is trying to figure out how to balance his love for family with his desire to be his own man. This task is especially burdensome to him in light of his admiration of Bazarov, whom they have invited to stay with them for a while. With Bazarov present, Arkady watches himself carefully in order to guard from looking too childish in the eyes of his friend (7). As Arkady himself says, he believes Bazarov to be a \\"great friend\\" (4) and \\"splendid fellow (5), who's friendship he prizes (6). But as time passes, Arkady slowly begins to recognize that his colleague is not as winsome as he once thought. With the stage set, let us look at the first instance when Arkady begins to part ways with Bazarov.After meeting the father and uncle, Bazarov declares to Arkady his less than agreeable impressions of them. He calls Uncle Pavel \\"a queer fish\\" and \\"an antique survival\\" (12). Obviously, he was not meaning to compliment him with these words. He goes on to put down Nikolai, the father, by saying \\"he wastes his time,\\" \\"doesn't know much,\\" and is \\"shy and nervous\\" (12, 13). Later, he gets into an argument with Pavel about his nihilistic views, and Arkady gently reprimands him afterward saying, \\"you weren't nice to him...you have hurt his feelings\\" (21). In an attempt to defend his uncle, Arkady tells Bazarov of his hard life, ending with rebuking him for judging his uncle unjustly, as well as telling him \\"it's a sin to despise [Pavel]\\" (25). But even his friend's remarks about his uncle do not offend him as much as his making fun of his father's playing the violoncello. It is at this point that Arkady first apprehends of his friend's objectionable personality (34). This is only the beginning of his steady drift from the unruly nihilist.As I said before, fads tend to fall out of vogue quickly, and Arkady's hasty admiration of Bazarov's nihilism is no exception. He has already seen how rude Bazarov was with his family, and he soon finds out why this lawless man finds it so easy to insult others. While staying at the home of two elegant female friends, Arkady and Bazarov's visit is cut short by the appearance of an unseemly and unannounced visitor named Sitnikov. Feeling the loss of a possibly significant relationship with Katya, one of the two women, Arkady starts to complain about the arrival of Sitnikov. Bazarov takes this as an opportunity to make a jab at Arkady, calling him a fool himself, and then describing his need for such fools because \\"it's not for the gods to bake bricks\\" (88). Obviously, this insults Arkady, but it also shows him \\"in a flash all the fathomless depths of Bazarov's conceit\\" (88). Upon asking for clarification, Arkady finds out that Bazarov truly does believe himself a god, but Arkady as only a \\"dolt\\" and a \\"fool\\" (88). I believe it is at this point that Arkady's most significant and substantial departure from his former friend takes place. He is deeply hurt, but also genuinely astounded at the extent of Bazarov's pompous and braggadocios estimation of himself. From this point forward, Arkady's relationship with Bazarov never fully recovers.With their relationship devastated by Bazarov's insults and detestable arrogance, it doesn't take long for Arkady to take his final steps away from this nihilist: not caring about Bazarov's opinions, and rejecting his philosophy. A little later in the story, Arkady returns to visit Katya and to declare his love for her (148), something of which the nihilist would surely disapprove. While talking to Katya, she tells him that she has noticed he is no longer under Bazarov's influence (137) and that he is \\"different from him\\" (138). Even Bazarov begins to see their lives diverging when he says, \\"A sentimentalist would say, \`I feel that our paths are beginning to part,' but I will simply say that we're tired of each other\\" (142). Before parting however, he takes one last shot at Arkady's new belief in love, saying it is \\"purely [an] imaginary feeling\\" (143). This does not affect Arkady, and by later that evening, with Katya by his side, he has already \\"completely forgot[ten] about his former teacher\\" (151).Arkady and Bazarov's relationship is crippled, and eventually made near non-existent by Bazarov's insults toward Arkady's family, his complete and utter arrogance, and his critical view on love. By the end of the story, we see Arkady has become a new man. He has seemingly rejected nihilism, embraced meaning in life, and begun to explore the joys of deeply loving another human being. With the dismissal of the philosophical fad of nihilism, Arkady has moved on to better and brighter things. In fact, his moving forward is actually moving back to the romantic ideals and traditions he was raised with. While nihilism may have brought a sense of pride and place in a type of exclusive club for philosophers, it was not worth giving up the things which were so dear to him. As he says goodbye to Bazarov, and to nihilism, truly he has been given a new chance at life."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"romantic russian literature, really interestinglovely cover picture in color of a red russian print scarf on entire page. beautiful, i saved it.liked the paper its printed on too, felt like antique paper, really nice"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Perhaps because it was originally written in Russian & translated to English, it was a little wordy.

Unlike Dostoevski (whom I admire as well), Turgenev's approaches to the characters and stories are rather calm and controlled. They are not exaggerated or dramatic, their thoughts do not shift back and forth, and there is not alot of pondering. In the end, wherever the history takes, there is a sense of continuation of life, \\"However passionate, sinning, and rebellious the heart hidden in the tomb, the flowers growing over it peep serenely at us with their innocent eyes; they tell us not of eternal peace alone, of that great peace of \\"indifferent\\" nature; they tell us, too, of eternal reconciliation and of life without end."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"I read this book for a Russian history class, dreading it at first it came to be the book I most enjoyed out of the class. Great and easy reading, interesting and hold your attention storyline, worth the read!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. Russia and the main characters are at a crossroads. It is witty, and warm and intelligent and provocative. I particularly liked the way the author captured the warmth between the fathers and their sons. It does start a little slow, esp by modern standards, but if you like to read great literature, and you haven't read this, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Turgenev's novels express a continual desire to find a new model for the Russian male, a hero for the time - idealistic and progressive, but also practical, his nature and strength still rooted in the very land itself. While some of these characteristics are evident in the heroes of Nest of the Gentry, On The Eve and Rudin, there's still something lacking, the Russian men still ruled by their hearts more than their minds, unable to break from the shackles of old society, old tradition and old ways of thinking.In Fathers and Sons (1862), Turgenev creates a character, a Nihilist, to overthrow these old values. Into Bazarov, Turgenev pours all the qualities that he believes the Russian man should have - stout-hearted, educated, intelligent, decent and self-sacrificing, yet ruthlessly contemptuous of old ways. He is no respecter of the \\"sacred tradition\\", the aristocracy, or indeed the lower classes, who still cling to the securities they knew under the old feudal system. Ironically, the nihilistic, revolutionary character of Bazarov would find favour with neither the old establishment nor the new regime, making life in Russia difficult for Turgenev (who had already been imprisoned for his support of Gogol), and later see him going into exile.Fathers and Sons however goes beyond the historical importance of the work, touching on sentiments in the father/son relationship that are still relevant today - the need to break with the past and overturn old ideals, and the sadness of the wedge that this places between parent and child, but the necessity of doing so in order to find a new and better expression in the evolving modern world. In many ways however, the world in Fathers and Sons still resembles that of Rudin, with the same kind of characters, landowners and aristocrats on country estates, with the same social divisions, having the same fruitless discussions about art, family and society - even if it is to condemn them here - while forming romantic attachments.Fathers and Sons however is certainly a much better constructed and balanced novel than Rudin, the characters actively pursuing revolution rather than merely talking about it, although perhaps because of their very nature, they still fail to make a significant impression on society. Turgenev's model of Bazarov as a character for the future of the new Russia therefore doesn't entirely succeed and there is still some romanticism both in the character and Turgenev's depiction of him. It would take better writers like Tolstoy and Chekhov to delve deeper into the Russian character - and human nature - and bring it out in all its complexities and contradictions. Bazarov then is very much a hero for his time, and Fathers and Sons, although perhaps Turgenev's best novel with much to admire in it, is also very much of its time, while Tolstoy and Chekhov are eternal."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Since I am studying Russian, I am now engaged in exploring many Russian classic novels and a few poems too (Pushkin mostly). I have had a hard time with \\"War & Peace\\" but enjoyed immensely Turgenev's \\"fathers and sons\\". It was written around 1861 I believe, but it is modern in the sense that generational conflicts are happening today as they did when the author lived. His descriptions of human nature are intuitive, detailed but not as lengthy and exhausting as you find them in some of Tolstoy's earlier works; (see above). The young nihilists then might have been replaced by other norm-busting attitudes of today's young generation, but it is obvious that old and young don't get along too well. Turgenev's style is fluid, creating amazing imageries, and to me at least, it provided me a deep insight into a Russian society which was on the brink of breaking with the past and delving into a tumultuous future as we now know."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Though not Russian fiction's father in Nikolai Gogol's sense of adapting the language and producing its first notable fictional works, Ivan Turgenev is the direct antecedent of the psychological characterization and philosophical dramatization that is most closely associated with it and thus arguably its true father. Fathers and Sons, his most famous work and masterpiece, was the first Russian novel to attract Western praise, particularly winning over Henry James, who hailed it as a masterwork and championed Turgenev over the Russian writers who soon overshadowed him. One can debate Turgenev's merits relative to giants like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy, but he certainly provides an interesting contrast, and Fathers and Sons has long had an indisputable place alongside their great works in the world canon.The book is of course most famous for Evgeny Vasilevich Bazarov, its protagonist, who is both painstakingly realistic and thoroughly symbolic. He typifies the young, European-influenced, middle-class liberal that Turgenev rightly thought was a rising Russian power. A self-proclaimed nihilist, he rejects religion, conventional morality, and nearly every other traditional Russian virtue. He claims to believe in nothing but has a great passion for science and seems to believe in a sort of self-reliance. Though influenced by archetypes like Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, he was an essentially original creation - Turgenev's most memorable and famous character. Anyone at all familiar with Russian literature can immediately see that he became a prototype, his most famous manifestation being Raskolnikov in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment a few years later. However, he is interesting enough in his own right, and his ambivalent depiction is fascinating. Though he is ostensibly a cautionary figure, a negative example, Turgenev was open-minded enough not to condemn him outright. His dark end is indeed a warning that pure nihilism is a dead end, but Turgenev at times seems as enthralled by Bazarov as anyone. This ambiguity was the main reason that the novel got very mixed reviews; it satisfied neither those who sympathized with Bazarov nor those who condemned him. Turgenev was stung and wrote less prolifically and enthusiastically from then on, but time has shown that the uncertain portrayal is exactly the book's greatest strength. Bazarov represents a path that Russia could have taken - or, if you will, one pole of human nature -, though admittedly an extreme one, and cannot be lauded or condemned outright. Turgenev was brave enough to give an honest portrayal, and the profoundly believable and insightful psychological portrait retains its power. Bazarov is one of the most interesting characters in a century full of great ones. He is hard to fully love or hate; he certainly has many despicable qualities, but only Pollyannas can deny some of his points, and the force with which he argues, in combination with his cynical apathy, has a certain perverse charm. We can debate him and what he stands for ad nauseum, but it is unlikely that anyone who reads the book will soon forget him.There is of course far more to the novel, not least its vivid dramatization of the title's implied generation gap. Turgenev saw an ever-widening chasm between the liberals of his generation and the Bazarovs, dramatizing it with striking verisimilitude and stunning philosophical and psychological depth. His generation is represented by the brothers Nikolai and Pavel Petrovich Kirsanov. They have also embraced Europeanization but in ways that Bazarov finds contemptibly superficial: speaking French, wearing foreign clothes, etc. More fundamental is their continued clinging to traditional morality and institutions. Their interactions with Bazarov make clear that, religion and morality aside, the generation gap was to a great extent a class issue. The Kirsanovs are aristocrats, and Pavel Petrovich in particular resents the upstart Bazarov. Their clash soon culminates in a highly symbolic duel suggesting, especially in its aftermath, that while the Bazarovs may initially gain the upper hand, there is much to be said for the older generation, which should not be written off so quickly. Nikolai Petrovich is more moderate, abandoning tradition to the extent of taking a lower-class woman as a mistress and even having a child with her, yet aware enough to constantly worry about offending his brother. He can sympathize with Bazarov and is even willing to listen to his ideas but above all simply wants harmony. His son Arkady is at yet another place on the spectrum, respecting the elders but so nave and joyous in his youthfulness that he becomes a Bazarov disciple almost without knowing.These conflicts play out in various ways but primarily through Arkady, the only character who really changes. It can be assumed that he was squarely in familial tradition before college, where he nearly became a Bazarov clone, and he finally takes solace in love's redemptive power. There is no doubt that Turgenev thinks this last the right path - that we are supposed to think, as Arkady finally does, that Bazarovism leads only to wasteful self-destructiveness, making true happiness impossible and keeping us from doing the world any good. Some will of course disagree, but Arkady's progression is very plausibly written; it is hard not to sympathize and be glad for his eventual peace and bliss. The novel is thus among other things an excellent bildungsroman.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the book is how Turgenev dramatizes all this - and even makes his point clear - without heavy-handedness. Novels tackling such weighty issues often let didacticism overwhelm story, but Fathers and Sons is never guilty of this nearly always fatal sin. He is also a master stylist; his often lyrical prose encompasses not only dense philosophical speculation but also much sublime beauty. The last paragraph in particular is unforgettable in its precise beauty and profoundly moving sentiment - so well-written that even those who cynically disagree with the conclusion, and thus the book's overall message, cannot deny its immense power. Most notable of all is that Turgenev manages to do all this in under 250 pages. This is the greatest difference between him and the more famous Russian masters known for their thick tomes. Turgenev eschews their great attention to detail, lengthy dialogue, and long philosophical asides. Those who, like James, detested such \\"loose, baggy monsters\\" may join him in preferring Turgenev, and the differences are substantial enough that even those who dislike Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and their ilk should not pass over Turgenev automatically on account of it. That said, he shares enough of their great elements - indeed, inspired many of them - that their fans should check him out. His remarkable conciseness is certainly less intimidating, and there are many benefits to reading the Russian greats chronologically. In short, the appeal of Fathers and Sons is so great and diverse that the book is a must for practically anyone who appreciates great literature."},{"Title":"Bioaerosols: Assessment & Control","review":"I was looking for a good book on bioaerosols and Bioaerosols: Assessment and Control was recommended to me by several fellow members of the American Indoor Air Quality Council. I already owned the first publication (1989) by ACGIH Guidelines for the Assessment of Bioaerosols in the Indoor Environment. Bioaerosols: Assessment and Control is by far the best book on the assessment of bioaerosols on the market today. I highly recommend it to any professional looking for information on the subject. The book is technical but easy to read and easy to find what you are looking for. I gave it to our Infection Control Department and the Microbiology Department to preview. Both departments were equally impressed with the book. I ended up giving the book to Infection Control (because they kept borrowing it)and ordered another copy for our office.

My wife and I read this book out loud to each other during the course of the week and we are totally engaged in the ongoing dialogues between the various characters (especially Karl Oskar, Kristina and Ulrika of Vastergohl). The narrative descriptions of the scenery and the various interactions of the characters while they are on board the paddlewheeler \\"Red Wing\\" as they push up the Mississippi River toward Stillwater, Minnesota, will keep you anxious to know what's coming next. Moberg has a gift for being able to understand and describe the human thought and behavior of a people confronting a completely new and different environment for the first time. As the reader, you will be able to easily relate to the oh-so-human fears and frailties of the Swedish immigrants as they try to deal with the foreign and alien American frontier. Remember, they have been uprooted from their centuries-old traditional lifestyles back in the old country and are now thousands of miles away from their home country. They can't speak one intelligible word of English. Bless their hearts, these folks are bonefide heroes and heroines.

Translated from Swedish into English, this beautifully written book of historical fiction was first published in 1954 and met with excellent reviews at the time. It is the second part of a four part opus, the first of which is \\"The Emigrants\\". This book, \\"Unto a Good Land\\", is followed by two additional books, \\"The Settlers\\" and \\"Last Letter From Home\\".In the first volume, \\"The Emigrants\\", the author detailed the emigration of a Swedish family to the New World, grounding it in the reasons for the exodus of so many Swedes from their mother country in the middle of the 19th century. The focus of the first book in this four part opus is on the family, relatives, and friends of Karl Oscar Nilsson, a peasant farmer who unceasingly worked his farm, only to find that, no matter what he did, he could not progress and would continue to live on the cusp of total poverty. The focus of the first book is on their life in Sweden. Gathering up his family and friends of the family, the Nilsson family decides to take the monumental step of making a fresh start by emigrating to the new world, specifically the United States of America.The second volume, \\"Unto a Good Land\\", focuses on the arrival of the Nilsson family and friends in the United States of America. It details their journey from New York, a journey that was to take them across the Midwest by rail, steamer, and foot to arrive in the wilds of what would one day be the State of Minnesota. It is in this wilderness that the Nilsson family and friends would homestead and struggle to make a new home. The author regales the reader with the travails this hardy group of settlers would encounter in their efforts to create by the sweat of their brow a new home in the wilderness. The early struggles of the Nilsson family to succeed in what was an unknown frontier is engagingly chronicled. I have enjoyed the first and second volumes so much that I look forward to continuing their journey with them by reading the remaining two volumes. This is a book that those who love historical fiction will greatly enjoy."},{"Title":"Unto a Good Land (The Emigrants II)","review":"From Manhattan, it is 1500 miles to Minnesota. Before departing, Karl Oskar feeds his family, and Robert and Arvid walk the length of Broadway, amazed by what they see. The group travels up the Hudson River by steamboat, from Albany to Buffalo by train and across the Great Lakes. They are now immigrants rather than emigrants. You can not be one without being both.Alienation is a theme of Unto A Good Land. The immigrants feel the limitations imposed upon them as foreigners. They do not know the geography and cannot speak the language. Dependence breeds suspicion and paranoia.The tension between Kristina and Ulrika begins to subside. After an attack of conscience, Kristina shares a loaf of bread with her. Ulrika and Elin are caring for Danjel's children.At a stopover in Detroit, Ulrika totally vindicates herself in Kristina's and Karl Oskar's eyes. She recovers Lill-Marta, their 3-year-old, from an orchard where she had gone to pick cherries. This is in the nick of time as the boat is about to leave. It is a touching scene where Karl Oskar takes the hand of the woman he ridiculed.The immigrants cut across the prairie and head up the Mississippi River. Arvid remains funny and stupid, fearing alligators which he calls crocodiles.The novels are virtually non-violent when compared with a Hamlet or a War and Peace. They are strong on character, simple, plain. We find people determining their own course, not swept up in events so overwhelming as to have their actions dictated for them.There is an emphasis on nature, the necessity of eking a living from the earth. There is not so much of war or what man has done to man. It is unexpected when at one point Karl Oskar has to elude some would-be bandits. The possibility of evil always lurks in the background, but it is secondary to man's struggle against the harsher side of nature. The immigrants yearn for freedom without having to harm anyone.Once in Minnesota territory, they walk to their final destination. In the lush forest, they feel at home for the first time, and Kristina and Ulrika laugh at the shaggy hair and beards of the men. Kristina uses wool shears on Karl Oskar, giving him the look of a sheep. Robert wants his hair short so he can not be scalped by Indians.When Danjel and Jonas Petter stake their claims near Swedish settlers, the obstinate Karl Oskar keeps going. Only when he feasts his eyes on Lake Ki-Chi-Saga does he feel he has arrived.Ki-Chi-Saga is an Indian name, but it is Karl Oskar's for the taking. It is all here: the lake, oak trees, a pine forest and three feet of topsoil.There is an optimism in the books and in Karl Oskar, an assurance that if we go hard enough and long enough, we will have the things we need.Domestic life resumes. The settlers build cabins, make furniture, plow and planet and hunt and fish. Kristina prepares meals and mends clothing. Moberg pulls us down to basic survival.Making it through the first winter is crucial. They need a cow for milk and flour for bread. Returning one night in the snow with a sack of flour, Karl Oskar gets lost. He finds his way, but realizes he might have frozen to death.The sense of mission in the first book dissipates into a narrative of day-to-day living, into a compilation of anecdotes and close calls.Of all the immigrants, only Kristina misses Sweden. She hides it. She now considers Ulrika a friend and requests her as midwife when the baby is born. The birth is described in detail. So is Kristina's emotional attachment to her first child born in America.The differences between the brothers quickly surface. Robert is no farmer. He wants to get rich. Karl Oskar considers him a liar, governed by his imagination. After the first winter, Robert and Arvid leave for the gold fields of California.Having cleaned up her act, Ulrika begins getting proposals. Women are scarce. Amazingly, she marries a Baptist minister.The book ends with Kristina confessing to Karl Oskar how much she misses Sweden. Karl Oskar shares his vision of the future with her, that their children and grandchildren will one day thank them for emigrating to America. The pair agree to call their new home Duvemala after the village Kristina grew up in."},{"Title":"Unto a Good Land (The Emigrants II)","review":"This is an epic work by its Swedish author.

While she is now too old to enjoy having things like this read to her, there is no question that she would have loved it if I had read this book to her when she was younger."},{"Title":"Gender and Disorder in Early Modern Seville","review":"This is a great study of the roles of women in early modern Spain. Normally, books of this nature focus on women of the nobility or elite classes. However, Perry takes an indepth look at such women as prostitutes and healers. The author also incorporates many personal stories reconstructed from a variety of sources such as court records or Inquisitional records. This is definitely a book for all with the care the author has taken in presenting a &quot;readable&quot; account."},{"Title":"King James Version Reference Bible, Compact","review":"Check Your Review ofHoly Bible: King James Version, Charcoal/charcoal, Italian Duo-tone, Reference (Bible Akjv)by Zondervan Publishing HouseHere is your review the way it will appear:A Gift from God, July 17, 2007By Garry L. Solano \\"Spider18333\\" (Fort Lauderdale, FL) - See all my reviewsI was given a copy of Holy Bible: King James Version, Charcoal/charcoal, Italian Duo-tone, Reference Bible by a friend, it was the best gift ever received. I carry that Bible everywhere even to school. The reference portion is excellent for further study. It is easy to read and comprehend. I don't know about you but my personal preference is the King James Version, it's feels as if I am reading the original text that has been translated into English. I have found myself reading the Bible for hours on end everyday.This is the perfect gift for someone likes to carry the Holy Bible with them during the course of their activities. The Word of God never goes out of style.God Bless you all."},{"Title":"King James Version Reference Bible, Compact","review":"I really like this new bible. Written in King James version, very compact + included are the reference. In the back of the bible, it has also topical indexes. It is worth buying for all of those who is on the budget."},{"Title":"King James Version Reference Bible, Compact","review":"This bible is really handy and compact. The cover is designed to look like it has a flap that closes around the edge but that is just the stitching. The printing is crisp and sharp and so far I have not seen any smudging. The one thing that was bad was the overglue of the front cover's vinyl edge making the first blank leaf stick by about an inch. Forcing it off ruins the paper and leaves some on the vinyl edging. Other than that it does the job of providing a basic KJV bible with a very spartan concordance."},{"Title":"King James Version Reference Bible, Compact","review":"This bible is roughly 4 inches wide, 8 inches long, and about an inch thick. Beautiful creamy pink color; with the first half of the bible having a leather pink, and the bottom half of the bible being a cotton soft pink. It has a creamy beige middle lining. I absolutely LOVE this bible. It might be able to fit into your back pocket if you are wearing really baggy jeans. It has so many maps, pictures, Jesus' words in red, and a centre column cross-reference in the middle of each page to help me study. The words are as tiny as the words found in those small yellow Gideon Bibles that are often giving away for free in malls. There is also very faint white stiching around the edges of the bible - a lovely finish. This bible is smaller than the other zondervan duo-tone bibles (its probably the smallest out of the collection) and it's classy. Complaints? I personally have none, but if you wear glasses, for example, you may find the words to be a bit too small. I have never written a review before, but I wanted to write one to help those who are in my position. I was so nervous about whether or not I would like this bible when it arrived in my mailbox. I had searched through google image to find a photof of the bible but I was having a hard time finding somthing. But when I finally recieved it, I could hardly open the bible up because I was so blow away by the way it looked. I have had this bible for 2 months now, and I love it.

Jance is a woman, she writes very convincingly about a male character, J. P. Beaumont. We see the struggle between his personal and his professional life as he is summoned to a Shakespeare Festival where his daughter is pregnant and soon to be married. After his arrival, two actors are murdered and Beaumont uses his professional skills as a policeman to solve the murder while trying to be civil to his prospective son-in-law and his daughter's artsy friends. Beaumont has a wry way of looking at his own foibles which endears him to readers. If you enjoy this book, there are several more in the series."},{"Title":"Failure to Appear","review":"In \\"Failure to Appear\\" lone-wolf Seattle homicide detective J.P. \\"Beau\\" Beaumont finds himself a fish out of water surrounded by family in southern Oregon and on the outside of a murder investigation.Quite often, when a mystery author tries to fit so much of a protagonist's personal life into a book, the plot drags to a halt and the investigation into the crime is treated superficially because the focus is on massive character development. Jance manages to keep things moving at a fast clip and provide a mystery that is as multi-faceted as her lead character's personal difficulties. Beau has a lot to deal with in this book: a daughter who starts out a missing person and winds up pregnant and about to be married, a re-married ex-wife and her husband, a new girlfriend, a murder suspect that awakens painful memories, the siren song of a bottle of MacNaughton's, and a couple police officers out to nail his hide to a wall - not to mention the book's three murder victims or the loved one Beau loses in the course of the investigation.There are a few nits that could be picked (Oregon vanity plates don't have 8 letters, for instance), but the quality of the rest of the book more than compensates. All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"Failure to Appear","review":"This was the first Jance book I encountered. I decided to read it because it takes place in the town I live and work in. As much as I enjoyed reading about the places and cities I know well what I really enjoyed was the character of JP Beaumont. He is an ordinary man (a Seattle Cop wih an extraordinarily inherited fortune) who is caught between his work and his family. The characters seem very real and Jance's writing gives them a life and humanity that appeals strongly and makes you really care about them. The story never lets up either and you will find yourself hard pressed to put the book down. I have read every book Jance has written now and she is always on the top of my list of series that I am waiting for the next installment of!"},{"Title":"Failure to Appear","review":"Failure to AppearJ.A. Jance does it again in this 11th J.P. Beaumont mystery novel. Unlike most of the previous books, this one starts out, not with a crime, but with a personal mission. Detective Beaumont (\\"Beau\\" to his friends and associates) has left his Seattle home area to look for his runaway teenage daughter in an artsy community in Oregon. Of course, as anyone could have expected, violent crime soon intrudes.For those who are familiar with this series, you can be assured that it is true Jance writing: characters who act like real people; a fast-moving story; plenty of self-deprecating humor; and a sterling protagonist who is all too aware of his not inconsiderable faults.For those who are not familiar with J.P. Beaumont or Jance's Joanna Brady, who appears in a separate series, you have the pleasure of delightful discovery to look forward to. There are lots of books in this series. I've read 12 so far (and a bunch of the Brady ones, too) and I have yet to be disappointed with any of them.If you're one who likes to start at the beginning of a series (which I think is not a bad idea with this one, for a number of reasons), the first is \\"Until Proven Guilty\\". However, if this isn't important to you, you can't go wrong with this or any of Jance's books, if you're in the mood for a fast-moving mystery novel with a bit more than usual in the way of character development."},{"Title":"Failure to Appear","review":"I love book series.

So far I have gotten the whole J.P. Beaumont series and they are all have you wondering \\"what's going to happen next.\\" I would recommend her books to anyone that loves to read.

Beaumont is the cop's name and Jance has him writing the story. He is an alcoholic now on the wagon. He is divorced, has two children from their union, one a daughter, Kelly, missing. David Livingston, his ex-wife's present husband calls to tell him where Kelly is and that she is plasnning on getting married. J.P. plans to run down to see her and bring her back with him, despite her being eighteen and hence legally independent. He has a girl friend, she invites herself along and they drive down to Ashland, Oregon. Alexis is a big help, she has friends in town and gets them a room and tickets to some of the plays being presented there through her connections. J.P. runs out on her, finds Kelly-s residence, meets her landlady, they do not get along, then he meets Kelly and finds her pregnant. He had opposed the wedding and hated her fiance without meeting him, now the wedding is a must but he still hates the man. He ignores Alexis, runs into acquaintances and gets involved in murder, not in commission but in its solution. He meets a city cop, again they dislike each other and spar. He meets more people. one a former child porn flick actress and gets a sob story from her. The city cop suspects her of the murders and arrests her. Jance spends all this time in the story so we get to know the cop. He is dumb, conceited, but hard working and accomplishes a lot by going through normal police procedures. When he is working he pays little attention to events outside his case and as Jance shows he fails to catch warning signals until after the fact when it is too late. How he ever solves anything I do not understand, Jance has him acting on facts derived from insufficient evidence.J.P. breaks the suspects sob story, he suspects her, but continues his investigation, by letting it slide and concentrating on the former porn actress. By concentrating on the actress and accepting the city cop's belief in her guilt, the two cops begin to reach an understanding. But complications appear. In meeting Kelly's landlady he also met her dog. knew its name.In investigating the murders he had enlisted some Seattle help and was send some faxes. J.P. could not see the pictures but one of the faxes commented on a woman connected to one of the characters and she had a dog with the same name as the landlady's dog. Times were juggled, the dogs might be one and the same, J.P. for some reason decided they were the same, spilled his story to the city cop. The city cop, though married, showed his love for the landlady and took J.P. with him to confront her. All the crimes were solved, the daughter was married and J.P. was able to reconnect with Alexis after some huffing and puffing."},{"Title":"Failure to Appear","review":"I enjoy J.P. Beaumont.

Order & Enjoy@!My Darling My Hamburger"},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"I'm inclined to agree with Ramseelbird's review, and unlike indiegirl29, I don't recall Liz going out with another guy who nearly rapes her. What I do remember is teens in the 70s claiming to love this book, while I (maybe I wasn't savvy enough) just didn't get it. I sort of maybe guessed that her \\"friends\\" were accompanying Liz to have an abortion (didn't occur to me whether it was legal or not; I may not have even been aware of the issue of legality).What struck me more was the unlikelihood of a pretty, cool girl being best friends with an uncool, homely girl. Never saw this in real life. Actually the most vivid memory I have of the story is when Liz calls home to say she'll be late, her stepfather calls her a tramp, and that's when she succumbs to Sean's pressure to have sex. This scenario is what is actually timeless in the story, as opposed to the rest of it.The plot and atmosphere are indeed grim, which is indeed what bothered me. It's darker than any other teen / Young Adult novel I can think of. I certainly couldn't relate to any of the characters. I wasn't cool, didn't have a best friend who was cool, didn't have a boyfriend (pressuring or otherwise), and didn't have a stepparent. I suppose that's not Zindel's fault, but I do expect a fiction author to be able to cause the reader to feel what the characters are feeling, or sympathize with their situations. I suppose that's why I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"This book has loads of detail and is not that short.

I am sure Paul Zindel means well, but his outlook on human life is simplistic at best and cynical at worst. The man clearly believes humanity is a small step above animals, and that our children should be raised to accept their fate in this Ricki Lake world in which we live.This is the sort of book that turns children into sex and relationship obsessed creatures, consumed with nothing but the desire to eat and procreate. It is for those who desire nothing more than to live like cattle, with some improved diversion courtesy other human inventors (ie television).What is even worse is reading the reviews of this book... Wow."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"In My Darling, My Hamburger, they talk about many topics amoung teens today.

They are also both seniors in high school. It is about time for prom and they both have dates. But you'll never guess what happens next!!!I think that this book is a really good book. Personal I loved My Darling My Hamburger. It has a really good moral. It was just like a real story. Everything in this book is based on what is happening in real life. That is just my opinion.When I read this book it reminded me of one of my friends sister. She has just graduated and basically the same thing that has happened to one of the girls in this story. I am not going to tell you the rest but I guess that you will just have to read and find out for your self.I would definitely recommend this book to People in 6th-9th grade. The main gender that would want to read this book would be girls because of what the story is based on and because they can relate to it the best. The people that wouldn't like this would be boys.

I really liked this book and I read it all in one night. This book had some mature subject matter that young kids should not read. For the most part, I thought this book was good and I especially enjoyed Maggie and Dennis."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"Some early young adult novels (it's a fairly new form of literature, you know) age gracefully and seamlessly. I'm thinking of course of Robert Cormier's &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; and (to a lesser extent), S.E. Hinton?s, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. Unfortunately, I have a nasty suspicion that these books are the exception rather than the rule. For every &quot;Forever&quot; there's a &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot; that contains a great story bogged down by changes in the world. While Paul Zindel's classic tale of four teenagers and their relationship problems is at times both moving and perfectly toned, mostly the problems presented in it are as dated as they come. Even a plot synopsis makes this apparent.Friends Maggie and Liz aren't exactly close, but they hang out frequently together. Liz is the more beautiful and popular of the two with Maggie often following behind. When Liz and her boyfriend Sean decide to hook up Maggie with his friend Dennis, the blind date is as incredibly awkward as they come. Throughout the book the narrative switches between Maggie and her tentative relationship with Dennis and Liz's problems with Sean. Sean, like any normal teenager, is as horny as they come and is continually pressuring Liz to have sex. She'd like to, but she worries that it might end up in pregnancy. Unsurprisingly, that is exactly what happens and soon the big question in the book is whether or not Sean will do the honorable thing and marry Liz (!!) or if Liz will seek out an illegal abortion on her own.It's this last plotline that struck me as dated. The book was originally written in 1969, a full three years before Roe V. Wade and in many ways this abortion issue (while it still looms large) isn't the same. Sure, many girls will sweat over what to do with an unplanned pregnancy, but crossing the border to a state where abortion is legal is probably a more up-to-date literary solution than getting a back alley job. Then there's the debate about whether a girl should marry the guy who gets her pregnant, regardless of how old they are or what their future plans are. Maybe there are pockets of the country where this really is the only honorable solution to such a problem, but it's really not how the majority of teens would handle it today. The book is additionally riddled with small cultural time capsules as well. Talk about how Orientals kill themselves for honor, going to the movie theater to watch a documentary on pygmies, and the complete and total lack of any mention of STDs all combine to make this book an interesting window into the past.To some degree it does still speak to teens today. I was especially amused by the Sex Ed. teacher's advice on how to stop a guy from going all the way, (suggest going out for a hamburger). The characters were interesting as well. Liz, unfortunately, isn't a character you're going to identify with intrinsically. Yes, it's sad that she doesn't get along with her parents. But she's such a self-absorbed person, constantly ridiculing her best friend and at the same time dragging Maggie into horrid and dangerous situations, that by the end you feel zippo pity for her. In fact, you're supposed to end this story hating and pitying Sean who got her pregnant in the first place. Curse those lustful young men that refuse to marry their knocked up girlfriends! Curse them! This book probably read very well in the 1970s and I could even see it having some interesting points in the 1980s. But by the 1990s with the advent of AIDS better known and the options available to teens widening, books like this one began to read more as cautionary tales than as contemporary novels. I've no doubt that &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot; was riveting and shocking when it first came out. Unfortunately, that's certainly no longer the case. I recommend it as a glimpse into the America that once was. If you'd like to know more about the history of the Young Adult novel, this is a good book to pick up. Just don't expect it to have too many insights to offer today. I'm afraid it's no longer that meaningful."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"This is an execellent book about teenagers and all the usual problems teens go through.

They introduce their awkward friends Maggie and Dennis to each other. Underneath the veneer of success Liz and Sean have problems with their parents and each other. Do their parents understand or even care about them? Are they ready for sex? Meanwhile can Maggie and Dennis learn to communicate enough to stay together?This book is Paul Zindel's second and was first published way back in 1969. Life has changed since then, such as the free availability of legal abortion, but much of the story is still surprisingly relevant to modern life. Liz and Maggie are the main characters so this could be described as a book for girls, but the lives of Sean and Dennis are also described in important sub-plots. The story is basically a double romance but Zindel has too much of a grip on the ugliness of life to describe the book as 'romantic.' This is not Mills and Boon stuff.To tell the truth I find this novel one of Zindel's less successful works. To my mind there is nothing in the story to make it really memorable. But then again Zindel is so far above other writers that I would certainly still recommend reading the novel. I should also add that I am largely interested in coming of age stories about boys, so maybe I am biased."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"I like books with drama and stories that seem true, so I really liked this book.This book is an example of kids with problems and their friends problems all in one book.

Paul focuses on the problems of an intimate relationship and the decisions the teens make at that moment. While this book explores issues of teens I highly recommend it to others. This novel focuses on the issue of sex and it helps teenagers understand how complicated it gets if the teenager decides to develope a intimid relationship. The novel ilustrates how some parents ignore this issue and it also mentions how some parents deal with it. Overall this novel is very interesting and short. Paul really emphasizes what sex can lead to and at the same time gets into teenagers head to really think about doing things out before executing them. Even though this book is mainy aim at teenagers in American cultureparents and others culture can relate to them.

It seems as though the author had covered everything...but...for a long while, the book just wasn't very interesting. It's a very quick read, but I didn't get into it until it was almost over. Also, I didn't get the closure I needed at the end between Liz and Maggie.It's a nice cautionary tale for students that are of high school age, but maybe I've read too much good Young Adult literature in the past to be impressed by this one."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"My Darling, My Hamburger by Paul Zindel was a book i chose for a book report.

My Darling, My Hamburger is set in the 1960's in a small town. The four main characters are Sean, Liz, Maggie, and Dennis. All four of them undergo many serious problems. Sean and Liz are a serious couple of about a year. They both have issues concerning the father figures in their lives. For example Liz's Stepfather treating her unfairly and cruelly. Liz and Sean are also fighting against the urge to have sex. By the end of the book they end up having sex and Liz gets pregnant. Liz and Sean immediately vow to get married and raise the baby together. After talking to Sean's father however, Sean begins to feel pressured by Liz and completely backs out of their relationship. Liz is heartbroken and confused. She feels that the only thing that she can do to make it all go away is to have an abortion. Liz has the abortion and suffers from internal bleeding. The rest of the story with Liz is slightly complicated. You never actually see her again. Many assume that she died from losing too much blood but I honestly don't know! Maggie and Dennis are a whole another story! Maggie and Dennis are set up at the beginning of the story. Both feel inferior to their best friends (Liz and Sean). At first they really don't like each other but somewhere in the middle of the story, that all changes. I find it weird that their feelings toward each other completely change with no signs of why. They go on dates and have just an overall strange relationship. Maggie and Liz are best friends and so are Sean and Dennis. Maggie is constantly trying to improve Liz's life and I think that LIz depends on her too much. Sean and Dennis seem like a regular pair of best buds to me! At the end you don't know what happened to Liz, Maggie and Dennis break up and they all graduate. I thought that this book was way too short. You only got a small glimpse of these characters and their lives! I didn't even remotely care what happened to these characters because the book provided almost no insight on them as people. I think the book was too impersonal and overall just not very good! I give this book 2 stars!"},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"I expected better from him. I enjoyed the warm silliness of his other books,like The Pigman. This one was dramatic and true-to-life. However,it bungled in many places. Some characters were hypocritical and detestable. Maggie and Dennis weren't all that romantic and close,but they were the strongest characters. They provided relief from Liz's ridiculousness. I will give kudos for a poignant,thought-provoking ending. I use such strong language because I knew Mr. Zindel could've done better. It was overall an OK book,but don't read it if you're anticipating more great literature from him. Try The Pigman and its sequel or The Undertaker's Gone Bananas instead."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"Liz and Sean seem to be a smooth and sophisticated senior high school couple.

Meanwhile can Maggie and Dennis learn to communicate enough to stay together?This book is Paul Zindel's second and was first published way back in 1969.

It also shows how different people deal with different problems. It's a good story about friendship as well as true love. It is also about doing things that you'll regret.

Give me a break. There are two kinds of 13-year-olds in the world: the kind who just want to hang out and be good buddies with someone for a few years, and the uber-romantic kind who want to date and fall in love. I was the latter. This book was very interesting in a teen-movie-of-the-week sort of way - does anyone remember all those 70s movies about teenage girls losing their virginity and the consequences that resulted? Books like \\"My Darling, My Hamburger\\" and \\"Forever\\", as well as the movies, gave us a chance to think about those types of events and emotions and the possible outcomes, without actually having to DO the deed, which in hindsight I'll admit we were mostly not mature enough to handle.This book is about two teenage couples, Liz and Sean, and their respective friends Maggie and Dennis. Liz and Sean are the beautiful people - good looking and seemingly in true love with each other. Both of them have lousy home lives and are very happy to have a kindred spirit; the only bump in the road of their relationship is that Liz doesn't want to \\"go all the way\\" with Sean and when she finally does (after much hassle and a harrowing near-rape by another boy) she gets pregnant. The question then becomes whether Liz will have an illegal abortion or whether she and Sean will stay together and raise their child. Maggie and Dennis, on the other hand, are shy and a little bit clumsy, just starting to take their first steps into the world of dating, and since they have to watch and sometimes participate in the big soap opera between Liz and Sean, you can't hardly blame them for wanting to move a little slower. By the end of the book, Liz and Sean's lives are pretty well wrecked and Maggie and Dennis have matured into much more confident adults.The story is dated in some respects - for example, abortion is still illegal; teen pregnancy is a much more shameful condition than it is today; and the fashions, movies and dialogue in the book aren't exactly up to the minute. However, the main theme of how to balance first love and sexual desire without everything going kablooey still rings pretty true. As for the people who wonder why nice-but-shy Maggie would hang around with gorgeous Liz who's something of a jerk, I see this pairing all the time among young girls and older women too. The person who is acting like a jerk often has a pretty soft interior (as does Liz - she just hides a lot of it along with her insecurity) and the \\"nice\\" person often enjoys the excitement of being around a prettier and more popular girl, even going so far as to act in a \\"caretaker\\" role just as Maggie looks after Liz when she becomes ill. I would still recommend this book for teenagers interested in books about relationships, although I think girls would be the ones most likely to read and enjoy it since the male characters are less developed and with the exception of Dennis, act more like jerks."},{"Title":"My Darling, My Hamburger","review":"Liz and Sean seem to be a smooth and sophisticated senior high school couple.

At the same time, another client contracted me to develop an industry-based short course on Sequence Stratigraphy. Consequently, I was hopeful that this book might provide good illustrative material and new insights.When I received the book, I was, in fact disappointed. The book is well-written, it has lots of illustrations, and the science is sound. However, it is written more from the perspective of an academic researcher and the applications to the petroleum, coal, uranium or environmental industries are minimal. The amount of material on relevant seismic stratigraphy is less than minimal. Moreover, about 1/3 of the book is a sedimentology text and better informtion is available elsewhere.The focus of the book is outcrop sequence stratigraphy. Subsurface sequence and seismic stratigraphy is downplayed (This is where these principles are applied in the working world of industry). The use of far too many acronyms is annoying. The endless stream of nomenclature makes application of the principles difficult.For academic and outcrop sequence statigraphers, this is a good book. For those of us working in industry, it is limited."},{"Title":"Principles of Sequence Stratigraphy (Developments in Sedimentology)","review":"Bought this product new and it arrived on time.

Thanks for your business."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"I flew through Bent's Fort in a week after it was recommended to me by a friend. I wasn't all that interested in the topic but I decided to read a few chapters and give it a try. I instantly became hooked. Bent's fort gives the reader an inside look into the West BEFORE it became the stuff of lore (i.e. Lincoln County War, Pat Garrett, Custer, etc.). Lavender starts with the mountain men roaming the Missouri and Rockies and their relationship with the Plains indians. His knowledge of the Indians (specifically the Cheyenne tribe), really brings the sometimes forgotten native people, down to a personal level. Most of the book centers around the Bent family and its fort located in SE Colorado between 1820 - 1870. With the Bent's into trading, much is also written about St. Louis, Santa Fe, Taos and the Arkansas and Cimarron Rivers . What I really liked about the book is the personal level Lavender gets the Old west characters down to. It feels like you know William Bent, Kit Carson and Yellow Wolf. A great deal of the book also deals with Mexico and the trader's relationship with the country up to the Mexican War and after the US gained possession of the territory. One thing that really surprised me was the amount of small, sporadic fights that went on between the Indians, the Mexicans and the whites. Lavender writes about all the small skirmishes, what precipitated them, and how things cooled off into a peaceful state again. If you do plan to read Bent's Fort, I suggest you do so with an atlas handy. Lavender writes about hundreds of places in the Southwest and it's hard to get a gauge as to where the events occurred unless you have an atlas. Also, if you are reading this book for reference material, do not plan to cite dates of events. Because the Bent's did not keep journals, many of the years listed for when things happened are just educated guesses. It's fine for the reader but if you're working on a college paper, it could be a headache. I recommend this book to any history buff who wants to know what the West was like when it was first discovered by whites and how their relationships were with the Indians and Mexicans. Lavender also gives the reader a feeling on how it was to venture out to an unknown land and what chores were needed to do daily to survive. Just remember you atlas before starting!"},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"Despite all we read, this is the first book that made me realize that there were two Old Wests. The first really starts with the fur trade; the second starts with the flood tide of white immigration. Somewhere along this continuum, Native Americans effectively disappear as economic units and as cultures. The focus of this book is on the first West, including its transition into the second.This then is the story of the early west, when the first white emigration was necessarily in balance not only with the aboriginal inhabitants but also with the valid claims of Spain, Mexico, Great Britain and Russia. It is a story of intense competition, the story of a hugely successful commercial empire that really opened this vast section of the American West. It is the story of the Santa Fe Trail, the main route of commerce between St. Louis and Santa Fe, and the people who sought to control it. It is the story of men and women, of the lives and fortunes of those who developed and experienced this commercial thoroughfare.As a history it is mesmerizing. As a yarn it is eye popping. As a series of events it is unbelievable. A critical part of the Nation's Manifest Destiny, it is the story of human endurance, of culture clash, war, survival, success and failure. But mostly it is the story of a very logical, continual development, a transition, one that will make you proud to be an American."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"The best book I've read about the mountain men and the beginnings of the migration to the West. A must read for anyone interested in the history of the USA and exploration and settlement of the Western United States. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"The hearty souls that were part of this book are long gone. Jedidiah Smith, William Bent, Ceran St. Vrain and various players from the Old West are part of this menangerie that is brought together by brilliant author David Lanvender who passed away several years ago. The book is 395 pages of sorrow, courage, ruggedness and entreprneurialship that starts with the arrival of the Bents from the Old World, From here, their decendants emmigrated to Missouri where William Bent and his brother George were born. The story tells of early adventures of the Bents trapping for beavers for their fur which came at great physical cost to the trapping parties, the fomration of a fur company to rival competitors incuding Astor's company and the grand establishment of Bent's Fort on the Santa Fe Trail which served as a way station for traders, both white and indian, to exhange goods and money. The old fort lasted from 1833 to 1849 when William Bent decided that the rising conflicts on the Great Plains between the Indians and the white men would hinder trade. The great cholera outbreak among the Southern Cheyenne in 1849 which wiped out half of the tribe further reduced trade potential and was another factor in its closure. Having lost his brothers to disease and war and was not willing for anybody to use his fort, he demolished the fort to erase it from his memory and set up a new fort further east. His new fort would survive only another decade when he gave it over to the United States Army as part of the Fort Lyon complex when he realized that Indian trade was all but gone and that the Civil War was on the horizon.The story discusses William Bent's family relationships. He married a Cheyenne woman to show his sincerity to the Indians that he wished to stay in that part of the country for the long haul. His son Charles Bent was known for his depredations of white settlers while one of his other sons George fought for the Confederacy. After he sold his new fort to the U.S. Army, he soldiered in the trade business until he died from pneumonia in 1869. Ceran St. Vrain was his long-time partner who went his separate way to settle down in New Mexico where he died in 1870. On the whole this book was a great read with a substantial end note section which is almost a book to itself and an index. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to know how business and trade was in the Old West."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"This is one of the all-time great histories. Well-written, as fascinating as any action-adventure fiction, but one comes away from reading this book with the feeling that you have really been there with the Bent.

Lavender did a magnificent job with it."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"Excellent history of early Southwest; Independence to Taos. Follows the Bent Family from Missouri to New Mexico while addressing the Indian issues of the prairies."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"For a book written in 1954, I was surprised at the thoughtfulness and consideration given the Indians. Over and over Lavender brings to the fore the emotional lives of the Indians, he makes clear how these immigrant whites mixed with Indians and Mexicans in a rather ho-hum no-big-deal, she's-my-wife manner, and he skewers those whites in power who brought the Sand Creek Massacre about. However he does not shrink from portraying Indian lives as more Hobbesian than many of us, steeped as we have been for decades in the &quot;noble savage&quot; myth, would like to admit was true, and pulls no punches in using the language of the time. My! how horrible for our own history to be given to us straight and unfiltered. Essential for Coloradoans; the names of many of the people in this book are now forever attached to the creeks, mesas, rivers, and mountains around us. Difficult to imagine that the border of Mexico was the south bank of the Arkansas River until 1848. Bent's Fort was rebuilt in the 70's, it's just east of La Junta. I have liked everything Lavender has written so far - this is another excellent entry in the list."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"This work is an outstanding introduction to the overall narrative of the early Southwest. It taught me how much the early West was connected by trade and about the often overlooked period in between the high-water mark of the fur trade and the Civil War.Despite at least one reviewer's condescending attitude toward Lavender's writing, I found that he portrayed his main characters as morally mixed. The Bents come off as mainly good and noble, but even they are portrayed as having faults. The Indians are treated with respect, even while being described as apparently suffering from a 19th century form of ADD. The cruelty of whites and Indians is criticized, as it should be.My main criticisms of the books are (1) its length and (2)Lavender's historical method. The book probably could have been shorter. Lavender goes into way too much detail about things not directly tied to the Bents and their trade. Even so, the book is not terribly longer than it should have been. Perhaps 10 - 20% could have been cut.The other troubling aspect of the book is that it's hard to tell where direct documentary evidence ends and where Lavender's storytelling begins. Endnotes are far and few between and aren't always so helpful.Nevertheless, the story flows, and is interesting to read. How nice it would be if all recent historical writing was this readable!"},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"One fantastic, engrossing book! Bent's Fort is in southeastern Colorado and this book gives the history of that area along with Taos and Sante Fe. Couldn't put the book down. The fort bordered what was then the United States and Mexico. We see how the Bent brothers establish a trading post along the Arkansas River in the 1830's and began a long career of not only in trading with the Indians and Mexicans, but also get involved in the uprising of hostilities between Mexico and the United States. The cultural descriptions of our Native Americans is very well done. It is a great read and as another reviewer said, it is as if the characters simply come alive and you feel as though you know them personally."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"David Lavender wrote Bent's Fort in 1954. His book has all of the virtues of a popular history written during that time period. The story is driven by bigger than life characters forging history in an exotic locale. The book was a fun read enjoyable in the same way as those big 1950's technicolor movies. Great on plot but a little weak on the history.To the modern reader, the book is very dated. The Indians are \\"Red Savages\\" and the Mexicans are lazy and shiftless. Not surprisingly, the Anglo Fur Traders are heroes straight out of a Hollywood central casting. David Lavender writes with the easy racism that was common in the pre civil rights era. In the past fifty years, American historians have made great progress in the study of the West. We now have a much more nuanced understanding of how the West was really settled.I would recommend this book to those who like the \\"lite\\" version of history. A fun read with plenty of good guys and bad guys. Something to read between the tomahawk throwing contest and working on the buffalo hide beer can holder. However, the serious reader should check out David Fridtj Halaas' \\"Halfbreed\\". There is no better an example of how much Western History writing has progressed in the past half century."},{"Title":"Bent's Fort (Dolphin book)","review":"I am glad to see thi book is still available.

Bruce does the obligatory opening chapters on quantum mechanics in general and the weirdness that arises when mere humans [like me] try to fathom the subject. The book then launches into a thorough accounting of what the author refers to as the Oxford interpretation, giving us the agreements and disagreements, warts and all. Bruce is a great writer and keeps the tough material engaging.

The sections on the many-worlds interpretation (or interpretations, since not all many-worlders agree) of quantum mechanics are very good, although they haven't changed my views. (I'm still firmly agnostic about the interpretation of quantum mechanics.) This book explains the two most mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics quite clearly, and compares them reasonably fairly. The main disappointment I had in the book was its treatment of Bohm's and other alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics (i.e., not Copenhagen or many-worlds). They are dismissed quite cavalierly, and I would have liked to see them treated more seriously and at greater length, and dismissed with better justifications. (Just to set the record straight, let me say that I think there are good reasons to dismiss Bohm's interpretation and excellent reasons for dismissing all the other alternative interpretations. It's fairly hard to articulate these reasons, as doing it right would involve learning more than I really want to about these alternative interpretations, and I would have really liked Colin Bruce to do this work for me. On the other hand, maybe I'm just being selfish here and hoping somebody else will do work that I'm too lazy to do myself. Even without a comprehensive treatment of these other interpretations, this is a really entertaining and instructive book, which deserves every one of the five stars I'm giving it.)"},{"Title":"Schr&ouml;dinger's Rabbits: The Many Worlds of Quantum","review":"The book pushes what the author calls the Oxford Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, i.e. the many-worlds interpretation, as the \\"correct\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, the argument in favor for it is only supported by a cavalier and arbitrary application of Occam's Razor, and dismissive (and sometimes ridiculing) statements against all alternative interpretations. I couldn't really find any strong argument supporting the Oxford Interpretation at all. I enjoyed the author's other books very much but this one was a bit of a disappointment. The author must be spending too much time in Oxford and allowed himself to be brain-washed by the many-worlders."},{"Title":"Schr&ouml;dinger's Rabbits: The Many Worlds of Quantum","review":"I give this book four stars, in spite of significant conceptual errors, because it clearly explains not only the \\"many worlds interpretation\\" but also what an interpretation is and how to choose a good one.Quantum mechanics has often been \\"interpreted\\" by use of approximations. The many worlds view leads to these same approximations but also accepts the whole mathematical theory at face value. So it works also in cases like Einstein's EPR problem. This is actually a very old approach, but it has been waiting for a clear relatively easy to understand explanation, like this book, to become generally accepted.An example of an error: p. 127, \\"The mathematics of ''decoherence'' tell us that the interference between developing outcomes that are significantly different above the microscopic level fade very rapidly.\\" This statistical and partly classical view is not needed here. The lack of visibility of alternate outcomes follows from the linearity of the Schrodinger equation. It was explained by Everett, in a footnote to his thesis, \\"The whole question of the transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' is taken care of by the theory in a very simple way--there is no such transition, nor is such a transition necessary for the theory to be in accord with our experience. From the viewpoint of the theory, all elements of a superposition (all branches) are 'actual,' none more 'real' than the rest. It is unnecessary to suppose that all but one are somehow destroyed, since all the separate elements of a superposition individually obey the wave equation with complete indifference to the presence or absence of ('actuality' or not) of any other elements. This total lack of effect of one branch on another also implies that no observer will ever be aware of any 'splitting' process.\\", H. Everett, \\"Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\\", Rev. Mod. Phys. 29, 454-62, (1957)Some quantum applications can be explained by the Copenhagen Interpretation, but, the author argues, were easier to think of in the Many Worlds interpretation. There may be others, that like EPR, might actually work, but would appear impossible in the Copenhagen Interpretation."},{"Title":"Schr&ouml;dinger's Rabbits: The Many Worlds of Quantum","review":"I felt that the introduction Colin Bruce does in Chapter 1 through his \`lottery card' to entanglement and its associated non-locality phenomena is quite simple, entertaining, revealing, and faithfully depicting the crux of the matter in quantum physics. In spite of his famous \\"God does not play dice\\", Einstein was willing to accept the non-deterministic character of the Universe but, he could not renounce to the principle of locality.While writing the book in Spanish entitled \\"&iquest;Qu&eacute; es la Realidad? - Einstein, F&iacute;sica Cu&aacute;ntica, y Folclore\\" (\\"What is Reality? - Einstein, Quantum Physics, and Folklore\\"), I am particularly interested in reading popular science books like Bruce's where the philosophical implications of different ontologies for Quantum Mechanics are discussed -- even though it is clear Bruce has already taken a position based more on gut feelings than hard evidence. Sometimes (I agree with other reviewers) he goes a little overboard in suggesting the reality of his many-worlds interpretation but, in many others occasions, he appears objective, acknowledging there is a long way to go before a particular ontology (perhaps a different one not yet imagined) is universally accepted by the scientific community.Chapter 4, where he tries to make the reader \\"feel in her bones\\" that sending information faster than the speed of light is equivalent to send it backwards in time, is obscure and hard to understand by a person not imbued of the epistemological intricacies behind the concept of simultaneity in Special Relativity. Those epistemological issues are thoroughly treated for the non-professional inCabalgando con la Luz - Einstein, Relatividad, y Folclore. Chapter 6, introducing the Hilbert space for the non-professional, is well done. The concepts of collapse and decoherence throughout the book are difficult to grasp in their intrinsic significance and I felt the author should have spent more time explaining them and emphasizing their importance in making the strange world of quantum look sensible. The second half of the book is dedicated to explaining the Many-Worlds ontology and is quite interesting and abundant in the good, the bad, and the ugly of such an interpretation. It is clear his position but it is clear as well he cannot convince the reader.Overall, I give four stars to this book and recommend its reading without hesitation. Felix Alba Juez."},{"Title":"Schr&ouml;dinger's Rabbits: The Many Worlds of Quantum","review":"In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many natural philosophers believed that the laws of the Universe could be derived from Reason. For instance, Galilean invariance gave us Newton's Laws, and similar invariance conditions give rise to special and general relativity. Quantum mechanics changed all that because many quantum mechanical phenomena violate one or more 'reasonable' assumptions, such as the impossibility of action at a distance. This is really why Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics as more than a provisional theory.It is tempting to be dismissive of quantum mechanics because it only deals with phenomena at extremely sub-microscopic dimensions, and classical mechanics and electrodynamics can get alone without it perfectly well at 'human' dimensions. Both reasons are faulty. First, quantum mechanics explains quantum tunneling, which is central to solid state devices such as transistors, and more generally, quantum effects can be amplified without difficulty to the human level (this is the famous Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat problem, to which the title of the book alludes. Second, there are deep antinomies in classical electromagnetic theory, including the prediction that the energy in blackbody radiation goes to infinity as the wavelength of the energy goes to zero.There are many strange and beautiful quantum phenomena. Perhaps the two most famous are wave/particle duality and entanglement. Wave-particle duality is well illustrated by the famous two-slit experiment. Photons are directed towards an absorbing wall with two vertical slits some macroscopic distant apart. The few photons that go through one of the slits hit a clear photographic film that records the absorption of the photon by coloring the impact point black. If photons are particles, there should be two widely separated masses of black dots whose location can be calculated using simple geometry. If photons are waves (like waves in a pond), it is not hard to show that there should be alternating bands of light and dark on the photographic plate, corresponding the interference pattern of the two parts of the wave that pass through the distinct slits. If you do this experiment, photons act wave-like. However, if you measure the passage of the photon through a slit, you always find it went through either one or the other, but not partly through both. This shows the photon is a particle. Moreover, if you can measure which slit the photon went through, the interference patter on the plate disappears, and the photon leave a black spot on the plate.Early interpreters of this weir phenomenon argued that by measuring the photon, you interfered with its normal path, as explained by classical signaling theory, so the phenomenon is just poor experimental design. For a variety of reasons that you can read about, this explanation is faulty. The widely accepted explanation (the so-called Copenhagen theory, named after Neils Bohr) is that the photon is indeed a wave, as described by Schr&ouml;dinger's famous equation or Planck's relativistic version. These equations describe not where the photon is, but rather a probability distribution over its possible locations. When observed, the wave 'collapses' to a particular location, the location being proportion to its relative probability.This experiment and its interpretation calls into question the nature of objectivity and subjectivity in a highly radical form. What does it mean to be 'observed'? By whom? What if it is 'observed' by a machine and you do not have access to the machine's memory? The two-slit and related experiments, as explained by the Copenhagen school, simply divides reality in to nature plus observer, where observer means a human or an instrument that can be read and recorded, accessible to a human. This is fine for all practical purposes, because that's how we humans do science. But its ontological status is highly compromised.A second weird phenomenon involves 'entanglement.' Electrons have 'spin,' which when measured in any direction, is either 'up' or 'down.' When electrons are generated in pairs, they may be entangled in the sense that after they are separated, if one measures 'up' in a particular direction, the other must measure 'down.' However the state of spin is a probability distribution that collapses to a particular up or down when you measure it. Suppose the entangled electrons move apart until they are a light-second apart, and then the spin of one is measured in some direction. Then immediately, not a second later, the other measures the opposite direction. This is not a relativistic time effect, and it has been repeatedly verified in the laboratory. It is called a violation of locality.Einstein and his colleagues Podolsky and Rosen (1935) used a similar argument to show that there must be something wrong with quantum mechanics, but it turns out that that is just the way the world works, like it or not.Most physicists do not care why quantum mechanics works the way it does, but some do, and many of those think that there must be a better model that the Copenhagen collapse theory. One is the Many Worlds Interpretation (MMI), which Bruce explains and defends in this book. The MMI says that whenever there appears to be a collapse of the quantum wave, the Universe really branches into a large number of alternative Universes, side-by-side, each of which captures one of the possible states. So, for instance, if you set up an apparatus that kills you if a certain photon is measured as having spin up, and does nothing if the spin is down. Then the whole Universe splits into two Universes, in the first of which you are alive and the other of which you are dead.This theory does explain most of the queerness of quantum mechanics, and it could be true. But there is no evidence that it is true. Nor has anyone ever suggested an experiment that would determine its truth value (Bruce suggests some possibilities, but they are far-fetched). Moreover, the theory itself is completely outlandish, far weirder than the phenomenon it is supposed to explain. The fact is that reading this and other attempts to explain quantum weirdness are fun and challenging intellectually, but their real value is virtually zero. When someone tells me he believes a version of the MWI, I treat the person the same as if they told me they believed in transubstantiation or the tooth fairy.Nevertheless, quantum mechanics is certainly not a \\"true\\" theory, if only because it makes no room for gravity. The string and quantum gravity theorists attempt to repair this fault, but they produce theories that are as yet untested, although possibly testable.But I think there is a deeper problem. Quantum mechanics represents a particle (e.g., a photon) as a point in Hilbert space, which is an infinite dimensional vector space. I don't believe there are \`real' infinities, and hence this representation must be an approximation of the true, finite, model. We should be looking at finite or countable models of particle physics, not hugely overpopulated continuous models. Richard Feynman registered his discomfort with nonconstructible, continuous models, in the following words (quoted by Bruce, p. 242): \\"It always bothers me that, according to the laws as we understand them today, it takes a computing machine an infinite number of operations to figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space, and no matter how tiny a region of time...\\" I have often make the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed, and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the checkerboard with all its apparent complexities.\\"I realize many readers will not share my skepticism concerning infinite models. But they should, because it is the only reasonable position. Countable models are fine, because we can attain any element of a countable model in finite time. But uncountable models are just a useful human construct, probably not corresponding to anything real in the world. At any rate, reading Bruce's book conjures up all sorts of cute ideas that are fun to think about while taking a break from the real world."},{"Title":"Schr&ouml;dinger's Rabbits: The Many Worlds of Quantum","review":"This book made my brain hurt; but in a good way-much like my thighs hurt after doing squats at the gym. While aimed at the intelligent layman, this book still contains quite a bit that might go over the reader's head. Readers would do well to have at least an amateur grasp of some of the main concepts involved in Relativity, classical mechanics, particle physics, and mathematics these days (don't worry, you don't actually need to understand the equations these fields employ). I felt it was a wonderful overview of the many-worlds approach to the problems of quantum physics, and Dr. Bruce certainly fleshes out the terrifying problems the many-worlders themselves must account for.However, I agree with the reviewer who suggests that the \\"non-many-worlders\\" are given short shrift in this book; one gets the sense that the great physicists who cannot support many-worlds are a motley crew of cranks on the fringes of theoretical physics. This is hard to believe, given the seemingly ludicrous implications of many-worlds and its frightening \\"decoherence\\" with the human experience. Only Roger Penrose seems to be given due credit, and his theories are really only alluded to.Finally, the author's \\"solution\\" for reconciling the problems introduced by many-worlds relies upon a somewhat flimsy elucidation of the concept of subinformation, which this reader found incomprehensible. Perhaps seasoned physicist readers will understand and appreciate this book more than I did, but I would still recommend it highly to anyone wanting a rigorous intellectual workout."},{"Title":"Schr&ouml;dinger's Rabbits: The Many Worlds of Quantum","review":"This book is somewhat harder to read because the subject does not flow well from chapter to chapter, but on the positive side, it is written for a general reader which requires only basic knowledge of quantum physics. The author states that his main focus is the recent advances at Oxford University, due to Roger Penrose and David Deutsch, with emphasis on the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics. But as you read through the chapters his lack of focus becomes evident.The summary of the book is as follows: Schrodinger's equations for an electron in an atom are described by the \\"time-independent\\" equation, which does not answer the question of where the particle is located at any given instant. The time-dependent equation predicts that as long as it is not interacting with anything, the wave will flatten and spread out to infinity. Yet even a tiny observation-like interaction with this wave somewhere in the universe can bring an extremely point-like electron springing into view, with dimensions that remain too small to measure and this happens in less time than it would take light to cross the region of space where it was until a moment ago. It is hard to imagine any reasonable physical mechanism that could bring about quantum collapse (faster than speed of light).The quantum phenomenon is interpreted by two major schools of thought; the Copenhagen interpretation due to Niels Bohr, and the many worlds interpretation due to Hugh Everett. According to the former, that unmodified Schrodinger wave equation gives rise to a collapsed single reality when perceived by a conscious observer, but it does not provide a mechanism for quantum collapse. Roger Penrose proposes that the Schrodinger wave equation must be modified to include some physical collapse mechanism that gives rise to a single-valued reality. Exponents of many-worlds interpretation propose that collapse never happens and the universe continues with all outcomes which are equal and real. Just believe what the equations (math) are telling us, that the universe is tracing out all possible histories, rather than just one privileged one expounded by Copenhagen school. There is one problem at the heart of the many worlds concept, which is how do you treat relative probabilities of different outcomes and the world lines that follow them? There is a third interpretation due to David Bohm (Bohmian mechanics) called hidden variables interpretation. The conceptual difficulties of the quantum world such as, the two-slit experiment, Heisenberg uncertainty, and the quantum collapse is explained by postulating some fine structure to space that is too delicate to measure directly. This hypothetical fine structure also called hidden local variables. Waves that can influence the motion of both photons and matter particles and make small objects judder about so as to complicate the measurement of their positions and motions. Abrupt collision jolt particles from the waves they are associated with resulting in localization of matter (quantum collapse).The spacetime in which the probability waves move is also quantized. If gravitational force (space-time curvature) were subjected to quantum fluctuations in the way that other fields and energies are, mathematical infinities would arise. In physical terms, the structure of space-time would be very unstable. A quantum fluctuation in a tiny region of space-time would very rapidly grow, perhaps spawning exotic entities such as black holes at a colossal rate. Roger Penrose offers an explanation by suggesting that such uncertainties in gravitational field energy tend to cancel themselves out producing quantum collapse as a side effect. Even two atomic nuclei attract each other gravitationally and produce tiny curvature in spacetime. Penrose's calculations for quantum collapse as expected is fast for larger objects (for a cat it is 10(e-37) seconds, and for a beryllium ion, 100 years).The first half of the book is sometimes irrelevant and boring but the second half is interesting. I found the last three chapters are particularly interesting; it is here the author discusses the quantized spacetime and the information stored in space-time in relation to the rest of the universe. There are many books on quantum physics and physical reality written for general readers, and I recommend readers to look for other sources to strengthen their knowledge in quantum reality and philosophy of existence.1.Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale: Contemporary Theories in Quantum Gravity2.The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism (25th Anniversary Edition)3.The Physics of Consciousness: The Quantum Mind and the Meaning of Life4.What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"5.Schr&ouml;dinger: Life and Thought6.Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science7.Uncertainty: Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science8.Niels Bohr's Times,: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity9.Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality: Solving the Quantum Mysteries Tag: Author of In Search of Schrod.

Winnicott","review":"This little book should be required reading for everyone who works with kids who have serious behavior problems. Winnicott was a pediatrician and psychoanalyst who had many years of close, intimate contact with families, especially families of troubled children. He makes a convincing case that children who steal, lie, destroy property, assault others, etc. are attempting to compensate for early separation/loss of an important caregiver. He views such behaviors as attempts to coerce the environment into taking notice and &quot;containing&quot; the child. As such, these behaviors are &quot;hopeful&quot;, and are viewed as the child's efforts to reclaim the satisfactions that were lost -- to take back what once was theirs. Children who had adequate care that was lost are the children Winnicott suggests become anti-social. There are numerous vignettes of his personal experiences in trying to treat delinquent kids. He makes a compelling argument for early loss as a decisive factor in later delinquent acts. Although he ultimately felt that &quot;treatment&quot; was only possible after an extended period of &quot;containment&quot;, he maintained his conviction that these kids have sustained losses too dreadful for them to think about. He was a good-humored and compassionate clinician with an enduring belief in the profound importance of the child's early relationships. People who work with delinquent kids may just find that Winnicott's understanding of children helps them hang on when the going gets tough. I treasure this book.

Unlike the author of this book, I can't claim that it's my full time job, but I do get paid for writing porn along with straight fiction and non-fiction. I often read books about writing to see if I can learn something new and useful. This book was really disappointing.I find it dificult to understand why anyone would offer a book about porn writing that contains no examples of erotic writing; no information about the structure and requirements for popular porn categories; and, nothing that indicates the person ever wrote a porn story except her saying so. In fact, there is little in the way of writing examples of any kind in the book. For the most part the book offers homilies such as \\"... a story must have a beginning, middle and end\\" and not much more.

The author claims to be published in Playgirl, Score, Gallery and Huster. Yet, when we look at the paying markets sections and the writers guideline section, we find no mention of these magazines. I'm not saying the author wasn't published in these magazines, but it's odd that she wouldn't provide information about places where she says she was paid for her writing. Providing the Corporate mailing address for Gallery and nothing else (like a person to send stories) is less information than I could get from just picking up a copy of the magazine in the newstand. I found better editorial information for Gallery and the other sources the author indicates paid her from reference material in my local library.The paying markets section and writers guidelines is a hodge podge of entries. There are only 22 of them in this section. What's worse, the same two editors appear as the person to send material for about half the entries.

(Main problem with the pro-Catholicism literature is that it cannot explain the ultimate success of Protestantism in late sixteenth century.)Argument(s):* It was the continuities in transition that allowed laity to make transition without a major problem-especially liturgical continuities.* The communal nature of the Reformation was key (following Blickle): people generally did what their community did and what their priests did (203).* Says (contra Duffy and Scarsbrick) that Protestantism actually did have quite a bit of lay appeal: the Reformation was \\"unwanted but not wholly unwelcomed.\\"* Conversely, however, Protestantism was not immediately understood or adhered to; laity tended to just add all the elements together-had a mix of Protestantism and Catholicism and saw no dissonance* The laity were always a bit vague about what they believed-as true in 1500 as in 1600.* Ultimately, the Reformation succeeded because it was mostly gentle (although radical elements did exist): \\"The church of England was to be a nursery in which the masses were gently weaned, not roughly snatched, from popery.\\"Methodology:* Focus is on laity and popular religion (but doesn't want to make too sharp of a distinction)* Looks at thoughts and practices of three groups: 1) those inside the church; 2) those alongside of the church; 3) those outside the church* Charts a middle path between the extremes of interpretation: on one side is A.G.

It is grounded on a series of readings by three modern fiction writers. Each of these (Izumi Kyka, Enchi Fumiko, Nakagami Kenji) centerpieces a modern type of female character, one that often draws on the stylistics of pre-modern archetypes. \\"The dangerous woman\\" is the focus for Cornyetz's development of an understanding of how three moments of modern narrative have drawn on, yet re-formulated, the moment of encounter with the pre-modern. They have done so, she writes, in the service of contemporary critiques of their respective patriarchal orders. Crucial in each of the triptych's parts is an analysis of how the \\"dangerous woman\\" also corresponds in some fashion (negation, abjection, other relation, etc.) to a maternal figure. The use of psychoanalytic criticism in this book differs from many psycho-biographical narratives (e.g. that focus on Kyka's maternal complex) that reflect authorial consciousness onto characters as a kind of therapy. She analyzes how language that has been troped as \\"feminine\\" opens a proliferation of meanings. But at the same time, this potential opening often channels a line of narrative that tries to re-attach language to a kind of \\"Real,\\" but can only do so by abjecting a female (not a \\"feminized\\") body. The argument is clearly written, and upfront about its own critical investments; it goes through focused explications of the Lacanian concepts that are necessary to apply to the readings it offers; I even found the Structuralist-influenced charts that compare various concepts quite helpful. The book is useful and actually teachable because many of the works it cites by each author are translated; moreover, it succinctly summarizes the main line of many currents of Japanese scholarship hard to get one's hands on outside of major metropolises. I liked the Kyka section in particular, because it works THROUGH the logic of the textual systems, apart from a priori assumptions about history or the author's personal history, before relating her readings to the historical period/regime of power in question. Lastly, it perodizes lit crit in some helpful ways too--e.g. the reception of particupar Kyka or Nakagami critical paradigms. In short, highly recommended, useful, and one of the least hysterical books about hysteria you are likely to read for a while."},{"Title":"Dangerous Women, Deadly Words: Phallic Fantasy and Modernity in Three Japanese Writers","review":"There's a fundemental problem with Cornyetz's book-- as she herself points out in the introduction, her work depends so heavily on the theories of thinkers such as Lacan and Foucault that not a whole lot of time was left for her to master her Japanese language skills. Her detractors point out that she has a limited knowledge of her subjects and a limited ability to read their work, which leads to a problem of credibility when drawing broad conclusions about their ouevre. Her supporters laud her for.... her mastery of the theories of thinkers such as Lacan and Foucault.The end result is a work that will teach readers interested in modern Japanese very little about the writers or the work that they produced, but will certainly be of value to those who wish to see Lacanian psychoanalytic theory applied to that work. No less a deconstructionist icon than Derrida liked to point out that there's nothing to literature beyond the text. The question, then, is what sort of work can be produced when the author's ability to read the texts she's critiquing is marginal at best. Too often, the analysis boils down to nothing more sophisiticated than 'if it's convex, it must be a phallus.'A university dean I know once told me &quot;when the only tool in your box is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.&quot; This is certainly a comprehensive take on what French theorists might make of three Japanese authors of supernatural tales, but of little use to those seeking a comprehensive understanding of the life and work of three fascinating Japanese authors from unique backgrounds who penned some remarkable tales of the supernatural, Japanese society, and the nation's role in the modern world. The unfortunate treatment of these individuals here is a cliched attempt to &quot;read&quot; male Japanese authors as unwitting dupes of a society largely interested in the subjugation of women.If you'd like to learn more about the authors whose work is critiqued here, why not do the sensible thing and check out Charles Inouye's excellent translations of Izumi Kyoka in &quot;Seven Gothic Tales,&quot; or Nakagami Kenji's short stories in &quot;Snakelust.&quot; Make up your own mind-- after all, isn't that what an encounter with literature is all about?"},{"Title":"Dangerous Women, Deadly Words: Phallic Fantasy and Modernity in Three Japanese Writers","review":"Cornyetz takes three seemingly disparate writers and shows how they are all implicated in the creation of the modern Japanese subject through a process of othering and abjecting the \\"dangerous woman\\". The book makes several sorely needed contributions. First, it brings rigorous critical vocabulary to a field that often uses loose, impressionistic language to talk about femininity in Izumi Kyka (1873 - 1939), Enchi Fumiko (1905 - 1986), and Nakagami Kenji (1946-1992). Second, it reveals how more sophisticated recent criticism - especially on Nakagami - tends to erase gender as it becomes more theoretical. Perhaps most impressive, it steers clear of using feminism either to celebrate or condemn the texts themselves. Instead it highlights the ambivalent politics of their simultaneous reliance upon and interventions into the foreclosure of women's bodies and women's pleasures from Japanese modernity.The three authors receive four or five short chapters each. Those on Kyka situate his nostalgia for mothers and enchantresses in relation to Meiji social, economic, political, linguistic and literary reforms. Those on Enchi focus on vengeful uses of the sacred and the profane by middle-aged women in the immediate post-war period, when state-sanctioned maternity was enforced anew to make non-reproductive female sexuality almost inconceivable. The chapters on Nakagami describe the author's treatment of 1960's jazz, the Buraku outcaste class, male homoeroticism, and pre-Buddhist oral tales. In each case Cornyetz draws from a range of recent and canonical writings to provide precise sociocultural and literary-critical contexts. These expository elements give her narrative a fine historical grain, delivering a great amount of information with authority and clarity.The book's main achievement is to draw these elements into a compelling account of why sexual excess, maternity, voice and the monogatari form are integral to each writer precisely in their systematic codings as feminine, and abject. Kyka is often said to be fascinated with an erotic female other and at the same time \\"feminine\\" in his own prose style. Cornyetz argues that these \\"femininities\\" are not oppositional to but in fact devalued byproducts of the genbun'ichi consolidation of modern male subjectivity in a new phonocentric writing system. She demonstrates how a similar gendering of premodern language lies behind the \\"discovery\\" of an exotic, erotic, and necessarily absent Japan in a number of cultural projects, from Meiji ethnography to Edo kokugaku. Her discussion of Enchi pivots on the feminization of Heian literary genres. Drawing from important work by Mizuta Noriko, it shows how Enchi uses Heian \\"women's\\" writing to access a disruptive female rage that is always framed by the same phallocentric logic it is meant to resist. Of the three writers, Nakagami emerges as the most self-reflexive in his knowledge that the premodern \\"women's\\" voice is ultimately neither dangerous nor deadly. His identification of the male outcaste with the female other is the most ambivalent instance of \\"phallic fantasy\\" in the book."},{"Title":"Dangerous Women, Deadly Words: Phallic Fantasy and Modernity in Three Japanese Writers","review":"In an age ruled by phallic, unilateral men who want things as they see it (Iraq or Japanese literature) without abstract mediations or filters of any kind (the United Nations or &quot;French theory&quot;), it's a pleasure to have this book in print. Here we have Japanese literature filtered lovingly through the most scintillating, abstract thought around. The result makes Japanese literature more delectable, not less. I love the way the author doesn't assume that there's a there (always already) there (like the &quot;text itself&quot; or Weapons of Mass Destruction) but rather reconstructs the object of Japanese literature in new and exciting ways. Foreplay is so much more fun than pre-emptive penetration, especially when it's being handled by a feminist committed to intelligent and abstract mediations. Long live feminist mediations!"},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I was also required to read this in college--last year in fact--for a seminar on Colonial American society. I was not able to finish it in the week we were given to read it...I liked it so much, that I finished it over the summer as my recreational travel reading! She gives you all the details, the colors, the textures, the sights, sounds, smells, and even the tastes of what it was like to be a woman in the early years of settlement in this country. Particularly enjoyable was reading about the living connection of Ulrich's own experiences working with cows, baking pies, preparing preserves, and speaking with old women in her little New England community.What began to annoy me after I read this book was when people implied that nothing existed before 1776, the &quot;birth of this country&quot;--how could I believe that after living in the century prior to 1750 through this perceptive book? Amazing to read, amazing to think about, and amazing in the way it ultimately changes your paradigm. I only wish all history books were as absorbing as this."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"Good Wives sheds an illuminating light on the lives of early American women in New England. Ulrich does a great job in proving that these women's lives were far from static and submissive, a fact long lines of historians have never realized or have ignored. Of course, one reason New England's pre-colonial women have not been studied to any vast degree is the fact that primary (and even secondary) source material is almost nonexistent. For example, there is no female diary written before 1750. Ulrich deeply mines the sources that are extant and presents her findings in a way that is highly organized, richly detailed, and quite illuminating. Her main sources consist of court records, probate records, family papers (which include only a very small number of letters written by women), diaries of men, church records, and the contents of ministerial sermons. She is very careful to qualify the reliability and utility of each source, and, in a bibliographical essay, she points to the shortcomings of previous historical monographs that either ignored colonial women or dismissed their influence in colonial life.Ulrich states that this book is a study of role definition, and she organizes her text around three role clusters associated with three Biblical women (an appropriate framework for the religious societies of colonial New England). Her three prototypes are Bathsheeba for economic affairs, Eve for sexual/reproductive matters, and Jael for matters of female aggression within the bounds of religion. Ulrich identifies and expounds upon the following roles for colonial New England women: housewife, deputy husband, consort, mother, mistress, neighbor, Christian, and--in some cases--heroism. While women were subservient to men, they could assert themselves to certain degrees within the social framework of life. For example, women commonly helped men with their work, conducted business matters in the place of a husband who was unavailable, oversaw the raising of all neighborhood children collectively, dominated the frequent occasions of childbirth, and indirectly exercised influence within the churches. In some of the most interesting material in the book, Ulrich examines the accounts of females captured by Indians. Although she finds significant differences between them in terms of their levels of submissiveness and aggression toward their captors, she develops a framework in which these differences can be understood within early New England society as a whole. The real magic of the book is its success in describing the normal, daily lives of women and comparing and contrasting the stories of those residing in urban centers, town outskirts, and frontier homes. While the lack of primary source material makes it impossible to know the true aspects of these pioneer New England women, Good Wives offers a sweeping yet individualized picture of an important part of colonial society in all its aspects, a society in which the boundaries of men and women did sometimes blur within the individual household."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"How can any history can be written as though 50% of the population doesn't exist? This book gives a clear idea of what that other 50% was doing while the others were becoming &quot;historic&quot;. It becomes clear that these women were not cut from a cookie-cutter, and their position in society was not so stagnant or ineffectual as modern Americans like to believe."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I am a passionate fan of A Midwife's Tale, and so expected to enjoy Good Wives. It is different, but nevertheless, an incredibly valuable resource. I read with amusement the one-star review from the student who'd been compelled to read this for a college course and thought...\\"Gosh, he COULDN'T have read this book! He must be confusing the title!\\" It is crammed with interesting, offbeat, entertaining, and poignant glimpses into colonial American life. Perhaps I enjoy Ulrich's books so much because I live in a northeastern hamlet next to a 350-year-old village and run into history on my way to the grocery store (or local farm) to pick up eggs. If I haven't convinced you to give this a try, let me just throw in that this is quite a sexy little book, for the Puritans and colonials, contrary to folklore, were very susceptible to Eros. It's also a book one can pick up, read a bit, then take up later with no difficulty. If you enjoy history, particularly the Princeton \\"common man\\" school and not just kings and queens...you'll have a wonderful time with Good Wives."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"&quot;Pots and pans&quot; history. So that's what this stuff is called. If that is supposed to diminish it, allow me to suggest that nothing could be further from the truth.Nothing is more controversial in our society today than &quot;woman's place,&quot; and no where is it more controversial than among women. (Any email list will bear this out.)But what was it like for the women who were the founders of this country? How often do we even think about how they lived, unless we happen to visit one of the burgeoning historical communities multiplying across the country?It was work, and it was hard work. Women were at home, and they were at home for a reason. Even getting to church was a major endeavor, and one they fought for, for it was women who built many of the major American congregations thriving today.Their relationships with each other sustained them, and also were likely to pose the most threat, for women could make or break the reputations of one another, upon which survival depended.Childbirth, pre, post and in between, determined the rhythm of life for generations of women. There were many births, and many of them did not live to adulthood. A woman who was able to nurture many children to see her grandchildren and great-grandchildren had accomplished a great deal, and was honored accordingly.They had to know and understand the rhythms of nature and the timing of how to use an oven they could stand in and work with its heat as it coursed over the length of a day. There were no timers. There were no temperature regulators. There certainly were no microwave ovens or dish washers or washing machines.They made medical tinctures as well as food, for doctors were few and far between and if they couldn't nurse their loved ones to health, they lost them more often than not.They acted as &quot;Deputy Husbands,&quot; representing their husbands in their livelihood, not in their own right, but as stand-ins based on the status of their husbands. It was power, even if not their own.Well researched, thoroughly documented, well written and a very pleasant read, this book will allow us all to count our blessings -- and honor our foremothers....geminiwalker"},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I've always been curious about the \\"history behind the history\\": while the Big Names were out and about, what was going on with the \\"common joes\\" I know darn well my ancestors would have been? I have 3 of Ulrich's books, Good Wives, A MidWife's Tale, and Homespun. I enjoy the way she paints a picture of the everyday chopping wood and baking bread part of life that sustained the Big Boys while they were out Making History. Her books are very readable, in large part because of the way she draws you in by getting you intrigued with the life of one or two specific people, and shows you their world through their experiences. Good Wives was quite an eye-opener for me. I'd had an image of colonial women as leading a life of drudgery, very much confined to house and kitchen. Instead, they were partners to their husbands, making business deals and commitments their spouses would be expected to carry through. I came away from this book thinking that as things got more settled in this country, women actually lost freedom and opportunity, not gained it."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I really liked this book. It was an easy and very interesting read. I like history, but get a little bored with text-type books that just focus on wars and dates. This book takes you back in that time period by using examples of real people (concentrating on women) and situations so it makes it easy to put yourself in that era and understand what life was like. I feel that no matter what your age or sex you will get something out of this book."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I found this to be an excellent source for some curious, sometimes gritty details about the lives of women in pre-colonial America. It was exactly what I was looking for in researching my new project. It's well-organized, accessible, and more readable than many of the academic works I've read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"Ulrich's Good Wives examines the diaries and court records of men and women to provide a complete portrait of women at work in colonial America. The book is divided into three sections, the first examines the economic life of women in New England, the second focuses on sex and reproduction and the third religion and aggression. Ulrich explores women's economic contributions detailing traditional tasks like cooking and cleaning as well as less controversial ones like shopkeeper and textile manufacturer. She shows how some women became deputy husbands, making business deals with a neighbor as a surrogate for their spouses. Although Ulrich also provides many vignettes of women's experiences with sexual relationships and reproduction, but these stories do little to add to the discussion of women at work in early America. In fact, the role of reproduction deeply affected a woman's ability to work and this was not stressed by Ulrich. While the stories of aggression and captivity are exciting, these instances remained rare and thus less consequential for the study of women in New England. The portrait of women in Good Wives seems incomplete because it fails to examine religion in the lives of women. But, overall, Good Wives' use of vignettes of ordinary women in New England allows the reader to be drawn into the world of early colonial America by examining some of the various roles women were required to fulfill."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I am very interested in finding out about colonial American women. This book didn't disappoint as far as facts. The author takes great pains to mention as much as she can about the women she's writing about. My only quibble with the book would be sometimes when the author introduces some facts, she would just leave the facts hanging there. There would be interesting tibits mentioned about a particular woman, then that tibit would be left and the author would go one to discuss something else.Still, overall this book is very enlightening about how women lived back in colonial times."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"Ulrich succeeds in bringing to life the obscure and the mundane in a manner that intrigues and entertains. This is not a small feat given a subject that I thought would be somewhat dry. Rather than reading like a textbook, Ulrich targets the divisions of women's lives that Nancy Cott used, religion, sisterhood, domesticity, and marriage relations with a wit and wealth of facinating vingettes.The only real issue I have with the book (aside from becoming a little dated twenty years on) is the title. People seem to assume that a book entitled 'Good Wives' is a type of antiquated self help manual, rather than a record of the Good wives of 17th and 18th Century America."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"While not a book that addresses spinning/weaving/textiles exclusively, there is enough good information on those subjects here that a spinner/weaver would thoroughly enjoy this book.

There are photos, too, which is always a bonus."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I was required to read this book in college. To note that I kept it, and have re-read it many times tells you what a service Ulrich has done with this material. Her organiztion of subject is beautifully done , with lots of biblical allegory's.

Every Person should read this book!"},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"This is an excellent book that will really make you rethink the history you've been taught. As another reviewer put it, half the population was left out of history! This book gives an account of the many roles puritan women played during this time and the immense impact they had on history. I enjoyed reading about the impact of sexuality and reproduction. Imagine your entire life being filled with getting pregnant, giving birth and lactating and then starting the cycle all over again. It just goes to show that women who aren't allowed control over their bodies aren't allowed any control in society. We can tie this to our own culture and the struggle for birth control and abortion rights. Anyways, a great read and I shall make my future sons and daughters read it so they know that women have a strong important place in history."},{"Title":"GOOD WIVES","review":"I received this product via My Kindle and have nothing to say about Amazon's service itself.

I was forced to read the book because of school, and although interesting, learning about how women lived between 1650-1750 gets old really fast.

I do not feel there's a need to argue the importance of women in history, no one's writing any books about how great chairs are for sitting, it's understood. Of course no society could develop and function without women and all of the very important things they do, to me thats a given.

Mystery (Bubba Mabry Mysteries)","review":"It is such a pleasure to read a mystery where the protagonist isn't a super hero. In fact, Bubba Mabry is probably the antithesis of a super hero. Steve Brewer's characters and scenes get better and better with each story. There were occasions when I stopped and went back just to read his description of a particular character, because that description was so enjoyable. Read his description of Melvin Haywood on page 2 and you'll get the picture. Brewer's characteristic humour presents itself once again in Crazy Love. Bubba is his usual funny self, and Bubba's father, Dub, is the perfect foil to bring out the worst in his son. The scenes with Bubba and Dub are priceless. I recommend any of Brewer's books.

Mystery (Bubba Mabry Mysteries)","review":"Do you like your mystery detectives to be human? Are you tired of the too tough to care detective? Bored with the detective that can tell a persons past by the lisp of their s and the limp of their leg? If so, then let me introduce you to Bubba Mabry. Bubba is the star of the novel, Crazy Love, the sixth book in a series of excellent mystery novels by Steve Brewer. Born and raised in Mississippi, transplanted to Albuquerque by the Air Force, Bubba is a private investigator working hard and usually scraping bottom. He is not the tough as nails, super confident type of PI that spits blood casually at the feet of thugs beating him, but instead takes his licks and deals with them like a real person: He bleeds, bruises, and takes aspirin to help with the swelling.In &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, Bubba gets into one of his typical situations. He isn't getting much work, and rather than allowing his wife to support him, he takes on an odd case, the client that wants to find out with whom his dead wife had an affair. Things seem to move toward a quick conclusion of the case when suddenly the suspected lothario is dead, Bubba's client is the key suspect, Bubba is viewed as a potential accomplice, and the client disappears. Ever faithful to his client, Bubba tries to find out who the real murderer is. Getting in his way is a happy widow, a bruising hulk, another case with a demanding client, and Bubba having to deal with his jealousy of his wife working long nights with a handsome new coworker and his parents dropping by from out of town. He is sucked further into the quagmire finding himself in jail for attempted murder, being fired from a case, and his wife angry at him for his jealous accusations. How does he resolve it all? As only Bubba can.If you enjoy a good twisted plot mystery, a likeable detective, and hours of good reading, pick up Crazy Love by Steve Brewer. While you're at it, pick up any of the other titles by Brewer, they are all very enjoyable.Think Elvis is dead? Then perhaps you should start with Lonely Street, the first Bubba Mabry mystery."},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water: A Father Dowling Mystery","review":"This is the first of the series I've read, and I'm rather pleased.

What makes this book unique is his approach to how he thinks about accumulating wealth and about having money work for the earner. \\"Poor Dad\\" accepts the notion that he will never be rich and thinks that \\"money doesn't matter.\\" \\"Rich Dad\\" thinks that \\"money is power.\\" This book is just for teens! Most teens are not educated in good financial habits by their parents, and certainly don't learn them in school - especially when so many school systems are nearly bankrupt! It's never too early to learn the methods of managing money intelligently, and even young people can learn how to make their money work for them. Thinking rich pays big, and if started at a young age - wow - think of the compounding interest!If you are giving this book to a teen, I can really recommend some others that are just as special and very good with teens:Kiyosaki has something in common with Horatio Alger, as Alger's books - novels of rags to riches - were very much like the effect one has reading a RDPD book. Not only uplifting, (all Alger's books are uplifting and very powerful in that way and written about and for young people - thou adults love them as well!), but Alger always explained in his novels HOW a person was successful, (even down to the math), and these were more than principles, but examples that someone could duplicate in a different business and move forward, succeed and prosper. Kiyosaki does the same in his books, and I would recommend you read all the books by all of these authors.The Cash Boy: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Driven from Home: Carl Crawford's ExperienceThe Errand Boy: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Frank's Campaign: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Luke Walton: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!"},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"Product 2\\"x 2\\" in size.

The idea was interesting and novel at first, but lately it's been ghost-written junk.The \\"Teens\\" book is a total waste: I thought I'd give it a chance because it was affordable and I thought the gearing towards teens might make it useful for my kids; it arrived today and I was shocked -- the book is literally about 3 inches wide by 3 inches tall (less than the size of two Tic Tac boxes put together). In total, there must be about 10 \\"real\\" pages within its miniature 124 pages. What a rip off.I'm getting sick of seeing this guy in newspaper ads, magazines (he used to \\"write\\" a monthly for Entrepreneur Magazine, but his columns soon deteriorated to a few inches of writing, next to a giant picture of himself, so they cut him out.Robert Kiyosaki has become lazy and derivative.

It's concise and to the point. My only reservation is that I've never been a fan of mini-books and how challenging they are to read. Kiyosaki's breakdown between how rich dads and poor dad's see wealth in a different (and mutually exclusive) fashion was illuminating. That he defines what money is for and how we should see it instructed further. This should capture the imagination of most teens. The story of Robert's first job at the store as a child was inspirational. The comic book library that he and friend created should resonate with most kids who could well apply the concept to renting video games. This portended how Kiyosaki, an average guy, was able to become a great and wealthy man. Practically all of us wish we could be as successful as he is. The advice he provides is pretty basic but very sound."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"The book arrived in excellent shape and in a timly manner.

Anyone with teenagers knows kids are all about themselves at this age, so this approach really seemed to strike a chord. The kids could relate.This is an excellent place for kids to start, but keep in mind that after the book has been read through, that's all you've done - start. You've peaked their interest. Without some sort of follow through and guidance, kids probably won't know where to go from here.If you want to introduce your teens to some of the inspirational ideas in Rich Dad Poor Dad, if you want to get them thinking about who they are, what there strengths are and get them started thinking about money, assets vs liabilities, saving vs investing, etc., this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"I was surprised by the size of the book...it looks like a large book in the photo, but is actually about the size of a deck of playing cards.I was unpleasantly surprised to have been \\"played\\" by Amazon, as I would have made another purchase if I had known it was not a normal sized book."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"this is a good book that I will give to my sons as a present and require them to read .."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"Right on the money (pun intended).Nothing that will hurt or offend anybody.Limits his advice to abstinence, nothing that will get a youngster into tight situations or lead to immoral means for getting her or him out of it.Recommended for church and home."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"This is a waste of money!

I love it!!! Thanks Robert!"},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to the how and why of finance. Author Robert T. Kiyosaki has written this short book in clear concise language that cannot be misunderstood by the teen in your family. At the outset, Kiyosaki puts the young reader at ease by talking about the myth of IQ and intelligence. He immediately erases any thoughts of \\"I am not smart enough to understand this book\\". Once again, as in his previous books, Kiyosaki emphasizes how the rich think differently from those who are in the middle and poor class. Rich Dad Poor Dad For Teens is an easy to read 'think positive about finances' book for young people. Included is a two-page glossary that proved to be very helpful to the young teen (age 15) who read this book after I did.In this day and age of consumer greed and high end designer clothing for teens, there is a chapter that addresses Stretching the Dollar. Kiyosaki does not say be frugal, instead he advices the teen to think of ways to recycle old clothing, how to buy in bulk, etc. I was particularly impressed with a revealing exercise under the heading of The People Whom You Spend Your Time with Are Your Future . Now that can be scary--but what a powerful statement. I had earlier talks with my young friend concerning this very subject. Reading and discussing Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens together gave us the opportunity to delve into this troubling issue again, this time with very positive results. He walked away feeling good about himself.I recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School! This book can definitely help teens to accept and understand financial responsibility.Vannie(~.~)Work & Family @ BellaOnline.comhttp://www.bellaonline.com/Site/workandfamily"},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"I'm fourteen and I've read four of Kiyosaki's books. I liked all of them, except for this one. He doesn't get into the facts about investing. Pretty much, all he says is get a job, control your spending, and invest. Save yourself $15 and buy Rich Dad Poor Dad instead."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"Despite the controversy surrounding the author, Robert Kiyosaki, I strongly feel that this particular book is still worth reading by teens, as it offers good teen-friendly advice on achieving financial headstart & freedom.Overall, his advice is also given in a straight-talk, easy-to-understand manner.In a nut shell, this particular book covers basic principles of cash flow, assets & liabilities, savings & investments, as well as spotting money-making opportunities. There is even useful information about personal learning style while developing financial intelligence.Yes, the author's published stuff to some extent may seem hyberbolic on the surface, but deep down, you can always discern some useful learning from some of his teachings. [Personally, I have encountered the author in Hawaii. Frankly, I don't like his arrogant attitude & his seemingly characteristic propensity for running circles around people who ask pertinent questions, but I do respect some of his thoughtware.]His core financial advice to teens is certainly realistic:- work to learn, not to earn;- don't work for money, make money work for you!;- play games to learn!Allow me to share this simple reading philosophy of mine: Absorb what is useful; reject what is useless; research your own experience & add what is specifically your own!"},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"The \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" series has been enormously popular on the lecture circuit and in book stores. Authors Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter have distilled a fair amount of useful financial advice using the medium of Kiyosaki's autobiographical remembrances of the lessons his two 'Dads' taught him. In brief, one father (his biological father) is a teacher who stresses education and finding a 'good' job, while his other father (actually the father of his best friend Michael) taught him how to manage money, seize opportunities, and build financial independence. Like many other self help financial books, this series has a good mix of practical advice and a fair amount of platitudes designed to give readers confidence in themselves so they will take some risks in the pursuit of their dreams.I was expecting a slightly easier to read version of the same message from this book. My wife asked that I skim it to see if it was appropriate for her grandchild. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that this book was not just a easier to read version of the original 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad.' Instead, Kiyosaki and Lechter have moved beyond the usual boundaries of the financial self help guide to discuss multiple intelligences and (surprise) the value of education in all its forms. Of course, the best of the advice found in 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' is repeated here as well. You should buy assets, not liabilities. Debt is a tool for developing assets, not means to purchase the latest gizmo that you absolutely have to have right now. But the authors also talk extensively about Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences. They correctly recognize that kids (indeed, all of us) have certain innate intelligences not all of which are developed in a traditional classroom setting. They encourage young people to develop and use their own talents and gifts in pursuit of a financial education. They rightly remind their readers that all of them are born geniuses.In conclusion I liked this book considerably more than the original volume of the 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' series. In that volume, Kiyosaki concluded that he learned from both of his Dads, but the Rich Dad gets a far more positive portrayal. The teacher father comes up short in many ways. But in this book, education is correctly seen as one form of wealth. It is not the only form, despite what many of my colleagues in the teaching profession might say. But it is one form. A life with great books and music is also wealth. And so is financial independence. Indeed, without the latter, it is difficult to appreciate the former. And I think the authors give both forms of wealth their due in this book. That is a good message for teens to read."},{"Title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!","review":"With all of the 1 star reviews saying this book is a tiny piece of fluff, I thought I would point out a couple facts. There are two versions of this book. One is a miniature version and is ABRIDGED. The other is a full size book with all of the benefits of an UNABRIDGED book.

Maybe I am sensitive to education and what it means, but I certainly don't want to give anyone \`permission' to not study.

He just writes a brief introduction. His name is used because he is famous, and the title plays off his \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". The actual contents of the book are chapters by various technologists, speculating on the future, as written in 1990-1. Given that this is now 2006, you can read the book as a retrospective, for an assessment of how accurate they were, in just projecting forward 9 or so years.The most striking feature is how the concept of browsing is not that prominent.

First of all,the 300 pages is very misleading as there is only one saying per page,where there is plenty of space for 10 per page,or 3,000 in all.This would be more comparable to other books of this nature.The pages are not even numbered,nor is there even an index.I suppose one can thumb through the book ,like picking little papers from a bowl with each having a saying on it.There is no rhyme or reason to the order.For instance,a page with \\"\\"Therapists are expensive friends\\" is followed on the next page by, \\"The biggest lie on the planet:\\"When I get what I want I will be happy.\\";and the next page.\\"God doesn't make faulty products.\\" As I said,no order or connection.So to answer the question ,I would have to say this book seems to be just cranked out;and for the same money,one can find a much better book of sayings for the same or less money."},{"Title":"Think Big: A Think Collection","review":"Everything is ok!

How bout this one, \\"The only thing we 'have to' is we have to die when the time comes and we have to live until the day we die\\". Very inspirational, I guess. But I require something more full-proof to totally believe in it. We HAVE TO pay taxes. We HAVE TO eat, therefore we HAVE TO work. I read many self-help books because I need alot of help, personally, and this was by far the worst one. What does the author hope to accomplish by giving us a bunch of quotes. We will never remember all of them. The only way to remember each one is if there is a story attached to each of them. That is why I recommend Wayne Dyer's Wisdom of the Ages if you want something more meaningful. Again, not everything in that book will be accepted by everyone, but at least you will be able to remember the ones you do treasure."},{"Title":"So-- What's a Tutor to Do?","review":"My chief problem with this book is how the author seems obsessed with protecting the child's self-esteem from failure and \\"peer review.\\" Self-esteem is her destination, not literacy. Roller, if youre reading this, the kid already knows he's a loser-frog, and his peers merely confirm his beliefs. As if the need for a tutor doesnt get the idea across with a bull-horn and searchlights. Competence takes care of self-esteem. Teach a kid how to spell the 50 most common words, and his problem is half-whupped. Increase his vocabulary to the 3000 most common words, and he's good to go 98 to 99 percent of the time....for life.

The takeaway for me was what it's like to be immersed in the devastation of attack; there are marvelous descriptions of behaviors of many different types of people. The book is free of the author's telling what is happening; his characters show. Without saying so, Maxwell points out that the Blitz of 1941 wasn't the last.This book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Sugar Mile","review":"Full disclosure: I took a workshop with Glyn Maxwell and found him to be a thoroughly pleasant and extremely interesting, surprising person.

The story is told in a series of individual poems by individual characters. Each character's story is told in a different style and meter.I bought this book based on an interview I heard with the author.

One learns of the relevance for life that he has attained only through experience, and sometimes hardship, in his many years and roles. Of particular importance to me was his time spent in Japan shortly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945 -- to see the mass destruction from the eyes of a Native American and learn of the compassion that can surface even in the midst of ruin and death was a compellling chapter. But there are lighter moments too, as Axtell speaks of his grandmother and her sense of humor. Unlike other &quot;spiritual guidance&quot; books, this work does not judge, beguile, or confront the reader. It's a friendly and open invitation to learn how the trail of one's life can shape a person's soul. And despite challenges such as racism, ignorance, and family conflicts, dignity and courage can still be earned."},{"Title":"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations with a Nez Perce Elder","review":"I purchased this book because I had the privilege of seeing Horace Axtell on several occasions, and because I am a firm believer in the need to record oral traditions. (I have done so through the Montana Historical Society, obtaining an interview for them with my friend, mentor, and former chair of the Native American Studies Departments at the University of Montana and Montana State University.) As with all oral history, to really \\"learn\\" one must \\"listen,\\" not read, the stories and recollections. Perhaps co-author Margo Aragon, or the Idaho Historical Society, have the recordings and can some day make them available. In the mean time we have the transcript that we can \\"read.\\"Let me be clear, \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder\\" will not appeal to many readers for several reasons. One, the book retains the \\"English as a second language\\" syntax (sentence structure) that Horace Axtell uses. Second, the \\"deep meaning\\" of what is being told can easily be missed and/or lost in the stories repetitiveness inherent to Native American speech. Third, while one learns much about Horace Axtell, a Nez Perce elder that I personally respect, the reader does not garner much \\"cultural\\" or \\"historical\\" information about the Nez Perce from the book. Granted, the reader can sense the sincere reverence Horace Axtell has for his Nez Perce traditions, but details are politely left unsaid. Fourth, Horace Axtell tells it as he sees it--which I personally like--which may be offensive or \\"boring\\" to some readers. Keep in mind, this is not a biography, a history, an ethnography, or a novel. If you can do that, then \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder\\" may be something to look into.I have rated the book four stars because I feel the book, by the very nature of it's content, cannot adequately convey in words that which must be oral. Moreover, if I did not have two advanced degrees in Native American Studies, if I had not taught Native American Studies, if I had not spent years studying the Nez Perce, and if I did not have what I hope is a fairly reasonable understanding of various Native American cultural ways, I am unsure if I would have enjoyed the book. Then, again, I may be overly jaded in my perspectives, having encountered so many individuals who either think they \\"know\\" everything about Native Americans or hold overt and/or covert prejudices--many to the point of oblivious bigotry.On the other hand, if you love listening to your \\"grandparents\\" or elders tell stories and their own recollections, \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder\\" well could be your \\"cup of tea.\\" And, there is in deed wisdom to be uncovered. As I think Horace Axtell would put it, we all can learn if something is told us in the right way; and what each person learns may be different from another person. AND, each time we read \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder,\\" we may learn or put to mind a different understanding than before.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

Bashing it, rather.Life, I would agree, consists of memorable segments and reflection upon them. Everything between is lost in the 'Gulf' as he so subtlely suggests. These moments contribute to an overall impression, in this case plummetting to the essence of the main character. The essential Raife exists, as much as in dreams as in reality, both real and unreal, here and there, flying away at the end. Skyward.

Cassidy and Sullivan team up to look into the kidnapping - she's an anthroplogist Foxwoman, he's a Guth werewolf from Ireland. Neither ever thought their mate would be each other.We learn a bit about the world of the Others and get a steamy relationship to get us there.

The Others are non-human races; vampires, werewolves, witches etc. Before the important meeting takes place, the tantalizing scent of honeysuckle has Quinn distracted and searching for its source. He can't fight his desire for the sweet scent and he abruptly leaves to find it.Cassidy, a werefox, is taking a break from the meeting when she hears growling. She turns to find Quinn hiding in the shadows staring at her. Cassidy runs and Quinn chases, each shifting in to their Other forms. She manages to get away but she ends up coming face to face with Quinn again soon after, when she is brought unwillingly to the Council's emergency meeting.The mistress of a very powerful vampire has been kidnapped and the group thought to have taken her, The Light of Truth, could expose the Others to the humans now. The Council decides that, because Cassidy is an anthropologist, her extensive knowledge of human culture will be useful in finding more information about The Light Of Truth. She will be working closely along side Quinn as well. Right away Quinn and Cassidy's relationship becomes intimate.It's a race against time for Cassidy and Quinn to find the ones responsible for the kidnapping and to stop their evil plans before the Others are exposed and Cassidy's loved ones are harmed as well.Wolf At The Door is jam-packed with mystery, thrills and it's full of fascinating characters. Quinn is incredibly sexy and Cassidy is strong and intelligent. Their passion is scorching! This story draws you in with a familiar time and setting and then it's blended with an edge of the supernatural. Christine Warren does paranormal stories so well, and Wolf At The Door is no exception. This new series is proving to be a very entertaining and exciting one!NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"While this novel can be read as a stand-alone book, much of the background and characters are not well fleshed out as they have their own stories in the authors \\"Fixed\\" series of eBooks published by Ellora's Cave.If you prefer not to start in the middle of a series, I highly recommend you download the other stories first. Book 5 of the Fixed series - Fur For All - is Rafeael De Santos and Tess' story."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"As a whole, I like this book. The characters could have used some more development to bring about more depth. They were what I would call sufficient, but they would have been stunning had they been better developed. The plot was predictable. The theme of supernatural beings on the verge of being discovered by humans is quite popular in this genre at the moment. If you're looking for a book with some intense \\"romantic moments\\" between total strangers who are in touch with their inner beasts this may be the book for you. There is a rush and lack of details about this book that make it seem more like an expanded short story than an actual novel. I pre-ordered the next novel in the series."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I thought this book started off great. Quinn and Cassidy were both interesting characters and their romance was sweet. Quinn is a werewolf visiting from overseas. Cassidy is a foxwoman with magical abilities that allows her to turn into a fox. There are a strange group of people that are trying to expose/capture the Others (werewolves, vampires, fae, etc.) and Quinn and Cassidy have to work together to prevent them.Okay, here's my problem. Yes, the romance part of the story was fine, but everything else BIT, royally! The problem, regardless of the severity of the situation, was given a backburnner (I'm not talking--simply moved over, I'm talking it was moved like an entire state over) The zealots were hardly mentioned. The work Cassidy and Quinn were suppose to be working on was allowed one chapter and then other work was mentioned in passing but never discussed. Then the end was tide up neat and tidy like a bow with no climax. Of course, everything simply fell into place with no effort from the characters. A huge let down for a reader that perfers suspense and action."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I really enjoyed Christine's book. It ranks quite high in the slew of paranormals out there. The one thing I thought that made it stand out for me was the hero, Sullivan Quinn. I'm not usually a sucker for a paranormal hero, but prefer to read about kick-ass heroines, but Quinn did it for me. Sexy and Irish, need I say more. He was just alpha enough to stir my loins and sensitive man to stir my heart. Great characterization Ms. Warren! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I was looking forward to reading this. I was told it presented a completely unique and compelling view of lycanthropy and werewolves. That much was true. However, there is very little real story here. Most of the book is eroticism, but it's not even provocative eroticism. Granted, there are none of the tired cliches found in the more pornographic adult books, there is also none of the raw power and pure understanding of the human psyche found in D. H. Lawrence or Emmanuelle Arsan. The erotic scenes are long, drawn-out, and completely unnecessary. They take up nearly a third of the book and add nothing to the reader's understanding of either the characters or the current crisis they find themselves in.It's not science fiction. It's not modern gothic fiction. It's not even erotic fiction. So what is it? It is nearly a hundred thousand words in search of a story to tell. The great tragedy is that Christine Warren has created some truly unique, multi-dimensional characters in her two leads (Sullivan Quinn and Cassidy Poe), so much so that if these two had a real story to move through, I could easily forgive the shallow, plastic feel of everyone else in the book. Unfortunately, at the end of the day there are only these two characters still in search of a story to tell."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I am a big fan of Paranormal & Erotic Romance, I love authors like Lora Leigh, Christine Feehan, Sherrilyn Kenyon, J.R. Ward, Rebecca York, Lynsay Sands, and Karen Marie Moning. With my taste in mind I will say that this was a very good book. I enjoyed the world the author created, the H/H were fun characters, and I look forward to reading the next book in \\"The Others\\" series. We were introduced to a lot of secondary characters that I had a bit of trouble keeping straight being as though they all had different talents. We meet Vampires, shifters (fox, jaguar, bear, werewolf, ect.) demons, witches, voodoo priestesses and on, and on. There was also a lot of politics, council meetings and a major disagreement on whether or not the \\"Others\\" should \\"go public\\" and reveal themselves to Humans. I would have enjoyed this book more if the author spent more time developing the story between the H/H instead of introducing so many characters and filling the story with so much political hoopla. But, really, it was a good book. I'm intrigued but not panting in wait for the next installment. Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I am so disappointed! I have never not finished a book if I have paid money for it, but I just could not make myself finsih this book. I did not care what happened to the characters. I did not care if they solved the mystery. After starting and stopping several times, I finally decided to leave it alone. If you like a plot driven mostly by sex, then you might like this book more than I did. I am assuming that the series must get better since there are so many of them, but I am not willing to take the chance."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"Cassidy Poe simply wants to live her life; and that means, for her, teaching anthropology, not displeasing her grandmother any more than she has to in order to remain sane, and once in a while turning into a fox. Romance would be nice, but it's not a top priority, especially since Grandma Adele would never approve of most interesting men. All it takes is one night to turn Cassidy's world on its ear. First, she has a close encounter with a lupine ambassador, then, is called before the High Council of Others' Inner Circle and pressed into service. Moreover, her werewolf \\"friend\\" is as well. It seems that a group called the Light of Truth wants to expose the Others, the fairies, the shifters, witches, vampires, etc, and is willing to resort to violence to see that it happens, thus sparking witch hunts and other killing sprees aimed at anyone more than human. To preserve the way their lives have been for centuries, Cassidy and the werewolf guth, Sullivan Quinn, have to work together. That part is not difficult, since they are falling in love. The hard part might be staying alive and keeping their families that way, too.Fascinating characters populate Ms. Warren's new world. Exploring it in upcoming books should be a treat, judging by this initial volume.Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"Another race exists outside of humans- the Others, populated by a variety of supernatural beings....Sullivan Quinn is determined to get the Council of Others to listen to him. Little does he expect a scent to derail him... but the honeysuckle smell is irresistible to his werewolf nose. He follows the scent and finds Cassidy Poe, a Foxwoman and granddaughter of the most formidable Council member. There's no way Cassidy's grandmother will approve a mating between a werewolf and her Cassidy but bigger problems have come up. A group is stalking the Others and is willing to do anything to expose them... anything, including murder. Can Cassidy and Quinn work together to save the Others?Christine Warren combines romance, suspense, and the paranormal together in the prefect blend. The mystery of this story was an added bonus. The relationship between Cassidy and Quinn happens almost instantaneously and then over the course of the book develops into something lasting as these two realize the power of a true mating.I really like the idea of a society of Others with their own governing body. It will be interesting to see how this concept develops in the future books but Christine Warren is certainly off to a good start with WOLF AT THE DOOR. The villains found in the Light of Truth (aka as the Lightheads) aren't as well developed as the Council itself, but the storyline still seems fresh even upon a second reading two years after the initial publishing date of WOLF AT THE DOOR.Christine Warren shows a true flair for world building in WOLF AT THE DOOR. The power of this story isn't necessarily in the individual characters but rather in the overall creation of a hidden society of Others. I look forward to more tales featuring the Others as WOLF AT THE DOOR is an excellent start to the series!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"Kept me interested all the way through.

I really disliked the hero who seems so obsessed with the way the heroine smells that he rants on about it at length. This was particularly bad, because the narrator is female and his voice sounds awful and boorish. The Heroine who is a fox-shifter, runs from the creepy hero, only to be caught of course. The hero is somewhat on the crude side, his mental dialog containing his desire to F*** the owner of the delicious Honeysuckle smell he finds at a party.I just couldn't get into this and gave up.

She makes a good effort at keeping her distance, but who could resist a charmingly handsome wolf who would do anything for his mate. They were both great together and I could really feel the chemistry coming off the pages.This story had some action in it as well and a bit of a mystery.

I thought this was the first in the series. But no, it's the 4th. I'm going back to read the 1st! Of course, I also read the 6th before realizing this, so I'm all mixed up. Please note that if there were any inconsistencies that I noticed, it's probably due to coming in to the stories in the middle of the series. I can't change what I said because it was how I felt. It also proves that you should start at the beginning of every series! Bummer, I know. I can't believe I messed up! Ugh]My review:It took a while for me to get in to the book. Even the initial contact between the two main characters kind of bothered me. Quinn seemed really stalker-ish. Given enough time, I found that not to be the case, but that initial feeling was uncomfortable.I felt that plot took a distant second place after a while. Or maybe I misunderstood the plot. Which is very possible! They have to find who is trying to \\"out\\" the Others before they do, and it felt slow getting to the finding part. In fact, I don't even know if they did find the who/what. They found the root cause, just not the who/what [does that make sense? you're probably staring at this thinking \\"what the hell are you talking about crazy:]. wAt this point, I keep telling myself.. who cares? They got to the root of it, what more do you need? But I felt like this whole time I wanted to know who the puppet was and I all I got was a sort of puppeteer. Maybe I need to re-read the last few pages to make sure I'm not being an idiot.I did something really weird with this book though. I stopped reading it for about a month at the very end... What?! Who does that? I think I was in a reading slump and I just was hung up on the root cause and who the Light of Truth that's trying to expose them is, and the fact that I didn't understand what was going on. Once again, my problem. I'm sure Christine Warren explained it perfectly for the non-challenged people.The only honest and true complaint I have is that the resolution to the conflict of exposure ended too suddenly for it to be normal. But the ending for me is huge. I understand the need for the fluff at the end, but nothing is wrapped up in neat little packages in real life, and I just feel that books should portray that sometimes [yes... i know it's not real, but for it to be relatively believable even in a fictional world, I don't like neat endings--that's one reason I hate chick flicks:].OKAY! That was the bad.. Here's the good:Christine Warren's writing was great! Most of it flowed together flawlessly [I say mostly, because as with all books, some sentences had to be re-read several times to understand what she was saying:]. Their romance, though it had a rough start... a really awkward rough start, it was believable. Some parts were fluffed, but whatever. I could believe that they actually had a connection to each other. Their foreplay and/or sexual encounters were.... awesome! :D Very blush worthy if someone catches you reading those pages. ;)-Another really neat thing she did was that she didn't make Quinn an Alpha. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Alphas [mmmmmmm:]. But he didn't need to be an Alpha to be dominant. He also had a great and unique role in his pack that I haven't heard of before. I think it might have been too much, so that was a perfect decision made by Christine Warren.Ratings:1. Cover +12. Hooked: +.53. Finished the book: +14. Overall Feeling: meh: +15. Re-readability: +.5--might skim through6. Suggest to others: +17. Lost time: ... not really +18. Readability: +1Looks like it's a 7 out of 10. Which makes me happy that I have my rating system. I would have felt that after the month of a break [from all books really:] that I should rate it lower."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"This was ok but not great.

See Quinn smell Cassidy, See Quinn chase Cassidy, See Cassidy Run. This couple is very endearing and Warren doesn't let them wallow in the pitfalls that so many h/h types get bogged down in. She introduces the conflicts for them not having an easy time, but allows the couple to overcome them without a lot of unnecessary angst. So we're different species... so we're both breaking with tradition.. we're hot for each other and that's all that counts, right?The prose was witty and made me chuckle out loud on more than a few occasions. However, long on plot, this one isn't. The story is good, the conflict between good and evil interesting but quite predictable.How you find the appeal of this book will be based soley on what you're looking for. If you want a good story, sympathetic h/h, colorful secondaries and a chase scene that had me grinning and \\"Arrrroooooooooo\\" ing in applause, then you will NOT be disappointed.This one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"After taking a while to get into Christine's book I started to enjoy it. Christine had a taken a Were-Fox and a Wer-wolf and teamed them up into an interesting concept about The Others and The Humans. I always wondered how the intro of fantastical humans and beings to the everday Humans would appear,and maybe this new series will explore this concept. Bravo Christine, nice intro to a new series. Her new book called She's No Fairie Princess sounds really cute to, and I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it is not one that will end up on the keeper shelf. The series has a lot of promise and I will check out her next book, if just to watch her grow as an author. Here is what I liked...the lead protagonist were witty, lighthearted and fun. I wish that there was more plot development and tension built between the protagonists. Yes I get that it is hard to resist the built in ease of 'mating heat' so to speak, but really the story is so much better when the tension builds over the length of the novel. Other than that, the love scenes were hot, the banter witty. It is worth a read just for kicks and I think this author has potential."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"As another reviewer said, there is definately nothing new here. What's worse is that Warren may actually turn some people off to the genre with the disappearing/reappearing accents, the errors (at one point in the beginning of the book the heroine's parents are describe as both being shifters, later she goes on and on about her human father), the lackluster characters and the skimpy world building. I've read a couple of Warren's e-books and they weren't much better but at least they were cheaper!"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"The beginning was fun, with the rooftop chase scene, but soon after the first sex scene, which occurred about 1/4th of the way into the book, it became a snoozer. Boring.And some of the lines were just dumb:There is a statement about humans evolving from Vikings to Crusaders to missile-defense fanatics. Huh? There is no difference in these three behaviors. And the time span is not even a drop in the bucket on an evolutionary scale.Quinn is thinking to himself that he wants to get to know Cassidy -- her favorite color and whether she likes Thai food. Excuse me while my eyes roll away. No way would Quinn give a snap about color!In another section, Cassidy's grandmother says, \\"You regularly lecture to a class of 500.\\" Um...nope. Not at Columbia University, and certainly not anthropology classes. Maybe 250, at most, in those classes.When Warren does write something clever, like the reference to Edgar Allen Poe, she hits us over the head with it. Quinn made himself pretty clear -- even not having heard of the poem, I caught on -- without Cassidy reflecting that she was glad he got the reference to one of her favorite poems, \\"The Bells.\\" (It's like with jokes. Don't explain.)Then after sex, Quinn says, \\"Jesus wept.\\" which felt totally out of left field. Bizarre.I don't care for religious cussing either, by the way, which occurred elsewhere in the book, but not too often.I have read three of her books. Bottom line, the sex scenes are the best part of her books, but even good sex gets boring, after the nth page. As a long-time romance reader, I protest. Why can't we have it all? One sizzling or tender love scene, maybe two, and a satisfying story, with carefully considered dialogue, consistency in characterization, and an absorbing plot."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"A religious cult known as the Light of Truth is after the paranormal community. They want to expose vampires, werewolves, and other non-humans for the monsters they believe them to be, but are they really monsters? The Others have blended in well with the humans, but members of the cult will stop at nothing to succeed, even if it means killing another human. So far, the group has remained in Europe, but investigating the kidnapping of a human tied to the paranormal community reveals the group is now operating in New York City.Sullivan Quinn, an Irish werewolf, is an ambassador of his pack. He's in New York because some of the Others wish to come out of the closet. Though he doesn't believe this is a good idea, the cult group is about to expose them. Problem is he's having a heck of a time staying focused on the issue at hand. There's a sexy little foxwoman with an enticing scent.Cassidy Poe, the foxwoman Quinn is so hot after, has resisted following the path of her parents and grandmother by staying away from politics, but she's been given little choice. The Council needs her expertise to hunt out and find the group of humans who are threatening to expose them. This means, she'll be working closely with Quinn. As things heat up between the two, both are a bit distracted and aren't aware that Cassie is now a target for the powerful force behind the cult.A couple of things kept me from love-loving this book. One was that Cassie was so naive about werewolves being possessive, mating for life, etc. Same goes for Quinn. Maybe I've been reading this genre too long, because I think the characters should be catching on a bit quicker.Mostly what I loved were the characters, even though Cassie was a bit slow in the mating department. The sizzle between the two was there from the very beginning and isn't that one of the main reasons readers love this genre? It is for me."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I have been a fan of Christine Warren's for a while now, having read her e-books at Ellora's Cave where the world of \\"The Others\\" started. \\"Fur Factor\\" is still an absolute favorites of mine! The Others are basically the paranormal folk that live and work right next to you (weres, vampires, witches, etc.), but the general population is, at yet, unaware. The time is coming however that The Others are going to be exposed and the Council of Others is trying to work out the best way to do that while causing the least amount of upheaval for all concerned. This story revolves around Quinn Sullivan, a werewolf and council member from Ireland who has come to sit in on the meeting. Cassidy Poe is a foxwoman, one of the last of her kind, and the granddaughter of one of the leading council members. They might be different species, but a wolf knows his mate, when he scents her.This story was a little slow to get started and I must say that out of the mainstream stories of The Others, I enjoyed \\"She's No Faerie Princess\\" and \\"The Demon You Know\\" (I haven't gotten to read \\"Howl at the Moon\\" yet) much better than this one, but on the whole, I love this series. Miss Warren has an irreverent writing style. Her characters are fun, and funny, and real people. If you're looking for a serious werewolf, or more traditional science-fiction type paranormal story, this is not the one for you. If you enjoy a more fun approach, similar to the Argeneau vampire family from Lydsay Sands, you will enjoy this series."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It was hard to get to the middle without thinking - when is something going to happen. The characters were great - I loved the Irish werewolf and the fact that all the Others \\"got along\\" in a para-society. But it was not until the very end of the book that I thought \\"wow - now something is happening.\\" Great ending but hard to start."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"This novel tinkers with the shapeshifter/paranormal formula by adding the characters of Foxwomen. Their heritage is slightly different than the were-animals and that blend of two backgrounds weaken the story slightly. The male lead, Sullivan Quinn, is well drawn with a strong background as an educateddiplomat and his presence greatly enhances the book. The female lead, Cassidy Poe, foxwoman is good, but not quite the match we would want for such a good male character. Still this is a good read enriched with an interesting thrill chase at the end."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"STORY BRIEF:This is the first of a series, eight books so far. \\"Others\\" is the term for creatures including werefolk, vampires, witches, and magic-users. The Others live in secret among humans. Cassidy is a foxwoman (fox shifter) who teaches anthropology at a college. Her grandmother is a member of the Council of Others, the international governing body. Quinn is a werewolf (shifter) from Ireland. He comes to New York City to attend a meeting of the Council of Others. While at the first meeting, he smells a honeysuckle fragrance which happens to be Cassidy's scent. He knows this is the scent of his life mate. The Council meets the next day to decide what to do about a religious fanatical group called Light of Truth. This group wants to destroy the Others and kidnaps one of them. The council leaders assign Quinn to work with Cassidy to learn more about this group. He's happy about the assignment, she's not.REVIEWER'S OPINION:The first 100 pages were great! I especially loved the first 30 pages. Quinn had not yet met Cassidy but is drawn to her smell and follows it. When he finally sees her, she runs, he chases, and the two of them shift back and forth between their animal and human forms as the chase continues. It might be worth buying the book just for the first 100 pages. There were some good lines. I was chuckling. I enjoyed Cassidy's frustrations and conversations. But after that, the story became ordinary. It needed more interesting plot and character development. The bad guys kidnap good guys. The good guys try to find the bad guys and stop them. I wish the author would have continued with the freshness of the first part. One of the sex scenes dragged a bit, could have been shortened.I was disappointed with the ending climax. The bad guys were more powerful than the good guys, then all of a sudden the good guys found some power and won. I was shaking my head thinking how did that happen?DATA:Story length: 336 pages. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: 3. Total number of sex scene pages: 24. Setting: current day mostly New York City, NY.

He does not know much about this dangerous group, but they are hunting down his people.Sullivan misses his home and his pack especially while listening to the drone vampire lawyer who could have been a double for Oliver Hardy; that is he yearned for Ireland until he sniffs the honeysuckle odor of an American Foxwoman. He wants her and realizes that it is more than just the heat is on as he has finally met his mate for life, world renowned anthropologist Cassidy Poe, who feels the same way about the Irishman who has entered her life. Cassidy is confused as her lust at first sight and second, third, etc. goes against her theories on social interaction, but she knows her desire for Quinn is palatable and supersedes everything. That is everything until she realizes the danger to her loved ones; she and Quinn must team up to save those they cherish because the enemy is stalking them and someone within their inner sanctum is a Quisling rat helping their deadly foes.WOLF AT THE DOOR is a terrific paranormal romantic suspense fantasy that makes believers out of the audience from the start when Sullivan fails to listen to the babble of the vampire because he sniffs the 3 F's (Femininity, fertility, and F***ability). The relationship between Sullivan and Cass is deftly developed with danger lurking everywhere and threatening not just their lives, but their love. Fans will take immense delight with this terrific thriller and want Others to star in future novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I wasn't pleased with this book. I've read all of Ms. Warren's E-Books and I have to say they have a lot more fire. She lost a lot in this book. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I started thinking \\"Did I actually buy a book this bad.\\"Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book.

Hopefully, there is light at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I liked the cover, had a gift certificate and bought this book. I started it Saturday night, finished it Sunday; for this type of book that's a SLOW read for me. I realized about 1/2 way through that if I skipped any of the obviously broadcast extremely long and detailed sex scenes I missed NONE of the story. When the romance could've been wrapped up in less than 3 pages but the author devotes over 1/2 the book to it, kinda slows a book down.The story, characters and world-building were excellent, but the book could've done with less sex and more plot and actual interaction between the characters. Felt like she was just creating a rather intersting world so the reader would be trapped into reading about 100 pages of sex."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I prefer to read a series in order, and I didn't realize that I wasn't until the \\"Big Bad Wolf\\"According to her web site, there are 4 books that in this series that haven't been published (they were written through Ellora's Cave and could have been downloaded, but they are no longer available).The actual reading order of these books are:1.

He's traveled from Ireland to America to warn the Others about a dangerous threat to all of them. Quinn should be concentrating all of his efforts on convincing the Council to work toward a resolution that will allow them to continue to live in peace among mere mortals.Cassidy Poe is an anthropologist. She's also a foxwoman, a trait that's passed down through only the women of her family. Her grandmother, Adele, is a formidable member of the Council of Others. Politics don't interest Cassidy but her skills are needed and therefore she's expected to join forces with Sullivan and attempt to uncover the whereabouts of the group calling themselves the Light of Truth.Who could possibly concentrate on the conversations of the Others also attending the gathering when there's such an intoxicating scent invading your senses? It reminds Quinn of honeysuckle. While on the prowl for the bearer of the elusive scent, Quinn is summoned to make Adele Berry's acquaintance. The dragon lady demands to know exactly what Quinn was going to say to the council of Others. The uncouth Irish were in him refuses to cave to her demands and couldn't care less if he's insulted her by his uncivilized behavior. After all there's still that trace of honeysuckle in the air and the were in him demands that he find the source.Cassidy escaped the gathering to stroll in the rooftop greenhouse before she did something completely unacceptable, like throwing her drink in a vampire's face. Her grandmother has drilled the do's and don't of socially acceptable behavior at gatherings into her since a very young age, but just because Cassidy knows how to behave doesn't mean she has to enjoy it. Cassidy had just begun to relax when she heard a growl and noticed the large lupine watching here. Of course, she does what any self-respecting fox would do when confronted by an aggressive predator - she runs, and there's nothing that wolves like better than a good game of chase.WOLF AT THE DOOR is the first book of Christine Warren's THE OTHERS series. This book is chocked full of creatures that will both fascinate and horrify you but in the end leave you clamoring for more. Cassidy and Quinn's budding relationship is intensely thrilling. In addition to burning up the sheets with their passion, they burn up the pages with the drive to uncover the source of the danger to the Others. WOLF AT THE DOOR is a fast paced tale that will draw you in from the very first page, keep you engrossed in the story right through the end, and leave you greedily anticipating the next book in the series.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"On the whole, I liked this book. I agree with some of the previous reviewers in that there are definite discrepancies (hello editors! wake up!!) and a tad more plot- and world- building, however there's enough heat and steam that these were minor and easily forgotten. Definitely the focus of the book is the relationship of the two main characters (as is to be expected) so it should come to no suprise to anyone. For certain an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","review":"I bought the ebook, which was $7.99. Kind of expensive, most of the time the ebook is a little cheaper than the paperback.

That said, I love the creativity behind the story and they are a quick read."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"...WELL WORTH THAT!Highly entertaining, debauched, funny and fast paced. But, I must admit that I figured out who the murderer was the first time that particular person's name was mentioned. It really was a fun read though. The murders themselves were so compelling and interesting that I didn't care who the murderer really was.London is the main character here and London is always richly fascinating.I had a fab time with this one!"},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"I enjoyed the half of the book I read which features wit and zany sex, and will probably read another of this author's mysteries. Still, one shouldn't know the solution to a 371 page mystery by page 195. The author might consider eliminating the innumerable redundancies--how he does go on."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"This is another triumph from Mr. Elton. He is rapidly becoming one of the best and most original crime writers around. As ever the pace of this whodunnit is unrelenting. It is almost impossible to put down from page one onwards.He has a great talent for using contemporary fads as the setting for his stories. In Dead Famous we had a murder in a Big Brother house. Here we have a series of murders linked to Friends Reunited. He manages to weave a good tale and also to satirise the craze.There is some graphic violence that might put some people off although it is not gratuitous and in many ways essential to the story.He also introduces us to a new character in DCI Newson with the tantalizing hint that there may be more. Let's hope so."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"This was my first taste of Ben Elton's work, and if his other books are half as good as this, I'm buying his entire collection. Past Mortem manages to be tender, gruesome, intriguing and hilarious all at the same time.

Be warned, once you start reading this you won't want to stop."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"I have read all of Ben Elton's previous books, have enjoyed his stand-up comedy, his play Pop Corn and his musical We will Rock You. All that stuff was great and tremendously funny! When I read this, his latest work I was really disappointed. It was truly his worst, and would recommend to anyone who has not read any of his works: Do not start with this one!Although it was witty, it was generally too far-fetched and simply very predictable. I knew how the murder mystery would evolve one third into the book.. Please Ben, stick to funny, stick to temporal fiction and your hilarious vocabulary, but stay away from murder mystery, as the genre clearly does not become you."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"I always pick 2 novels to take on my annual 2 week holiday and read one in each week ( I take my time). So this year I picked Past Mortem (along with You Are Here by Steve Horsfall). I have never read a book by Ben Elton before, but this blew me away - it's funny, touching and risque with a great comment on how the past catches us all up at some point ( centred in this case around the Friends Reunited phenomenom). The whodunnit leaves you guessing to the end. I read it in 2 days ( and You Are Here in 3). I'll need to buy more books next year!!!"},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"I've read and enjoyed a number of Ben Elton's works, and I don't feel this to be one of his better ones.Elton tends to take a particular social or environmental issue, and then uses a story to barrage the reader with his trendy and enlightened perspective. Usually he gets away with this - his stories can make a rollicking good read, and the underlying social commentary can be stimulating and thought-provoking.But in this book I was bored. The social issue he's taken on is bullying, and I really don't need to be told the bleeding obvious - bullying is bad, it's effects are long-lasting, and we should all feel guilty because at one point we watched it happen to someone else and didn't do anything. OK, I get the point Ben, you can stop repeating it. I enjoy it more when he tackles the genuinely contentious issues - \\"High Society\\" being my definite favourite.It isn't a great whodunnit either. I'm not particularly cluey with these things, but here I could pick the murderer as soon as [he or she] was introduced. The trail of bodies gets tedious when you're just waiting for the main character to figure it out.On the plus side, I enjoyed the school reunion and all of the apsects of revisiting the past. He conjured up the memories of being a teenager in the 80's very well. If he only explored that whole area more I would have had a better reading experience."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"A brilliant read - I read it in 2 sittings (and I'm not refering to the toilet).Having read all of his books (with the exception of STARK would you believe!) I continue to be engrossed in them. They all flow with the same fluid 'not reading but watching tele' ease.Past Mortem is no exception and it is truely a book you cant put down. The sex scene with Ed and Helen had me in stitches. Rather than a turn on, Elton turned it into a hilarious chapter. Ed fumbling 'oh...ok' to a rather bizzare request had me rolling!Yes, there are gruesome details but in the hands of Ben Elton those details do not so much as shock but add to the colour of the story. In any other crime writers hands, the way the murders were committed would be shocking to the point of sick.The only gripe I have about the book is the ending. It did get very predictable and you cant help but know who the killer is. There are so many clues it becomes too obvious. Infact, it becomes so obvious you begin to wonder if its actually not that character at all. The ending is also weak. The plot to catch the killer is weak and rushed. The end is over way too soon.But dont let that put you off in the slightest. Its one of his best. I do kind of miss 'wrrrick' though!"},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"Just recently I'd received Past-mortem for Christmas and only hours ago finished reading it. I didn't start reading straight away, but about a week ago, now a week has passed and I have to say it is one of the best crime fiction novels I've read. The blend of crime, sex and romance is flawless, the characters are real and the investigation draws you in and keeps you guessing right to the end. Well I managed to guess the obvious...but the obvious could be different for anybody.Edward Newson is both on the case of brutal murder as well has his lonely, uneventful life. He lives day by day trying to track down the killer whilst mulling over his junior partner he secretly love, and by night attempts to track down an old girlfriend of his youth over the internet on Friends Reunited. As the story progresses, the killer strikes again, and Edwards old class comes together, \\"old feuds and passions burn fiercely again.\\"This is not a novel for the faint heart due to the gory content and extreme sex-capades Ben Elton has added to the book. But it is an easy read, the writing driving head first into the story and not wasting time with bland description, keeping the book to 300 odd pages but 300 pages of worth while story and character development.Ben Elton is one of the finest writers of this age."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"When will America discover Ben Elton? As far as I know, none of his books have been published here and they are only available as imports. \\"Past Mortem\\" doesn't quite reach the heights of \\"Dead Famous,\\" but it's a first rate page-turner with heavy dollops of wit and style, and characters who leap off the page. If P.G. Wodehouse wrote sexy serial-killer thrillers, he might have come up with something like this. It's miles above the godawful tripe being served up by American hacks like James Patterson, whose junk stares out at us from every airport book rack."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"You can always count on a few good laugh-out-loud one-liners in a Ben Elton novel and you'll get a few from Past Mortem, but the \\"mystery\\" won't exactly keep you guessing. The killer's motivation and identity become obvious fairly early in the piece.As usual, Elton has picked an atypical hero - in this case \\"ginger shortarse\\" Ed Newsom. But, despite the fact that Ed is consistently described as funny, he's actually only given a handful of funny lines. As mentioned by a few other reviewers, the \\"bullying is bad\\" message does get repetitive and you do feel like you're getting beaten over the head with it (much like one of the unfortunate murder victims!). Also, there were a few irritating editing errors, eg \\"throws\\" instead of \\"throes\\" and one plot point that didn't seem to work - one of the murder victims is supposed to have missed meeting a friend at the pub, but then only his family turns up for his funeral and he's described as being universally hated. What happened to the friend?But these are minor quibbles. All-in-all, this is a fun enough beach/plane read."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"Ben Elton can certainly write -- but this one's a dud.If you're an Elton fan, you'll already know that his \\"formula\\" relies on taking a controversial issue, and presenting it to us sideways, through the eyes of some unforgettable characters. In previous novels, he's dealt with drugs, the environment, and traffic, (High Society, Stark, Gridlock) and they were all great reads.In this novel he slips up, because the \\"issue\\" he chooses is bullying -- which of course is an issue that no-one \\"disagrees\\" on. Unlike drugs or the environment or even driving around in cars, we all agree that bullying is bad and should be stopped. Elton has stepped away from his winning formula, and the results are substandard.Not even Elton's trademark quirky characters can save the story, his \\"socially inept but brilliant detective\\" and his \\"emotionally damaged but brilliant social worker\\" are straight from central casting.And then there's the \\"crime novel\\" format. If you haven't guessed \\"whodunnit\\" by page 130, then quite honestly you're not paying attention. Out of the twenty-two people I know who've read the novel (the members of two book groups) only one didn't guess who the serial killer was well before the end. Guessing the ending completely destroys the last half of the book, and makes finishing it a chore.I enjoy Ben Elton's work -- I'll buy his next novel if it's not another attempt at crime fiction -- but this one's a predictable and preachy bore."},{"Title":"Past Mortem","review":"I don't know much about Ben Elton, but I've read a few of his books before, including the last few detective novels. The novel about the BIG BROTHER house I've reviewed for Amazon, and this one is almost as good as the last. Technically speaking the previous book DEAD FAMOUS took more chances, was more daring in conception and in execution. And this one has, for some reason, a fisting scene in the middle of it that's explicit enough to warrant an X rating, if books still carried such, and yet all in all I prefer the present nook, if only for the charm and wit of the central romance.Edward Newson is a detective inspector for Scotland Yard, the youngest ever in such a post, even though everyone he meets doubts he's cop because, well, \\"er . . . isn't there a height restriction?\\" Apparently not, because Ed is only about five foot four, more of a Hobbit than an Inspector Morse. His second in command is a lovely police sergeant, Natasha Wilkiem whose personal life is a bit of a mess. She has a boyfriend called Lance who's not averse to beating her up a little, when he doesn't get his way. Ed doesn't know how to proceed with Natasha, who occupies all his thoughts day and night. If he says anything, he's afraid she'll laugh him down, for she's way out of his league in terms of looks and sex appeal; and also he's afraid if he leans on her, not that he would, she would have grounds to complain about him for sexual harassment. However, all of this becomes moot when Ed is assigned to what becomes the biggest case of his career.It seems that the ones getting murdered are all (or were, years ago) horrid bullies as teens. Are the victims finally striking back and torturing the bullies as they were tortured when only children? And what does the Friends Reunited web site have to do with this? Here in the US, I'm not familiar with the Friends School phenomenon which must, if the evidence of this book is to be trusted, be sweeping the country, and all old schoolmates must know now where all their fellow alumni are living and what all of them are doing. I suppose there are similar organizations and websites here in the States, but not on such a scale.Elton keeps you guessing and, despite the claims of other reviewers, the culprit is a surprise.

The killer's identity is blindingly obvious from about the middle of the book, which makes it even more annoying when Elton continues to trot out characters and make some reference to them being shady, which is clearly supposed to make us think \\"Oh, SURELY this guy must be the killer!\\" Despite this, it is a quick and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Generosity and the Limits of Authority: Shakespeare, Herbert, Milton","review":"It is difficult to know how &quot;generosity&quot; might better be investigated as a critical bellwether than by this most generous of thinkers, William Flesch, whose expansive intellect readily welcomes disparate poetical figures to a &quot;fire-warm'd lodge&quot; of his own making. Occupying a paradigmatic position vis-a-vis hedonism, Flesch challenges the privileged space of Western intellectual practice in denying the figure of the sucking vortex the power of his critical imprimatur. My friend recommended this book to me, and although I was skeptical, since, being a &quot;science&quot; man, I don't read much literary criticism, I thought *The Heart of Generosity* was really readable. The power of Flesch's overwhelming images and amazing insights into a wide variety of interesting topics mesmerized me, as it did my friends and colleagues at work."},{"Title":"El Mago De Oz / The Wizard of Oz (Spanish Edition)","review":"Un libro para regalar a algun ni&ntilde;o.

Trent, sometimes a name used for Lance Kilkenny is one of the most interesting heroes created by L'amour, perhaps the ultimate warrior-like person who could ever be created by one of the greatest authors ever lived and contributed. There is one thing that Bantam Book and L'amour's offsprings didn't do yet. They should line up the whole works of L'amour and mark the 1, 2, 3 numbers for the readers to follow. Like Sackett saga, they should tell the reader to start reading from &quot;To The Far Blue Mountain&quot;, then, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot;, then which one should be read first about Tell Sackett, Orrion, or Tyrel Sackett. Readers picking up and finising a book and found out that should come later after the other ones is so annoying and frustrated. If there is a character who would appear again and again as a certain series, the publisher and the heir of L'amour should mark them clearly. Like I've read Tell finally lost his wife, Angee, and then the next one I've picked up was Angee was still alive, because this is the one I should have read first, but without knowing it is such an annoying mixup."},{"Title":"The Rider of the Ruby Hills","review":"L'amour is always dependable for a good read with realistic people.

And the story started promising but faded toward the end with little more to like about the main characters than first described.Story goes like this, lone rider rides into town from off the plains, see's the woman he's goin' ta marry, determines the land he's goin' ta own, runs into the city-slicker and the other men he's gonna hav' ta kill and goes about takin' care of business. A formula I like really, but in other Louie L'amour books it's been done so much better.Of recent stories I've read or heard I'd suggest Crazy Man, The Lonely Men, or Mojave Crossing for a better read. Also Larry McMurtry's Commanche Moon is a good western read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Eye Against Eye","review":"A friend of mine lent me a copy of this book, and I had to buy my own copy. By far the best thing here is a sequence of poems facing b&w; photos by Sally Mann. The descriptions and the poeticizing are truly gorgeous, without being obvious on the one hand, or nebulous on the other. The effects are also pleasingly varied; the poet seems inspired, not merely seeking novelty. I'll quote one passage, as example of the haunting beauty of these poems: \\"The depicted instant: a galvanic pre-storm eclipse. On a bridge, the photographer bends, shrouded behind her tripod. As she guesses the exposure time, lightning hisses and rips so close that the air, for seconds, isn't breathable. At once, the river quicksilvers. Its surface bulks and brightens. The heft of the scene, though, and the dynamic tension flee to the margins.\\"Somewhat less successful are three longish poems rounding out the book - a disjointed meditation on Mayan ruins, a wide-ranging evocation of our distracted age aptly called \\"Present Tense,\\" and a dreamy retelling of the poet's brushing encounter with a bicycle thief in the Mission district of San Francisco. The first seems to me to err on the side of solemnity, with some questionable diction and some vague statements (\\"the exposure vesicles inward\\"; \\"The fragility of presence. A bird perched at the tip of a branch.\\" etc). The second is lovingly written, but predictably unfocused; while the last is a tad sentimental. \\"Someone and someone's grief / careen around a corner,\\" but the poet is very much himself, on vacation, as he is in the first instance perhaps. The writing is still lovely and resonant though.I've ignored thus far the prelude poem and the page fillers called \\"ligatures,\\" that in my opinion do little except to indulge in some fashionable postmodernistic poetics. Gander's gifts don't need that kind of credential, thank goodness; though it's no big deal, if it wins him more readers. (The friend who lent me this book is a real po-mo freak!) A very enjoyable book. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"A very well done story about a village pushing the boundaries of right and wrong as they struggle to survive in medieval Japan. Yoshimura's short novel transports the reader into the world of a young boy learning how to fish and help his family stay together while forces beyond his control try to tear it apart. It's a novel you won't forget."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"PUBLISHED IN JAPAN in 1982, this is the first of the prolific Yoshimura's provocative novels to appear in translation. The story spans three years in the life of a young boy (ages 9-12) living in a tiny, isolated coastal village in medieval Japan as he struggles to come of age. The village exists purely on a subsistence level, forcing many people-including the boy's father-to sell themselves as indentured laborers so that their family may eat. In his father's absence, the boy struggles to learn the tricks of fishing, and must make do with less food. Through sparse prose, the reader is shown a life of pure work, the villagers' waking hours are completely devoted to gathering food (mainly fishing for octopus, squid, sardines, and the like) or household chores-allthewhile worrying about absent family members. The villagers, who number about 200 or so, seem to accept their grim existence with stoic fortitude, with the only glimmer of hope coming during the stormy winter season.It is then that the sea every so often delivers bounty in the form of a shipwreck, providing foodstuffs, tools, and other useful items the villagers could never hope to obtain any other way. There is a dark side to these boons, however, and the karmic consequences are both inevitable and heartrending. The story slowly builds to its tragic conclusion by detailing the flow of the seasonal cycles of fishing and chores. This is pretty slow, sedate stuff, which can be annoyingly repetitive. Finally, however, when the shipwreck comes, we share in their joy at the small comforts it offers, such as rice. Soon after this, the insular village is threatened by powerful outside forces and the tension mounts. Ultimately, a tragedy occurs, one that is all the more poignant to modern readers because it is so easily prevented, but then again, the story is essentially a bleak morality tale. Altogether it's good, but not very demanding reading-kind of interesting as a period piece as it details mundane chores and customs with almost anthropological attention. I'd read another of his books, One Man's Justice, previously, and liked it a bit better."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"This book is short, to the point, and an excellent read! It concerns people who eke out a barely adequate living in a tiny village on a small rocky coast in medieval Japan. The people work very hard just to survive, but they depend on the occasional shipwreck (which they help cause) to supplement their own food supplies.We read in fascination and horror how the shipwrecks are caused, and the total lack of remorse shown by the villagers, even the youngest among them, one of whom is the protagonist. When a shipwreck comes that causes consequences that are unexpected, the novel really soars, and we watch as the village suffers for it actions. It's not a pretty book by any means, but one well worth reading."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"This exotic tale defies categorization, with its mythical quality and poetic simplicity.The setting is an isolated coastal village in medieval Japan. Just as their ancestors did, the villagers weave cloth from linden tree bark, fish for squid and saury, and trade salt and fish for grain in the nearest village on the other side of the mountains.To stave off starvation, the villagers often sell family members into indentured servitude. Only one thing can raise their lives above the level of mere subsistence: the wreck of a merchant ship on the reef just beyond their beach.So desirable is this disaster, the ancestors long ago found a way to lure unwary ships to their shores, and the villagers continue this unholy tradition.We follow the story by observing a young village boy as he learns the skills and duties of adulthood in this desolate place. The beauty of Nature and the seasons form a poignant backdrop to the struggle for survival.Crime does not go unpunished in this story. At the same time, the distinction between right and wrong is anything but clear. This is definitely a book to share with a philosophical friend."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Because of -- not in spite of -- a spare and deceptively simple writing style, Akira Yoshimura succeeds in depicting a time, place, way of living, and habit of being with extraordinary immediacy and vividness.The story itself is remarkably original (I wonder how and why Yoshimura came up with the idea), which engages the reader from the get-go and holds (indeed, increases) his interest as the story unfolds.While the novel is unquestionably complete, I think that it errs (albeit slightly) on the side of sparseness and austerity; \\"Shipwrecks\\" could have been a bit fuller and deeper. Also, while I fully appreciate the judgment upon and punishment of the villagers (who, one should note, are more desperate and delusional than evil), it's indeed a pity that the villagers don't make the connection between what they've done and the horrors they ultimately suffer. This is a mistake on Yoshimura's part, for the primary objective of chastisement is not to punish but to teach.Still, this short novel is infinitely superior to the bloated, Oprah Winfrey-approved junk that makes up the bulk of contemporary American fiction.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Well let me first say that if you must have a happy ending in your literature then I suggest you look somewhere else. Shipwrecks is the first novel that I have ever read by a japanese novelist and I was not disapointed(at the time of writing this I am reading The Samurai by Shusaku Endo and will be reviewing that soon). One of the first things that I noticed was the attention to detail that the author uses when describing the landscape the story takes place in.I won't say much else since most of these reviews give you a fairly good idea of the story, but I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for something a bit differnt."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Akira Yoshimura's novel \\"Shipwrecks\\" tells a story of a small fishing village's struggle for survival. The story, seen through the eyes of a young boy, is a disturbing tale of the lengths some will go to survive. Each year, the village has a gift from the gods, in the form of a vessel blown off course. It is a tradition to lure the boats to the jagged shores with large fires buring off shore. The boats are lured towards the shore and are damaged. The people kill the survivors and steal the supplies in order to stay alive. The young boy is an innocent witness to such a disturbing act, yet as the reader, I found myself trying to simpathize with these murderers.I think this story has a similar theme to Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\", and has the same amount of horror. However, there is more emotion in this tale because it is seen through the eyes of such an innocuous main character. I highly recommend this story. It left me feeling morally conflicted, yet highly satisfied as a prolific reader.Hope you enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"One hundred and fifty four exquisitely written pages,the last six of which will &quot;haunt&quot; me for a long time to come.A wonderful tale of life in medieval Japan narrated by nine year old Isaku who lives with his mother and three younger siblings in a remote and very poor fishing village.Life is spartan with little respite from days spent trying to eke out a meagre existence and stave off starvation.

Although the surroundings are more destitute than we can imagine, where a bad run of fishing for a week can cause many to die in the Village, the people themselves maintain a dignity only dreamed of by the Sophie Rhys-Jones set.This is the most compelling read this writer has ever experienced... especially the struggle to understand how good people can brutally murder others and feel nothing. Is this a late lesson on the brutality of the Japanese in WWII?Waiting eagerly for more translations of his works"},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"I wont giveaway the story, and I'm glad I had not read the other reviews before reading this as I feel they gave away far too much of the story.Transport yourself to a medieval Japanese fishing village, and experience the life of Isaku with his family and fellow villagers over a period of 3 years. The tale is filled with ironies - a land that sounds like paradise yet the people living here are in constant struggle with poverty and starvation; shipwrecks that bring bounty and joy to the people yet they live in fear of being discovered; and the final outcome of a blessed shipwreck that washes in to their shore....The author does not make any judgements nor does he describe in detail the emotions of these villagers in their plight. Rather, the reader is left to imagine a riot of emotions - empathy, horror, and.. hope.I couldn't put this book down.I cannot wait to read Yoshimura's other works."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Although the writing is very simple, the style is perfect to convey the harsh reality of life in an isolated fishing village of Medieval Japan. It's a struggle to survive society where the luxury of philosophical thinking does not exist. Every action has a consequence and rules are abide. This book has stayed with me for several weeks. I love a book that makes me think. This certainly does that."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Yoshimura's writing is clean, simple, and affecting. I read this a couple of years ago on a beach holiday and haven't been able to get it out of my mind since then. (I read it right after finishing a ridiculous Dean Koontz novel, and was struck by the obvious differences - the other book could barely be considered words in comparison to Shipwrecks.) The story of lives that are at once extremely simple and extremely complicated is buoyed by crisp descriptions of life by (and in) the sea. This is a classic work of sparse, unsentimental Japanese fiction. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Shipwrecks is an entrancing tale of a boy coming of age in a village that is constantly on the brink of survival. The survival of the village hinges on two things: in lean times, family members sell themselves into slavery (bond) for periods of 3 to 10 years, often losing their lives while they are away; and the ability of villagers to lure ships onto the reef, so they can kill the crews and loot the ships for vitally needed food and supplies. You might think that the villagers are evil, but as you become immersed in their story there is a logic to what they do. Moreover, they are deeply religious people with a host of strong traditions. In one annual ritual they pray for shipwrecks to occur. They do understand how their actions would be seen by the outside world (the nearest village being a difficult three day walk away) and take pains to conceal their actions. But because their entire livelihood depends upon the occasional shipwreck, the survival of their village is the defining factor in their morality.A deeper reading of this book might be to view it as a metaphor for just about any culture in any time. To what extent is our culture's sense of morality, along with its rituals and forms of government, predicated on survival of our particular \\"village\\" at the cost of pillaging the riches of others? As I read Yoshimura's fine book I saw many parallels between the village and various empires throughout history. I wonder if other readers see the same thing?"},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"It's a simple coming-of-age tale, in which young Isaku struggles to provide for his family in their village by the sea. But knowledge of medieval fishing and rites are not the only things the reader can gain from this book.The beauty of this story is its grip on the reader. The prose style is incredibly simple, told almost without emotion, reflecting the routine simplicity of Isaku's life. Yet instead of coming off as dry or clinical, the narrative is harrowing. I have yet to come across another book as matter-of-fact as Shipwrecks that creates such a strong hold on its audience."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"The fishing village on the Japanese island's rocky coast is the rough setting of \\"Shipwrecks\\", a great novel by the Japanese writer Akira Yoshimura.The village inhabitants survive by fishing and bartering their catch for grain in the villages across the mountain range, which separates their village from the civilized world. Their lives are determined by the forces of nature - they completely depend on the sea and weather. They live in symbiosis with their surroundings, and barely manage to survive. There are poor years when they so not have enough food - then, it is common for families to sell the healthy, strong people into bondage for several years.When Isaku's father is sold into bondage for three years, Isaku, a boy of nine, has to grow up quickly and become a provider for their family - he has three younger siblings. He learns, not without difficulty, co catch different kinds of fish, octopi and crayfish. As a fisherman, he is also allowed more and more into the secrets of the village life.The villagers have one more means of survival - luring the passing cargo ships onto the rocks during stormy nights. The shipwrecks - o fune sama - are not a common occurrence; sometimes several years pass without any coming their way. But when they come, the bounty (rice is the most precious) lasts for a long time...Isaku witnesses the happiness after one ship is wrecked in the village. Finally, they have plenty of food. Next year, another ship comes, but this one is confusing and mysterious...I loved the even pace and minimalistic prose of this elegant novel. The language perfectly reflects the tough life of the village people, their struggle against the unfriendly environment and their strength and courage. Their life is difficult and therefore there is a strong element of fatalism and belief, so they treat the shipwrecks as God's help and do not think about the crew who die. However, they are not unaware of the consequences and live in constant fear. The simple goal: survival, has to be achieved by morally complicated actions.I am happy to be able to read the novel of the Japanese author from Japan and I think I should also give credit to the translator, Mark Ealey - the translation felt smooth and seamless. Hopefully there are more novels of Yoshimura's coming along in English."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Yoshimura's writing style is sharp yet infused with rich emotion. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"NOTE: If you haven't already read the Amazon and Publisher's Weekly reviews, avoid them until after you've read the novel. They reveal key plot points that will diminish the book's impact.The poor inhabitants of a seaside Japanese village struggle to survive at the subsistence level. During the stormy season, they light the salt cauldrons all night in the hope of luring foundering ships to wreck themselves on the nearby reefs, where the crew will be killed and the ship plundered and disassembled. The story tells three years in the life of Isaku, a boy who must provide for his mother and siblings while his father is away in indentured servitude.By taking us deep into the daily lives of the impoverished villagers, author Akira Yoshimura allows us to understand how these desperate people can adjust their ethical system to justify murder in the interest of the community's well-being. Karmic justice awaits them, however, and the novel's finale is harrowing and melancholy."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"I have to disagree with all the high ratings for this book. While the imagery is amazingly well written, the book is about 4-5 times longer than it needs to be. Nothing of great importance or anything that moves the story forward happens for the first 2/3 of the book. I have no idea why we needed to see Isaku age over so long a time, and so much of this book was overflated, overstated, and just not necessary.I wonder if something is lost in the translation of the text from Japanese... Again, the story idea is great, the author's ability to create imagery is excellent, but it just lacks focus. Tightened up a bit by an good screenwriter, it could make an excellent film."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"As the other reviews have summarized, this novel is about Isaku, whose village lures ships to the rocky shore where they are wrecked so that the poor village can plunder the cargo. This is an incredibly interesting setup that the writer fails to take advantage of.The first rule of novel writing is to have a main character who overcomes something (an antagonist, himself, nature, etc.) by making a decision.With this setup, there are many opportunities to build a story. The simplest version of this story would be that as Isaku grows up, he begins to understand the moral dilemma - what they're doing is wrong, but if he doesn't, he/his family/his village will die. There's many possible variations.But Yoshimura uses none of them. As Isaku watches, they keep doing what they've always none, and the last time it turns out badly and they basically all die. I guess the point is that God has made the decision.So Isaku watches. He does what he's told. Sometimes they're starving, sometimes they have food. Sometimes his mother is angry, sometimes she's happy. Sometimes things are going well, and then they all die. But Isaku is just and observer and doesn't make any decisions. He doesn't even make a decision not to make a decision.An interesting discussion topic that's probably worth a master's degree in Japanese literature if not a Ph.D. is that the idea that a novel has to be about an individual's choice is rooted in Western thinking, especially American thinking, where we are brought up taught to make our individual choices, but Japanese are brought up in collectivist system where decisions are made as a group and responsibility shared. Does that mean that works in a novel (or movie) to an American and to a Japanese are different?I was wondering about that as I read Shipwrecks, but I've tentatively concluded that the answer is no, that successful novels and movies are focused on the individual, even if they are part of a group or representative of a group. I've watched enough Japanese TV dramas to realize that the stories are the same - wife has to decide what to do about a cheating husband, boy has to decide how to win the girl he loves, father has to find a way to get promoted, even if the settings and situations and the way they solve their dilemmas are unique to Japan.So, what we have with Shipwrecks is interesting history, interesting setting, and a great set-up, but the story leaves you asking \\"so what?\\" But if you like a story where in the end, god suddenly comes in and kills everyone for their sins, you'll probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"This book draws you into its world. The language is very sparse and yet very descriptive.Unfortunately, in the end it does not seem to amount to much. All the characters interact only slightly, and we really do not know how they feel about each other. Does Isa like his older brother? How does his mother feel about going into the forest? We don't know.Ultimately, we do not know why the book was written and it is hard to pick anything out of it. Was there a moral or a lesson?

Translated from the Japanese by Mark Ealey, it is a tale of suffering and hard work, told from the viewpoint of a young boy as he grows from child into man.Young Isaku is 9-year-old boy at the start of this story. But for him, childhood is short-lived, and even as a young boy of five, he was expected to pull his weight and help support his family. The village where he lives is isolated from the rest of the island, and to make ends meet, they resort to fishing and trading, depending on the season. The other option is selling oneself into servitude or bondage, in exchange for goods. Isaku's father has sold himself, and at the start of this novel he is already living in another village working for his master.In the meantime, Isaku is the man of the house, and it is up to him to catch their food and to keep his mother and siblings from starvation. Rice is hard to come by, and most of their meals are vegetables or grains traded for salt with the neighboring village. He barely knows how to fish, so it is not often that they have anything substantial to eat.Isaku eventually learns about the \\"ofune-sama\\", which is Japanese for \\"ship god\\" or \\"ship master\\", and it is this ofune-sama that helps the village thrive. Every few years, a ship or two will ground itself upon the rocks that border their shores and the villagers will pillage and kill any survivors on that ship to take what they can to feed their families. The villagers see no harm in this. It is what they have done for many generations and it is how they live. They know no other way, and Isaku follows his family in obeying their customs.One year, a ship arrives that they think is \\"ofune-sama\\", but brings bad fortune to the people of this tiny village. What happens to them is beyond description. Is it karma that brings this ill luck to them? Yoshimura's tale of life in this impoverished town does not point fingers, but serves as a parable.I found this book one of the most unique stories I have read in my entire life. Not only did it describe a way of life that was totally foreign to me, but also it was done so to the minutest detail. The first half of the book was dedicated in describing this lifestyle, so by the second half the reader has become quite familiar with the routines that are performed month by month that Isaku and his family had to endure to keep alive. It is a trip into another world and another time, with a possible lesson to be learned at the end. I recommend this book for those who are serious readers, and are willing to read \\"outside the box\\"."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Shipwrecks is a tale of a town's destruction told through one resident's eyes. The witness in Yoshimura's novel is Isaku, who, at the beginning of the book is only a nine year old boy. His small fishing village is balancing precariously between a meager life and death by starvation. Family by family, the inhabitants stave off total collapse only through selling their individual kin into slavery in the town across the mountains.After Isaku's father has been removed from the home in just such an arrangement, the boy continues to live with his mother and younger brother and sister, Isokichi and Kane. The story is, in some ways, the tale of Isaku's loss of innocence as he attempts to fulfill the duties of head of the household--fishing for saury and sardines and octopus and squid, and, most importantly, tending the salt cauldrons. For Isaku, this represents a confirmation of his own maturation, for the salt cauldrons are of prime importance to the town and its people.A nave boy, Isaku comes to learn that, in addition to boiling the salt out of sea water to sell, the fires on shore serve another, more sinister, purpose--that of luring unsuspecting trading ships onto the reef. The village calls it O-fune-sama and sees it--the destruction of those ships and the subsequent murder of their sailors, as a gift from the gods, no different from any other harvest, such as rice and pottery, cloth and utensils. Far from being a crime, what the villagers are now engaged in nourishes the small town and keeps it from dying.Even as Isaku learns about the inherent risks--specifically those of luring clan ships to ruin instead of trading ships--O-fune-sama is never questioned: it is a necessity and a customary part of the yearly cycle; there is no moral question to be answered...other than the town's quiet acknowledgment that no one beyond the village must know.In this small book, time unfolds at a leisurly, but disquieting, pace. There is a quiet passing of the seasons in which normalcy seems to prevail: couples wed, children are born, elderly persons die. As Isaku's father is not due to return for years, a routine finally settles in and it is time to fish for saury, then squid, then octopus. And, when the trade ships are running again, it is time for O-fune-sama.One year, however, the inevitable happens and there is retribution for the town's crimes.Shipwrecks is a horrifying and tragic book that unfolds slowly and deliberately. Because the village situation is grim and its needs are clear, Isaku's grasp of the situation is understandable; the reader can definitely sympathize...and empathize. And this is what makes the inevitable punishment so personally tragic and sad, yet so very morally justified."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Languid, beautifully ascetic prose tells the story of a young boy's coming of age in an extremely poor fishing village on the medieval Japanese coastline. Isaku [9] is primed to take over as head of the household after his father sells himself into indentured servitude in a neighboring village. This wonderfully crafted snapshot of an ancient lifestyle tells of his slowly developing fishing techniques, his interaction with his mother and siblings, and his later attempts at wooing a village girl. Surviving always on the brink of starvation, the village has for centuries employed a technique of luring and beaching passing ships to supplement their staples. Once the ships have had their bottoms ripped by the rocks, the villagers kill the remaining crew and dismantle and disseminate the ship skeleton and its cargo [rice, wine, sugar, etc.]. One good size \`haul' of this type would last a family many years. Like the reader, Isaku is gradually introduced to the various methodologies employed in the creation of the salt fires which lure the ships during stormy nights. The novel spans the three years of the fathers servitude and presents the unvarying, but vitally important changes of the season which bring their own seafood type and technique for capture. This translation's writing matches the sparseness of the village, presenting itself with the stark beauty of a crashing Japanese reef. One certainly gets lost in the wonderful descriptions of this far-away time and place. Conflict arrives at the hind end of this novel in a whirlwind conclusion, the abrupt finality mirroring anguish and despondency in the reader as well as Isaku. A very intriguing and recommended read."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"This is a quiet tale of life in a Japanese fishing village so poverty stricken that members of families must sell themselves into bondage for years to put food on the table. After ingratiating us into the yearly cycle of village life, the tale tells us of the villagers' rather macabre secret that keeps them alive, and the unexpected outcome of their activity. It contrasts their own judgments on their means of self-preservation -- by no means limited to them alone in the history of the world -- with the condemnation that would come from their neighbors. The book is simply written, interesting, emotionally involving, and compelling; very informative of how such villagers live. An enjoyable if strange story of what people do to stay alive. What a pity the ending has been more or less given away already in these pages."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Whether you are a fan of Japanese literature or not - I happen to be one - this book is probably worth your time. A short read, it nevertheless manages to convey a very compelling and disturbing story of life in medieval Japan. The story is essentially an illustration of karma at work, but divulging any more than that would give away too much of the story. It reminded me a great deal of The Plague by Albert Camus - both books use similar plot devices to make similar points about human nature, morality, and the tenuous nature of human existence.Yoshimura does an excellent job of conveying a strong sense of place, personality, and a continuously mounting tension that keeps you turning the pages. A great read."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Concepts of good and bad are confused in this story and another system pervades - survival. The reader is totally immersed with the village people concern for their endurance and in their prayer for O-fune-sama, a wrecked ship that might better their condition for a few years, with the plundered ship's supply of rice.However, although the villagers are poor and hungry they do not seem to be bitter and the relations amongst them seem to be good. All obey the orders and rules set by the head of the village even if those orders are hard to grasp towards the end of the story. All village is united in its daily work and desperate wish for O-fune-sama and all take part in the daily \\"work\\" in trying to lure the ships to their shore by lighting huge bonfires at night.This book can be read in several levels and as three different stories: The first one is the story of survival through harsh conditions. The second is the story of the coming of age of Isaku. Isaku is only nine years old when his father sells himself for slavery for three years and has to provide for his family while his father is missing. The third is a cosmic tale of world order and the constant battle between good and evil. The villagers are punished upon their \\"wrong\\" doing in the same way they are being \\"prized\\".The story is hard but is nevertheless a great read and a very easy one. The author does not spare us the exact details of the \\"punishment\\" as he did not spare us the details of the daily existence of the village people and the periodic catch of the sea."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"This quiet novel is my introduction to Akira Yoshimura. A ship Captain myself, the title caught my eye. I wasn't disappointed.This short novel is a beautifully rendered cycle of life as seasons and years pass. It's evocative of a Japanese silkscreen with its panels for each season. In the Western tradition, I was reminded of the illuminated calendar, \\"Tres Riches Heures\\", crafted by the Limbourg Brothers in the middle ages.The story is told through the eyes of the young boy Isaku. He must learn the seasonal labors and rituals when his father sells himself into indentured servitude. And it's this plot device that allows Yoshimura to give us this serene \\"labor of the seasons\\".Contrary to the description on the cover of a \\"thrilling tale of murder and retribution\\", the story describes the coming of the O-fune-sama, the shipwreck, in the same quiet prose. Killing the survivors is a crime in the world beyond their village and while the villagers worry about being caught. it is a matter of simple survival for them. It is just another \\"labor of the seasons\\". The destruction of the village that follows is not an attempt by Yoshimura to achieve moral symmetry; rather it's a consequence of the isolation of the villagers. In the end, the surviving villagers continue their labors and the decimation itself becomes just one more panel in the silkscreen."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"\\"Shipwrecks\\" is a very good short novel about an isolated Japanese fishing village and its' special source of support. The author, Akira Yoshimura, does an excellent job in his description of the village and its' people. Indeed, the novel excels on two levels; the portrait of the impoverished hamlet and the moral tale that is told through its' experience. The title lets us in on the town's secret. Although they struggle to survive, the villagers reap an occassional bonanza when they are able to draw a merchant ship into the hazardous reefs near their community. These wrecks are very infrequent but, when they occur, life is good for an extended period. The culture of the village has created customs and rituals surrounding the lure and pillage of the ships. We get the opportunity to see these put into action. Later, we discover what overzealous expectations can lead to. I won't give away the ending but it is nearly Shakespearean in its' message.\\"Shipwrecks\\" is a brief story yet Yoshimura seems to have covered his message adequately. I was tempted to rate this book 5 stars. I didn't because I've read enough other books over the years to know there's a higher level than \\"Shipwrecks\\" reaches. However, it's not far below that level"},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"If you live in a rural Japanese fishing village, then the Ocean is everything. Absolutely everything you have, your possessions, your very life, is pulled from its churning depths. You worship it like a god, and ask its blessing and fear its retribution. Your skill in managing its mysteries determines your status, who you can marry, how many children you can have, everything.\\"Shipwrecks\\" is an account of this lifestyle, in a tiny village which owes its existence from the whims of the sea. The story follows the life of a young boy 9-year old boy, Isaku, who must take on the responsibilities of providing for mother and siblings, after his father sells himself into indentured servitude to save his starving family. Struggling to be a man, he learns to read the ocean, to know when the fish will come and how to harvest them. He watches the salt pots that burn on the beach, providing an additional source of income for the village. He dreams of the arrival of Ofunesan, shipwrecked vessels filled with exotic goods that occasionally come near the village, lured by the lights of the burning salt pots. The shipwrecks are harvested in the same manner as all things the ocean brings, without worrying about the morality of it all. Things die so that other things may life.This is not a dramatic book. There are no great life changes, no sweeping events. Good things happen, and the people are happy. Bad things happen, and the people are sad. But they accept both as what life has to offer. There is no outrage at the ocean when it brings devastation, just the knowledge that this too shall pass, and the survivors will rebuild, and the hope that next time the ocean will deliver a bounty. When the book ends, there is no climax, because you know that life in the village will continue on much as it always has, and we were just offered a brief glimpse."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Unfortunately, amazon.com has given it all away above, and randall short is obviously a reviewer who needs a rest. The snyopsis above is fair... I'm reminded of Santayana's definition of beauty: You're on a cliff and see two ships about to collide; you can do nothing about it. Or Tuesday Weld's definition of beauty: that which should cause pain but does not. Shipwrecks is written in a prose that is as devoid of modern stuff as you would expect the medieval fishing village to be. The depiction of the cove reminded me of Refugio Beach, where I spent my summers as a kid, hanging out on the beach, in the surf, carving tikis in the palm fronds. The details of the surf, the storms, the waves and water, the fishing. The writing of the huts, the food, the clothes - all this makes the book so readable. And the emotional pain the characters go through, the separations, the fears, the worries. And is there a moral? Is this some allegorical vision? It is after all medieval times, the times of passion plays. So what's it all about? Blind fate? Naturalism? Or does the village represent all of humanity, and the shipwrecks mankind's just deserts? I don't know. But if you are looking for a book that will draw you into its world, this is one. Highly recommended. Good writing, good strong forward moving story, complications you don't expect, a twisted ending that would make de maupassant weep"},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Shipwrecks is a book about how a remote, extremely isolated Japanese coastal village depends on plundered shipwrecks for its sustenance. It is set in medieval times.These shipwrecks are known as &quot;O-fune-sama&quot;. To say that these villagers are destitute is, if anything, an understatement. Every springtime sees more and more of the villagers having to sell themselves into indentured servitude to support their family. Fathers are usually the first to go.Everyone left behind in the village hopes... indeed, BASES their entire continued existence on the good fortune of an O-fune-sama wrecking itself on their reefs, thus providing their village with a life-giving bounty of rice, utensils, wine, and unheard-of delicacies.Yoshimura's story-telling lense focuses on the plight of nine year old Isaku and his family. His father has already left for indentured service, and Isaku, as the eldest male, is left to provide food for his mother and siblings. He develops his craft as a fisherman. Isaku, as a character, is by far, the strongest point in this novel. Well done. Yoshimura did well in providing a glimpse into the struggle of Isaku's forced initiation into the realm of responsible manhood.Isaku soon learns the mysterious origin of the salt cauldrons that burn on the beach all night long, when he is asked to tend to these fires.The fires are meant to lure floundering cargo-laden ships in the night... to coax them onto the treacherous shoals... to run them aground. These ships are subsequently plundered for all the goods on board, and the crew is slaughtered.Isaku becomes a witness and recipient of one of these bounties. He, along with the rest of the village, longs for a similar occurence the following year. After all, Isaku's father is about due to return. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to present him with prosperity, however ill-gotten it may be?Well, what the heedless waves bring these villagers next... is not quite what was expected, nor desired.Yoshimura has written a good story, but I am of the opinion that a bit may have been lost on the English translation. (Do medieval Japanese really say &quot;I reckon&quot; as Mark Ealey suggests they do in chapter 8)?I found &quot;Shipwrecks&quot; to be poignant in a few respects... but overall unmemorable in most."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"on the surface, this book is very interesting. a village uses the fires from their salt cauldrons to lure passing boats onto the rocks. then they slaughter the crew and loot the ship. they need this in order to survive as the infrequent fishing seasons do not give the citizens substantial amounts of food. the follow through, however, is not that good. the story is not as engaging as it could be. also, in a few places the wrong tenses are used. that is not acceptable in any book, especially one with such a promising premise. some passages do succeed and that is why i give it three, albeit very reluctant, stars."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks","review":"Sorry.-I just don't understand.-I bought this book because of a catalogue's description of it as &quot;Japanese Gothic.&quot;-Further, a quote from the Los Angeles Times on the front cover describes it as &quot;A haunting read.&quot;-There is nothing haunting nor &quot;Gothic&quot; about this book. This is the book for you if you're interested in: a)The difficulty of learning to fish in different ways off the Japanese coast, in detail. b)What it might have been like for a young boy growing up in a poor Japanese village a long time ago. c) What the effects of smallpox are like.-It really reads like a non-fiction work, not a fantastic haunting or Gothic novel, best exemplified by the Brontes, particularly Emily's Wuthering Heights. Nothing in the book evokes passion or is really more than commonplace. The practice of lighting fires to attract ships to founder on reefs in order to pillage them was a common practice around the globe, particularly in England. Young boys growing up frequently have a hard time of it (whether in Japan or Nigeria), and I reommend a medical textbook to get a better idea of smallpox, its etiology and symptomotology. Why did this book get all these reviews praising it as &quot;haunted&quot; and &quot;Gothic.&quot; There's nothing haunted or Gothic in a tale a young boy growing up in a poor fishing village where they cause ships to wreck in order to sustain themselves and then accidentally catch smallpox on one of these ventures. Did Yoshimura bribe everybody?

One of the Nashville \\"fugitive poets,\\" he also contributed to I'll Take My Stand and wrote a history of the Tennessee River which is still considered a classic. He was also a noted scholar of American folk songs and Singin' Billy grows out of this preoccupation. His book and lyrics provide an authenticity to the work which is unsurpassed in literature utilizing folk themes; and his words provide the perfect complement for Charles Bryan's brilliant and melodic score.This musical was first produced in 1952 at Vanderbilt University. It has as its hero, William Walker of South Carolina, an influential figure in the musical culture of the antebellum south. His song-book, Southern Harmony (1955), was one of the great popularizing agents of the \\"shape note\\" or \\"Fa-Sol-La\\" type of part-song, long used in the singing schools and today known as \\"white spirituals.\\" Walker was affectionately known to thousands as Singin' Billy.

IF the author had provided better self assessment test, say asking you 100 questions about what you have done in the past or how you live and relate to your environment to sort out your entrepreneurial talents, then I would have given it 5 stars.

She had read about the Phipps/Small family in some books about early New Zealand Settlers and decided to follow up the story. She found out what she could from the grandchildren of the original settlers and checked up on records. It has been fictionalised what she didn't know, but the detail in it is superb. You really feel like you know and understand early New Zealand in general and Christchurch in particular.It is about a family, a mother, four sons and two daughters who make the decision to escape from an abusive father in Australia. They wait until he has gone on a droving trip for 7 days and make their way to Sydney where they hide out with a secret friend for a few days while they find passage somewhere else, anywhere else. They change their name and finally get passage on a boat to New Zealand. Only the eldest child, a daughter, cannot get passage and must remain with the friends.The rest of the family escape to New Zealand, to Christchurch where the eldest two boys are set to work draining swamps and cutting flax to pay their passage. The mother manages to settle a small farm house in Governers Bay on the Cracroft Wilsons land with her youngest three where she establishs a small farm growing lots of fresh produce which she uses to better the family.The trials and tribulations make sobering reading. Suriving on damper and oats for weeks on end, living in a single room in a thatched cob cottage. Young teenages having to alk 7 miles with produce to sell in Lyttelton, having only squares of greased calico over openings in the wall to make windows. The most incredible of it was the droving trip she took to the west coast going hundreds of miles with 30 odd cattle to sell on the gold fields, just the mother and teenage son. The hardship and responsibility of it all is sobering.Elsie Locke has invested this story with a wealth of detail so you can understand the times much better. The detail never gets in the way of the story though. Pwerful, compelling and a great read."},{"Title":"Advanced Racing Tactics (Norton Nautical Books)","review":"Anyone who has read Mr. Walker's work understands that he takes a very technical and analyitcal look at the sport of yacht racing. It is definatly an effort to get through the book, and I feel that the beginner will not get much out of it. Overall, he is very thorough and on target. There is much to be learned from the book, and it will make a person a better racer.One humorous aspect of the book (and all of Mr. Walker's writing, for that matter) is that most of his examples consists of times that he has screwed up and lost the race. The reader occasionally wonders whether he should be taking his advice.... ;) However, the examples are often excellent illustrations of the point he is trying to make."},{"Title":"Advanced Racing Tactics (Norton Nautical Books)","review":"I bought this book many years ago and learned a few important tips from it. Why it is good to sail into a persistent shift upwind, and how to choose a side downwind (and why jibe-sets are important) for example. Yes the information is useful, but the book requires diligent plowing through to turn up the occasional useful nugget -- I found the anecdotes tedious after a while. I picked it up again recently and found it all but unreadable. I have sailed for many years and still find this work terribly wordy and filled with ambiguous jargon.A good author or teacher will distil a complex subject into simple understandable concepts that can then be presented and digested readily before they are developed further. This work falls short in that regard.As a brief example of the pedantry in store for you, consider this passage: \\"Head-to head conflicts must be welcomed as opportunities to demonstrate superiority, with the recognition that most competitors will be adversely affected by the demonstration.\\"All that said, anyone with the patience (It'll take a winter) to tough it out and get through this book will probably learn quite a bit about racing small boats.

Roffman shines in her first published book. Witty and insightful, it should be on every parent's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Sex and Sensibility: The Thinking Parent's Guide to Talking Sense About Sex","review":"I saw Deborah Roffman speak before I read this book. When she told us that her students (she teaches at a local private school) call her \\"the sex lady,\\" I wasn't surprised. When she explained some of today's kids' (we're talking kids, not even teens) attitudes about sex, sexuality, and sexual activity, I was very surprised.I've always considered myself enlightened and pretty progressive, but when it comes to what our kids are thinking and doing, I felt like a Puritan. According to Ms. Roffman, the roles that we as a society thrust on our kids put them under an incredible amount of pressure about themselves, their sexuality, and their values.This book is written just the way Ms. Roffman speaks -- frankly, straightforwardly, and plainly, with no holds barred.

The idea is revolutionary and necessary in modern society: a generation of parents who genuinely talk to their children about sex and maintain an open and reasonable dialogue throughout their child's life.Roffman does a good job of arguing for why we need this. What she does not do well, in my opinion, is get to the point: just how are we to instill these dialogues into our relationships with our children? After pages of being told how important it is, I was frustrated not to find how she recommends going about it. So I skipped around. However, due to the poor organization of her book, I had no idea where to skip to. I left it back at the library I got it from with only a vague idea of how she recommended I speak to my child.Don't get me wrong: her stories are good and there a few I feel glad knowing. But she simply does not get to the point soon enough. The path of her narrative is wandering and her direction at times unclear. I simply could not sit through it long enough to give her a chance to get. to. the. point.After some disappointment and some searching, I found a book that *does* get to the point:-Everything you NEVER wanted your kids to know about SEX (but were afraid they'd ask)-by Justin Richardson and Mark SchusterWhile Roffman has the advantage of many first-hand discussions with parents children, Richardson and Schuster have the advantage of not only that but also enlightening statistical, psychological, and sociological research. Not to mention a much more straight-forward writing style.I applaud Roffman's efforts on a difficult topic. But this simply is not the book to read. I wish she would organize her personal stories so I could find the ones on topics I'm interested in and assimilate them.

She dismantles the idea that talking about sex is a conversation that parents should have prior to adolescence and argues for an on-going dialog with your child from birth. This book has given me the confidence that one day I may be the \\"go-to person\\" for my children when they have honest questions about sex and sexuality from mechanics to sensuality. Ms. Roffman also made me realize that even the most progressive parenting is backwoods on this topic and that the media is the most informing resource that children have in order to learn about sex and sexuality. She outlines the concept of limits and boundaries v. well early on. She asks us to imagine a child who was raised with little or no boundaries navigating their newly found sexuality informed primarily by media. For the reviewer that called her rambling and disorganized, I would argue that the author lays clear ground work for child rearing topics such as limits and boundaries prior to getting to chapter 10, which I think is the heart of the book that states what to do as a parent and how to do it when. After reading this book, I no longer imagine that I'm exclusively raising a future adolescent on how to deal with sex and sensuality in their teens, but I imagine that I'm raising children who will be in their 20s and beyond and realistically helping them navigate this amazingly complex topic with caring maturity.

Ruby Murphy is endearingly, refreshingly HUMAN, as are the rest of the cast of this story, and we're allowed to get more than one perspective of what is going on, thanks to the creative use of different narrators, all of whom are wonderfully - and believably - eccentric. Maggie Estep breathes fresh life into the genre and leaves me wishing that some of her characters lived in my neighborhood, which is not something I can say for any other mystery I've read. Usually in a mystery you can't wait to get to the end to find out what happens, and while this one is definitely a page-turner, I was so in love with the characters and the world they inhabit, I didn't want it to end. The prose is direct yet very poetic and vivid.

Hex features Ruby Murphy, an amateur private eye who is a reformed alcoholic and knows what it's like to live somewhere else than the rest of the world, somewhere where the horizon is smaller. In Estep's lovely phrase, &quot;Coney Island, where I live, is either the end or the beginning of the line, depending on the direction you're traveling.&quot; But Hex is very much the work of a beginner. Estep's exposition can be clumsy and her characters don't have much depth. Ruby reads Anna Karenina and listens to classical music and &quot;is fanatical in her love for animals and her misanthropic friends.&quot; Though it seems these characteristics may be drawn from Estep's life, it is still true that intelligent (but never intellectual) wounded loners with a private appreciation for high culture and tribal loyalties to their friends and pets are a fictional cliche. (See Andrew Vachss's private eye Burke for a better rendition of these traits.) Other characters are similarly cliched or unconvincing. And as a classical music fan, I needed Estep's musicians and music students to demonstrate a more detailed knowledge of the music.

The opening scene where the new baby is named is quite sweet. The depiction of Carol as an angelically holy invalid gets to be a bit much after a while, but the main story wherein she invites the nine Ruggles waifs over for a holiday feast is quite nice. The chapter where the guests' mother explains to her brood how to behave in polite society is the high point of the book and laugh out loud funny, and the book is worth reading for that scene alone. The depiction of the Bird family life remains one-dimensional and sentimental, and is simultaneously heart-warming and cloying. Still, a pleasant, quick read when your in the mood for something old-fashioned that depicts a different (simpler?) era, however much the author may surround it with a golden aura."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"As a writer my self, I found The Bird's Christmas Carol a delite to read.

It is charmingly illustrated - I'm not sure if that holds true for other editions.As one might expect from books of this age, there is a heavy moral tone. It is not a cheerful book, nor would I recommend reading it at Christmas. I find it better as a take on the time period rather than an actual story.The story concerns two families, the Birds and the Ruggles. The Birds are a well-to-do family; the Ruggles live in \\"the little house at the end of the back garden.\\" They are poor.Carol Bird is the main character in this story. She is a young child afflicted with an unnamed illness that leaves her invalid. However, she is plucky and cheerful and always thinks of doing well for others. One year, she gets it into her head to invite the Ruggles over for Christmas. It's sheer treacle afterwords - the Birds are nobless oblige, the Ruggles are pitifully grateful.SPOILER: This is a children's book. However, before you buy it or read it to a child, you should know that Carol Bird dies in the end.I found the interactions between the Birds and the Ruggles very interesting as a modern reader looking back to that time; there is quite a difference in class / social standing between the two families.

That said, this story is near impossible for a child to read. It was difficult for this relatively literary dad to read. The reason is that there are long stretches written quoting people in a slang dialect from some time in the 19th century. This dialect is completely foreign to us today making it difficult to figure out what it is that they are supposed to be saying. Even the true \\"english\\" in the story is often structured in the manner common to 19th century writing. This also is difficult for little ones to follow.

It took at least a week, perhaps two for her to work her way through the story, which many of us had not heard before (unless we had an older brother or sister who had heard her read it during a previous year and came home to retell it). Some of her book choices appealed more to girls, some more to boys, but this one, I remember distinctly -- more than forty years later -- kept all of us attentive.The story, set in the 1880's, is simple: after several sons, a family finally has a little girl, who is named Carol because she is born on Christmas morning when the sounds of the choir singing a carol came floating in the window of the house. Sadly, she has an illness (unnamed) that the she and family must accept is incurable and will be fatal. Although she has just about every toy imaginable, and the continuous attention of her parents and older brothers, she longs to do something for someone else and decides, after a bit of thinking, to throw a birthday party (i.e., Christmas party) and invite the poor Ruggles children who live in the lane.It can not be denied that the story is dripping with Victorian sentimentality and that Carol is almost too good to be true, nor can it be denied that it is effectively told and will touch all but the hardest hearts. The image of the Ruggles children wrapped in blankets while their mother washed their clothes in anticipation of the party is but one of the vivid vignettes in this delightful book.Along with the Nativity story and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, put this on top of the list for holiday reading. As my third-grade teacher (long-departed) proved, this is a wonderful read-aloud story."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"I first heard the Birds Christmas Carol when I was in grade school a long time ago. Our teacher was new to the area and I think she read the story to us because there was a little girl named Peoria. I loved the story from the very start. A few years later my parents purchased a house to renovate and I found a copy of the book in the attic. This was about 1954 or so. The publishing date in the book I discovered was 1888. I treasured this book and read it every year right after Thanksgiving. It always brought tears to my eyes. After I married I thought I packed all my books and stored them in my garage. I really didn't have time to look for or read the book for a few years and one day my son and the littled boy next dood apparently were playingg with matches and burning pages of books in my garage.

Recently, my daughter was searching through some old books at my mothers house and what do you know. She found my cherished copy of The Birds Christmas Carol intact.

But in the Judd household, we recall her as the author of the bathetic yuletide classic The Birds' Christmas Carol.The brief novella tells the story of Carol Bird, a sickly little rich girl born on Christmas Eve. An impossibly good and generous child, she is inevitably doomed:&quot;Dear heart,&quot; said Mr. Bird, pacing up and down the library floor, &quot;it is no use to shut our eyes to it any longer; Carol will never be well again. It almost seems as if I could not bear it when I think of that loveliest child doomed to lie there day after day, and, what is still more, to suffer pain that we are helpless to keep away from her. Merry Christmas, indeed; it gets to be the saddest day in the year to me!&quot; and poor Mr. Bird sank into a chair by the table, and buried his face in his hands, to keep his wife from seeing the tears that would come in spite of all his efforts. &quot;But, Donald, dear,&quot; said sweet Mrs. Bird, with trembling voice, &quot;Christmas day may not be so merry with us as it used, but it is very happy, and that is better, and very blessed, and that is better yet. I suffer chiefly for Carol's sake, but I have almost given up being sorrowful for my own. I am too happy in the child, and I see too clearly what she has done for us and for our boys.&quot;&quot;That's true, bless her sweet heart,&quot; said Mr. Bird; &quot;she has been better than a daily sermon in the house ever since she was born, and especially since she was taken ill.&quot;&quot;Yes, Donald and Paul and Hugh were three strong, willful, boisterous boys, but you seldom see such tenderness, devotion, thought for others and self-denial in lads of their years. A quarrel or a hot word is almost unknown in this house. Why? Carol would hear it, and it would distress her, she is so full of love and goodness. The boys study with all their might and main.Why? Partly, at least, because they like to teach Carol, and amuse her by telling her what they read. When the seamstress comes, she likes to sew in Miss Carol's room, because there she forgets her own troubles, which, Heaven knows, are sore enough! And as for me, Donald, I am a better woman every day for Carol's sake; I have to be her eyes, ears, feet, hands--her strength, her hope; and she, my own little child, is my example!&quot;&quot;I was wrong, dear heart,&quot; said Mr. Bird more cheerfully; &quot;we will try not to repine, but to rejoice instead, that we have an 'angel of the house' like Carol.&quot;&quot;And as for her future,&quot; Mrs. Bird went on, &quot;I think we need not be over-anxious. I feel as if she did not belong altogether to us, and when she has done what God sent her for, He will take her back to Himself--and it may not be very long!&quot; Here it was poor Mrs. Bird's turn to break down, and Mr. Bird's turn to comfort her.Having reformed her family, Carol determines to help out the poor but numerous Ruggles children who live in the carriage house outside her window. To this end she plans a Christmas Party for them and sacrifices her own gifts in order to buy them presents. But after this happiest day of her life, she passes away in her sleep as the strains of a neighboring church choir waft through her window. The Ruggles children are mortified that they may have caused her death:Sadness reigned, it is true, in the little house behind the garden; and one day poor Sarah Maud, with a courage born of despair, threw on her hood and shawl, walked straight to a certain house a mile away, dashed up the marble steps and into good Dr. Bartol's office, falling at his feet as she cried, &quot;Oh, sir, it was me an' our childern that went to Miss Carol's last dinner party, an' if we made her worse we can't never be happy again!&quot; Then the kind old gentleman took her rough hand in his and told her to dry her tears, for neither she nor any of her flock had hastened Carol's flight--indeed, he said that had it not been for the strong hopes and wishes that filled her tired heart, she could not have stayed long enough to keep that last merry Christmas with her dear ones.And so the old years, fraught with memories, die, one after another, and the new years, bright with hopes, are born to take their places; but Carol lives again in every chime of Christmas bells that peal glad tidings and in every Christmas anthem sung by childish voices.I fondly recall my Mother sobbing through this chapter as Jeff Farris, one of the neighborhood kids who basically lived at our house, asked plaintively, &quot;Are you going to stop crying long enough to finish this? I'll never find out what happened.&quot; (NB: Here's a special visual aid--to imagine this scene in your head, simply picture a small gang of urchins in a rice paddie surrounding a woman on the verge of a breakdown )I don't know that I'd go as far as my Mom (see her review) and say that every holiday requires a sobfest, but it doesn't hurt for those of us with health and plenty to be reminded that we are pretty lucky. And even a certified curmudgeon like me still gets his heart strings tugged by this little tearjerker.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"This sentimental gem by the author of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm glows with familial warmth and the true spirit of Christmas. A frail ten-year-old girl named Carol (because she was born on Christmas Day and her mother heard the carols from the church next door) plans a memorable Christmas for a poor family of 9 children who live in the back alley. Carol wants nothing for herself this year, since she feels already blessed by the riches of love from her own family.Quaintly narrated with occasional old-fashioned words to remind us of its century-old setting, this book may not appeal to hardcore 90's school kids, who prefer action and popular slang. But the messages of family unity, bravery in the face of hopelessness, and cheerful self-sacrifice provide inspiration, especially during the holiday season. Perfect to be read aloud a chapter at a time--promoting intergenerational literary pleasure and special family memories."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"My mom read me this story out of an anthology book for every Christmas I can recall from the time I was about 6 years old through my high school years. As an adult, I read it to her several times as well.Not only is it well-written; but, it truly brings home the spirit of Christmas as a time of sharing with those less fortunate.I highly recommend this book to instill some rock solid family values in children today. And, it will bring several tears to the eyes...it touches that deeply."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"I was first introduced to this book when my seventh grade teacher read it to the class. It touched the hearts of all of us, including the boys. I will never forget the reaction. I know it would still be good reading today. I will always treasure the thoughtfullness that the book has given to me and I will always think of Miss Moynihan when I read it. LOVE THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"My 5th grade teacher read this book to the class 43 years ago and I never forgot it. I was thinking about it and decided to read it myself to see if I enjoyed it as much as I had when I first heard it. I loved it. It is a wonderful story to read aloud to younger children. It is such a cleverly written feel good Christmas story."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"I first read this book some 70 years ago when I was a child. My mother would read it to my sister and I at Christmas time. My sister and I loved it partly because the little girl in the story was named Carol, the same as my sister. Whenever my mother read the story to us(which she did every year for about 4 years), I'd have to read the last few pages because my mother and my sister would both begin crying over the sad ending. Although Carol is almost too good to be real , it was still for young children , a delightful story. And shouldn't we have sweet and gentle stories in this sometimes hard world?"},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"Thank you.Loved book.My father had a copy when he was a child,but it has got lost through the years."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"The Birds' Christmas Carol was not a familiar story to me. I expected it to be about the birds I find at our feeders. It wasn't. It is a lovely sentimental 'tear-jerker.' It was short, sweet and not entirely predictable. It will be a story that hope will be a Christmas tradition for reading to my grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"I loved this book as a child. The Victorians wrote and read a lot of books about dying children because in that era many children simply didn't live to see adulthood and such stories are a help in processing a loss. At the time it was written, anyone who hadn't had a child die in their immediate family knew people who had; now grieving parents are greeted with confusion and incomprehension by their family and friends and grieving siblings are ignored. Children still die, and it's still a beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"My mom has a beautiful old copy of this book...it is dark green with victorian drawings. We read it every year at Christmas and it is always delightful. A sweet picture of by-gone days and it gives a wonderfully different perspective to our frenzied, detached 21st century lives."},{"Title":"The Birds' Christmas Carol,","review":"Read this book as a child and loved it.
