That's not a knock--it's very entertaining and its length shouldn't keep anyone from reading it. It flies right by. You also learn a lot about the Restoration Era.The movie (which was meant as an answer to \\"Gone With the Wind\\") was pretty good but didn't do the book justice, especially with the abrupt ending. The novel's ending is much better.OK, it's not great literature, but the BBC should make a mini-series out of this one. They'd do a great job, and wouldn't have to tiptoe around the more risque subject matter like the 1940s movie version did (although that was surprisingly frank for its time)."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was drawn to this book which nestled amongst hundreds of others in an old book shop in Sussex, England.

Forever Amber by Kathleen Winsor is ultimately one of my favorite books of all time...this is the closest to Gone With the Wind.

I couldn't put it down and stayed up too late some nights reading it and was tired going into work the next day. This book has everything that was shocking in the 40's.

However, after reading all awesome reviews I decided to buy it. I must say that if you are looking for a book to take you away to a faw away place and keep you there then this is your book. The author captivates you in a time in England when things were beautiful and also ugly. The details that are described in this book are more then magnificent. I at once even imagined the smell at one point (which I have never done before). The romance,heartbreak and accomplishments are well worth going through this adventure for.

What an amazing story of intertwining history with the tale of a strong willed girl who manages to survive against so many odds and who loves, almost unreasonably, a man who is seemingly out of her reach, socially. The irony in this story is that had Amber's parents been able to marry, she would have been socially acceptable to Bruce. But then, there would not have been the story we have.

A very modern girl"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I love this book. I actually have an antique copy that is signed on the flyleaf and given as a gift to someone. I've read and reread it so many times I've lost count. It is a fantastic story of a girl that just knew her destiny was &#34;out there waiting&#34; for her. Born of nobility but not knowing it, she begins as a well-off farmer's niece, running off at age 16 to London with a group of Cavaliers returning with King Charles II. After her lover leaves her pregnant and alone, she has huge obstacles to overcome. She gives in to every vice known to man, as she escapes Newgate Prison, the criminal sanctuary of White Friars, becomes a notorious actress with upward of 100 lovers. She marries a rich merchant, then marries an earl so she will have a title. Finally she becomes the King's mistress and becomes a duchess - after beginning as a nobody. The book is rich in detail, full of the life and times of Restoration England. It puts you in the moment so fully, you can see and hear the terrors of the Plague and the Great Fire that destroyed a large part of London. I feel it is one of the best books ever written, and if you're a history buff or student of all things British, its not to be missed.All that being said, there are a lot of typos in the Kindle Edition of this book. It is rather distracting to read a text you remember pretty well and see things that are NOT what was in the original. But, I was happy to get it on my Kindle - now I have an e-copy that I can take anywhere!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Read this book years ago and it went straight to my heart, it's timeless story lingered. I loved this so much that I named my daughter Amber... and so that long ago Amber's memory echos on and on."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I love this book. It is set against the history of 17th century England and so much of that history makes up the background of the book. It is very well written. The author's knowledge of that period is so impressive. Two of the illigitimate sons of King Charles II with Barbara Villiers (she had five children with him) and Louise de Keroualle are the great grandfathers of Princess Diana and Prince William and Prince Harry. So they are direct descendents of King Charles II who never had a legal heir. The king could never have imagined that one day one his direct descendents would one day be King of England. Through the king they are also directly descended from William the Conqueror. Back to the book...it is very engrossing story of a young girl who loved maybe too much and unwisely. She was a survivor though."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I have read this book twice and gave it as a gift for the Kindle. What a perfect gift! Loved it!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read this book when I was 17 yrs. old. I have probably read it at least 20 times. It is the best. Has everything in it...love, death, sex, adventure, mystery...I really like reading novels that I have no idea what is going to happen next and this book has that. You can't imagine what Amber will do next and you just love that she has the guts to do it."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read this book based on recommendations since readers often compare its Amber to my favorite heroine, Scarlet O'hara. I differ. I think Amber mostly reminds me of Thackery's Becky Sharp (Vanity Fair) - someone I sometimes route for (when I can manage to feel sorry for her), but most the time I route against. I'll save a plot synopsis for other reviewers. There are only two words to describe my feelings while reading this novel...emotionally spent. This book is a delicious page-turner, yet I felt wretched, exhausted, tight, and anxious after every chapter. In that regard, Winsor accomplished what a great auther should - a stirring of emotions (but, the unhealthy kind). I think the only character in this novel without an ice-heart was Catherine of Braganza (and I grieve for her). Winsor's description of the Restoration is intriguing: she paints a picture of a period in which there is no conscience, no morals, and no integrity. I ponder why the world didn't self-destruct in the 1600s. The Plague didn't even affect a change in (the court's) lifestyles. Winsor taught me more about that period than I ever knew. All I can say is that I'm greatful, for once, that this is only a book; I sincerely don't yearn to experience any of it for myself."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever Amber was banned in Boston when it was first published in 1944. If compared with books of the romantic genre written today, it is sexually tame - however, in 1944, it would not have been considered tame. The behavior of the primary character Amber St. Clare is scandalous - the writing is excellent. Without the explicit style of so many modern authors, the reader still knows exactly what she is doing to rise in the social hierarchy of Restoration England. This book is the classic romance - and much better written than Gone With The Wind, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Although this book was written in 1944, it is addictive. The woman who recommended it to me advised that I would not be able to put it down. That was true, even though I really did not like Amber, the central character. That being said, I still found her fascinating. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book is a historical romance that takes place in the 1600's in London, England. It is not only very historically interesting and accurate, but I can't put it down. Don't let the 900+ pages scare you away, this is an absolute page turner. I found myself relating real life situations to the events in this book! I am saddened only by the fact that I am almost done reading this marvelous book that my book club has picked! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Before I bought this book I saw that alot of people found the heroine unlikable. To my mind, it's one of the things that makes this book one of the best of the many novels I've read that are set in middle ages and/or Renaissance England. It seems so easy for authors to fall into the trap of always making their heroes/heroines noble and likeable by today's standards, so it's refreshing to find an anti-heroine who is appropriate to her time. Amber is always a real person who does both noble and crappy things. The book is set during the reign of Charles II, who was king of England following the second civil war. The country had been devastated by Oliver Cromwell and forces fighting on behalf of the king, whose father had been deposed and executed, and following his exile on the continent in a state of relative poverty, Charles II ruled with an open-minded attitude that was astonishing for its time. Into this environment comes Amber, who does whatever it takes to climb the social ladder, no easy feat in 17th century England, particularly for a woman. I compare her to Scarlett O'Hara in that she is a strong, frequently abrasive personality, in love with a totally inappropriate and ultimately unattainable man, and she uses other people, particularly men, to get her way, with an end justifies the means attitude. She may not always be likable but you always have to admire her spirit and resolve. And she is never, ever dull. The authors bring vividly to life the court of Charles II with its backbiting and cattiness and its wanton ways, and the depiction of the plague is one of the most moving and realistic I've ever read as rather than trying to cover the effect of the plague on everybody and everything, it focuses on how one woman experiences it. The same is true of the London fire and the other calamities of the era.Whenever I think of great historical novels I find myself coming back to this one. Truly well-done."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read this book in 1967 when I was in my 20's and was enthralled. At the time I knew little about Restoration England and found Amber's exploits to be captivating. I read the book many times after that first time and still find Ms. Winsor's attention to detail and historical background to be engrossing. When compared to historical novels written today, it is by far, still among the best. I don't find the characters dated and I marvel at the frank handling of sensitive subjects like abortion and life on the streets of London in the 1700's. It is easy to see why, when it was published in 1944, it caused a ruckus!I admit it did go on a little too long at the end when Amber seemed to have exhausted all possibilities in England and one had the feeling there would be a sequel that took place in America. Of course, that didn't happen, although Winsor's book \\"Wanderers Eastward, Waderers West\\" might have started out to be that book.\\"Forever Amber\\" is second only to GWTW in my library and I still find the characters to be colorful and memorable. I would love to see a new film production of it with some good actors--the original film didn't do the book justice."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read this book this last summer while on a very long tour of the US SW. It took me about one and a half weeks to read, and I was involved in every page of it!! I love how Amber stands out of her time period, and yet belongs enough to be historically believable. Plus, in my opinion, women who aren't the most admirable of moral people often make the best heroines. The other characters are also vital ingredients to the story, as each one comes and goes as people tend to in life. And yet the reader understands the importance and influence of the individuals. The backdrop of the book is remarkably historically accurate, and it is engrossing to learn the details of politics, philosophy, and medicine of the time. Dialogue is usually what determines how much I like a book, and the scenes are so real in this book that one can perfectly imagine them. The only possible downfall to this book is its striking resemblance in many ways to Gone with the Wind. It seems like the author loved many of Mitchell's ideas, and possibly used these subconciously in her own novel. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves good literature and historical romance."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Forever Amber even though the heroine is not really likeable. Infact her unscrupulous ways and shallowness make Scarlett O'Hara look like a saint in comparison. The court of London was a very evil place around the time of the Restoration. It was regrettable that Amber perhaps because of her very shallowness could not look beyond the people and their characters at court and mostly ended up going along with the current flow of thinking or behaviour. Being village born and deprived of a good education it is understandable how this very thing almost defeats her in the end. If she had any redeeming qualities in the beginning by the end of the book I felt she had only got what she deserved. Still she is not an easily forgettable character. I know that Kathleen Winsor intended to write a sequel titled Amber in America but never got around to it. I don't know if another author has done it though but if its true I'd appreciate anyone who knows the name of the author and / or the title of the book and ways to find it if out of print. I REALLY do want to get my hands on a sequel if it exists. So any help at all will be appreciated. My email is cinderellabeauty@hotmail.com."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is a great historical story. It is accurate and extremely entertaining in its entirety. Fictional characters and real historical figures are mixed naturally into the plot quite easily and develops around the life of the lead female character.There were many times when I did not really like Amber herself and I thought the ending was somewhat unsettling. But, I enjoyed the description of Restoration London and life in the 17th Century. I would highly recommend buying this book to get the feel for yourself!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Of course I am going to read it if it says it was banned in Boston of all places in 1944. It is over 900 pages long---I only read books that long every 7 years or so! But----let me reassure you, there are NO slow or dull parts. Its almost funny how refreshing each new intrigue in 900 pages can be.The story reads like a story written nowadays---however, your imagination is left in full force. There are no graphic descriptions, except for parts about the Plague. The sex and violent scenes are left up to you; oh gentle reader. Also, there is no sequel; the story of Ambers birth is never resolved (does it need to be?) and it is only a slice of her life--say about 10 years.The point is---nah---gosh, this is a good book. Its about England in the time of King Charles and the 17th century. What a horrible time to be alive and be a conservative! It reads like a modern novel also partly because the time period was just as scandalous then as it is now. Barring a plague and a great fire in the city of London.Look, its good. They made a movie out of it, right? :)"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"My mother gifted me with this book when I was about 14, and I read it cover to cover in a weekend. Almost 30 years later, I came across it again during a search for somthing else -- and had to reread it.'Forever Amber' is a stunningly crafted book and amazingly well researched. So much about the court of Charles II and the restoration is included here along with the troubling story of a headstrong girl who rises from a farm girl to a courtesan. But her rise is not a happy one. She finds out along the way, like so many others before and after her, that money can't buy her what (or who) she really wants.Amber St. Clare is not a likeable character. She is at once immature, selfish, opportunistic and even spiteful. And yet the reader has to feel some pity for her enduring feelings for her first love, Lord Carlton. Carlton, a true cavalier, is also often unlikeable. In fact, the only one I came away feeling any fondness for was King Charles, a softhearted rogue of a monarch if ever there was one.Definitely a book that any teenage girl interested in romance novels should read. Parents, be advised: it's a little violent, a little racy, and a little depressing. But it's a wonderful story without a gushingly happy ending - in fact, a rather open ending that leaves several possibilities for the reader to ponder. It's a wonder a sequel was never attempted by someone in the 60 years since 'Amber' was published."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever Amber covers 10 years in the life of Amber St. Clare in Restoration England beginning in 1660 when she was 16 and ran away from the farm to go to London. The monarchy had just been restored and the Royalists were returning to England.Bruce Carlton is a returning lord whose family had lost everything during the Cromwell period. He is on his way to London when he stops in Amber's village for the night. For Amber, it is love at first sight and she begs him to take her with him. However, to Bruce, Amber is \\"a woman any man would like to have for a mistress, but not for a wife.\\" She is beautiful, desirable, and sensual. Yet she is also vain, unscrupulous, wanton, and ambitious.Sleeping her way to fame and fortune, Amber is not a likable heroine. As a character, her devotion to Bruce is her saving grace. Yet she is a woman who loves too much an unattainable man. So even her undying love doesn't redeem her.What finally makes this novel work is the history. Kathleen Winsor does an excellent job of portraying the turbulence of Restoration England. She superbly portrays the intrigues of King Charles II and his court, the upheaval of British life caused by reformation and restoration, and London consumed first by plague and then by the Great Fire.The prior Puritanical period was swept aside by a royal court of relaxed sexual morals into which Amber fit particularly well. Forever Amber, while banned in Boston when it was published in the 1940s for its portrayal of the loose morals of the court, actually contains no no descriptions of sexual intimacy. Dozens of times the author makes it clear that something happened without ever describing it. Depending on the reader this can be a strength or a weakness of the book."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"TWO DAYS! it took me two days of being ill at home to read this book and even for me that's quite something. i only picked it up cos my mum had it on her pile of books to read and i thought it looked ok. i was a bit dubious about it being a soppy romance but i was literally addicted to reading it and enjoyed every single page. winsor has an enviable talent of holding the reader's attention through thick and thin and her attention to detail of both the period and the chacracters was astounding. i felt so sorry for amber at some points, thought she was horrendous at others. i couldn't understand how she let bruce carlton use her like that but then i'm only 18-what do i know!! neway, its a good book and worth a read, it's actually one of the few books out there that you'll learn something you didnt expect to learn and itll certainly make you wan to read more of the same. i bet there's nothing as good out there though dammit!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"&quot;Forever Amber&quot; is my absolute favorite historical romance.

Amber St. Claire never disappoints!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"My Father has a first edition of this novel which he caught me reading when I was twelve or thirteen years old. He was aghast because he deemed the novel too 'adult' for my tender years. However he asked me for a synopsis of where I'd read so far and apparently I closed my eyes and vividly described more about this era of English history than he'd ever learned in school. Yes, I was a teenager when I first read this book but have read and re-read many times since. It's a glorious insight to this time of stark poverty covered with a mantle of extreme wealth.Throughout the raw, naked emotion of passionate love, the distressing symptoms of the Great Plague, the lavish entertainments of the seventeenth century royal court this novel transports one to a long-ago era.This novel flows; it is easy to read yet filled with a weath of detail and delight. Hugely recommended historical novel."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Kathleen Winsor scores on three points with Forever Amber: plot, descriptive ability, and emotional involvement. Her plot is Dickensian, weaving in and out of the Plague, the Great Fire of London, and the personal catastrophes of one gutsy girl named Amber. Her inventiveness is utterly satisfying, and whenever the time came that exhaustion compelled me to put the book down and go to bed, I usually had to peek ahead to find out what troubles lay just ahead.As for descriptive ability, her style should be taught in writing classes. Effortlessly she sets the scenes; the reader never has to strain to picture the action. As most reviewers have noted, her knowledge of history is amazing, and highly instructive, much better at reconstructing the past than a straight history book, so whether you want to be or not, you'll find yourself educated about the seventeeth century when you've finished the book.And you know a book is good when you find yourself emotionally involved with the outcome. When you finally reach the last page, you won't say, \\"Well, that was good\\" --you'll wail, \\"Bruce Carlton, YOU CAD!!\\"I must also note that the much-touted \\"raciness\\" of the book does not exist. In fact, the very first \\"sex scene\\" of the book is so subtly included that I didn't even realise it had happened until the characters' subsequent remarks implied it. Her skill here is impressive too, and allows one to read the book without the distraction of titillation.Good plot, good writing, good book--read it."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book was given to me by my mother who read it 20 years ago. It was as contraversial and shocking as it is today. I enjoyed the historical refrences surrounding London, and the rise of the monarchy to England once again. Amber is a provactive character that will leave you gasping at her actions more than once. I love the ongoing fire between Amber and her true love. This is truly history uncessored for all its scandal and romance. If you enjoy reading about history I recomend this book for you will reilish in London and all its scandal."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Any author who can produce in her readers such a range of emotions for one character should be lauded. I couldn't help but love, pity, despise, sympathize with, and scorn Amber. Winsor's attention to detail, historically and emotionally, made this a true page turner--all 800+ pages! For anyone who's ever wondered what it was like in England's Courts way back when, you'll come away with great insight. Winson's gift was wonderfully exposed through this book.

She too had read it when she was a young girl. It's a fascinating tale that you will never forget. Excellent."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book is one of the last century's great pieces of fiction, a brilliantly written account of an English guttersnipe's rise to eloquence. Kathleen Winsor's book was immensely popular when it was first published in the mid-forties. The beautiful movie star Ava Gardner was caught reading it once by her intellectually brilliant bandleader husband Artie Shaw (who dismissed it as trash); after the two divorced, Shaw married author Winsor much to Gardner's dismay and fury! Justly famous for it's earthiness and realism, the author writes with impeccable attention to historical detail and this book is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I too read this book as a teenager (7times then) and then as I grew up lost track of it. I am delighted to find it again and reread it. I don't like romance stories,however, Forever Amber is more than romance. It's an adventure story, a story of determination and a story of history. I reccommend this book to anyone - however, no one is going to borrow my book. They have to get their own."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"My mother read this book when she was just 15. after finishing it, she promised to name her first daughter after the spitfire Amber St. Clair. When I was 13, I decided it was time to read it. It took me 2 months to do so, but it was a great accomplishment. Since then, my book has become tattered and discolored from much use. It is even held together with a rubberband! I have read the book at least 6 times and have no intention of retiring it to the top shelf of my book case. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. It is truly a timeless classic and will remain forever in my heart, right beside Gone With the Wind."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I give this book frequently as a gift to 14-15 year old girls who are readers and are interested in \\"grown up books\\" (Always ask parent's permission first...show them review). This is like Gone with the Wind but of a different period - a little racy in bits, but not dangerously so. GREAT review of the key elements of the history of the period; engaging, strong heroine, dramatic...it's fun, and I've never had a kid that didn't write me a fabulously personal thank you note - they appreciate the \\"recognition\\" they're ready for something that is grown up. This is a classic I read in young teen years and it sparked a love of history and historical fiction - but it's still one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"First off, this isn't a bad book. It's well written and although the characters themselves leave much to be desired, the book can make you think a lot. To make sure I appropriately complain, this book made me so depressed. I'll try not to spoil anything, but the main characters in this novel make you want to give each of them a good [...] kicking. The male focal point is indifferent, abusive, and negligent, while the dear girl is flighty, needy, clingy, and naive, content to spiral into complete self destruction and ruin anything that might be good in her life for the sake of a recurring figure from her past. You spend so much time wanting to see the two for their inner beauty, but you can't help but really hate them and the situations they end up in. However, I think this book is a great representation of relationships where a person is happy to allow themselves to become a pawn and used for what they can offer at a single point in time. If you can stand to read a few hundred pages of frustration to see an author perfectly realize the not so pleasant nature of some human beings, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read FOREVER AMBER back in April of 1967. I was 26 years old. I never read a book that affected me the way this book did! When I finished reading it, I actually felt as if something was missing from my life, because she made the characters come alive and I missed reading about them.I felt I had to write to Kathleen Winsor and ask her if she was ever intending to write a sequel. In a letter dated May 27,1967 she wrote as follows:Dear Mrs. Bolton, I was pleased to receive your nice letter about FOREVER AMBER. No, I have not considered writing a sequel. That is a very long book, after all, and I have no more to say on the subject.She goes on to answer a question I had asked her about Amber and Bruce. I cannot write what she wrote. I would ruin the story for those who have not read the book.For those of you who have wondered if a sequel had ever been written, I have now answered that question for you.I still have my copy of the book with the letter inside. And now I think I will pick that book up and get back in that beautiful story again!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was quite put off by the enormous length of this book but thought that because I heard so much about it that I should give it a try.The story revolves around Amber St. Clare's life, starting when she is 16 and living her boring (in her eyes) life in the English countryside. She meets Bruce Carlton, on his way through her town when Charles II is finally returning to England during his absence. She falls in love with him, and he brings her to London with him.The book tells the story of their love and how Amber wants always to marry him but for many reasons Bruce doesn't want to. Through the 10 years of her life that we see, she has many adventures, marriages, prison time, and experiences wealth and even becomes one of Charles II's mistresses.It was written in the 1940s but you can hardly tell. Winsor is a great storyteller and it she made it a very pleasant ride through Amber's life. The best parts, I felt, were the ones where Bruce wasn't involved; Amber's life and relationships with everyone seemed to be more dynamic. Amber herself is more interesting when she's away from Bruce, because whenever he's around she becomes obsessive and near the end it gets quite draining.Other than that, and the somewhat abrupt ending, this book all around was great ride through Restoration England."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I would give this book 10 stars for the historical content alone. I love historical novels and Kathleen Winsor brings the England of the 1600's alive. The details on court life, King Charles II and London, including the great fire and the plague are spellbinding. Then there is the story of Amber and Bruce, Lord Carlton. Amber's frustrations in her pursuit of the callous and unobtainable Lord Carlton are so well written that the reader wants to tell Amber to find her happiness elsewhere, to not seek it in Bruce. This is really one of the best historical love stories that I have ever read. I just wish that Amber could have realized that Lord Carlton was a cad and that Lord Carlton would have given Amber her ultimate wish to be his wife."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I just finished this book and I loved every page of it!! I wish Ms Bradford would write the sequel to it. The ending is just crying out for another page-turner of 972 pages. It was not enough. I want the story to continue and find out what lies ahead for Amber who will give up everything if she thinks she could have Bruce's love. I can't imagine the uproar this book caused when it was released in 1944. I checked it out from the library but I will be buying my own copy!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"When I finished Forever Amber, I rushed to buy the sequel the moment I reached the last page. I was dismayed to find a sequel was never written. I have never read historical novels before, and almost did not buy Forever Amber assuming I would not care for it. I read it in 3 days - I could NOT put it down. If you like Scarlet O'Hara, you will find traces of her in Amber. She is strong, she can be ruthless, as well as foolish. I found myself cringing at times, maybe because I could see myself doing the same things in pursuit of true love, not to mention true obsession. Amber is unforgetable, and next winter I will pick this book up once again to visit her again."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Just read the news today that Kathleen Winsor passed away at age 83. Her book, &quot;Forever Amber&quot; is a true classic. Racy in it's day but tame today, it is brilliantly written and every bit as readable as &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; The amazing thing about the story is that no one is particularly likeable but you want to read what happens. I read that Winsor had always wanted to write a sequel called &quot;Amber In America&quot; but never did.

I love her mission - to get what she wants- what ever the cost and support her totally. This is a fabulous period of history and I am facinated by many of the characters, especially the Villiers. The Villiers are my ancestors and while reading this book, I did not always know who to support; Amber, George, Barbara? George and Barbara? Usually I was rooting for Amber. I love Charles (II) - he is so intelligent, and witty.Bruce must be the biggest T****R ever written about! How DARE he not love Amber - when she saves his life and in effect, destroys her own for him, just to have him trample over it - off to the middle of no where!Almsbury is lovely. He is probably my favourite fictional male character because he is sweet, amusing and loving. I would adore being in a relationship with him! He is the one person who keeps Amber sane in the turmoil that is her life.I will forever rue the fact that Amber was never told that she was aristocracy. Her life could have been happy - as opposed to horrendous.I think that this is an amazing book - a must-read for all romantics, hsitorians, and people with an interest in fashion or architecture.

Sure, she hardens over the course of time and trouble - but since she always gets her way in the end, I can't but imagine that she got Bruce in the end, too. Amber is a terrific character, but what really makes the book is the historical backdrop in which Windsor has immersed her. I once read that she spent ten years researching the novel - believe me, it shows! Every corner of Restoration London is explored - after reading this book a few times, you will feel like you have lived there.

I saw nothing dirty (all the bedroom scenes were so-called 'closed door' sequences: he carries her in, closes the door, etc). Even then, however, the Restoration period of English history was my favorite, and I was struck by the wealth of detail, the finely-drawn characters, the incredible research, and even the smell of London in the 17th Century. Years later, and a writer myself, I lost my badly tattered copy, and could never find another. On a whim, I checked Amazon, and am now delighted to renew my library with another copy. It's not dirty in any sense, but it is timeless, ageless, and altogether Amber. I cannot recommend a novel more strongly."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is the story of a silly woman and her wonderful adventures in London during the reign of King Charles. Ms Winsor takes her main character, Amber through adventures that fit so believably into her plot that it is no wonder this book has become a classic. She shows us parts of London that most authors only mention, the inside of the prision (not the tower of London, but where the commoners went), theaters from a courtisian's view, London during the plague, and what it was like to be a lady in waiting. This book is an inside looking out story about a farmer's daughter who wants nothing more than to be close to royalty and the love of one man. While it is known for being very risque, I found it tame by todays standards, and really nice to read."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read forever Amber when I was 11 as an edition to my Franklin Library subscription my mother bought me.

I have read it more than 12 times, and I pressed English roses between the covers in college. Lord Carlton, Charles II, and even disgustng Buckingham come across with such charm and masculinity - any woman wold be glad to get caught in their web of confusion."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I must have read it a thousand times in high school, and I picked it up again recently and was surprised how much I still enjoyed it.It's a historical romance, and if you don't like the genre, you probably won't like it despite its compelling sweep and detail. If you do like the genre, this is the grand-daddy of them all, and shouldn't be missed by any means.The story follows Amber St Clare, foundling daughter of an aristocrat, through her ups and downs in Restoration England. She goes from the dregs to the highest reaches of society, from Newgate prison into the bedroom of Charles II. Her ins and outs and ups and downs take us on the ultimate armchair time traveler's voyage through the period, and her sexual conquests and ruthless ambition reflect the reckless licentiousness of the time.I never noticed the book's flaws as a teenager, but reading it more recently, I did kind of snicker a few times at cornier moments. But the richness of the detail and the incredible scope of the history more than make up for the cringe-worthy bits. I have seldom read a more evocative portrait of an era."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"&quot;Forever Amber&quot; is the only book that to my mind can stand alongside my all-time favorite novel, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

I felt I had to write a review to warn others before sitting through over 900 pages of this stuff especially for those who were hoodwinked by the Gone with the Wind comparison. This book is amazingly overrated. The title character is morally reprehensible in nearly every way. I would actually say she is vile. I found myself consistently waiting for her to get her comeuppance. Only in rare instances could I find myself rooting for her. Amber is NOTHING like Scarlett O'Hara. While Scarlett is selfish and self-centered, she always had a higher purpose or goal beyond her own self-interest. Everything Amber did was to get more and more and more for herself regardless of anyone else or how much she already had. I agree with the other reviewers who said the book should have ended around the time of the plague. Having said that, I did love Corinna with all her grace, beauty, and dignity - the complete opposite of Amber.At first, I liked the ending of the book because I finally thought that Amber was going to \\"get hers\\" but then I realized that it felt more like a chapter ending than anything else. As funny as it was, it felt unresolved especially after 900 pages. I also would have appreciated another scene with just Bruce and Corinna."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with the aquisition of my book \\"Forever Amber\\".

It was adventurous, suspenseful, witty and the storyline was magnificent. The descriptive language also used in the book was wonderful. There was also a movie made based on the book; I havent yet seen it but will endeavour to. I only wish Kathleen Winsor would have made the sequal &quot;Amber in America!!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I must speak out on behalf of Bruce Carlton! LOL! He is not a cad at all; he's one of the most honest and decent characters in the whole book. He isn't a habitual batterer like some of the other men in this book; he is a loving father; and he is always straight-up with Amber about his intentions. He never tries to lead her on; she is deluded and keeps hanging on anyway. I was impressed with him because he's the only character in the whole darn book who is able to see through the fancy clothes and pompous manners of the royal court, and see it (and Amber) as they really are--shallow and false.Well, anyway, defense of Bruce aside, let me tell you about _Forever Amber_. It's the story of Amber St. Clare, a teenage girl who has a mostly undeserved reputation as a slut in the boring little town where she lives. Bruce Carlton, a handsome Cavalier/pirate, rides through town one day, and she sees her chance--she runs away to London with him and becomes his mistress. When she gets pregnant and he has to leave on business, he gives her some money and advises her to go back to her hometown, because \\"London eats girls like you\\". Home seems a fate worse than death to Amber, so she stays in London, and does her best to devour the city instead.City life and hardship toughen her; Amber is scheming, calculating, and ruthless, the kind of woman we all love to hate and hate to love. She charms and bullies her way through countless husbands and lovers and friends, using them all to her best advantage, until she manages to become the King's mistress and a duchess. And all the while, she forever carries a torch for Bruce, who pops back into her life once in a while. He brings out the best in her as she nurses him through the Great Plague. He also brings out the worst in her--some of her later behavior is the stuff that restraining orders are made of. He is the only person she doesn't use. Then she angers some important people, and they cook up a plan for revenge--the sort of justice that makes for devilishly perfect endings...Along the way, we get gobs of information about English life during the Reformation, from the King and his barren queen and his many mistresses, to the old Puritan families who look down their noses at the vanity of the court; to the bawdy world of the theater and the corruption of Newgate Prison. Other reviewers are right--you'll learn a lot about history by accident, while remaining convinced that you're just reading a guilty-pleasure romance. Devote a lazy weekend (or three) to Amber."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I normally love period pieces, and romances are always nice. But I was sorely disappointed by &quot;Forever Amber.&quot;The tale starts out promisingly enough in the prologue, but when the novel launches into its main body, it takes a dive. The narrative, while historically accurate and very well researched, is rather simple and unintriguing...Winsor would have done her readers a great service to have used a thesaurus and enhanced her text with greater imagery. The characters, for the most part, are flat and uninteresting (there are a few exceptions). Amber is not a likeable heroine at all...I found her to be a complete idiot at the beginning and a disgusting, whining simp after her stint in Newgate.The worst part of the book is how repetitive and predictible it becomes. The plot is on a loop...it repeats itself again and again, changing details slightly but basically staying the same. This repetition had a negative effect on me...I got to where I was bored out of my mind and could care less about what happened to anyone in the book.I read that &quot;Forever Amber&quot; was wildly popular when it was published. I can't think why. It bored me out of my skull. If you are looking for a good historical romance, skip this one and keep looking...you'll be glad you saved the time."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book kept my attention for the most part. If you like a book that some what follows history you will enjoy this read. I liked the history part however the author is very detailed and I could have used a little less description. I would have given this book more stars if it had ended the way I wanted it too. There is a twist at the end. This book has adventure, history, romance."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Kathleen Winsor's Forever Amber tells the story of a country girl, Amber, who ascends the British social hierarchy to become one of Charles II's mistresses. The book begins with a tale of Amber's parents and their undying love for each other. They came from a high social class, but Amber ended up being raised by a lower-class agrarian couple who took care of Amber after her mom died in childbirth. Amber never knew her father--although it is inferred that he may have been one of the men that she married (luckily Winsor described him as impotent).Amber uses her beauty to advance in London's social circles. She is willing to sacrifice everything, though, to be with her \\"true love,\\" Bruce Carlton. Amber meets Bruce while still a country maiden. She travels to London with him and they live together for a few months while he prepares his boats for a trip to America. He leaves Amber with ample sums, but she is soon swindled out of the money from a man who she had quickly married after realizing that she was pregnant with Bruce's child. Amber ends up in Newgate for her debts, befriends a highwayman, and soon swindles others to pay her way out of Newgate and out of the debt she owes to her new \\"friends.\\"Amber learns that actors do not get sent to jail for debt, so she prepares herself for a career in acting. She becomes highly successful on stage but does not gain the respect of society, which she seeks so that Bruce will marry her. While traveling, Amber meets a wealthy, elderly man who she determines to marry. The fortune left after the death of her husband lets Amber live as one of the wealthiest women in England. She realizes, though, that wealth is not enough to Bruch and that he will never marry her until her social class increases. So, Amber leverages her money to marry a count. After this marriage ends, she takes residence in Whitehall as one of the King's mistresses. During her social climbing, Amber manages to have relations with Bruce whenever Bruce returns to England. These affairs left her with two children from him, and she eventually gives birth to one more child who she believes to be the King's offspring.While Winsor does a beautiful job describing English history during the Restoration and the culture of the wealthy, jailed debtors, highwaymen, and nobility, she fails to make Amber into a realistic character. As a teenager, Amber seemed to be aware of her beauty and used it to her advantage. Amber's conscience seems to stay in the country with the farmers who raised her. Once she gets to London, Amber becomes self-interested and her egotistical personality only becomes more accentuated with the years. Therefore, I found it difficult to relate to Amber and to have any empathy for her when Bruce repeatedly left her pregnant or in unhappy situations.Amber knew how to leverage her beauty in order to become an actress, marry one of England's most wealthy men, become a countess, and serve as a mistress to the King. She seemed to lose all of her social skills in the presence of Bruce. In fact, she became a grovelling, annoying character, when he entered the story. In the end, she almost murdered his wife, which did not seem consistent with her character--one that knew how to manipulate any social situation to her favor. Furthermore, I found it hard to understand why Amber loved Bruce so much and was saddened by how little she cared about her children. In fact, it only seemed she loved her children because they had Bruce's blood in them. By the end of the book, I could not bear to read another page about Amber's self-interest.Winsor's book covers a little more than ten years of Amber's life, not including the initial chapter on her birth. The ten years, however, seem to take forever. It would have been better if Forever Amber had been broken into two or three books rather than one book. After a while, it seemed that the book, and Amber's climb to the top of the social hierarchy, would never end. The nearly 1000 pages move very slow and part of that might be because the scenes between Amber and Bruce are truly pathetic. Furthermore, I wanted to learn more about Charles II and Amber's relationship with him. Winsor, however, only briefly discussed Amber's relationship with the King. In fact, Winsor spent more time in the last half of the book discussing Amber's dresses than moving the plot along.At the end of the book, I feel sorry for Amber's children and Carlton's wife. The book should have ended with the demise of Amber and Bruce and the King's confidants while Bruce's wife and Amber's children live a happy, quiet life. Winsor, however, did not end the book in this manner and left it open for a sequel, one which I will never read (if it even exists)."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was extremely excited to read this book, because it lies squarely within my preferred genre. Unfortunately, the book (though compulsively readable) was ultimately a disappointment. Amber was a character whom I wanted to find sympathetic, but her behavior was consistently immature, dishonorable and despicable. Over the period of 12 years she matured not at all. Her main love interest, Lord Bruce Carlton, was just as bad. Despite countless opportunities for reformation, he remained throughout the entire book a completely selfish and hedonistic character, dishonorable, dishonest, and deceitful. Virtually everyone else in the book was nasty as well. In short, this was a 1,000-page tome of decadence and despicable behavior with literally no redemption for anyone. There were a few \\"good\\" characters, and they were either ruthlessly murdered or shamefully cuckolded. More than that, the ending was abrupt and utterly uncertain, providing no resolution of the prevailing conflicts, and there were some blatantly obvious loose ends in the plot that never resurfaced and were never \\"tied up\\" as they should have been. Overall, despite its addictiveness, it was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"It is quite obvious that _Forever Amber_ was derived in part from _Gone With the Wind_. Both Scarlett and Amber (both named for colors, you'll note) are spoiled, selfish, and lack good breeding. Both are in love with a man they can't have. In Amber's case, Bruce, the Rhett Butler character. At least Margaret Mitchell gave some historical background and framework (although utterly wrongheaded and totally bigoted) in GWTW. In _Forever Amber_all we learn is that the court is filled with people on the make. Yawn. Restoration history is fascinating, and a better author would have made better use of it.Admittedly, the description of the plague is useful, but much more could have been done with the Great Fire of London and above all with the fascinating politics of the period.The plot is a real snore. and repeats and repeats and repeats itself for 800 plus pages.

Another thing that is done over and over again in this book is abortions and women who on purpose cause themselves to miscarriage."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This was, without a doubt, the WORST book I have ever read. I'd heard some good things about it, and the very beginning was fairly promising-- and then it started its rapid descent, and just kept going. I would rather burn my hair off than have to watch the movie version-- and I like my hair. The heroine was selfish, the narrative dull and at times it felt like I was reading a history textbook, when all I wanted to do was navigate my way through the cesspool that was Amber's FULL life story-- all of it-- to find a shred of the goodness that supposedly composed it.It starts with the history of Amber's birth. Then she meets a man whom she becomes obsessed with. Then she moves out of her small-town existence, which she clearly thinks that she is better than, to London, only to become pregnant, get married and loose all of the money that the object of her obsession leaves her, along with his love-child. Then she winds up in prison. Then she escapes. Then she is in another form of prison. Next, she's an actress with a lover. Then he-- her obsession-- returns. Eventually, she gets married again-- and on it goes. It felt like 6000 pages of drivel and smut. I felt like I was reading it purely out of the hope that the selfish, beautiful and stupid heroine would demise. I still don't understand how this book was ever published-- perhaps the publisher had the same morbid hopes for Amber as I, or perhaps he purely wanted to introduce a heady dose of crap into collection of books that can be found on library shelves. I am ashamed that any taxpayer may have ever contributed to the purchasing of it."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Bought second hand but in perfect condition,actually had to look twice to see if it was new.Great value for money"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is another book that was one of the first of it's kind. There was not a book after this one; so it is not a series and you are kind of left wanting more. I liked reading this book, the heroine is a pain and you so want to shake her; but in the end you can't get enough of her. It's fun because it was written in 1944 and was the grandmother of Romance Novels; if you can find the book it's worth reading and owning for it's historical value. I wish the author had the imagination to finish Amber's story."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is the most compulsively readable and enjoyable book, with the most unlikeable lead character, that I think I have ever read. There is absolutely nothing to recommend Amber St. Clare to us. She's emotionally stupid, selfish, avaricious, vain and completely blind to facts that at times quite literally slap her in the face.Usually when I read a novel, I want to root for the main character. In Forever Amber, I took rather a morbid delight in the various misfortunes that Amber brought onto herself. In only one sequence does Amber act completely out of love, with no goal beyond protecting someone about whom she cares. On most of the other amazingly fast 972 pages, everything she does has an ulterior motive to her own gain and someone else's detriment. Watching her fall on her face is more entertaining than I'd like to admit.This is a classic novel, one that was scandalous when it was first published in 1944. Given how laughably tame it is to my modern-day eyes, hearing that it was banned in Boston makes me wonder where they thought babies came from back then. You'd have to read very carefully between the lines here in order to find out, because there is nothing explicit in Winsor's text. The details are left refreshingly to the imagination of the reader. Maybe that's why it was banned - an individual reader's mind can dream up far more salacious situations than could ever be presented in mere text."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Okay, Okay, I've read all the bad reviews on here, and I have to admit that this was NOT the book I would choose if I wanted a pick-me-up, light-hearted, fun read. But I would always reach for this book before picking up Gone with the Wind, and that's saying something since most reviewers comment on how much they like that book!It really is along the same lines, and I don't know how you can like Scarlet O'hara without falling in love with Amber St Claire. Now, I have to admit, if I met her or someone like her in real life, I would hate her. The wonderful thing about this book, though, is you get an insider view on what's going on in her mind, the struggles she went thru, and the difficulty of being Amber St Claire. It shows you a side of her personality that I would never care to see in a real person I knew. I would automatically be obligated to hate someone like this, yet I sympathize with her, feel her pain, and understand that the one thing she really wanted, the one thing she dreamed of more than anything else in the world (Bruce), is the ONLY thing in life permanently denied to her.I think people are being way too harsh on Amber though. No, she wasn't a MORAL character. There is NO redeeming moral to this story; but I challenge a reviewer to write a story about THEIR OWN life that is any better than this book--I doubt they will come up with any dribble worth reading, and the point of this story is not a divine moral or some reason for living that's universal--it's the personal life and struggle of a young girl thrust into society and forced to make something of her life or die trying. Amber is an entity that will live on long after her author is dead. She's like a force of nature--really--you can't stop her, and she dares you to try! Her life wasn't easy, and in a time when life for women in general wasn't easy, her courage and force of life is admirable! If anyone had a reason to just sit down and cry about how life was treating them, it would be Amber--but she's much too strong a person to do that. I doubt you could say the same if you were in her place, and I know that not many would go anywhere near as far as she did, even if she was a fictional character.It amazes me that in a modern-day culture where women are supposed to be equal with men, and understand how far we've come from the primitive days where men could kill their wives and move on to the next pretty unsuspecting farm girl, wear her out, then kill her too,(which is not the plot of this story, but they do discuss just how bad things were for women back then and not one of these reviewers can honestly say they understand what life for them would have been like back then) a girl like Amber, who refuses to be used, and uses the only resources left to her to climb to a social and power status far beyond that which any mere man could have done in that day is worthy of respect."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Amber drove me nuts, but I was also entertained the entire time. It was worth the 972 page effort."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read this book in a matter of days, and at times, I couldn't put it down.....at others, I couldn't keep myself interested in the various details....I did find myself re-reading parts because I got confused with who was whom.....sometimes a person would be referred to by their first name and sometimes by their title and I didn't readily catch on that they were one and the same person.....a family tree of sorts would have been helpful as an introduction in this book, as would a glossary for terms of that time period. One reviewer mentioned than Radclyff's first love was Amber's mother - how did I miss that??????? And is that true? And why did the author end the book the way she did.....at the mention of Lady Carlton's death, my first thought, was, \\"well, we just kill 'em off at a moment's notice when convenient, don't we?\\" and I didn't find her sudden death even plausible - now I know why....but I was waiting the whole book for Lord Carlton to find out Amber's backgroud was of nobility, not yoemen farmers, but that never materialized. And I truly thought Amber would \\"come around\\" and in the end, realize she was truly meant to be with the Earl of Almsbury - that didn't happen either.....I read this book every moment I got, and then, in the end, thought, \\"hmmmmmm, all that, for that!\\"......I was left just a bit disappointed. But I would probably still read the sequel if it exists."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I enjoyed this novel. I think the best feature is the excellent research on the time period -- I felt as if I was transported back to London during Charles II's reign -- I could almost see the sights and smell the pungent odors. The description of the Plague was well-done.Most of the time, however, I was a little irritated with the immaturity and superficiality that our heroine, Amber, displayed throughout the book, as well as her somewhat imbalanced obsession with Lord Carlton. Many times I wondered where the line between fact and fiction was drawn. Also, for being a favorite mistress of Charles II, there wasn't a lot on their interactions or relationship, although a lot of imagination went into recreating the relationship between Amber and Lord Carlton.I felt that the last few chapters were rushed and the intrigues and plots described therein rather confusing as a result. I am also curious about how much fact the ending of the novel was based in.I will definitely rent the 1947 movie version and will recommend it as a highly worthy \\"trash\\" novel to anyone who enjoys historical fiction as much as I do! I found it very worthwhile reading. Not recommended for someone who prefers the straight facts over fiction."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read this book when I was 13. I ddin't understand much of the context of the book, and skipped the chapters on King Charles. But I knew I loved it then. It was such a new experience reading the book at 29, because now I understand all of it. This is the the best book I have read so far about historical fiction. The research is impeccable.It is so fascinating! I especially apprecitate leaving out the details of Amber's sexual exploits. I reccomend this book to anyone. However, I was a little disappointed about the ending. It really left me hanging. Knowing the full details of Amber's life and then not knowing what happened to her. I would surely love to know if there was a sequel."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its suspense and history. On the other hand, i despised it's heroine. This combination made it a compelling read and totally unexpected. A fun experience!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I have always loved this book, and although Amber leaves a fair bit to be desired as a person, she sure makes a great character! Her trials and tribulations, erratic love life and great passion make this a tale that fairly races along and keeps the reader interested.In addition, Ms Windsor has her historical details right as well - something that I always look for, and she paints the brightness of Reformation England with as much life and vigour as it must have had at the time.If you want a great historical romance, here it is. Unashamedly a book for a lazy weekend of indulgence!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I thought I'd read beautiful and memorable historical fiction in The Tea Rose, The Crimson Petal and the White, and Slammerkin. However, Forever Amber took my breath away. This beautiful novel centers on a rather courageous woman's struggles to get through one of the most difficult times a young woman could face...Pregnant and poor in the mean streets of London, sixteen-year-old Amber St. Clare does whatever is possible to improve her situation. The era -- Restoration England -- doesn't facilitate things for Amber. But with her charm, wit and, more important, beauty, Amber becomes the mistress of Merry Monarch, Charles II -- i.e., one of the most powerful men of that time period. From then on, Amber has the most luxurious and erotic experiences of her life. Little had she known that this new life would lead to greater surprises...The novel has the sort of beautiful language that is rare in historical fiction. Hers is a lyrical voice that drips with sensual prose. The historical references are as exquisite as they are insightful. I couldn't put this book down. And, as mentioned earlier, it exceeds the other historical novels released as of late. Forever Amber is one of the best literary revelations I've had all year!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"It truly is time that this book was considered to be a classic! Of course it's ridiculously long and passionate, but Forever Amber has to be one of the most compulsive reads ever. The ending robs the reader of that frantically needed happy ending when we realise that Amber will never be anything more to Bruce Carlton (the sexiest man ever to exist in literature)than a humble peasant, although, agonisingly, we, the readers know that Amber is so much more. The book probably could be shorter and yet, i didn't want it to end. Who didn't want Amber to cause chaos in America? If you liked GWTW then you would love this- i would also recommend 'Through A Glass Darkly'. Forever Amber also has to be one of the greatest historical novels ever written- the authenticity of characters is heightened by the careful web of real figures and events from history with an epic love story entangled like a document rather than a narrative. This is a book that if the reader enjoys, shall never leave them. The ending in particular invokes the audience to continue believing and hoping in Amber's quest to win Bruce Carlton. To summarise, Forever Amber is a twisted, passionate, addictive, living tale that embodies every possible theme, character and love that you could imagine."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I loved this book and savored it for weeks. Although Amber was at times ruthless, she was a good mother and a loyal lover to Bruce. She nursed Bruce through the plague and put up withhis social consciousness. The ending is bad, it just ends. We are hoping through all 900+ pages that her true birth roots and place in society will be revealed and that Bruce will now consider her good enough to have as a wife, but this is never tied up. I cheered for Amber and found myself saddened by her again missing the one thing she wanted all her life, Bruce to marry her. The history is wonderful as are the descriptions of daily life. I would recommend this but beware of the sad ending."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read this book when I was 14. It captivated me then and still does. I've lost count how many times I've read it; I read this first copy literally to shreds!The historical accuracy and detail interwoven with the story of Amber St. Clare is astounding...Ms. Windsor's research is impeccable. This book made me love all things English and awakened in me an interest in the British monarchy throughout history. My dearest wish is to visit England and London some day and to visit the sites mentioned in the book.I do have to admit I was severely disappointed with the ending of the book. If there was a sequel, I would appreciate knowing the title because I would love to read it. And for those who may be interested in viewing the movie, don't bother. This book cries out to be made into a mini-series!Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"The prologue of this book - which describes the romance of Amber's parents during the rise of Cromwell's Puritan forces over King Charles I - was really good reading; romantic, suspenseful. In fact, it was such a good opening to this novel, I was primed to enjoy Amber's story.Unfortunately, the story of Amber is not nearly as romantic, compelling, or even heartbreaking as her parents' was. Also unfortunately, Amber doesn't seem to mature beyond the self-absorbed, pretty teenager she is in the beginning of FOREVER AMBER, although she's well into her '20's at its close (and has had enough experiences to gain some wisdom).The hero, Bruce Carleton, is also to my mind a staggeringly poor sort of \\"hero\\". Amber's love for him is blind, I suppose; but need it be stupid? Amber is relentless in her love for Bruce, who never, ever gives her a break. Bruce impregnates Amber and leaves her. He ends up taking their son away from her. He marries another woman but comes back for quick beddings with Amber (just enough to keep Amber hoping that he'll leave his wife & live with her permanently). And, last but not least, when Amber nurses and saves him from the plague (the PLAGUE, mind you) -- he doesn't even think THEN, it might be a *nice* thing to make Amber his wife? What a heartless, cheating, miserable bastard of a \\"hero\\".Taking, for example, Rhett Butler: At least Rhett Butler loved Scarlett - the reader wants to conk Scarlett over the head for not seeing Rhett's value until it was too late and she loses him forever. But Scarlett had other qualities; was given strength and determination and makes her own way in the world, which does somewhat make up for her lack of wisdom with Rhett. In FOREVER AMBER, the reader -- this reader, anyway -- wants to conk both Amber and Bruce's heads, preferably together, because Bruce is so constantly, needlessly cruel to Amber, and she is so clueless, conniving, and immature. They are ultimately unlikeable characters, together or apart.I don't think the author liked Amber very much, either. Why else would she give her such an ending -- I won't give it away here, but it almost made me sorry for Amber, and certainly left a bad flavor. There was something so mean about it. It wasn't just a comeuppance -- it was downright cruel. And if the author doesn't care about her heroine -- why should I?"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager and loved it. Over the years, I have read it over and over. With the wisdom and maturity that I gained over the years, I find the book less enticing than it used to be. It is not about a great romance - it is about a very one-sided romance. Yes, Amber is selfish and greedy, but she truly loves Bruce. On the other hand, Bruce is selfish, cruel, and hypocritical. He scorns the court of King Charles II and acts like he is better than all of them, but his morals are no better. He sleeps with court ladies, slaves, and teenaged girls; compromises Amber and leaves her alone and pregnant in London; thinks nothing of sleeping with her when she is married; and repeatedly cheats on his wife. Amber saves his life and risks her own, yet for most of the book he uses her like a whore. He is responsible for what she has become, yet he shows nothing but contempt for her, and he pops in and out of her life whenever he feels like it, with no regard for the impact it has on her. It is sad and ironic that Amber was really from a noble, rich family and Bruce probably would have been willing to marry her if they had known her true background."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Just having read Kathleen Winsor's magnum opus Forever Amber i must say that I was astonished at the sheer magnitude of the volume. Some small municipal phonebooks pale in comparison. I wish that I could say that I was equally amazed by the story even though I am glad that the Chicago Review Press published an affordable version of this now classic romance novel.The story is predictable enough, country girl rises from prisoner at the infamous Newgate Prison to mistress of CharlesII, King of England by whatever means necessary. Through a succession of lovers and husbands she remains &quot;faithful&quot; to the one personthat she can never have.The book is very well researched and the reader gets a picture of the many strata of Restoration society. Winsor has a habit of dropping the right names at the right times but after 56 years the novel seems a little dated and the characters a little flat.A key problem is that there are no real characters that I could identify with. I found myself hating everyone equally. Amber comes off bad as does her principal love, Bruce Carlton. The feeling one gets is not of the decadence of Restoration London but of the despair engendered by the Court as a whole.I'm somewhat sad to say that I did not enjoy this novel so much as read it to get to the end. The end itself is somewhat disappointing also. It is as if Ms. Winsor simply ran out of things to say and just ended it. That being said the novel is overly repetitious to start with and even though it may have started scandals and been banned in Boston in 1944 it is rather tame and mild now."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book was amazing. It took me about a year to read, because I was so busy with school; however, every time I picked it back up, I felt like I'd never stopped reading. This is one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I have just finished reading Forever Amber, and though it had a lot of great scene-setting, and obviously Kathleen Winsor did her homework with Restoration-era England, I just gave up on liking Amber or Bruce, and frankly, my dear, I didn't give a damn when it was finally over.The story just went on too long, and after the plague passage, when Bruce STILL did not want anything more than what he'd ever got from Amber--basically, who cared about what else they did.I just kept getting more and more appalled with both of their behavior. And poor Corinna!! And why did he thank God he found her? When Amber had done everything in her power to keep him alive, and nearly died herself--obviously, the woman loved him, and I think something vital was missed in returning the characters to all their former bad behavior, and worse, by the time the story ends. I was frustrated, but still give it 4 stars, just because I liked the rest of it so well."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"My mother read this book when she was just 15. after finishing it, she promised to name her first daughter after the spitfire Amber St. Clair. When I was 13, I decided it was time to read it. It took me 2 months to do so, but it was a great accomplishment. Since then, my book has become tattered and discolored from much use. It is even held together with a rubberband! I have read the book at least 6 times and have no intention of retiring it to the top shelf of my book case. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. It is truly a timeless classic and will remain forever in my heart, right beside Gone With the Wind."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Saw the movie with Linda Darnell and was curious about the book. Wow, what a waste of time. Amber was such a disagreeable you know what, I kept wishing that one of the many characters she shafted would reappear and get their revenge on her. She was utterly unlikeable. I thought that perhaps she would grow up and mature after her experience with the plague but that sure didn't happen. In fact I couldn't believe how she and Carlton wouldn't even help the old nurses who assisted them during the plague. They locked them out and let them die after they contracted the disease from them!! Windsor should've ended her story after the plague with Amber and Bruce showing some maturity and realizing there's more to life than screwing people over to get to the top of a very superficial existence. But the story just went on and on with Amber becoming even more vicious and promiscuous. She had absolutely zero loyalty, sleeping with other women's husbands when the women were kind to her. After the plague, I just skimmed through the rest of the book, the repetition of pointless boinking got old FAST. I only stopped when Carlton's wife appeared on the scene. Lady Corinna Carlton was the one character I did like was, the book should've been about HER."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is a vastly entertaining bookI found myself reading passages out loud to others.The historical detail is very rich.The stories of Amber's life just keep on comming and holding the reades attention.It does stand the test of timeIt was wildly popular in its day, and in 2011, it really stands as a classic of 20th Centruy literature.It is one of my all time favorite novels.and at 68, I have read a great many novelsAmber is an amoral dingbat who will do anyting to survive. and one can not help but be amused by all the rich and vivid Restoration characters that she meets on her rich adventures.There is no other book like it in American literature"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read all the reviews before I purchased this book.

If you are looking for a saintly heroine then turn away immediately for Amber is an amoral, gold digging, devil and a selfish, scheming, seductress. Inspite of all her flaws I absolutely could not stop reading about her! I kept hoping she would grow and learn from her experiences but no such luck, which makes her a very memorable character. As much as I liked the novel, one tiny complaint is that the ending felt unfinished and left me with the feeling a sequel was needed."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read Forever Amber about 1969, at my mother's urging. I couldn't put it down- staying up all night reading. After 40 years, it gets better with every rereading. I love the historical aspect of life in the 1600's, the court of Charles II, the Great Fire, and the plague. Amber is a fighter and a survivor. The love she has for Bruce Carlton is unforgettable. Her rise from country girl to one of the most powerful women in the English court is great reading. This book has it all- romance, suspense and mystery."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"If ever a book was written that required a sequel, it was this one.Sixteen year old Amber St. Clare, ward of a yeoman farmer and his wife, falls instantly in love with a handsome cavalier who happened to stop by her tiny village for refreshment. Almost immediately, she surrenders her virtue to him and begs him to take her to London. \\"I won't ever marry you, Amber,\\" he states and he keeps his word in spite of fathering three of her children over a ten year period. During his numerous absences, she manages to land in Newgate Prison for indebtedness, be rescued by a notorious highwayman, marry several men for their money or titles, take up a tarnished career as an actress and become one of King Charles II's favourite mistresses.(Warning--could be a spoiler here)Throughout it all, she maintains her love for the devastatingly handsome, Bruce Carlton. To my mind, Lord Carlton is the real villain of the piece. His vacillating between his obsession with her beauty and his desire to marry \\"quality\\" is annoying and unfortunately the \\"undoing\\" of Amber. It is a sad commentary of what a woman alone in that period had to do to get along in the world. She may have become hardened and scheming due to her circumstances, but she more than proved her mettle during the terrible London plague. I wonder if Kathleen Winsor or her estate has ever had any thoughts of a follow-up novel.For all it was banned in Boston in the 1940s because of Amber's immoral life style,there is nothing explicit or graphic in this book. I could have liked it immensely, simply for the wonderful research the author did with regard to the 17th century Stuart Restoration period. One experiences that time and place as in no other book I have read about the era. As it is, like many other readers, I hated the ending which left me with an overriding feeling of aggravation."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time.

However just not interesting enough to earn 5 stars. I liked Amber but I thought she was way too daring. Also felt that she should have turned out better with good Sarah raising her. Finally by the 900th page, one realizes that nothing is going to change --(perhaps that is why the author named it \\"Forever Amber\\"! I was unhappy with Bruce and his violent temper with Amber at the end. If she could have just had her roots revealed to showup Bruce and who knows what it might have done to her own self-esteem. I don't know why many people accept the ending thread that she is going to follow Bruce to America. I think that it is just as likely that she would check out the facts first before taking the drastic step; especially considering the source of the rumor. As a veteran of reading Austen fanfiction; I got the idea to write my own private ending so that I could have badly needed closure."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book is one of the great examples of historical novels. Painstakingly researched for historical accuracy, it presents Charles II, his court, and the era in amazing detail. Published in 1944, it caused a bit of scandal, and became known as a \\"racy\\" book. This was because sexual relations were treated very naturally, not because there are any \\"racy\\" sexual passages (there aren't). Winsor depicted an age of great appetites-- for food, drink, luxury, power, and yes, sex.There are two main \\"stars\\" of the novel: the title character, Amber St. Clare, and Restoration London. Amber's adventures act as a device to take the reader to various settings and social strata in 1660s London. The reader \\"visits\\" debtors' prison; Whitefriars (the criminal part of town); the Inns (law schools); the theater (back full force since the decade shut-down of theaters under Cromwell) and a variety of other locations. I concur with the point some reviewers have made--that the character of Amber is somewhat flat and two-dimensional. Amber is interested only in getting on in life-- in better clothes, better lovers, more money, and the regard and envy of others. The true joy of this novel is the depiction of Restoration London, and we follow Amber's story to learn more about the different people and levels of society she finds herself in.Interwoven with Amber's story are chapters on Charles II's court. The court is shown in its full glory of hangers-on, witty fops, witless courtiers, mistresses, petitioners, and the occasional somber minister of state, disapproving of the gaudy new age and trying to stay above it all. Charles may seem to benefit from Winsor's obvious admiration of him, but in reality he actually was charming, intelligent, and brilliant at balancing the various personalities and factions at his court.Amber makes her fortune in the brash, sensual new era of the Restoration, an era when England was throwing off the dourness of Cromwell's puritanical reign and welcoming their charming young king to his reclaimed throne. Winsor does justice to the various milieus Amber passes through and her descriptions are full-blooded, colorful, and riotous, as was the age itself."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I had to reread this book which was such a shocker when I was in high school. I remember my mother being so upset to find that I had read it. Now, in the light of all these years, it is still a shocker to think that this was a way of life in that century.

One reviewer even claimed \\"Pillars...\\" was a historical thriller. I thought \\"Forever Amber\\" was much more suspenseful!Since then I re-read \\"Forever Amber\\" several times over the past decades and watched the movie which is also very good.Only one other author writes such great historical novels and that is Anne Golon (\\"Ang&eacute;lique\\"). I tried to read Diana Gabaldon, but never really managed to get into the first volume, but will try once more.I don't think 5 stars are enough for this great book!

Needless to say, I always get sucked in.You can although tell that it was written mid 20th century in it's writing style. What was considered \\"pushing the cusp\\" then, is truly nothing to even blink at in this day and age. But it gave inspiration to push the limits for many romantic novelists, and writers of historical fiction, and for that many romance novel readers can be thankful!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"When I picked up \\"Forever Amber\\" I wasn't sure if I'd be able to finish it. Unless a book is really, really good (like Gone With the Wind) I won't finish it if it's 600+ pages long. But this book was surprisingly good. From the moment it began to the moment it ended, I couldn't stop reading it. The story is about a precocious girl named Amber who will sleep with anyone and stab anyone in the back to get what she wants.The only problem I had with the novel, was it's characters. Amber was a disgusting, selfish girl, and Bruce was a stupid, selfish man. I thought that the characters should have been a little bit more likable (especially Amber, who I'm pretty sure you were supposed to sympathize with). Overall, I give this book 4 stars; I took one away because of Amber. Sorry, Kathleen!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"If you like historic romances, then this book is for you. All in all the book is very good, very well written, specially if you want details of what life was like during the times of Restoration England. The main character is very young and beautiful and makes a lot of mistakes, but the time it takes her to learn from them doesn't seem to interfere with her goals which obviously include getting into Court as well as the Kings bed. Lots of romance, love, hate, vengance and sex without it being explicit, leaving it up to your imagination. Couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Set in the mid to late 1600s, Forever Amber follows the ambitions of a young girl. Born in the countryside and raised by a yeoman farmer and his wife, Amber believes she is destined for better things. When a handsome Lord Carlton visits her small hamlet, she takes the oppurtunity to leave town with him. From there she becomes everything from a mistress to an actress to a countess, living a very full---but not very rewarding--life.I loved this book. It's long, but so filled with an interesting plot and sub-plots that I had a hard time putting it down. Apparently it was banned in some places when it first came out in 1944; but by today's standards it's quite tame. You can't help but feel sorry for Amber at times; this book really hits home the point that everything that glitters isn't gold."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"A friend of mine got me into historical romances. I am more interested in the history behind it then the romance but I have to say that Forever Amber was such a page turner. You can't help but to adore Amber, be repulsed by her, feel sorry for her, be excited with her.I love this book and I am looking for more like it. I found this one in a trade in book store and boy am I glad I did. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I will make this short and sweet. Why did I read this book to find that the last 200 pages spun out of control and had nothing to do with the main character....Read because it is such an interesting story. The main character has no morals whatsoever but it doesn't seem like anyone did back in these days.SPOILER ALERT:My problem is that I invested, as I do with every book, my emotions to find out that Amber never learns who she truly is. Hello, give the story an end. Let it be that she never finds the true love in the end but at least she knows that she came from something she always wanted?! I am just so confused. I read somewhere that when Kathleen Winsor submitted the book to a publishing company they pretty much cut in half. Bad publishing company. They could have made this book a true classic had they given the story a complete end. It just stopped. Ugh!!! So frustrating!!!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I would rate this book's contents to a PG or maybe a PG-13. The subject of the book is adult (about Amber and her affairs), but there are not any explicit descriptions of the affairs.The story is one of a gorgeous and sensual county girl, seventeen-year-old Amber, who falls in love with Bruce, a passing soldier. She goes to London with him, determined to make her way up in the world. She is passed from man to man, the mistress of important men. She marries several men, therefore inheriting great fortunes, leaving her immensely wealthy. As she becomes Mistress to the King of England, she is granted several titles, working herself up to being a Duchess. Too late, she realizes all she has - the title, wealth, beauty - is all unimportant and not worth it, empty. Through the years she has embittered all of her friends in the royal Court against her including her lovers. She is desperately in love with Bruce - who she has loved since he brought her to London as a girl. Bruce despises her now because of whom she has become. The ending is very melancholy - she is hated by everyone and she is tricked to leave England, to a false expectation of being with Bruce. This book's feel, though the plots are not the same, is of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. The sense at the end of loss and missed opportunities of the characters to be happy and fulfilled in one another. The book was very well written - capturing the depravity, selfishness, and emptiness of Amber."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"One day I wanted to research the famous Plague. I was so interested in it that my mother recommended this book, Forever Amber. After the first page, I couldn't put the book down and read the whole thing within a week and a half. What amazed me so much was the extraordinary historical time line the book followed. The book tells us of the different social experiences that happened in Restoration England, which is good entertainment, but also very true. Even the picture on the paperback book portrayed King Charles II as he really looked. Did you know that King Charles II had four sons named after him? Why would a person need History class when there is Forever Amber? As a 16 year old female, I believe that people of all ages should give this book a chance. You might learn something you didn't know before."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Wonderful!!!

I read Forever Amber because I didn't think that was possible. She was right. Forty years later I am still recommending it to students, friends and teachers, who say they can't put it down. Everyone I have recommended it to says it is impossible to put this book down. This is a wickedly romantic book with impeccable historical detail.

It was July 4, 2008. I was 17 years old. I assume my grandma left it for me, as my name is Amber. I don't think she knew what it was about, or else she probably wouldn't have left it. (my family is very conservative and modest).I fell in love with this book straight away. There were so many bits of me I could see in Amber. At times, she did annoy me, and she seemed very foolish, but I admire her strength, and her perseverance. This book is very long, but I wish it were longer! Kathleen Winsor paints a wonderful picture of London in the 1660's. I feel like I was there!I loved this book because it isn't a \\"trashy romance novel.\\" For a \\"bodice ripper,\\" it's relatively mild, there are no sex scenes described at all, and yet you really feel the passion, as a reader.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction, or England, or romance novels, or if your name is Amber too. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Interesting book.

Every page is entertaining, so the length should not discourage anybody. This story follows a country girl as she runs away to England to be with a man she is obsessed with throughout the entire novel. We not only follow her life but also the life of England at the time. Her experience during the Plague is definately one of the most gruesome yet entertaining parts of the novel. It is a book that everyone should read and won't forget as soon as they're done!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is my favorite historical romance novel. It is written in such a way that you love and loath Amber at the same time.My mom purchased this book for me when I was a young adult. My grandfather gave it to her shortly after I was born, with a note saying, \\"If you'd read this book first, you'd never have named your daughter 'Amber'\\". She agreed. I love my name and the book regardless.The only downside to the book at this time is that it is not (yet) available on the Kindle. Because of the thickness of the book, it can be cumbersome to read, so I look forward to when it is digitalized."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read this incredible book 35 years ago and cannot let it go. A massive story and the ending you will never never forget! Treat yourself to this classic and post a review !"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I picked up this book in large part because of all the comparisons to Gone With the Wind. The plot and character similarities are numerous, and although that classic is still the better book, Forever Amber is great fun and absolutely worth a read. Amber is an English country girl who in 1660 follows a gentleman to London to become his mistress, only to be left alone and pregnant. The result is a fascinating page-turner that takes the reader through all classes of London society over about a decade in time. Not knowing much about the Restoration, I learned a lot about the time period and particularly appreciated all the research into social history that the author had obviously done. We witness the Great Plague, the Great Fire of London, and day-to-day life from the prisons to the palace. Meanwhile, Amber's life is never dull and it's great fun to read about her going through men as she makes her way up the social ladder.There's nothing particularly notable about the character development or quality of the prose, although I didn't find them especially bad either. The descriptions are quite evocative, even though the descriptions of finery are overdone. And it's not exactly a romance novel, in that there's precious little actual romance in the book. What we actually get, though, is better: a vivid portrayal of the decadence of Charles II's court and an era when morality and love were scorned in favor of hedonism. (Yes, believe it or not, this isn't just a bodice ripper; it's actually got something to say.) As for the book's salacious reputation, it's quite tame by today's standards; Amber has a lot of sex, but none of it is on-screen or described in detail.I was not as interested in the chapters about King Charles and his mistresses, and didn't think they added much to the book, although I seem to be in the minority there. And I felt rather let down that many of the secrets and misadventures from the early part of the book had no effect on the later plot. For instance, the prologue shows us that Amber is secretly the daughter of nobility--but she never finds out, and her true identity has no effect on the plot. I'm not sure why this subplot exists at all. And the ending was quite abrupt. Still, these are minor quibbles about what is otherwise a delightful book."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"While it's certainly not a \\"bodice ripper\\" in the modern sense, Winsor certainly laid the groundwork for the genre with her novel of the multiple amorous and mercenary adventures of one Amber St. Clare Channell Dangerfield Radclyffe Stanhope. Lots of thrusting, pointed and pert breasts, lots of hard, bronzed muscled skin, lots of eyes filled with passionate anger and angry passion. You know what I'm talking about. The devouring, hungry kisses and languid afterglows are all here without the modern intrusion of leaky body parts, swabbing tongues, and climaxes filled with fireworks.This is a book that deserves its reputation as trash literature. It was a page-turner, the prose for the most part unremarkable, simplistic and easy to digest. The characters had very little development, even the historical figures. Amber herself goes through trials and dangers that would fill multiple lifetimes for ordinary mortals, but she is very nearly the same person on the last page as she is on the first. She forgets, puts things out of her mind, is diverted from any learning experiences by some fit of emotion, usually having to do with her marital Moby Dick, Bruce Carlton. For a three-dimensional portrait of a country girl who scrabbles her way to the top of the whore heap, look elsewhere.By the beginning of Part 5, her amusing factor had worn off and I was itching for her to develop another dimension (which she never did). She was deliberately clueless, and I have to ding the book a star because it started to drag on that count. The scene where Amber goes to a ball in a dress meant to wow everyone and ensnare Bruce in her arms once again fell pretty flat for me, in no small part to the character of Almsbury who forces a suddenly ashamed Amber to stay and dance in a scene that immediately recalled Bette Davis and Henry Fonda in \\"Jezebel.\\" Does Amber learn from this court humiliation? Hah! Nice one. She has one more desperate and humiliating ploy in store to win Lord Carlton, almost on the very last page. The title is very appropriate, for Amber is certainly forever pummeling away at what she cannot change, all the while never herself changing.After Amber's novelty wore off, I enjoyed far more the scenes in Charles' court with Frances Stewart, Barbara Palmer, George Villiers, and the clawing intrigues where Amber and Bruce were not present. At first I thought these two separate narratives were oddly alternated, but I started to find a connection between the two. The royal sphere and Amber's own gauche one were both rotten and unlikable in their own ways. However, I preferred the Charles-centric chapters best. Maybe it was just the obligatory spaniels.The costume and furnishings porn became overbearing after awhile, once Winsor had completely evoked the sights, smells, fashions and decor of the era. Like a store-bought cake with lots of rosettes and ribbons that make the frosting a mile-high in places, the obligatory paragraphs of clothes and room interiors started to give me a gluttonous stomachache.I appreciate Winsor's research (the plague portion rightly deserves its fame), and it did much to make the book worth the read, but I am quite glad there was no sequel. Unless Winsor's ability to create rounded characters had improved, I have a feeling that \\"Amber In America\\" would have been a second verse, same as the first."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Okay, Okay, I've read all the bad reviews, and I have to admit that this was NOT the book I would choose if I wanted a pick-me-up, light-hearted, fun read. But I would always reach for this book before picking up Gone with the Wind, and that's saying something since most of the reviewers on this site have commented about how much they like that book!It really is along the same lines, and I don't know how you can like Scarlet O'hara without falling in love with Amber St Claire. Now, I have to admit, if I met her or someone like her in real life, I would hate her. The wonderful thing about this book, though, is you get an insider view on what's going on in her mind, the struggles she went thru, and the difficulty of being Amber St Claire. It shows you a side of her personality that I would never care to see in a real person I knew. I would automatically be obligated to hate someone like this, yet I sympathize with her, feel her pain, and understand that the one thing she really wanted, the one thing she dreamed of more than anything else in the world (Bruce), is the ONLY thing in life permanently denied to her.I think people are being way too harsh on Amber though. No, she wasn't a MORAL character. There is NO redeeming moral to this story; but I challenge a reviewer to write a story about THEIR OWN life that is any better than this book--I doubt they will come up with any dribble worth reading, and the point of this story is not a divine moral or some reason for living that's universal--it's the personal life and struggle of a young girl thrust into society and forced to make something of her life or die trying. Amber is an entity that will live on long after her author is dead. She's like a force of nature--really--you can't stop her, and she dares you to try! Her life wasn't easy, and in a time when life for women in general wasn't easy, her courage and force of life is admirable! If anyone had a reason to just sit down and cry about how life was treating them, it would be Amber--but she's much too strong a person to do that. I doubt you could say the same if you were in her place, and I know that not many would go anywhere near as far as she did, even if she was a fictional character.It amazes me that in a modern-day culture where women are supposed to be equal with men, and understand how far we've come from the primitive days where men could kill their wives and move on to the next pretty unsuspecting farm girl, wear her out, then kill her too,(which is not the plot of this story, but they do discuss just how bad things were for women back then and not one of these reviewers can honestly say they understand what life for them would have been like back then) a girl like Amber, who refuses to be used, and uses the only resources left to her to climb to a social and power status far beyond that which any mere man could have done in that day is worthy of respect."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"After I had read a couple of heavy novels, I was looking for something light that I could devour. This definitely fit the bill. It's a lot of fun to read and an engaging story. I learned after purchasing it that it was written in 1944, and caused quite the scandal when it was released. The quality of the writing and the story itself are not diminished at all by the time that's gone by. In fact, with all the Phillipa Gregory etc. stuff out there these days, this book fits right in and is far better than many others. It's one of the originals, and should be a must-read for any fan of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was totally carried away with a book that was written in 1944 and still lives today.Amber St. Claire is a woman out of her time whose will and determination can match any man's. When this book was recommended to me, I thought nothing can compare with \\"Gone with the Wind.\\":But Amber is actually more relentless in getting what she wants. Not everything Amber does would be considered politically correct by many readers yet she has the same strength of purpose of letting nothing stand in her way as does Scarlett O'Hara.Both women are invincible. Both will use any man or situation to get what they want. Yet I couldn't help liking them, worrying about them and identifying with them as they went through their struggles, that in each in her case, reflected their time in history. Scarlett lived in the South during the Civil War in America. Amber's adventures took place in 1660 during the Restoration period of Tudor England. She suffers through the Plague and the Great Fire of London.This was definitely an I-can't-put-it-down-book for me. I love stories that bring me into history in the time and place when they happened.

Rarely have I disliked one as much as Amber. Not for any moral reasons, though she is vapid, greedy, and (spoiler)somewhat murderous. I found that to be fairly accurate of the times in which she lived. As another reviewer noted, the story goes on a loop. I love you Bruce! Bruce leaves! Amber becomes involved with someone else....just rather tiring. Amber is naive in the beginning, but doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes.

Her strength and determination to survive is inspiring. I did feel like slapping her when she begged Bruce Carlton for his love. Still, her love for Bruce is something you will never forget.

Walter Lippman was the first modern journalist of the US: in a time of parochialism, self-congratulatory muckraking, and yellow journalism, he had an internationalist perspective and strove to introduce the American people to new ideas. At the same time, he was deeply interested in the currents of virtually all major political movements in America, and he studied and then participated in them as an opinion maker. What is truly remarkable about the book is the way that Steel recounts the elements of these movements - encapsulates them in brilliant and stimulating descriptions - in paragrpah after paragraph on the development of Lippman's restless and omnivorous mind. He starts with the muckrakers and Lincoln Steffens as well as Wilson's ideas on the League of nations, moved through the implications of Freud for public policy, to the New Deal (and the ideas of Keynes), the Cold War, and his last great battle on the Vietnam War. But as Lippman looks at each of these problems, he also critiques them, probing for their limitations before moving on to the next great movement. The result is an absolutely first-rate intellectual history of about the first 70 years of the 20C, which in my opinion were far more interesting than the remaining 30. With each movement, at least for me, I wanted to learn more, to go back to the sources and other histories and biographies. Finally, there are also fascinating anecdotes of his intereactions with the great politicos of his time, from his dismissal of FDR as a mediocre thinker to a screaming argument at a party with Dean Acheson over the COld War - \\"it was two titans facing off\\" - to the bitter obsession that LBJ developed about him in the 1960s.Of course, Lippman had a charmed career and sprung from an elite background. This made him somewhat insensitive or disinterested in some developments that hurt people, from the Ku Klux Klan to the McCarthy era. Nonetheless, as Steel points out, in his conservatism he also reflected the most popular opinions of his time, which is the reason he was so relevant.Steel also gives us a portrait of the man, and it is charming and admiring. His father was a slum lord, of whom he was ashamed and Steel speculates that Lippman's life was a search for a better father figure in American politicians. He also had an empty first marriage, which he abandoned when he fell in love with his best friend's wife, renewing his life in middle age and breaking a number of 1950s taboos. THe portrait is quite moving.This is a truly great book, and I hope that it will be viewed as a classic someday. I learned an immense amount and felt hungry for more, which is my principal criterion for true excellence in writing.Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Walter Lippmann and the American Century","review":"This book is excellent. The 20th Century has often been described as the \\"American Century\\" and this book surveys the major part of that era from the vantage point of the life and work of one of America's leading intellectuals, journalists and pundits. Lippmann began his intellectual career as a young follower and aide to Theodore Roosevelt while a student at Harvard, moving quickly thereafter into the leading milieu around Woodrow Wilson for whom he authored the famous \\"14 Points\\" upon which the vison of the League of Nations and America's ostensible goal of promoting world democracy was based. Prior to that time he played a leading role in the formation of the still influential liberal magazine, \\"The New Republic\\" in 1915. After the First World War he became the editor of the New York World, a prominent New York City daily newspaper founded by Joseph Pulitzer, a demanding position, but one that did not prevent him from acting, as he did throughout much of his life from then on, as an unofficial ambassador and troubleshooter for the U.S. government and leading American business interests, first in Mexico in 1927 and later in Italy, Germany and elsewhere.In the wake of the bankruptcy of the New York World, Lippmann became one of America's most prominent newspaper columnists and opinion leaders and in fact wrote a seminal work \\"Public Opinion\\" dealing with the interaction of mass culture and politics. Lippmann continued and grew in this role as an ideologue and high priest for the New Deal, the Allied cause in World War 2 and more generally for America's leading role in world affairs until 1971 when his last column was published, three years before his death at the age of 85. By the time of the Kennedy/Johnson administration, Lippmann had solidified his reputation as, if not the Dean, certainly the grand old man of American journalism whose life had embodied and reflected all the great events and issues of American and world history through Vietnam which he came to view with skepticism and regret, a view presaged by some reservations he had held, notwithstanding his anti-communism, towards the \\"Truman Doctrine\\" and the Cold War."},{"Title":"Walter Lippmann and the American Century","review":"Ronald Steele's Walter Lippmann and the American Century is everything an historical biography should be and much more because it is also a valuable study in political science that takes the reader deep into the character, thought and impact of perhaps the finest political journalist in American history.When he was 25, Walter Lippmann was described by Teddy Roosevelt as \\"the most brilliant young man of his age in all the United States.\\" He built his global, popular reputation for 36 years in his column, \\"Today and Tomorrow\\" written from 1931 to 1962 for the New York Herald Tribune and from 1963 to 1967 for the Washington Post and their respective international syndicates. Lippmann was one of the founders of the New Republic, a columnist for Vanity Fair, editor of Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, the voice of early 20th century America's liberal conscience, and a correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. Millions of Americans didn't decide what to think about an issue until Walter Lippmann published his opinion on it. Steele says he was read not for solutions but for his dispassionate analysis, an intellect of the sort rarely attracted to journalism. English contemporary Van Wyck Brooks said Lippmann's career was the most brilliant ever devoted to political writing in America.Lippmann was born in 1889 in New York City, the only child of well-to-do Jewish parents of German heritage. They had inherited wealth from Lippmann's grandparents, especially from his maternal grandfather who had invested wisely in New York real estate. An exceptionally bright youngster, he was practically ignored by his mother, superficially acknowledged by his father and coddled by his maternal grandmother whom he loved dearly. Lippmann was educated in the demanding curriculum of a prestigious New York City secular Jewish school and spent his summers touring Europe and its museums with his parents. He pursued university studies in philosophy at Harvard where he learned to think under the personal tutelage of William James and George Santayana and to write from the irascible Charles Copeland. Steele says \\"Copey\\" shouted blunt criticism at Lippmann and his fellow students while they read their papers aloud in his office. Describing his experience learning to write under Copeland, Lippmann said \\"you began to feel that out of the darkness all around you long fingers were searching through the layers of fat and fluff to find your bones and muscles.\\"His first job of note out of Harvard was as assistant to the muckraking journalist, Lincoln Steffens, \\"...looking not for the evils of Big Business, but for its anatomy.\\" Lippmann helped Steffens with a thoroughly researched report showing the secret arrangements between New York banks and the major financial houses on Wall Street. The material Steffens and the young Lippmann dug up helped trigger the Pujo Committee's investigations that attempted to regulate America's big banks through the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Lippmann's time with Steffens was formative; he acquired Steffens' belief that corruption was an inherent part of the system, his skepticism about the inherent goodness of the average man, his insistence on uncluttered writing, his admiration for strong leaders and his faith in science.Along with thousands of articles, columns and lectures, Lippmann wrote more than a dozen major books. He demonstrated his powerful intellect with his very first, A Preface to History, published in 1913 when he was only 23. Lippmann had worried throughout his studies at Harvard that something was wrong with the way people were taught to think about politics. When he was introduced by a friend to Sigmund Freud's theories of personality, he saw them immediately as a new analytical tool for political science. A Preface to History was acclaimed by critics for being the first link between psychology and politics. In the book, Lippmann explained what he called the obvious: politics as a system of social interaction had to be governed by the same forces that governed other social behavior. Freud himself was impressed with the young Lippmann; a few years after the book was published, he invited Lippmann to a Vienna meeting of the Psychoanalytic Society and introduced him to Adler and Jung.Lippmann's genius was developed on both sides of the journalism - government fault line. He assisted a Schenectady, New York socialist mayor, albeit for only four months before he lost his appetite for petty local politics. He drafted a position paper on labor and management for Teddy Roosevelt. He wrote speeches for President Wilson and led the four-man effort to help draft Wilson's Fourteen Points for peace in post-World War I Europe. The first five and the 14th were the President's; the other eight essentially were Lippmann's. He even served as a Captain in the U.S. Army for six months as the American representative to the Inter-Allied Propaganda Board in London. With Wilson's peace plan in mind, Lippmann approached this work as \\"getting away from propaganda in the sinister sense, and substituting for it a frank campaign of education addressed to the German and Austrian troops, explaining as simply and persuasively as possible the unselfish character of the war, the generosity of our aims and the great hope of mankind which we are trying to realize.\\"In 1922, Alfred Harcourt published Lippmann's most enduring book, Public Opinion. Considered a classic today, it went far beyond the mechanics of political science to scrutinize the democratic process and the citizen whose mind is full of distorted, suppressed facts jumbled together by emotions, habits and prejudices. He said people see and define things according to stereotypes, prejudice and propaganda. What we know as facts are really judgments. While men are willing to admit there are two sides to a question, Lippmann says they do not believe there are two sides to what they regard as a fact. He said this poses a critical political drama for classic democracy \\"because the pictures inside people's heads do not automatically correspond with the world outside.\\" The result, says Lippmann, is erosion of the foundation of popular government.Lippmann said the press cannot provide the answer because truth and the news are not the same. He says men \\"cannot govern society by episodes, incidents and eruptions.\\" What would he say today about the American news media's slavish stream of engineered political photo ops, media events and sound bites? Might he have agreed it's not what we don't know that's dangerous, it's what we know that's wrong?Although he never became a sycophant, Lippmann was a high level political insider most of his life. He was always cautious about President Franklin Roosevelt, forming his opinion in 1931 when he wrote, \\"I am now satisfied that he just doesn't happen to have a very good mind, that he never really comes to grips with a problem which has any large dimensions and that above all the controlling element in almost every case is political advantage.\\" Steele says Lippmann thought Truman was an insecure man given to hasty decisions and false bravado to cover his anxieties and called publicly for his resignation. Lippmann was an admirer of President Kennedy while finding fault with several of his administration's decisions, including those on Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. \\"I don't agree with the people who think that we have to go out and shed a little blood to prove we're virile men ... And then behind that all lies a very personal and human feeling - that I don't think old men ought to promote wars for young men to fight. I don't like warlike old men.\\"One of Lippmann's journalistic rules stipulated one should not strike the king unless s(he) strikes to kill. He had been a Johnson administration insider, never wavering in his support of President Johnson's domestic programs. His foreign policy was another matter. Frustrated his advice was being ignored regarding the Vietnam War, Lippmann implicitly relinquished his role as an administration confidant in the spring of 1966, denouncing Johnson over Vietnam. Later that year, he wrote, \\"There is a growing belief that Johnson's America is no longer the historic America, that it is a bastard empire which relies on superior force to achieve its purposes, and is no longer an example of the wisdom and humanity of a free society ... It is a feeling that the American promise has been betrayed and abandoned.\\" Fighting back, Johnson rarely missed an opportunity to attack Lippmann as traitorous, irrational or senile. Steele says Lippmann's break with Johnson and opposition to the Vietnam War was his finest hour.Lippmann's last literary effort was a book he wanted to write on how mankind would govern itself in the future. \\"The absolutely revolutionary invention of our time is the invention of invention itself. It's also the reason for the moral and psychological difficulties of our time. The supreme question before mankind is how men will be able to make themselves willing and able to save themselves.\\" Steele reports he was too tired, too weak to do it. Lippmann published his last article in January, 1971, while his final comments flowed to America through interviews as the elder statesman of American political journalism. One comment was predictive but less than optimistic. \\"Anything that makes the world more humane and more rational is progress; that's the only measuring stick we can apply to it. But I don't wish to imply that I think this (the 20th century) is a great progressive age. I don't. I think it's going to be a minor Dark Age.\\" Lippmann died at age 85 on Dec. 14, 1974.Thoughtful debate leading to enlightened political compromise seems today to have been replaced in America by simplistic poll-driven talking points emanating from mean-spirited, doctrinaire partisanship. Ronald Steele's outstanding historical biography, doing double duty as a valuable study in political science, shows how Walter Lippmann would suggest Americans might find their way back from that swamp. \\"When men are brought face to face with their opponents, forced to listen and learn and mend their ideas, they cease to be children and savages and begin to live like civilized men. Then only is freedom a reality, when men may voice their opinions because they must examine their opinions ... Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.\\""},{"Title":"Introducing Microsoft Windows Vista","review":"Ever since I bought Stanek's Windows Server Inside Out last year, he's become the one author I turn to whenever I want to learn a new technology.

I read it when I was 18. I have been a Casey Valentine & friends fan since I was 10 and had devoured all the other books and was thirsty for more, and had been writing to the author on and off when I was a kid and she mentioned this book in her letter to me and so years later I finally found it in the library. I loved it! It is so good! It's about a chubby girl named Poopsie who wants to change her image, and her friend Tracy (some friend!) always puts her down and calls her a \\"Lily Liver\\". She wants ballet lessons and she gets her wish when her mom takes a job waitressing but the catch is that Poopsie will be home alone in the evenings while her mom works and she put Poopsie in charge on her baby brother Teddy. Thing is, Poopsie is scared since Tracy told her that a kidnapper is in the neighborhood. Poopsie gets tired of Tracy always teasing her so when her ballet class does a musical, Poopsie lies to her about her role in it, and then Tracy becomes impressed and decides she's going to come watch her perform...Poopsie's got herself in a jam! It's a funny book that will make you laugh out loud! Only thing though is they did not really explain what happened with Tracy's \\"kidnapper\\" story; it did turn out to be Richard and Leroy hanging out at Gypsy Wild, the cabin where Tracy claimed the kidnapper was hiding out, but how do you account for Tracy's story about her dad going to check the place out previously and Poopsie's mom being scared and telling her to stay away from that place?"},{"Title":"Poopsie Pomeranz, Pick Up Your Feet","review":"Besides being well written, this is one book in this series by Patricia that has been greatly improved with the &quot;new&quot; covers.

It helped me to redefine the way I think about pleasure and society's relationship to it. I was raised with such a puritanical &quot;if it feels good, it must be evil&quot; way of thinking that Leary's point of view - &quot;if it feels good, it's probably good for you&quot; - was downright liberating for me. Although I don't subscribe to everything Leary says in the book (for example, I don't think doing LSD once a week is a good idea), his essays are always provocative and full of food for thought. Even if you're put off by Leary's associations with hippie and drug cultures, I'd still recommend reading this book. Leary was an intelligent man with ideas worth listening to."},{"Title":"The Delicious Grace of Moving One's Hand: Intelligence is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac","review":"&quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; the trinity of tripping, the credo of the sixties' psychedelic revolution, was coined by the &quot;High Priest&quot; of LSD, Dr. Timothy Leary. Though his Harvard research into the consciousness-raising possibilities of psychedelic drugs might have ended with his, and Richard Alpert's, dismissal from the school-the first faculty to be sent packing since Ralph Waldo Emerson-Leary went on through private funding to research mind-expanding drugs, especially as related to sexual ecstasy.The Delicious Grace of Moving One's Hand: The Collected Sex Writings, compiled by Leary before his death in 1997, includes lectures, interviews, essays, and personal history that reveal this man's remarkable wit and brilliant scientific mind. The words here are just as often gorgeous prose as they are lucid scientific postulations. He writes of his &quot;first sexual experience&quot;-his own conception-in gorgeously erotic terms: &quot;I was eased into this soft, creamy home, my slim serpent body sputtering with pleasure.&quot;Accessible even to Leary novices-including those of us under 40, many likely born long after Leary's escape from prison in 1970-Delicious Grace will tune you in and turn you on to one our country's most ingenious, controversial minds."},{"Title":"The Delicious Grace of Moving One's Hand: Intelligence is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac","review":"This book is wonderful!

He relates his personal insights of the dynamic process of dying, and suggests an exercise to be undertaken by one who knows they have... only one year to live.This is an exceptionally difficult book to review. On the five-star side, the author has some exceptional credentials and the work has been well-reviewed by people with a wide variety of perspectives. Some of his exercises (such as his \\"soft-belly\\" meditation, his advice to carefully observe our thoughts-as-they-arise, and his suggestions to recall and bid farewell to our most pleasant memories and to forgive our worst ones) are simply wonderful. They have aided my own practice immensely. I commend his gentle assurances that, despite our fears, All Should Be Well (most religious leaders have said the same thing). I think the author has made a noble effort to tackle a hugely difficult subject.On the dark side, however, I wouldn't give this book to someone imminently facing the Great Gulp unless they were pretty comfortable with the New Age view of Death. Many good people feel preparing for death requires much regret, repentance, suffering, uncertainty, angst, fear, etcetera, and this book might provoke outrage from those people at a sensitive time without any corresponding redemptive value (I indeed respect a terminally-ill reviewer who trashed this book). The author seems to feel death should be kind of a peaceable, emotionally blissy, blend-with-the-infinite, far-out sort of experience. I wouldn't exactly say he views death as the spiritual equivalent of a trip to Disneyland but ... you get the picture. I'm sorry to again be so totally crass, but you have several financial and material responsibilities in preparing your loved ones for your after-death experience, and this book glossed over them pretty darn quickly. The book is New Age Ambiguous -- I looked over one section and put negatives in place of the positives, and it read pretty much the same either way. I'm skeptical the author's theology or ontology improve on the Buddha, who was silent regarding The Ultimate Question. I also agree with other reviewers who pointed out the twelve-month exercise is ultimately artificial and can degenerate into shallowness. Finally, no bibliography, no index, and no backup data for some Pretty Big Assertions-As-Facts.I finally suggest four stars as a compromise. I also gave a respectable rating because of the sheer value of some of his meditational exercises, and suggest the book for those reasons alone."},{"Title":"A Year to Live: How to Live This Year As If It Were Your Last (Thorndike Press Large Print Inspirational Series)","review":"We're all going to die. Levine's book helps us to view life and death from a broader perspective. Levine has spent considerable time working with terminally ill clients. According to him, people on their death bed commonly mourn their unfinished business. Be it unfufilled dreams, broken promises, or unresolved conflicts, life regrets are one of the most troublesome aspects of dying.Levine's book gave me motivation to begin living each day as if it's my last. It made me consciously aware of the importance of not putting life on hold.This book also encouraged me to be more accepting and conscious in daily life. Many of us do all we can to avoid pain. Levine believes that accepting and moving through discomfort is actually less painful than tensing up with fear. I believe this applies not only to physical pain, but also mental and emotional discomfort. Many times the events I've resisted and resented the most are the ones that offered the greatest satisfation and personal growth once I got to the other side.Levine's book made me feel more comfortable with the ideas such as acceptance and humilty.

I love the titles of his chapters including \\"ALTARING YOUR LIFE\\"...plus he offers meditations and a year-long plan...

It's very intense, and I think it's usefulness depends largely on whether you think it might be helpful to undergo this experience!"},{"Title":"A Year to Live: How to Live This Year As If It Were Your Last (Thorndike Press Large Print Inspirational Series)","review":"I see that some reviewers give this book a poor rating because (1) it lacks practical content like making a will and paying off debt, or (2)it does not realistically address the traumatizing emotions felt by a person who is left with only a year to live.But the book is not for the physically dying. He and others have written books to help people facing that tragic fate. Instead, \\"A Year to Live\\" is for those of us who do not want to reach the end of our lives with regrets. The book helps you find joy, gratitude, peace, and forgiveness while we still have plenty of time to enjoy them. The best exercise for accomplishing these states is to imagine what you would do with your life if told you have a year to live. Like the old saying, \\"No one on their deathbed ever says, 'I should have spent more time at the office.'\\"\\"A Year to Live\\" is the book to read if you don't want to reach the end of your life with feelings of regret, failure, shame, or loneliness.I read this book many years ago, and have recommended it many times. Now my husband is going through a crisis of the soul so I just ordered it for him (having loaned my copy out at some point). He is as far from new-agey as they come, yet is finding enormous value in reading it.

It's not a book that will appeal to those who bask smugly in their own self-sufficient world and think not of others. It is a book that can provide deep insight into the true nature of the human condition -- that all life is suffering with occasional happy moments. I'd recommend 'A Year To Live' to anyone suffering from a bereavement, or expecting one; to those struggling with elderly parents or relatives; to those trying to find some meaning in the life process and interested in 'what comes after' and above all, to all who are frightened of death."},{"Title":"A Year to Live: How to Live This Year As If It Were Your Last (Thorndike Press Large Print Inspirational Series)","review":"I am currently almost halfway through my &quot;Year to Live.&quot; My mother, her best friend, and her best friend's oldest daughter are among a larger group of people all over the nation who are actually trying to do exactly what this book discusses: Treat this year as if it were your last.

Now I know why. I read through the first several chapters - each chapter is only a couple pages long - and then flipped to the back of the book to see if the book was going anywhere. Sadly, nothing had changed in the end.This book is zen poetry. Levine is a good writer with many flowery images and metaphors for dying but after awhile he says nothing. Perhaps I should read his book in order to learn the patience needed to read his book. If i had six months to live, I wouldn't spend my time reading this book. It has nothing new to say, just a recycle of zen techniques.I expected this book to be a practical guide to settling our affairs in the final year of life.

Having undergone two brain surgeries, radiation and 16 months of chemotherapy, I feel uniquely qualified to write this review.In my case, and with hundreds of other brain tumor patients I know, the first year is spent in sheer terror, on a roller coaster ride of emotions and medical changes. For the incredibly lucky few that are still alive at the end of the first year (50% of malignant brain tumor patients die within six months of diagnosis), the terror gradually gives way to a bipolar life in which the patient simultaneously lives life as best s/he can, given physical / emotional / spiritual defecits, while living the emotional pain of knowing that in three months they could be dead; their spouse without a partner, their children without a parent.Through this year, the lucky ones that live are able to reconsider their lives and determine in which baskets their proverbial eggs should be placed.Levine, who has experience working with patients diagnosed with chronic illnesses, should know better. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.One can no better pretend to have one year of life left than they can pretend to live one year without the force of gravity. It simply can't happen.

However, if your humour leans to the macabre and darker side of things, this might just be what you need.To qualify for a Darwin, one basically needs to remove oneself from the human gene pool. This is possible in two ways: death or the removal of all possibility to reproduce, (thereby taking your own genes out of contention). There are other criteria, such as accidents, the monumental failure of judgement and the more vague \\"excellence\\". Basically, suicides, freak accidents and trusting so-called \\"qualified\\" advice, would not be chosen for a Darwin.The book itself has three main categories of stories that run throughout the chapters: the Darwin Awards themselves, Honourable Mentions, (where the person has not been removed from the gene pool, but deserves a mention for meeting other criteria), and Personal Accounts. There are also some Urban Legends included, which I thought were a bit superfluous. The chapters are divided into methods and are each introduced with some discussion on a related topic, (in itself interesting for the most part, but unnecessary to the overall enjoyment of the book). For example, in \\"Men\\", there is a discussion called \\"Online Safety\\".The stories themselves vary in the humour factor, some being uproarously funny and others being faintly amusing. A favourite was \\"Envy Flames of Passion\\", where a revenge fire went horribly wrong: the perpetrator forgot to plan an escape from the flames. Such stories are written by the author and some do seem to lack that certain something that would make them truly hilarious. Others are better written and hit the mark very well. It can be a bit \\"hit and miss\\" through this book.I have to confess that the book appealed to my somewhat basic sense of humour and I had a good laugh at some of the really stupid things people have done in the mistakenly sincere belief that they have a remote chance of survival. With some cautions about the nature of the humour itself, I would recommend it to those with darker tastes."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"The Darwin Awards is a creative concept, but I'm not sure this book is written all that well or in that funny of a manner. I haven't read the other books in this series, so I can't compare it with them, but I didn't get that many laughs out of this one. And heck, maybe there's something wrong with you if you are getting laughs out of other people dying, whether they're dangling from a hanglider with a chainsaw in hand or what have you.

I read the first volume aloud to my friend while on vacation - at one point he fell to the floor laughing. (I think it was the story about the sad sad man who clipped dozens of bunjee cords together and forgot that those cords do stretch. He leaped from a high place, and hit the ground like a rock. He died of course.)The first \\"Darwin Awards\\" was hysterical. Virtually all of this sequel is obvious filler that was rejected for the first edition. Interestingly, the focus of the second book shifts from seriously dull people doing idiotic things with predictable outcomes. It shifts to average people dying from too common bad luck. And that's not funny - just sad. This book left me cranky & paranoid.(If you do buy this version, I'd suggest ripping out the 4 or 5 funny entries and folding them into the first \\"Darwin Awards\\".

Wendy Northcutt also writes The Darwin Awards and The Darwin Awards 3.

Wendy Northcutt and her Darwin Awards team is one of those voices.Northcutt presents confirmed incidents, known urban legends and personal accounts (all carefully dated, labeled and annotated) to form a highly readable and very entertaining gumbo of the lunacy of human beings. The Darwin Awards, of course, are given to those who have improved the human gene pool by removing themselves from it. The stupider, more unlikely and bizarre the manner, the better.From the guy who played Russian Roulette (with deadly results) to impress girls, to the guy who literally lost his head looked down a malfunctioning fireworks tube, to the Egyptian shepherd shot by one of his own flock, the examples of human carelessness, arrogance and stupidity just keep coming.Northcutt is doing a real public service; not only helping the rest of us separate fact from fancy, but (hopefully) teaching her readers that being careful is not just prudent but can help them keep their heads."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"The first volume of this series was great. This volume is considerably weaker. I can't believe it, but perhaps the gene pool has thinned out most of the idiots so there isn't as much stupidity to report."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"This second book in the series continues to commemorate people who remove themselves from the gene pool in spectacularly brainless ways. Although it is intended for readers who can find humor in someone's demise, the stories within are for the most part pitiful rather than funny. How many stories can one read about people whose lack of common sense causes them to be electrocuted, drowned, shot, or crushed? Is riding a scooter at night in dark clothing without a helmet and subsequently being hit by a passing pickup funny? Or dying of shrapnel wounds while juggling a live hand grenade? Or drowning in a bathtub by slipping on a bar of soap while practicing walking on water? Yes, these are typical examples of the awards, which honor impressively idiotic deaths, perhaps, but not really humorous ones.It also appears that the supply of anecdotes on failing Life 101 is running low, since the book has little substance. Perhaps the original concept from the web site has played itself out. Of the over 100 stories, less than half of them are confirmed Darwin Award winners. The rest are unconfirmed Darwins, honorable mentions (where the award recipients are still swimming in the gene pool), urban legends, unconfirmed personal accounts, disqualified awards, and a series of &quot;classic&quot; winners from past years. As if that is not enough padding, the book also contains discussions on evolution, safety, biodiversity, and other unrelated topics. Sprinkled throughout are dozens of inane sayings such as &quot;I don't think, therefore I am not&quot; and &quot;Another sap from the tree of life.&quot; And finally, there is an appendix containing Internet etiquette.I suggest you save your money and go to the author's web site instead. The best of the awards listed in this book are there, along with many others. If you want to read about some really funny prizes, read &quot;Ig Nobel Prizes&quot; instead.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"This book is the second in the series and takes a look at human stupidity which either results in the stupid one's demise or at least sterilises them so that they can not reproduce. All entries have previously appeared on the official Darwin Awards website and the entire last chapter of this book's entries appeared in the original book as well. The fact that the funniest entries appear in both books would be the reason I would recommend purchasing this one over its predecessor if you are not buying the entire series.The author has realised by this book that 30 page introductions did not impress many and has thankfully drastically reduced them in this sequel. Unlike the original, this book contains a lot more myths which the author acknowledges have been proved false which may not be what you were after if true tales of stupid human demise was what you were after. If this is the case definitely get the first book instead.This book also contains a section where the author has retracted Darwin awards for entries on their website which were not Darwin awards. Following the reasoning behind those decisions if you applied it to most entries in both books then they would also be rejected so one would think if you are going to do this sort of book you should stand by your decisions no matter how much abuse you cop. Everyone who has died will probably at least have someone who loved them so abuse is something that comes hand in hand with this kind of writing. I just find this chapters inclusion pointless. Both books are not as funny as you might expect them to be but they do have some funny moments. If you are looking for a book to keep you laughing hysterically from cover to cover then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a book with a few laughs then either this or the first book will be sufficient."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"I was a HUGE fan of the so-called Darwin awards when they were circulating around on the Internet. I love the notion of morons offing themselves through their own stupidity. Now that someone has decided to cash in by putting them in book form, they have unfortunately lost their charm. Problem number one is that in order to pad the material for now two full volumes, lots of stuff has been put in that doesn't belong. Many of these so-called \\"winners\\" don't deserve Darwins because either 1). they didn't die or 2). the story itself is either unverified or an actual urban legend. The author also throws in a lot of stupid criminal anecdotes, which also don't deserve Darwins and are the same exact stories that have previous appeared in things like News of the Weird.The other comment I would make is that the Darwin Awards were written up to much funnier effect when they were being posted anonymously on the Internet. Author Wendy Northcutt has actually managed to, uh, drain the life right out of them with her unfunny prose.Overall, get 'em from the 'net and don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"This book is the most blatant case of authorial padding I've ever seen.

There's loads of white space on the pages, occasionally punctuated by non-sequitur quotes and proverbs.Northcutt further inflates the page count by including self-indulgent, digressive essays (labeled \\"Discussions\\") on topics unrelated to anything else in the book. In the worst of these, Northcutt speculates on the disruption in the world's food supply that would result from damage to the \\"transportation infrastructure,\\" then smugly concludes that she is \\"fairly safe\\" in California because she can hike to an agricultural region!Northcutt also includes a section of gruesome incidents that don't qualify for awards because the victims were too young, mentally ill, or otherwise didn't deserve their fates. If they didn't qualify, why are they included?I could forgive all of this if the book was funny; it isn't.

Three of the mutilation examples have a sexual context and are pretty gross.If you find fatal and grisly mishaps funny, you will enjoy the book greatly. In fact, this has to be the best articulated book ever written about stupid ways to die and lose fertility. Anyone will feel smarter and better about themselves after reading these stories!This book is about people \\"removing themselves from the gene pool in sublimely idiotic fashion\\" in &#8220;true accidental blunders.&#8221; The incidents involve ways that people &#8220;unthinkingly engineer their own downfalls, oblivious to warning signs that the rest of us automatically heed.&#8221;The book's premise is very well framed to put you in a humorous mood. The idea is that when people do stupid things that get them killed or keep them from having children, they thus perform a service by improving the gene pool for the remaining humans. Ms. Northcutt uses many witty essays and quotes to emphasize this point, and establishes the mood well.She has rules for these awards. To win the Darwin Award, you must (1) die or be unable to procreate after the incident, (2) show &#8220;an astounding misapplication of common sense,&#8221; (3) cause your own downfall, (4) have the ability to use sound judgment (are not too young or permanently mentally impaired) and (5) have the incident verified by someone else. If you don't meet all these tests, you can still get an honorable mention, or be described as an urban legend or a personal account. I thought these distinctions made good sense, because the story's focus and credibility weighs heavily on the interest it creates for the reader drawn to this subject.In an improvement over The Darwin Awards, Ms. Northcutt has shared feedback from her readers challenging the veracity of various urban legends, personal accounts, and honorable mentions. As a result, this book is tighter than The Darwin Awards.In another improvement, the stories much more carefully document the victim&#8217;s involvement with illegal drugs and alcohol than in The Darwin Awards. In this way, the cautionary lesson about using these substances is brought home more correctlyThe stories are grouped around themes: violating the seven deadly sins, women as the genetically removed party, water misadventures, problems with technology, men acting macho, misadventures with animals, explosions, and criminal capers. There is also a chapter on stories that do not qualify, and a dozen of the all-time favorites of on-line readers...I rated the book down one star, though, because the average humor level here was not as good as in The Darwin Awards. Almost all of the examples came from 1998-2001, so there were not as many examples to choose from. I also think the verification process needs some further work. In many cases, it is in a publication or broadcast news report (which may have an incentive to \\"improve\\" the stories to make them better, and sell more issues). Finally, I think the verified examples are vastly more interesting than the fables. I would like to see a version in the future that is only made up of verified cases. I estimate that less than a quarter of these examples were verified.I came away with two new themes from reading this book. Guns need to be treated with much more respect. The deaths and dismemberment from guns occur with considerable frequency here. The other theme is that people develop so much self-confidence in their abilities that they decide that the &#8220;rules&#8221; do not apply to them.Be cautious, rather than daring, so you can live to enjoy the next book in this humorous, cautionary series!"},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"I really enjoyed the first &quot;Darwin&quot; installment, but Darwin II does not cut it. First of all, too much of the book is filler (author's opinions &amp; editorializing, as well as boring discussions of evolutionary theory), and not enough awards are presented. About 40 percent of this book is chaff, with 60 percent consisting of award cases. What really upset me, however, is that of the 60 percent of this book devoted to presenting actual Darwin Awards, an entire chapter consists of repeats from the first volume! Northcutt begins this chapter by saying &quot;here enjoy some repeats of your favorite Darwins from my first book&quot; or words to that effect. What a consumer rip off! Why would anyone want to pay twice to read the same stories! If I hadn't already thrown my receipt away, this one would be going back to the bookstore for a full refund. What invariably happens in movie sequels is that sooner or later the producers make one too many trips to the well, and you end up with something as awful as &quot;Jaws 3&quot; for example. Well, the fatal trip to the well appears to have already been made with the Darwin series. Let the buyer beware."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"The Darwin Awards II is a great book that shows just what can happen when people fail to use common sense. It's filled with well-written, cautionary tales of people who did astoundingly stupid things and paid the ultimate price: death, or in some less drastic cases, sterility.If this were the only thing this book had, it would still be a good book. But this book offers far more than that. In addition to these tales (some certified and some not and both are clearly marked), there are Honorable Mentions (people who did stupid things but didn't pay the ultimate price, but who still might in the future) and Personal Accounts. The book is also sprinkled with the author's wisdom, applicable quotes and each chapter opens with a discussion of a topic related to the subject of the chapter. The book also integrates well with the website, where you can voice your opinion on the book or stories in it, submit new stories, or read more about a particular story in the book, or a topic related to it.As the book says, the grimness of some of these tales makes it such that it may be that it's best read in small doses. But whether you learn something, or just laugh, you'll love The Darwin Arwards II."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"If you read the first of this series, you really needn't bother with this one. Unlike most series out there, it makes no difference which order you read these in. Just a collection of stories of people who are too stupid to be alive, and aren't. However, one glaring flaw in this book is the constant listings of tales that are &quot;unconfirmed by Darwin&quot;. If the story is unconfirmed, essentially meaning it is untrue, why put it in a book of &quot;true stories&quot;. A few of these false Darwin's would be OK, but this book is nearly half full of these falsehoods. It was a little disappointing. However, it is amusing to read the tales and imagine what kind of morons would partake in such activities. Really you could read any of the books in this series; they are essentially the same, so if you have a choice between the 3 (so far) pick the cheapest.T"},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"The Second Edition of Darwin Awards is not nearly as funny as the first. It is usually the case that the sequel is a bit of a let down. This book is appropriate for its use, a book from which you can read a few pages each day.A good addition to this book is the &quot;Not A Darwin Award&quot; Chapter in which the author shows stories which were unable to receive a Darwin Award for various reason. If nothing else, this demonstrates the logic behind the awards. The book has many entertaining stories which demonstrate that there are a lot of stupid people in the world. It is all the more reason for the intelligent ones like us to be careful.My strongest objection to this book was chapter of recycled classic stories from the first edition. I would prefer to read new stories rather than ones I have already read. If somebody has not ready those stories, they really should buy the first edition. The second edition is also worth the price."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"Seldom have such valuable lessons been so enjoyable to learn. The stories contained within this book and its predecessor (&quot;Darwin Awards&quot;) are not only amusing, but valuable.As a school teacher I find that a brief story selected from within these books shared with the class periodically is not only enjoyable for all concerned, but can help instruct the students to use some minimal amount of reason in their daily endeavors.I find the quote contained in Northcut's first book to be the among the wisest things ever spoken; &quot;Only two things are infinite -- the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not so sure about the universe.&quot; Albert Einstein. Those words say it all, and Northcut has collected sundry examples to verify the accuracy of them in a delightful manner.Buy two copies -- one for yourself and one for a friend."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"Here is the much talked about Darwin awards, where dumb people do dumb things and usual end up dead. A lot of people have said that the book is hilarious, but actually, it's just okay. ... but It's meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite strike a chord with me. Still, it's definitedly a good way to kill time... Worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"This &quot;second&quot; edition contains several &quot;classic&quot; Darwin selections from the first book. There are a few good, new pieces in here, but mostly this book's a waste of time. Strictly a bathroom book."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"I picked this up for my Dad to read during his chemotherapy sessions. I read it first tho. I wasn't impressed.Tho not given a Darwin award, just honorable mention, the only truly notable one was LAWNCHAIR LARRY page 200. The very first Cluster ballooner. He was great. Google 'lawnchair larry'. He's in Wikipedia.This was my only Darwin Awards book. Maybe the first one was better. I don't think I'd do an inter-library loan to find out tho."},{"Title":"The Darwin Awards II - Unnatural Selection","review":"This book was funnier than the first one. It just made me laugh and laugh. I could never put it down. I took it with me everywhere I went just so that I could read another story of what someone did that was stupid. It is so funny to me of how dumb some people can be. They dont even think about what they are doing before they do it. Like one lady who was mad at her ex-lover so she pulled out a knife and stabbed him. The worst part was that he was piloting the plane they were in. She did not think that one through. That is not even the funniest of stories that they have in the book. This will be the best book that you ever buy."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I wish I'd read Dr. Kotler's book prior to having surgery. If I'd known half the important information in this book, I would have been better informed, researched differently, chosen a more appropriate doctor, and, ultimately, avoided the poor cosmetic surgery I received.Dr. Kotler's book describes how to make the necessary choices when considering cosmetic surgery. His book steps the reader through the process of choosing and consulting with a qualified doctor; explains common surgical procedures and their distinctions, the viewing of before-and-after photos, and the necessity of computer imaging; clarifies how to assess surgical costs; covers considerations for operating facility choices, the administration of anesthesia, and the after-care patients should expect; as well as treatments for aging skin, FAQs about surgery, and so much more. Additionally, there are accompanying commentaries and before-and-after pictures from actual patients.This is an easy to read book that covers all the fine points of cosmetic surgery. I spent many months researching cosmetic surgery and doctors before choosing a surgeon and agreeing with the procedure techniques he would use. Even with my careful study, there is so much that Dr. Kotler's book educates the reader on first, that I didn't discover or fully understand until after undergoing my own surgery.Enhancement of one's personal appearance through cosmetic surgery should be a good thing, not a tragedy. The risk of not making an informed choice is too great. And you will not find many doctors who will fully explain their procedures, take the time educate you, answer your questions, or even tell you what questions you should be asking.Dr. Kotler's book should be required reading for any one considering cosmetic surgery. It will make you a better-educated consumer and allow you to make the most informed research to choose the right cosmetic surgeon."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"after researching dr.kotler and finding out how good he was,i went on amazon and found his book and all of the great reviews.being in a new state and not knowing anyone or anything i needed all of the help i could get.what a great result!you absolutely must read this book before doing anything.i am now 16 days post surgery and i am very pleased.i had a rhino and an upper eyelid.the only reason i gave the book a 4 rating is because the pain and healing are really underplayed by everyone including dr. kotler.although everyone is differant it was very painful and healing is slow.but i have a perfect nose and my eyes are great.you must,i repeat must read this book before having surgery."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"For any one considering cosmetic surgery, this book is highly informative and full of important information. I had heard great reviews about this book and it lives up to every one! I feel much more prepared to proceed with the surgery I have been considering. Dr. Kotler's book helped to ease my concerns and allay my anxiety. I would suggest this book to anyone wanting more information about cosmetic surgery."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I have been considering having a face and neck lift for just over a year. In hopes of learning more, I have watched several of the reality TV programs. Unfortunately, while the results are spectacular and the programs entertaining, they failed to provide me with specific and realistic information. I heard about Dr. Kotler's book from a friend who said it was a teriffic resource and so I purchased a copy. The book provided me with the very information I was looking for. It was specific, detailed and an enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I read this book and was compelled to write an on-line review having just recently finished it. This book if super if you are considering cosmetic surgery. In fact, I can't imaging how anyone could consider having surgery without reading this book first. I feel entirely prepared and ready to proceed after reading this book. I see that Dr. Kotler's next book, The Essential Cosmetic Surgery Companion, will be published this October. It appears to be a workbook for patients to take with to their consultation. I eagerly anticipate it publication. What a great idea for a another book!"},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I found this book to be quite simplistic and full of self-serving letters to the author about what a fine surgeon he is. It supplies information that is so basic that it is almost worthless. He supplies lists of questions to ask a potential surgeon, but does not discuss how to evaluate the answers one might receive. A far better book is &quot;A Smart Woman's Guide to Plastic Surgery&quot; which is full of helpful and specific information."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon is a must for anyone seriously considering surgery. The internet is good 4 general info, but if you want to know about choosing the right DR., evaluating before/after photos than this book is 4 you. It just brings up things, that you wouldn't think of, but is essential 4 having a successful surgery and making informed decisions."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I looked at all the books on the market available to help me consult with plastic surgeons, and frankly this was unique. I had bought a couple of others which, while they were very good as far as the background information and factual information about procedures, neither gave me what I needed. What I really wanted, and found out was even more important than I thought, was questions to ask. I wouldn't have known to ask the questions that this book poses. It probably makes sense to buy other books, but be sure to buy this one, and now I understand why the author called it a \\"companion\\". You need to take it with you and work with it."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"After considering having plastic surgery for quite a long time, I thought it was time for me to do some research.I did not want to just move forward without some education and options on my side. I bought Dr. Kotler's book, \\"Secrets of A Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon\\", and this opened my eyes. I felt that the book was clear and honest. It made me feel more comfortable and confident about making the decision to have plastic surgery. I am thankful that this book was available. I am happy with the fact that I had a clear path once I read this book. Thank you."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I was disappointed with a couple of the other books on the subject because, to be honest, they didn't have very many before-and-after photo samples. A book without photographs, frankly, is low on its potential to help a consumer, in my opinion. The Secrets book was loaded with before-and-after photos with appropriate explanations, and I think that is very important. I thought the quality of the photos was very good, and that is also very important. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"Dr. Kotler's book is filled with valuable information for anyone considering plastic surgery. It's easy to read, well organized, and to the point. There are several other useful books on the market, but I found Kotler's book contained all the information I found in other books and his is nicely written.Before you make a decision or even an appointment for consultation, take a look at this book. It will save you a lot of time and make you a better informed consumer."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"Thank you Dr. Kotler for publishing an extremely useful book on cosmetic surgery, especially for us Canadians. Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon helped me find eight highly qualified cosmetic surgeons in the US with over 10 years experience, which I short listed to four. After reading the book and consulting with the four doctors I short listed, I learned what surgery I really require (and do not require) along with all the associated costs and risks. I also learned to first try collagen injections and medical pigmentation to reduce wrinkles and scars before considering cosmetic surgery, such as fat grafting. Thanks again, Dr Kotler for your very informative book."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"[...] After reading the book, I felt as if I had just consulted with Dr. Kotler. The book is packed with everything one considering cosmetic surgery could possibly want to know. The book was very thorough and very engaging. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about cosmetic surgery or just simply in the mood for a good read about a very interesting subject."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"As a news reporter, I am always looking for the most understandable and comprehensive information on the subject at hand, so when I started seriously thinking about cosmetic surgery, I went to the bookstore and started searching for answers. When I found, bought and read Dr. Robert Kotler's Secrets Of A Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon, even though I live thousands of miles away, I felt pretty much like he was there to comfort and guide me. He offered the pros and cons and seemed to really care about his profession with a passion and care if his reader had a successful, safe experience. Whether you are thinking about some type of surgery, or have already made up your mind, I would recommend reading Dr. Kotler's book because face-it, when you are about to do something this important, you need all the support and all the facts you can find."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I have been considering cosmetic surgery for some time now. I wasn't quite ready to begin consulting with doctors but wanted to start learning about my different options. I purchased Dr. Kotler's book after it was receommended to me by two other friends who had read the book prior to having surgery. I ordered the book and just finished reading it. I feel well equipped to start the surgeon interviewing process thanks to Dr. Kotler's book. I had many reservations and this book helped to allay most of them. I feel more confident than ever that I am ready to go ahead and start the process of consulting with doctors.

After reading this book, you will have a greater understanding of the various cosmetic surgical procedures and most importantly, how to select the surgeon who is most capable of performing your procedure.

This will definitely help you to save a lot of money, time and make you a better informed person. It even describes many medical conditions and various options you have to treat them. Dr Kotler describes medical conditions in such a way that even the layman can understand them easily. This book helped me to locate a couple of highly experienced cosmetic surgeons in the US. I am extremely sure that without this book I would have ended up with somebody else for my medical problem.I read the book and I thought, this doesn't sound too bad, but I found myself miserable. I just was frustrated after a week....it was very regimented. I did benefit by eliminating my coffee habit with the help of a wonderful coffee substitute called soyffee (www.s o y c o f f e e .com) Its made from soybeans which is a godsend for those troubled with hot flashes like myself. Another book I bought was the South Beach Diet book. I read that book and found the plan to be made up of things I would eat and the items were normal grocery store items so no hunting at the health food stores or buying online."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I have wanted cosmetic surgery for a while now, however I did not know where to begin. I was in the library and came across this book by Dr. Robert Kotler. What a fabulous book! It explained everything. A must read for anyone considering plastic surgery."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"What I like about Dr. Kolters book is how he stresses to find a qualified, board-certified doctor and what to expect before surgery and after. He explains what the Dr. does for each procedure (what he will do to your body to do that face lift, chin implant etc).Most of all he tells you the real risks involved even with a highly qualified Doctor that many doctors will not discuss- such as not taking to the implant placed in your body- your body might reject it or it can shift etc. I think that is extremely crucial to know. Unfortunately a lot of surgeons out there won't convey the real risks. Dr. Kolter gives you the needed information to understand what different plastic surgeries entail- so the consumer has the crucial knowledge to make a decision that might be right or not right for them. I respect him as a surgeon and learned a lot from this book"},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I'm a librarian and so I've assessed incoming books.

I was amazed at how much I didn't know and how crucial it is to know especially when there's some new &quot;cutting edge&quot; procedure every 5 minutes. Kotler is entertaining, easy to read, not at all technical and his desire to really help prospective patients (and not just his) really shines through. Too bad this wasn't around before Michael Jackson became the poster boy for how not to proceed."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon: The Expert's Guide to Safe, Successful Surgery","review":"I wish this book had been available when I had plastic surgery.

Dr. Kotler explains procedures in laymen's terms, not in \\"doctor speak\\". So you understand what he's saying.

I am considering breast augmentation and felt it important to get a woman doctor's perspective also. Each book complements the other and actually I was motivated to buy both because Amazon offered a good deal when both were purchased together. I liked this book's very folksy, \\"down-home,\\" \\"here is what you need to know\\" style. It seems that the author is talking directly to the reader.

I found the explanation about why some people look bad after cosmetic surgery to make sense. Understanding just that makes the book valuable. After all, who wants to come out like Michael Jackson or some of these other celebs who are not good examples of cosmetic surgery. What that section taught me was that the key to all of this is picking the right surgeon. Who is the right surgeon you ask?

In the book, Dr. Kotler carefully examines all aspects of cosmetic surgery, from the purely technical to the highly personal, that may be pertinent to a patient's understanding of the field. The ease of readability and comprehension of the text is valuable, a prospective patient can get all the information that they can possibly need in this book and most importantly understand all of it.

The explanation made sense; I never would have figured it out. That was enough of a tip-off that the book had value and that I needed to learn more before starting my own research process.

What is unique is that it seems to take the guess work out of the entire process of selecting a surgeon, which obviously is the most important of the decisions to be made. What I learned is that the world of \\" cosmetic surgeons\\" is inhabited by a wide range of different specialists; the variation in qualification can be surprising if not scary. I sense that as cosmetic procedures become more popular that even more MDs will enter the field. That will make the doctor- selecting even harder.

Since many of my Baby Boomer friends (no longer babies) are now considering their own vanity nips, I am purchasing a number of Dr. Kotler's &quot;survival guides&quot; to give as presents lest my friends make the same mistake I did.

The book did me a great service on two fronts. One: it gave me lots of practical, really helpful knowledge. Two: it has convinced me that I would be silly not to ask my friends about their experiences.

The book tells both good and bad things about cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic surgery's successes and its failures seems to get equal billing. The honesty alone makes the purchase worthwhile. There is a lot more to the cosmetic surgery world than most of us would imagine. It seems complicated and not always predictable. Many would like us to believe it is not a difficult process but I don't think so. The road is a little more curvy than that and this Dr. Kotler tells it like it is. It is a reality check.

I love Barbara Cooney's &quot;Miss Rumphius&quot;, and this adaptation of the Nun's Priest's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; was a delightful way to introduce my children to some classic literature. My girls got a glimpse of medieval times from the story and the illustrations, and I loved the simple way Barbara Cooney brought out the industry and economy of the poor widow as she takes care of her children, livestock and house. The pictures are precise and brilliant, but not overpowering. The description of Chanticleer elevates him from an ordinary rooster to a work of art. The story has the virtue of pointing out the folly of listening to flattery as well as the value of quick thinking on Chanticleer's part in a perilous situation. I didn't like the reference to trusting in dreams (nightmares), but felt I could incorporate it into a teaching point as I read it to my children. All in all, I am glad to add it to our collection."},{"Title":"Chanticleer and the Fox","review":"Chanticleer and the Fox, an adaptation of the Nun's Priest's Tale, is a simple and delightful tale with a moral (or three) at the end. Chanticleer and the other characters learn about the dangers of failing to be watchful, talking when one should be silent, and trusting in flattery. Barbara Cooney's illustrations are simple and warm, yet she gives a glimpse of what life might have looked like for a family in the Middle Ages. The book is suitable for an early reader or for reading aloud to younger children, although older children and adults would enjoy it as well. If you want more Chaucer for older children, without the rhyme or Middle English, you might want to try The Canterbury Tales, Retold by Geraldine McCaughrean, Illustrated by Victor G. Ambrus. Some material in that book, however, might need some parental guidance for younger readers. Chanticleer and the Fox is appropriate for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Chanticleer and the Fox","review":"Who would have thought that a Canterbury Tale would prove appropriate for children? Illustrator Barbara Cooney has adapted the \\"Nun's Priest's Tale\\" to picture book format, turning it into a tale that warns against flattery. I'm just glad she didn't think of adapting \\"The Wife of Bath\\" tale. Thank goodness for small favors, eh?In this story a widow and her two daughters live by themselves in the countryside. The focus of the story rests squarely on their cocky (ha ha) rooster Chanticleer. A bird with a harem (the book flaps description, not mine) of seven hens, Chanticleer has a fairly restive life. One day, however, a sly fox comes with flattering words and tricks poor Chanticleer into closing his eyes. It is only through the rooster's quick thinking that he is able to escape the fox and get away.I've never read the original tale, so I'm not certain how this story adds up against it. Needless to say, I found it a funny amalgamation of several Aesop stories. Flattery was always utilized by Aesop in ways similar to this tale. In fact, Chanticleer's escape from the fox is nothing so much as an alternate version of the old story about the fox and the crow with a hunk of cheese. Cooney's illustrations do much to help this tale along. Using gorgeous pen and ink drawings and selective sections of color, this books at times looks like nothing so much as a collection of cheery Edward Gorey prints. The tale is quick and clean and I imagine many children will be fond it this particular retelling. All in all, an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Chanticleer and the Fox","review":"Imagine a wonderful, timeless fairytale to read to your youngster.

He started out a Presbyterian, but later was an Anglican vicar. This book covers just about as much as could be expected about the Jewish social life at the time of Jesus. Edersheim makes use of Josephus, Philo, the Misnah, the Talmud, and the Bible to sketch out such things as what life was like in Galilee verses Jerusalem, dating and marriage, how death was handled and viewed, the Pharisees, as well as how they differed from the Essenes and Sadduccees. What is most interesting is his sketch of the Essenes, because Alfred wrote well before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

A great book!"},{"Title":"The First Fast Draw","review":"The plot of the book is when Collin Baker decides he needs to go back to east Texas, to regain and farm his fathers' land. The problem with him doing this is that when his family first moved to east Texas he became known as a troublemaker. He ended up beating up a bunch of boys that were older than he was, but he was doing it in self-defense, therefore he has many enemies in East Texas. Also the carpetbaggers and the Reconstructionists have other plans for his land. Collin Baker returns to his home, but the first night he is home he already runs into trouble. At first, Baker thinks he beat his enemies by himself but learns very fast that he needs friends and to learn to shoot very fast and quick. He quickly found Bob Lee, Bill Longley, and Matt Kirby, who were also having the same problems. Bob Lee is a character who is always ready to fight and looking for action. Bill Longley grew up with Collin, so they knew each other and were also one of Collins few friends. Matt Kirby is woods men that stayed in the swamps trapping. The four of them hide in the woods were nobody knows of. They train and Collin keeps on getting better and better with his gun. Finally its time for them to regain what is rightfully theirs. They kill of bunch of their enemies, but Collin gets caught in the process. He gets thrown in jail and is scheduled for a hanging the next day. While he is in jail he doesn't worry about his problems but worries about his friends trying to get him out and getting caught in the process. He friends come anyways and they all escape. They know now that they need to flee the area so they all head out west together and start over. I believe the main theme of the story is to know how good your friends are to you. Never let anything happen to your friend that you wouldn't want to happen to you. Know that your friends will be there for you when you need him the most.

And that well may have been true! But as we all know, history is written by the victors in any conflict.Louis L'Mour's \\"The First Fast Draw\\" is a romanticized interpretation of Baker's life. Like the historically accurate books of the Revolutionary War period by Kenneth Roberts, L'Mour shows us Baker's life from his own perspective. Like all of L'Mour's books, the writing is superb, the characterization excellent and the story is compelling. L'Mour was known for his accuracy in describing the Western landscape, and for his careful research. Written in the first person, \\"The First Fast Draw\\" is an idealized portrait of a temperamental, physically gifted man who struggled with his inner demons and eventually conquered them.After reading the First Fast Draw, you may experience, as I did, a longing for times past and the realization that the risk-averse, corrupt and hypocritical society that has evolved from Baker's time in 1869 is a far cry from the \\"land of the free and the home of the brave.\\""},{"Title":"The First Fast Draw","review":"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it immensely. Recently working in Texas, I decided to do a little background on the \\"real\\" Cullen Baker. Turns out Mr. L'Amours research is not as careful as he and others would have us believe. I understand the concept of poetic liscense but this isn't even close. The Cullen Baker of history bears absolutely no resemblance to the man immortalized in L'Amours novel. It would appear that L'Amour only bothered to reference a few popular stories and none of the solid historical records available on Baker. Cullen Baker was a vicious, opportunistic thug who bore no allegiance to anything or anyone but himself. The concept of fair play didn't seem a part of his makeup. There is no reliable historical evidence that Baker was ever a quickdraw artist. Looking for a good story? Read the \\"First Fast Draw\\".

Still, they made a television series based on the books so I figured there must be something right about the series. Having just finished the second book in the series, I'm baffled.In The Wild Island, Jemima heads to a remote Scottish island for a quiet vacation. When she gets there, her host is dead and his odd family is virtually at each other's throats. Turns out the dead host thought he was the legitmate heir to Bonnie Prince Charlie. More deaths follow. Of course, things are sorted out in the end with Jemima in the middle of it - though I'm not sure if she made much of a difference.Fundamentally, my problem with this series is that I just don't care for Jemima. She isn't a warm character. There is no humor and she takes herself very seriously. I am particularly troubled by her habit of falling into bed with married men (not a bright idea even in these liberated times) and her total lack of remorse. This make two men in two books. I'm hardly a prude but this plot device leaves me cold.Bottom-line: There's probably a reason why this series faded into the sunset after six or seven books."},{"Title":"All Around Fitness","review":"This book is jam-packed with everything you need to know to get started building the body you've always dreamt of.

It was all about how the dot-coms were blowing away traditional businesses with their \\"market-share at any price\\" growth strategies. Then the book started getting interesting.This revised version has the expected mea culpa in the Preface, deletes and replaces chapter 1 of the previous addition, and focuses on what is really valuable in Moore's work. The new chapter 1 highlights Moore's GAP-CAP distinction. GAP (Competitive-Advantage Gap) is what shows up in the numbers, differential success in the here-and-now marketplace. CAP (Competitive-Advantage Period) is a more subtle concept, referring to the ability of a company to sustain its advantages against competitors over time. It underpins future competitive advantage. The combination of a company's GAP and CAP is the real driver of its share price (discounted future earnings), and therefore of shareholder value. Moore write persuasively and in some detail about how this all works.Chapter 2 explores the second important idea, the CORE-CONTEXT distinction. Here Core is defined as those activities which are central to the company's marketplace differentiation: effective action here directly impacts the share price. Context activities are those which need to be done, and done well, but which the market gives you little credit for. Administrative HR, for example, in companies which are not HR specialists. Moore argues that these are candidates for outsourcing to companies for whom they ARE core competencies. Again Moore elaborates on these basic distinctions.Subsequent chapters explain the \\"Competitive Advantage Grid\\", which is new in this version. Here, the standard analysis of competitive advantage (product leadership vs. customer-focus vs. price/operational excellence - with a new category for disruptive innovation) is cross-referenced to strategies for marketplace differentiation to create a 4 x 4 matrix on which your company can be placed.The remaining part of the book returns to Moore's familiar themes of the evolution-model of technology-based markets: early-market, chasm, bowling-alley, tornado, main-street. Moore is looking to integrate some of his ideas from the early part of the book into this framework, with a fair degree of success. He closes by discussing business cultures and \\"culture management\\", but here the theoretical framework is noticeably weaker. William Bridge's recently re-issued \\"The Character of Organizations\\" is a useful complement to what Moore has to say, here.Overall, I think this book has its greatest value as a conceptual framework for strategic marketing and corporate strategy in hi-tech. I have personally found its ideas extraordinarily useful in telecoms. Reviewers of Moore's earlier books have indicated that some non-trivial work has to be done to apply these ideas to concrete cases. Clearly, some of Moore's rather black and white recommendations have to be nuanced in practice, but as an accessible business strategy primer for the 21st century, I would say this book is essential."},{"Title":"Living on the Fault Line, Revised Edition : Managing for Shareholder Value in Any Economy","review":"\\"Living on the Fault Line\\" is an extension of Geoffrey Moore's previous books, \\"Crossing the Chasm\\" and \\"Inside the Tornado\\". It examines the various stages of a business, presents methods for managing shareholder value and creating sustainable competitive advantage, and begins to examine how cultural diversity can be used as a competitive strength. Although Moore does introduce business culture and the importance of culture management, his approach to competitive advantage continues to rely on stock price and information technology, distinguishing core and contextual processes, and understanding the impact of technology in causing market shifts. The book is well written and includes many useful diagrams and charts.With change increasing exponentially, we are living in an environment where understanding and dealing with change is increasingly difficult. While Moore's approach towards competition is traditional, he does provide tools for understanding the apparent chaos in today's environment."},{"Title":"Living on the Fault Line, Revised Edition : Managing for Shareholder Value in Any Economy","review":"Moore's treatment of the technology adoption lifecycle is fundamental in providing a context for clarifying business strategy. His \\"competitive advantage grid\\" provides a ready way to describe current state and future options. He extends the earlier work of by Treacy and Wiersema on value disciplines and takes the description of related organizational characteristics to another level with his discussion and charts on \\"modeling business cultures.\\"While many of these items are similar to the earlier edition, this revised edition is as this one goes beyond the internet bubble to address the concerns in any tough economy where the investor perspective becomes increasingly demanding and dominant.Moore explains that the business in the 21st century is changing requiring investment to incorporate the enabling technology that is becoming increasingly widespread and significant as well as the specialization of work that is becoming necessary to succeed. He also addresses the need for companies to focus on their \\"core\\" business functions and take care of the context in other ways, e.g. use of services, outsourcing, and so on.While Moore has primarily concerned himself with the technology sector, his insights in this book have relevance for all sectors and it remains a classic for helping clarify business strategy and direction."},{"Title":"The Grimace of Macho Raton: Artisans, Identity, and Nation in Late-Twentieth-Century Western Nicaragua","review":"Field is a lucid writer and as a result, this book is extremely readable [IF and only IF you like anthropology and/or cultural studies. It isn't for the average person who happens to be curious about la tierra pinolera.]HOWEVER, just what is the point of this book? I have read it more than once, and the book's objective really eludes me. On one level, Field seems to be arguing that during the &eacute;poca sandinista, indigenous artisans portrayed their identity in relation to the Sandinista political project. In contrast, in the post-sandinista era of the 1990s, Field claims that new kinds of identities emerged. But what does this have to do with nationalism? And furthermore, why should we believe thatEl G&uuml;eg&uuml;ense is really the most important representation of Nicaraguan nationalism?The really lucid and nicely written part of this book is Field's splendid analysis of the way in which successive generations of Nicaraguan authors have reinterpreted the text of El G&uuml;eg&uuml;ense according to the political context of the times. Field's chapter 1 should be read in conjunction with chapter 3 from John Beverley and Marc Zimmerman's book, Literature and Politics in the Central American Revolutions. In fact, Field's chapter on El G&uuml;eg&uuml;ense perhaps surpasses Beverley and Zimmerman, and that is no mean feat; they are truly masters in the field of cultural analysis, and Field equals them in that one chapter.BUTI am less convinced by Field's chapters in which he tries to relate the [so-called] &quot;tropes&quot; from El G&uuml;eg&uuml;ense to the everyday behaviors of Nicaraguans as they talk about their &quot;indigenous&quot; identity. For example, one of the &quot;tropes&quot; is that Nicaraguan Indians always resist the nation-state (page 185); another &quot;trope&quot; is that the main character in El G&uuml;eg&uuml;ense tricked the governor Tastuanes into giving him &quot;something for nothing&quot; and many Nicaraguans want to trick others into giving them &quot;something for nothing&quot; (page 225).How can one generalize from an ancient play dating from colonial times to the behavior of modern Nicaraguans? It doesn't seem convincing. Furthermore, we never really get a clear statement from Field about the relationship between indigenous identity and non-indigenous [mestizo] national identity. He seems to argue against Pablo Antonio Cuadra and others who portrayed El Gu&uuml;eg&uuml;ense as an expression of mestizaje or the racial mixing and assimilation of Nicaraguan Indians into a homogenous nation. Nevertheless, does Field mean that the play represents an unadulterated and pure &quot;indigenous&quot; identity that is clearly autonomous from mestizo nicaraguan identity? If that is so, then why do Nicaraguans identify so strongly with the image of the wily, crafty Indian merchant portrayed in the play?In any book about a phenomenon as complex as national identity, we should be wary of any neat and tidy argument. But nevertheless, there is no real line of argument or reasoning that emerges from Field's book. Field's extended conversations with Nicaraguan artisans do not really give us any sense of how the &quot;tropes&quot; of Nicaraguan culture might in fact impact the self-perceptions and behavior of real human beings in Nicaragua."},{"Title":"The English Revolution 1688-1689","review":"Professor G.M. Trevelyan (1876-1962) is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential British historians of the 20th-century. Specializing in the years of Stuart rule over Britain (1603-1714), Trevelyan's books are still considered \\"definitive\\" in the historiography of Stuart England; in fact, Trevelyan's works, such as his multi-volume account of Queen Anne's reign, often document under-examined topics. In 1938, Trevelyan authors the definitive account of England's so-called \\"Glorious Revolution\\" with The English Revolution, 1688-1689. Employing a rich, clear, literary narrative Trevelyan argues that James II is a tyrant whose obstinacy and stupidity leads to James' loss of the British throne. Moreover, Trevelyan argues the Revolution, which raises the power of Parliament at the monarch's expense, sets Britain on a course of relative stability and toward ascendancy in Europe.When one looks at the historiography of the Glorious Revolution, one finds a paucity of books devoted to the Revolution itself. The sixty-six years between the publication of Trevelyan's work and today have not produced another volume so comprehensive and readable. In other works, the Revolution tends to be covered as part of a Stuart biography or mentioned as being \\"important\\" in a survey of England or America in the late 17th-century. All the while, little new information is being collected and published in book form. Oftentimes, the Revolution serves as a line of demarcation, a place to start or end a study of English history. In the past few years, revisionist historians have challenged the notion of James II as tyrant, preferring a portrayal casting James as the victim of scheming daughters and their husbands (as is most notably found in Maureen Waller's popular Ungrateful Daughters, published in 2003 by St. Martins). Nevertheless, most British historians still hail Trevelyan's work as the \\"gold-standard\\" narrative of the Revolution. In fact, the book is still in print some 66 years after its initial publication.Since the book is accessible and clear, and one of the very few books in print devoted solely to the Glorious Revolution, Trevelyan's work retains great importance to British historiography. Trevelyan's interpretation and narrative style may seem quaint and old-fashioned, but the information gathered and presented by his work serves to enlighten the 21st-century mind as to the importance of England's Glorious Revolution."},{"Title":"The English Revolution 1688-1689","review":"This slim volume by Trevelyan is one of the most gripping history books I have ever read. In 130 pages, the author succinctly describes the various interest groups involved, and how they interacted during the revolution and its aftermath.If you think you might be interested in the English revolution, but are concerned that some authors' treatment of the topic might be dry and unengaging, I recommend that you start with this book.

Basically James II was an inept leader who attacked his base of support (Tories) and alienated the Whigs. When William I landed and advanced on London, James II gave up and fled. If he would have stayed, he and his son would have ruled Great Britain with the consent of Parliament. Trevelyan does a good job of detailing how James II lost his throne.This is an academic read. There is little dramatic actions in this book. It is simply an explanation of how a leader should not rule. This is also a short read for someone looking to understand the Glorious Revolution."},{"Title":"JUGGLING : FROM START TO STAR","review":"I FOUND JUGGLING FROM START TO STAR TO BE VERY EASY TO FOLLOW AND IT HELPED ME QUITE A BIT WITH ALL MY JUGGLING.

All you need to do with the ball in each hand is gain control (catch) and change direction (toss). But, you must do it quickly because you have a ball in the air that will need attention very soon.NONE OF THE BALLS NEED CONSTANT ATTENTION.Back at the office: you have several projects at ay give time. As a project manager, you need to insure that each project gets all the attention it needs at just the right time, and move on to the next project.See, over simplified."},{"Title":"JUGGLING : FROM START TO STAR","review":"who has grown into a lovely young lady. fact is folks, a juggling book isn't realistic, as you need to see juggling to mimic and learn. though when I got this I was terrible, so it was helpful for a little while. truthfully, if you can, videos and dvds (dvds for loop factor) is the way to go so you can see it, SEE IT, over and over. a book forces you to visualize, whereas when you start juggling you just want to SEE IT, so you can mimic and learn, then get the form down and all that stuff, even the simple stuff like a 3 ball cascade/reverse, 4 ball fountain, you need to see these over and over. but the humor in the book is good, and the pictures are good, so that's why the 5 star, and the daughter...........sorry I dazed for a second there, for a true beginner (less than 3 months), it's worth it."},{"Title":"Nachtjager, Volume Two: Luftwaffe Night Fighter Units 1943-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"David Williams wraps up his two-volume history of Luftwaffe nightfighters with this well-done summary of the last two years of the war.Paradoxically the July 1943 Hamburg firestorm mission wherein the RAF used chaff to blind German radars so traumatized Germany's military leadership that it served as an impetus for the development of new nightfighter tactics and weapons to replace the discredited Himmelbett system. Zahme Sau and Wilde Sau tactics coupled with new radars checkmated the advantage temporarily bestowed on RAF bombers by 'Window.' The battles that followed became a see-saw race as RAF and Luftwaffe engineers and aircrews developed new radars, counter tactics, different weaponry (Schrage Musik) and so on. Though German nightfighters inflicted punishing losses on RAF raiders on many occasions following the Hamburg raid, a number of factors including superior Allied technology and fuel shortages ground down the Nachtjagers.Williams quite correctly points out that the turning point in this deadly see-saw campaign occurred not over Germany but rather at an English airfield! In July 1944 a disoriented Luftwaffe crew landed at an RAF base, thus presenting the British with a fully operational Ju88G equipped with the three radar systems that had made the nightfighters so deadly.Given such a wide canvas, Williams does a good job of summarizing those momentous years as well as highlighting well-known nightfighter aces such as Werner Streib, Heinz Schnaufer and Wilhelm Johnen. The comprehensive text includes ten first-person accounts of night kills by German pilots and their RAF victims.As with Volume One, this book is brimming with photos and artwork - over 190 black & white shots, 11 color pix including one showing a Schrage Musik-equipped Fw 189(!) and 16 color profiles of Me 110, He 219, Ju 88, FW 190, Do 217 and Me 262 night fighters.All in all, this two-volume set is an well-written, visually appealing introduction to the subject. Luftwaffe fans will definitely want to pick up the set!"},{"Title":"Nachtjager, Volume Two: Luftwaffe Night Fighter Units 1943-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"It is a picture book that is sort of on the tough side of reading since it is more of a narative than a historical book. Good stuff though and great drawings. It could have had more on the machines and less on the people."},{"Title":"Nachtjager, Volume Two: Luftwaffe Night Fighter Units 1943-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"The Royal Air Force quickly learned in World War II that their planes were not suitable for daylight operation, so turned to night bombing. The Luftwaffe then had no choice but to begin to develop a night fighter system that would offer at least some defenst against the bombers.By 1943 the war of the technical wizzards was well underway. For the Germans this meant radar systems, including both ground based to get the fighter close to the bomber, and airborne equipmen, usually mounted on twin engine planes such as the Me-110, the Ju-88, the Fw-189, He 219. To these were added a smaller number of single engine fighters, the Me-109, Me262 and Fw-190, some with and wome without radar.This book has some text to explain the pictures, but it features a spectacular set of photographs of the night fighting planes of the Luftwaffe in the later years of the war. It also has several pictures taken of planes after the war as found in abandoned airfields or as they were removed to allied bases. Finally there is a set of detailed drawings of the planes to show details often missed in the photographs."},{"Title":"KitchenAid Mixers and Attachments: Recipes and Instructions","review":"I bought this cookbook for my sister-in-law who lost her original book that came with her KitchenAid mixer.

They have a brief affair, but Alec, not knowing Libby loves him, thinks its better for her to move on with her life without him, and so dumps her and gets into a marriage of convenience, even though he loves Libby. fast forward eight years, and Libby returns to the island of her lost innocence, with Alec's eight year old son in tow. She meets up with Alec again, of course, and shocks him by his surprise off spring. Alec is consumed by guilt, but wants her back and pulls all the stops to get her back. This is a sweet romance with two people with a long history but a lot of love who find each other again. They never stopped loving each other, and its apparent they'r meant to be. This is a very satisfying romance if you can look past the separations they endured. I recommend it."},{"Title":"ISLAND INTERLUDE","review":"Libby was acting as nanny to a couple's children when she met and fell in love w/ Alec Blanchard. They had a brief affair, but then he had to marry another woman. Now she is back on the island w/ her child, yes secret baby, to do some research and Alec is there as well w/ his daughter from his marriage.Libby is engaged to OM while she is kissing Alec on her return trip to the island. OM comes on the scene and Alec seems to take advantage of things and shows him the writing on the wall. He, the OM, leaves knowing that he and Libby won't be getting married, of course.It was a little troubling that she didn't go out of her way to tell Alec that she was pregnant, but understandable as she was hurt by his cavalier dismissal of her. He truly felt guilty about the circumstances surrounding the other woman and her place in his life and he was functioning on this guilt as well. He felt that what he had wanted w/ Libby would have interfered w/ her plans for her future and so he hadn't pushed things either. But he was surprised that she wasn't further in her education than what she was and then he discovers why. He wasn't too happy about that and he demands that she reveal the truth to their 7 year old son. She does get a few digs in w/ Alec as well. He truly seems to love her though as he continues to come back for more.She wouldn't let him explain things either at one point and he didn't push it. I wondered why he didn't search for her over the years. They weren't always sure of one another's feelings for each other either and thought that others were still engaging them emotionally or otherwise. Alec still didn't learn from his earlier mistakes as he dashes off w/ no explanation and she is left to assume that he walked out on her again as they evidence points that way.Was hard for him to claim some things when he himself wasn't living up to them, but he realized that and was trying to put that right as well. I didn't like the choices that Alec had made, but he felt that he needed to make them and so he did. The HEA was believable and I felt that both of them had suffered enough for the past decisions.One huge complaint is that the OM whom it was believed that she wouldn't' see again and yet he pops up again and again if only to throw a wrench into her r/s w/ Alec."},{"Title":"ISLAND INTERLUDE","review":"Grad student heroine goes back to the Bahamas to conduct interviews with the island's residents & to get closure from her brief affair with famous actor-director Hero 8 years earlier. Recently-widowed Hero just so happen to be vacationing with his 7yo daughter too. Their reunion is bittersweet especially when she told Hero right away that they have a 7yo son together. He persistently attempts to win back her affection & be actively involved in their son's life. But heroine doesn't trust him to not break her heart again when it looks like his marriage proposal is primarily motivated by his wanting to be with their son. How will Hero regain her trust?This was a fast & emotionally-evoking read. It was angsty & featured a hero who truly regretted his past decisions re: heroine & tried to make up for it. I could feel his painful regrets & desperation to right his wrongs with heroine & their son. Overall I'd say that Hero groveled enough. He spent most of the book groveling via his actions & not so much his words. And therein lies my problem with him. He needed work in verbally communicating his feelings, crucial events, & needs in a straightforward way with heroine. He often assumed that she knew what he was thinking & would be surprised that she misunderstood his silence. And that's another problem I have with Hero. He not only expected heroine to read his mind he also thought he could read her mind! One of his primary reasons for marrying the other woman 8 years earlier was b/c he thought heroine didn't really love him & that she would rather pursue her career goals than be with him. And she never once told him that nor did he ask her what she wanted. He just assumed a lot of things about her & made a really big mistake b/c of it. McCallister tried to make up for this by letting heroine emphasize the positive side of their separate lives in the past 8 years. I didn't like this bandaid-over-an-infected-wound method b/c it belittled heroine's pain. I'd rather that both Hero & heroine face the past (pain & regrets and all) for what it was & move on to their HEA(Happily Ever After) from that point on.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of New Comic Fantasy: A Dazzling New Collection of Comic Fantasy Masterpieces from Esther Friesner, Neil Gaiman, Tom Holt, Paul di Filippo, Adam Roberts, Molly Brown and Many More...","review":"The Mammoth Book of New Comic Fantasy: A Dazzling New Collection of Comic Fantasy Masterpieces from Esther Friesner, Neil Gaiman, Tom Holt, Paul di Filippo, Adam Roberts, Molly Brown and Many More...A wonderful collection of stories.

Beginning with a basic pedigree chart and the question \\"What do you know?\\" he leads the reader through a seven-step process of finding out the essentials of what you *don't* know, including family interviews, writing for death certificates and following up the leads they contain, burrowing into the federal census and the Family History Library, and then moving on to state and county records. At that point, the beginner should be well under weigh, with a lengthy list of research goals to pursue. The second part of the book introduces the wider arena of the National Archives, Social Security records, renting microfilms, and dealing with professional researchers. A state-by-state selected and annotated listing of \\"resource centers\\" provides a good basic checklist, as does a list of recommended reference books. A handful of blank master forms (on the Dollarhide model, naturally) are intended for photocopying. Surprisingly, though, except for a few Website addresses, the author takes no notice at all of \\"computer genealogy\\" or the Internet, though the Net is the first point of contact for many would-be genealogists these days. Still, this would be a good textbook for a Beginning Genealogy class."},{"Title":"Quest for the Lost City","review":"My father read this book aloud to me when I was 7. When I was 37, I read it aloud to my sons. Now I am in my 50's, and I still pick it up and reread a chapter here and there. It is a really exceptional piece of nonfiction.The narrative style is terse, but highly descriptive. The construct is deceptively simple: a newly wed couple, eager for adventure, hears about a tanalizing archaeological site- a well preserved pre-Columbian city, discovered by a flyer who lost his way over Central America. With only sketchy information about where this site is, they set out from California'on foot! With only what they can carry on their backs!And what adventures these intrepid campers find! Held hostage by mexican bandits, adored by villiagers whom they help, they repair and fly an unflyable plane named Whezelbritches, navigate uncharted caverns and live off the land for food, medicine, and shelter. They also shoot, charm, and barter their way through dozens of tight spots, any one of which would have sent Indiana Jones packing.And as if you weren't already getting double your money's worth in adventure, this narrative also has some timeless demonstrations of what makes a marriage successful. I won't tell you how their quest ends, but the climax to the adventure is unforgettable.I am really looking forward to reading this book to my grand children!"},{"Title":"Quest for the Lost City","review":"Quest For The Lost city by Dana and Ginger Lamb is a wonderful bookDwayne Shreve in his review of Quest For the Lost City on Amazon obviously has a problem with the author Dana Lamb.

I encourage anyone to read it. http://www.mostlymaya.com/Lost_City_Intro.htmMr Shreve gives not one footnote in his accusation .

Oranges pretty much grow themselves, really. What to do? Why you (Dana) and your wife(Ginger) build a dugout canoe and paddle it down the coast of Mexico to Central America. That was last time. Now it's been a few years and you're bored again. What to do for an encore?How about going searching on foot for the lost city of the Maya's buried by the jungle somewhere in Central America - Maybe Guatemala, who knows? The two of you. Nobody with you. What better way to start than by walking from California through Mexico - meeting bandits, villagers cut off from the outside world, no one, and ..the jungle. Dana and Ginger carried everything on their backs, although admittedly they cheat in the beginning by buying a $10 Model T from a Junkman and driving it till the Baja kills it. From then on, it's every mile on foot through deserts, mountains, surf, and finally cutting their way with machetes into the jungle that defeated the Conquistadors.A wonderfully light and modest book with great photographs that prove the story is real. Watch out for the man with the two-barreled gun.Suitable for young teen boys who are starting to feel a bit of wanderlust, and older guys who are tired of sitting behind their desks and want to -do- something."},{"Title":"Quest for the Lost City","review":"I do have a copy of the book and have read it. It makes for a good tale if you don't know much about the area, which I didn't when I read it the first time. I was especially intrigued with where this ruin might be, but a few careful readings of the relevant portions gave no idea and they still don't.Archaeologist Frans Blom was annoyed with the book enough to type up a quick rant and then a longer diatribe, both of which he placed inside that copy of the book at Na Bolom. A Mr. L.E Scott of Los Angeles had sent him a copy and that was what set him off. One thing he pointed out was that the \\"Mayan Jewels\\" they were supposed to have gone through hardship to get to even back then were attainable by truck or jeep in 2 1/2 hours from Comitan. I have copies of all this, courtesy of the Explorer's Club, which was kind enough to send me copies of what I told them about.I read the many letters home from Herman \\"Carlos\\" Frey in researching my account of him. He was quite accurate in geographic details, so I presumed that his opinion about the Lambs was correct. His version has him traveling with them and becoming disenchanted. He wrote that the Lambs set up scenes in photos to make it look as though they were deep in the jungle. He described them as not being able to walk \\"three miles without pooping out.\\"One positive thing about the Lambs is certain. They did find some sort of minor ruin site that, based on the unique stela they photographed, was probably under the aegis of Yaxchilan. Unlike Blom, I think that the book is not a complete fabrication. Lamb's \\"Lasch-Tunich\\" has given way to being referred to as Laxtunich by those of us who are interested. People do wonder where it was, but wherever that is, the stela was presumably looted decades ago.Although Blom wrote that \\"never has worse tripe been written,\\" he was well known for hyperbole. There have been a good number of worse writings all over the World. And, if you think of it as a yarn, Quest for the Lost City isn't all that bad."},{"Title":"It's Not Just About Wrinkles: A Park Avenue Dermatologist's Program for Beautiful Skin - in Just Four Minutes a Day","review":"If you want to have perfect skin, this is the book for you.

There is a lot of in-depth discussion of air pollution and ozone depletion, as well as water pollution. The book covers virtually every topic in environmental sciences, even going into detail in some ares that are usually classified as environmental geology. The book is written clearly and is accessible for most people who have taken general chemistry courses. A background in organic chemistry would be helpful but is not necessary. This is one of those textbooks that I kept at the end of the semester, to have as a reference guide."},{"Title":"Chemistry of the Environment","review":"I found the first edition of this book very useful for myself and my students as a reference and the second edition is even more useful. The book is excellent in covering thoroughly the chemical aspects of energy and environmental problems. The book is divided into four parts: Energy, Atmosphere, Hydrosphere/Lithosphere, Biosphere.The authors discuss the advantages and disadvantages of petroleum, natural gas, coal and the ways of handling the emission of CO2. They include chapters on nuclear, renewable energy, and energy utilization.I'm particularly impressed with the use of figures which show the many aspects of a system being discussed,with the different contributions from different sources happening at the same time. For instance what happens to the energy annually on earth, organic carbon changing to fossil fuels, energy storage in photosynthesis, maximum work, and systems efficiency, etc. These are great for understanding how many aspects there are to a process.The section on the atmosphere has chapters that covers air pollution, ozone, climate changes, nitrogen and oxygen chemistry. The section on the hydrosphere covers water resources from a global perspective, properties of water, the importance of acids-bases, solubility, redox reactions, the chemistry of nitrogen and phosphorous. Water quality pollution and its treatment are covered in detail. The section on the biosphere covers toxic materials, the nitrogen cycle in food production use of fertilizers and insecticides.Dimensional analysis is used extensively throughout and in assigned problems. For instance they calculate an estimate of the energy in a moderate rainstorm to be over a million tons of TNT. They actually show the calculations for other interesting problems such as the increase in energy used in the future with even a small 2.5% annual increase.You won't find a better or more even-handed exposition of the natural cycles on the Earth emphasizing the importance of understanding the chemistry involved, and our options to keep us and the Earth healthy."},{"Title":"Chemistry of the Environment","review":"Well, this book is a boring read.

The designer, manufacturer, and design date are given as well.Some of my favorites include a roll-up lounge bed shaped like a snail that would be great for lounging and an interesting looking wave shape chaise lounge. Some designs are amazingly innovative, like a bed that folds away and coverts into a desk and another that can be either a couch or a set of bunk beds. There is a cradle made of cardboard and crib/cot that can be expanded as a child grows as well.Ranging from whimsical to practical, what all of these designs have in common is creativity and ingenuity.

This book really helped make my study time more efficient and I did get an A in my class. There are some mistakes in the book, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I also used Microbiology Study Guide by Dr. Leonardi, which is excellent, but if you can only buy one study guide, this is definitely the book to buy."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Microbiology","review":"taking online courses, this book helped with more information and quizzes at the end of each chapter."},{"Title":"My Great, Wide, Beautiful World","review":"Juanita Harrison, a southern African American woman, overcame the obstacles of poverty, a lack of formal education, racism, and a little thing called the Great Drepression to fulfill her dream of seeing the world on her own terms. This collection of her diary entries, unedited for grammar and spelling, has captured the voice of a resourceful, intelligent, adventurous and charming woman. Ms. Harrison's colorful descriptions, clear-eyed assessments of human nature (including her own), shrewd bargain hunting, and her whole-hearted enjoyment of all the good things in life should serve as inspiration to all would-be travelers."},{"Title":"My Great, Wide, Beautiful World","review":"I give this book by Juanita Harrison 5 stars because I know of no other quite like it. The book is a compilation of Ms Harrison's diaries and letters recording her around the world adventure in the 1930s. Harrison was a self-educated, optimistic woman of color who determined that she could do anything in the world she pleased. The writing is organized in sequence but is unedited so that all of Juanita's errors in grammar, spelling and syntax are left in tact lending an incredible charm to the book. As with dialect it takes a bit of getting used to but you really get to \\"hear\\" Ms Harrison as she takes us with her on the adventure of a lifetime. We get to experience her as a supremely confident, friendly and charming woman who was just suspicious enough to keep herself out of scrapes(most of the time) and who knows, by her very nature, how to squeeze a dollar out of a nickel. She has a great appetite for culture and her sense of pleasure from concerts and museums is palpable. Plus she loves to eat and has as an ample appetite to say the least. Juanita varies between giving great details of places and social customs or none at all as she wanders through Italy and Spain, India and Japan. For all of her bravado we do, several times, get a look at her more vulnerable side. The \\"Villa Petite Peep\\" in my title was the name of the tent she pitched in Honolulu with it's little view of the sea. Ms Harrison disappeared from any record keeping and the date or whereabouts of her death are unknown. Fortunately we have this wonderful record of a truly interesting, inspiring American woman. In the right hands \\"My Great Wide Beautiful World\\" would make a terrific film."},{"Title":"My Great, Wide, Beautiful World","review":"What can I say about this marvelous book? It is so good, that words describing it fail to do it justice. This book needs to be experienced. When you read it you'll feel like you have travelled with Juanita, seen the sights, and met the warm people of the world. Juanita Harrison was a single African American woman in her 30's who travelled the world all by herself. Virtually nothing is known about Juanita\`s life, but it's assumed she grew up in a family typical of the time and place she was born: the early 1900's in Mississippi. One would guess that she was a child of sharecroppers, and that eventually she wound up working as a domestic or a nanny. But Juanita had a great spirit of adventure, and ended up working in several places other than Mississippi... most notably in New York, California, Canada and Cuba. It was while in California that her employer invested her salary, and soon she had enough interest income to start on her plan to travel the world. For close to 10 years, she roamed the globe, getting jobs when her money was low, and taking off for a new place when the mood struck. The book is written in a diary style, for it is a travel journal. Juanita was mistaken for many different nationalities, depending on the country she was in. She made this observation: \\"I am willing to be what ever I can get the best treatments at being.\\" She was definitely a \\"glass half-full\\" person. In Tours, France, she said, \\"a big faire are going on in the city are ever so gay I sure have luck for arriving at the gayest time.\\" When she reached her room in Tours, she said, \\"in just a few minutes after arriving in a place I feel that I have been there all my life I feel just like that everywhere.\\" She found wonder and appreciated the smallest things. She was given a pair of warm tights by one of her employers. When she went from Holland to Denmark on a ship, the sea air was cold. But she spent \\"the whole day on deck and not another woman (has), and it was all to the tights. What a life this is, sometimes it hangs on a pair of cast-off tights.\\" She was always looking to be with the people of any country, especially the average person \\"There are auto bus trips but I don't care to see the country it's the people I want to be with.\\"Of her journey on a ship from Cairo to Sri Lanka, she thought she should have gone partly by train because it would be more enjoyable for her to travel 3rd class thru the Sudan and Ethiopia hungry and thirsty, since then she'd have something to remember. Even though she most likely was not formally educated, she does a decent job writing, despite the spelling and syntax errors. And there are more than a few clever turns of the phrase. After swimming in the Dead Sea, Juanita was offered corned beef: \\" I was just full of brine and felt just like Lot's wife so I couldn't eat any.\\" Describing the wallpaper in one of her rooms in Bordeau, France: \\"the wallpaper are blue vases filled with white roses and look so real I feel a fear of knocking them over.\\" As far as travelling by herself, she expressed several times in the book how happy she was in going it alone. \\"My visa from Russia to Asia would have cost 20 dollars but at the Hotel they got it free for me, I being a poor lonely woman. Of course that lonely look helps me a great deal but there never were one less lonely than I am.\\" A quote in the second-to-last paragraph of the book sums up Juanita's life philosophy, \\"I always want to be where wealth health youth beauty and gayness are, altho need very little for myself, I just want to be in the midst of it.\\" That's simply a fantastic outlook on life. Imagine the world if we all shared that viewpoint.When I finished this book, I did not want it to be over. I read this over the course of 2 months...with a diary-style you can put it down and then pick it back up right where you left off. I was totally living vicariously through Juanita. I didn't want to rush it. And when the book ended, it left me wanting more."},{"Title":"Dragon Seed","review":"This novel bore little resemblance to the original Pearl S. Buck which I read, but the binding and printing was very niceley done. The story itself was moving, believable, fact-filled, compassionate and hard-nosed--in other words, a good read, if perhaps somewhat raw for younger readers. The spirit of empathy for a unique and complex people came through very strongly, perhaps in the spirit if Pearl S. Buck, if not in her own words."},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"Haunting, chilling, and riveting are just a few words to describe the horror fiction of F. Paul Wilson. I have read many anthologies he has contributed to, yet it is only when you see so many of his stories placed in one volume that you can truly appreciate his wicked brilliance. As an avid reader and collector of short horror/fantasy/sci-fi fiction, a piece has to be truly remarkable to stand out in my collection, yet this does, and I would not hesitate to re-read it at any time. Both Soft and Cuts were so delicious that they alone were worth the price of the book! The poorest story in here still blows away everything else on the current market.A complete list of the stories is-***The Cleaning Machine *** Ratman ***Lipidleggin' *** To fill the Sea and Air *** Green Winter *** Be Fruitful and Multiply *** Soft *** The Last \\"One Mo'Once Golden Oldies Revival\\" *** The Years the Music Died *** Dat-Tay-Vao *** Doc Johnson *** Buckets *** Traps *** Muscles *** Menage a Trois *** CutsThis work turned me into an F. Paul Wilson fan and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the short story form or horror fiction. Treat yourself to this and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"This was my first book of F. Paul Wilson and now I am a huge fan. Every story is tight, concise, and eminently readable. Look out especially for &quot;Soft,&quot; &quot;Dat-Tay-Vao&quot; (which figures into later novels like The Touch), and &quot;Buckets.&quot;"},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"F. Paul Wilson is an amazing writer, and these stories serve to highlight that fact. Soft is a good story, and the one about the plant-men was chilling...I WOULD recommend this to other FPW fans."},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"This is an excellent compilation of the author's short stories, which were written between 1969 and 1987. The author, who has since gone on to fame and fortune, having written a number of best sellers, among them \\"The Tomb\\", \\"The Touch\\", and \\"The Keep\\", writes a brief, yet interesting, introduction to each of the sixteen stories, telling the reader the genesis and history of each one.The stories range from the macabre to the odd, with unexpected twists and turns. These can be categorized as being of the horror genre of fiction. The book also features some stories that fall squarely into the science fiction genre. No matter the genre, they are all edgy, clever, and clearly a labor of love by the author. For those unfamiliar with the work of the author, this is an excellent introduction, as these brief, well written stories will give the reader a thirst for more."},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"The stories in this collection are diverse. Some of the stories make one think and consider the future especially as regards healthcare legislation and population control (Lipidleggin', Be Fruitful and Multiply). Others are imaginative, supernatural tales of revenge (Cuts, The Last \\"Oldies Revival\\", \\"One Mo' Once Golden Oldies Revival\\", Doc Johnson). There are three SF stories, 'The Ratman' which deals with rat problems and shows how well trained a rat can be, 'Dat-Tay-Vao' is about a remarkable gift for healing, and 'To Fill the Sea and Air' is a fishing story. Conspiracy theory and the music business are dealt with in 'The Years the Music Died'. 'Muscles', 'The Cleaning Machine', 'Green Winter', 'M&eacute;nage A Trois', and 'Traps' are straight horror stories. One story, 'Buckets', deals with the controversial subject of abortion. The title story, 'Soft', touches on a broad range of fears: disease, slowly dying, paralysis, losing loved ones, death, etc., for me this was the scariest story.If you do read and enjoy this collection, you may also be interested in 'The Barrens and Others', which features a horror story ('Pelts') that is even more disturbing than 'Cuts', and another story ('Pelts') which like 'Buckets' is very graphic and deals with a controversial issue (killing animals for their fur)."},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"My dad read me a bunch of these stories when I was a kid, and I've never forgotten them. The title story is the stuff nightmares are made off."},{"Title":"Soft and Others","review":"Most of the stories in this book are fairly old now, but they do not suffer much from that. This is not Mr. Wilson's best short story collection, but is a worthwhile addition to the others. Well worth having."},{"Title":"Safari for Seven","review":"What a surprise to discover that no one had written a review on Safari for Seven, by Thea B. Halsema, published in 1967. This is not a boring journal of we went there and we saw this. Rather, it is a delightful account of a minister, his wife, and five children--the youngest being 4 years-old--, traveling for four months through Europe and the Middle East on a very slim budget.This expedition occurred during a time of unrest, hardship, and great suspicion in Europe and the Middle East. In spite of challenging border crossings, a whole moth in the bottom of a full jar of jam, and four-year-old Dicker's unpredictably spontaneous behavior, they manage to get past the formidable Berlin wall and travel in East Berlin.Many chuckles await the reader in the author's colorful, vivid writing style. The book is not only entertaining, but full of history, as well as, Scriptures read before following the Apostle Paul in his travels. Even the Biblical book of Revelation becomes alive through the author's skillful pen."},{"Title":"Private Security and the Law","review":"I bought this book as a requirement for my course at webster university.

This book reflects her relationship with and knowledge of God, and gives a clarity, insight and knowledge that can only come from a supernatural source. My first exposure to this book was over 35 years ago. Today I can point to several of the events predicted in its pages that have come to pass with unerring accuracy. The light she sheds on bible interpretation, history and what our future holds, makes events taking place in our world understandable, thrilling and awe inspiring. I can't say enough to recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand Biblical Prophecy, and end time events. This book is not fiction."},{"Title":"The (New, Illustrated) Great Controversy (Conflict Series, Vol. 5)","review":"This Illustrated Great Controversy gives the reader insights into how God has been involved in Western Civilization history and will be involved in our near future.

Perhaps it will serve as a tickler of memory for the book I intend to write, but of course never will.&quot;This first book from Jack Ward Thomas is sure to open the eyes of those who think they know how policy and management decisions affecting the nation's forests are made. Though Thomas has authored well over 400 publications, mostly on wildlife conservation, perhaps the most valuable thing he's written is the set of journals he started eighteen years ago - the book he intended to write.As Chief of the Forest Service, Thomas is quick to give credit to those he respects, particularly his agency employees in the field. But he doesn't shy from battle, and his assessments of some political appointees in Washington and certain members of Congress are brutal.Thomas was drafted into the chief's job shortly after Clinton took office, and he took the helm of the agency with typical fortitude - and the naivet&eacute; of a researcher thrust into the political cauldron that is Washington DC.&quot;We don't just manage land,&quot; he wrote, &quot;we're supposed to be leaders. Conservation leaders. Leaders in protecting and improving the land.&quot;Statements like that surprised some of the people in Washington, but certainly didn't surprise his longtime friends and colleagues. Thomas had been talking about and writing about conservation for most of his life. And the cream of that conservation writing is in his journals.This book offers not only insight into the mind and heart of a naturalist, but also a perspective on the politics of natural resource management through the eyes of one of this country's finest conservationists. His writings clarify many of the environmental issues we face today: protecting obscure but endangered species, dealing with wildfire and wildfire fatalities, balancing resource needs against the need to preserve, and the development of policies to address forest health.This book's a treasure, and will be a valuable addition to the collections of those who care about natural resources management."},{"Title":"Jack Ward Thomas: The Journals of a Forest Service Chief","review":"For those of us who lived through the strife and conflict of the 1990's inside the United States Forest Service, or outside looking in, these journals are a rare epiphany that remind us that hope lives in darkness.Jack Ward Thomas, the first politically appointed Chief since the first Chief, Gifford Pinchot (a Teddy Roosevelt appointee in 1905) takes us on his very personal journey as he grows from wildlife biologist to agency statesman in a few short years. Along the way he stumbles and wanders, siezes triumph and faces tragedy, and crosses the finish line with grace and understanding.The politics of natural resource and environmental policy are often ugly, frustrating, arcane. Thomas' lights a candle with often astonishing revelations about people - he names names - that can be highly entertaining and insightful. With humor and pathos he deconstructs the key events of the age and explains his rationale for highly controversial decisions clearly and in real time.Thomas was a career scientist whose identity and loyalty was to his profession before events in the Clinton White House landed him on the fourth floor in the corner office in the old Auditor's Building on the Mall in Washington, just a few hundred yards from the Washington Monument, in the seat of Forest Service power. His grasp of the breadth and depth of what he would come to correctly identify as the sacred calling of being Chief was slight, but his willingness to tell the story of his transformation was strong and this he did honestly, openly, and often delightfully.Did he do everything right? Hardly. But neither was he deserving of condemnation. If anything he stepped up to the plate in the face of far worse alternatives and tried to do the right thing, acknowledging his own innocense and failures, coming of age and successes, and in the event creating a personal and agency political history that is both very well written and very compelling.Expect to be up in the wee hours of the night when you open this book. These journals are a must read for anyone who hopes to understand the politics of the environment being played out right now and for serious and casual students of government policy in public land management."},{"Title":"Jack Ward Thomas: The Journals of a Forest Service Chief","review":"Come on. This is nothing but self-hagiography from the very guy who consigned the Northern Spotted Owl to extinction. Stump justification from a biostitute.Nowhere does one find any remorse over his decision to push the RESUMPTION of old growth logging after it was stopped by an Injunction issued by a courageous Reagan judge who noted that continued liquidation of the centuries-old trees was the death knell for the owls - the Indicator Species for the health of the entire Ancient Forest ecosystem.Spin it how he may, Thomas' and Clinton's Option 9 Northwest Forest Plan has indeed led to a crash of owl populations. The \\"scientist\\" pushed a voodoo science plan that actually called for the loss of 1% of the owls per year for fifty years with the wishful thinking that after 50 years, the owls would rebound as the stumplands of today will become habitat then.Of course over 50% are already gone after just 13 years! And, that puts the species past the point of no return even if 50-year-old trees could replace centuries-old ones as habitat.The very reason it's called Option 9 was because the eight original options the array of scientists charged to solve the issue came up with did not cut enough to satisfy Thomas' real bosses in the timber industry. So, the scientists were sequestered in a hotel until they came up with a more rapacious option (conveniently, no mention of that episode appears). Some science!This is awful George Tenet-style self-justifying revisionism, pure and simple. At least Robert MacNamara apologized in his similar attempt to reclaim his reputation."},{"Title":"Awake (New Poets of America)","review":"If Emily Dickinson were to read Laux's poems, she would know she was in the presence of poetry.

Irreverent because it tells all, good and bad, with sly and not so sly jokes, and it covers all the computing (and more) that users will need - in understandable English. Well arranged, well indexed, and well cross referenced. After 28 years of updating The Secret Guide to Computing, Russ Walter can truly call himself a &quot;computer missionary.&quot;The 639 pages in this 8 1/2 x 11 softcover book extend from buying to viruses.

This guide introduces you to the various cities and towns, vast jungles and the myriad of rivers that flow through this world. Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, the Guianas and Venezuela all lay claim to this world and all are covered in this guide.The practical A-Z section is basic but good. Statements like \\"Avoid eating endangered species\\" are a bit moronic, especially when no list of endangered species is offered. The 50 pages devoted to \`Amazon Wildlife' are helpful, but your chances of seeing most of the wildlife documented in the book are slim. After five days on the rivers and camping on land in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, my medical group had yet to see a single form of wildlife, other than the occasional spider monkey. The brochures that you are handed at the travel agency have beautiful photos of the animal life that you probably won't see. However, what the Amazon lacked in visible wildlife, it made up for with its insect population. And, to the guides credit, it does start off the \\"Fauna\\" section with a the insect section. The Amazon Spirituality (Rainforest Shamanism) and the Music and the Amazon sections were delightful.I relished the forthright and candid critiques of the agencies (\\"the elevated price of this agency hardly justifies the modest increase in comfort\\"), hotels (it is the best cheap hotel in town) and restaurants (one of La Paz's best Italian restaurants). That said, you will only get a handful of recommendations for major cities and if you plan to stay longer it is best to get a country guide.There are no prices, or costs, for anything! This is a substantial omission. No prices for agencies service, no prices for the restaurants nor for the accommodation. Nor does the author take to task the serious damage that is being done by multinational mining, logging or petroleum companies. Scant is said about the escalating ecological damage that each country is allowing in the Amazon. And then there is the bare bone \\"further reading\\" section and an absence of any any films or documentaries set in, or about, the Amazon. All of these are significant short-comings.Be aware that this guide will not help you decide where to go, it gives no recommendations, it only helps you whittle down your choices; by laying out all the possibilities before you. When you consider that the Amazon is a world, spanning 11 countries, each with scores of places to explore, you are somewhat lost in the jungle, so to speak. So, it is a useful, but not great guide."},{"Title":"The Amazon: Including the Gran Sabana and the Pantanal (Cadogan Guides)","review":"This was the only Amazon guide I found which really covered the whole area. The background information was easy to read, fascinating, and written by genuine experts - senior scientists, field researchers, members of the U.N working group on indigenous peoples, and by indigenous people themselves.

Good for on the road or at home reading."},{"Title":"The Amazon: Including the Gran Sabana and the Pantanal (Cadogan Guides)","review":"Although a little out of date this is still the best book on the area on the market. The flora and fauna section are comprehensive and written by professional botanists and biologists and this is the only book properly to cover areas like Manu, Tambopata and Noel Kempff. It is a shame it is not larger as there is much to cover - 9 countries and an area bigger than Australia.The previous reviewer is incorrect to say that there is no information on conservation or the pillaging of the Amazon by multi-nationals. This is all in the text either contextually or under the history section; which also spells out in detail the abuses wrought on indigenous peoples. However it would have been good to see it have its own designated section as well.Let's hope that Cadogan do a new edition adn give it a good deal more pages."},{"Title":"Student Study Guide Part 1 for Calculus","review":"This is not a good book. However, I must admit that it really isn't that bad. The examples are clear, and the solutions are given, with decent explanations.The bad thing about Calculus with this Study Guide isn't that it's poorly written, the bad thing is that it's practically useless. The problems are of the same type as those found in Calculus with Analytic Geometry, and they are explained in the same dry way. In other words, the Calculus with Analytic Geometry Study Guide doesn't really help to clear up any confusion, nor does it serve as a &quot;guide&quot; of some sort--it's simply more textbook problems!If you are having trouble with Calculus with Analytic Geometry, the Study Guide will do you no good.

As a fellow child of Astoria,Queens---HVALA LIDIA!!!"},{"Title":"La Cucina Di Lidia","review":"This is really two books, largely interleaved with each other. The cookbook is the more obvious one. It's where Lidia - never truly separable from her husband Felice - exposes the secrets of her kitchen. Correction: kitchens, plural. These are the recipes that have kept the lines long outside of her restaurants back to the early 1970s. Struggling against American palates trained on TV dinners, they addressed and quite possibly created a clientele who discovered that there was more to Italian food than tomato sauce.Lidia has extensive professional education, undertaken while she was a young mother and beginning restauranteur (this is the weaker sex?!?). She and her husband traveled most of Europe, studying the national and even regional specialties of each culinary tradition. Although training and research inform this book, that's not where it really comes from. It comes, through her personal alchemy, from her grandmother's truck garden. That's where the second book within this one binding comes in. That book is Lidia's culinary biography, from her earliest girlhood in Adriatic Italy up to the book's 1990 writing.The family wasn't rich. Meat was a rarity, and every part of the animal went into the pot: heart, kidney, liver, blood for black sausage, and (in this pre-BSE book) brain. Produce was fresh from the garden, though, and slaughtering the animal was part of cooking with meat. Plain cooking can be exquisite cooking, however. Lidia's close contact with every aspect of the food gave her a bone-deep appreciation for unique character of ever plant and animalin her kitchen. Her secret is really no secret at all: it lies in using the finest and freshest ingredients, and in knowing the preparation that lets each be the best it can.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"La Cucina Di Lidia","review":"Lidia does her usual.

While I grew up is a working class suburb in the American Midwest,with its small lots ringed by chainlink fence, Lidia grew up in a country still scarred by WWII. We were not wealthy -- my father, who never went to high school, was a skilled laborer -- but we never had the sort of struggle to put food on the table that Lidia's family had. That struggle and the story of her families immigration is told in this cookbook. And, yes, it is a cookbook, but it is just as interesting as a document of perhaps the &quot;other side&quot; of the Baby Boom generation that has been soundly criticised for materialism and self-indulgence. From generations of Istrian cooks, Lidia learned how to feed a family suberbly. To my Irish and Polish family, the Italian dishes that were making their way into the Midwest in the 1950s were exotic. I remember my mother buying the &quot;spaghetti kit,&quot; (can I mention the brand - Chef Boyardee) a yellow, rectangular box in which there was a long, thin box of dry spaghetti, a medium size can of tomato sauce and a small can of grated cheese. When there were only 2 children in the family, we were fed from one box, but as the children grew in size and increased in number, so did the number of boxes it took to feed the family. It was with considerable trepidation that my mother bought her first pound of dry pasta and cans of whole tomatoes and tomato paste and made her first &quot;Italian&quot; dinner from scratch. More than red sauce, this is a wonderful book that captures an era and an area. By the way, Lidia also answers the question of dry v. &quot;fresh&quot; pasta. A great book."},{"Title":"Chanda's Secrets","review":"In a touching and heart rending story, Mr. Stratton has captured one of the anomalies of life on this planet at this point in time. \\"Chanda's Secret\\" deals with the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. While AIDS is significant enough in the United States it is truly an epidemic in parts of Africa, where up to 3 out of every 4 people have AIDS. Stratton's book deals with the subject most artistically.The biggest anomaly about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is that even though it is hugely prevalent, it is a huge stigma to have the disease. It is not only a stigma for the patient, but for the patient's entire family. Many would rather go off and die or commit suicide to spare their families from living with the shame of knowing they were an \\"AIDS Family.\\"In this book, the reality of the disease is portrayed through the eyes of a young girl in Africa. She has to deal with most difficult life conditions, but then on top of all that, AIDS strikes at her house. The story tells most tenderly and appropriately about the trials and tribulations of her dilemma and what could be done if only people were willing to face things straight on, rather than hiding from the reality.The book is extraordinarily well written. It is recommended for all readers between 12 and 112 for a close look at the HIV/AIDS dilemma in Africa. Stratton shows true tenderness and care when he describes the reality, yet manages to get that reality across in rather stark imagery. It is well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Chanda's Secrets","review":"Chanda's Secret is about a 16-year-old girl named Chanda Kabelo who is growing up in Africa. She loves school and is very smart. She would like to win a scholarship one day, but as most of us know one of the biggest problems in Africa is how to deal with aids. Many people in Africa have aids and so do the many people around Chanda, not only friends but family too.Allan Stratton captures the meaning of a young girl growing up in Africa trying to help her family in the best way she knows how. She tries to make her family proud and at the same time help her mother out as much as she can. She fights to be the best she can be and lives each day with more questions and answers.I would recommend this meaningful book to anyone going into high school or older. This book is a very good example of what a young teenager does to help everyone before herself, no matter what rumors are going around."},{"Title":"Chanda's Secrets","review":"saw the movie first. bad choice, the book as usual gives more details and background to the story. Nice coming of age story would recommend it to teen girls."},{"Title":"Chanda's Secrets","review":"Very interesting look at another culture through the eyes of children who are experiencing great suffering.

After meeting Chanda's family and friends and community, I know it's not a life without tears and fear. The YA novel takes place in Bonang, Africa. Chanda sees her life torn apart by disease. People are afraid of people who have gotten the disease. The people with AIDS are thrown away literally. Believe me Chanda's mother's story is unforgettable. I have heard people say our greatness shows itself during tragedy. This is what happens to Chanda. She becomes stronger willing to care for those whom she loves no matter what other people say and no matter what will happen to herself. I pray that one day a cure will be found for this horrible disease. It's a disease that strikes not only the body but our inner character, our ability to love one another.\\"Mama said I should save my anger to fight injustice. Well, I know what's unjust. The ignorance about AIDS. The shame. The stigma. The silence. The secrets that keep us hiding behind the curtain.\\"globalissuesaids-in-africa, teenreadsmichael-l-printz-award-2012,allanstratton\\"There, perched on the wheelbarrow, was my stork.

When her mother turns ill and vanishes to retrieve treatment, Chanda's in charge of her two younger siblings as well as best friend who might have contracted AIDS. She carefully balances providing an honorable life for her loved ones with standing up for what she believes in, regardless of what others think. The book was an extremely powerful read - dark and deep - that I definitely enjoyed. Chanda is a great character for young adults to read about. She's determined, responsible and incredibly aware."},{"Title":"Chanda's Secrets","review":"I know that the recommended grade level is 9-12, but I would only use it for very mature 11th and 12th graders. There is lots of sexual content; Chanda's mother has several partners through her life, Chanda is molested, and there are instances of prostitution.With that being said, this book will explain the problems of dealing with the treatment of AIDS in Africa. There is no communication about the disease, no one wants to be seen going into the clinic to be tested for it, anything. It really opened my eyes to the problems these people have to face everyday, horrific to say the least.One of the reviews on the back of the book sums up my feelings \\"This powerful story hits home with its harsh truths, its pain, and its hard-won hopefulness. No-One can read Chanda's Secrets and remain untouched by the young people who are caught in the AIDS pandemic\\" (Written by Stephen Lewis, a worker for the UN).I gave it 5 stars because I learned so much about AIDS, and I became emotionally attached to Chanda. I wanted her to have a good life, and for something to go right for her. And as we all know, making a connection with a character is what keeps people reading!Just keep in mind that because of the adult content, young readers need to be mature, and culturally aware."},{"Title":"Chanda's Secrets","review":"Great book for a teen, I brought this book for my daughter and she loved it.

The author discusses the history of the subject as well as giving a thorough discussion of modern developments. In addition, many references are given for readers who want to investigate the subject in more detail. The philosophy of law has become even more important in recent years due to the social tensions surrounding the Supreme Court of the United States as well as the difficult legal issues involved in nation building.The following questions, among many others, arose for this reviewer when reading the book, with some of them being answered in the book and some not:1. What is the difference, if any, between standards and rules?2. What is the difference, if any, between substantive justice and formal justice?3. Does the granting of broad discretionary powers to legal officials encourage abuse?4. When a legal rule ages, does it become less or more applicable to the activities it is supposed to refer to, i.e. will judges become more tempted to declare exceptions and extensions to it?5. How important is the use of formal logic in legal deliberations?6. Can most, or even all, legal argumentation/deliberation be given an algorithmic or formulaic definition?7. Can statutes or constitutions, being forms of communication, be verified in the same way as scientific hypotheses can?8. Does good legal judgment consist of caution, detachment, imagination, and common sense or must these be supplemented by other activities or modes of cognition?9. Is law an autonomous discipline, with the designation \\"autonomous\\" given its usual intuitive meaning?10. Can the complexity of legal deliberations/reasoning of a judge be modeled successfully using a language or framework that is clearly not being used by that judge?11. Is the \\"test of time\\" a legitimate criterion for accepting certain legal practices?12. What is the role of metaphors in legal reasoning?13. What is the role of defeasible reasoning in legal deliberation/argumentation?14. Are legal deliberations always inconclusive?15. Is there any need, from the standpoint of rational legal deliberations, for the \\"trappings of the judicial process,\\" i.e. the elaborate courtrooms with elevated benches and compelled etiquette on the part of the observers and litigants?16. Is criminal law dependent on the notion of free will?17. Assuming that certainty is unattainable in most legal deliberations, what is the role of probability theory in these deliberations?18. Is the interpretation of legal texts deductive, and if not, what does it mean to interpret a legal text?19. What is the difference between common law and statutory law?20. Does agreement on the meaning of legal texts depend ultimately on the use of force?21. How does one characterize an activist judge from a non-activist one?22. When a legal text or document is examined, is it always important to acknowledged the intent of the individual(s) who wrote it?23. Can interpretations of legal documents ever be politically neutral?24. Can a legal system be constructed that would be free of errors?25. How influential has feminist thought been in the philosophy of law in the last few decades?26. What is the nature of \\"prudentialism\\" that is advocated by the author of the book?"},{"Title":"The Problems of Jurisprudence","review":"What is law? How exactly do judges reason out it's kinks? Does it operate on presumtions of behaviourism or free-will? Why aren't lawyers or judges puzzled by these quandries? Posner seeks answers and ends up in a not-so-comforting place.This book starts small and ends big. From epistemology (how we gain legal knowledge) through ontology up through his concluding 'Pragmatist Manifesto' the book is quite philosophical and this may be offputting to some in the legal profession. As usual though, Posner tackles his subjects in a clear, fast-paced and exciting way. The task that Posner sets for himself is to forge a place in legal theory (or lack of?) between two radical extremes: On one hand, there is the view that law is a completely isolated profession and legal reasoning is completely internal to it. The other sees law as a clever guise for politics- it's 'methods' being a subterfuge for the judge to justify her political views.Through pragmatism, Posner sees both theories as gross exageration- the first, falsley denying law's susceptibility to outside non-legal techniques and the second's refusal to acknowledge the judiciary's independence from the legislature.As Posner acknowledges in the intro, Posner's view here is middle of the road and to many, it will be boring. He doesn't take sides, rather he creates a side: that of legal pragmatism. No matter what your persuasion philosophtical, political or jurisprudential persuasion, there's nothing like a little Posner to get you thinking!!"},{"Title":"Bernard Tschumi Zenith De Rouen","review":"It's a good book, but I thought it was better, because there isn't much project's description, but there's a lot of pictures"},{"Title":"The Adversary: Saga of Pliocene Exile (Vol. 4 in the Saga of Pliocene exile)","review":"I bought the Kindle version, having read the original print book many years ago... Unfortunately, whoever did the electronic version was too sloppy or too lazy to check and see if the spell-checking/auto-correct was screwing up the author's work. 'Torc' now reads 'tore' among other nonsensical things... It's so bad that when the Dougal character mistakes the Non-Born King for a character from Narnia, he calls him \\"Asian\\" instead of Aslan! Don't buy this on Kindle - I'm sure the print versions were more accurately vetted."},{"Title":"The Adversary: Saga of Pliocene Exile (Vol. 4 in the Saga of Pliocene exile)","review":"This book is the final in the pliocene saga, it deals with the period of time following the subsumation of Mercy and Nodonn, the start of the Nightfall wall (end of the world), the children of the Rebels attempts to escape back to the Milieu. The war between the Firvulag and Tanu has taken on a new focus, an armistice is technically in effect, however the Firvulag are going to war. The time gate back 'home' is possible, the Rebels dreams are threatened by the childrens wish to go the Milieu. Mixed in to all this, Aiken (the King) has problems following the subsumption, there is internal politics making havoc with the whole question. Marc Remillard's role is finally determined and his future role is implied, which then allows the next four books (Intervention, Jack the Bodiless, Diamond Mask and Magnificat) to make more sense. Either set of four can be read by themselves, and one set seems to prelude the other, but in the end the actual order becomes nebulous. A fantastic read, which ties up all the loose ends, and demonstrates some of the more interesting side effects of the meta-abilities."},{"Title":"The Adversary: Saga of Pliocene Exile (Vol. 4 in the Saga of Pliocene exile)","review":"I should have read the reviews first! In my enthusiasm of finding the Golden Torc series on Kindle, I went ahead and bought them all at once.The first 2 books were marred by occasional transcription errors, but not so many as to spoil the experience. Not so with the 3rd and 4th.In have really tried to get over the constant misspellings created by a very poor OCR product, and without any perceptible quality control, but when they are so frequent and of core words too, it's impossible.This has detracted to such an extent that the joy of re-reading a much loved classic in Kindle format has become an irritant.Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to go on without rectification. Others have previously commented on this and you have done nothing about it. Do you actually read the product reviews?Bottom line, overpriced for such shoddy quality. Please sort it out."},{"Title":"The Adversary: Saga of Pliocene Exile (Vol. 4 in the Saga of Pliocene exile)","review":"I read the series on recommendation of a friend, who was intrigued by it. I have about 1/2 of volume 4 to go. I found that the story was not a nail biter and the presentation suffered from horrible editing. It appears that the books were scanned in but never proofread. The story has too many characters without any real threads to hang on to."},{"Title":"The Adversary: Saga of Pliocene Exile (Vol. 4 in the Saga of Pliocene exile)","review":"As usual, Julian May writes a great book, the 4th in the Many Colored Land series, which is in itself a continuation of her Galactic Milieu series. This book has an exciting climax as the Pliocene Exile is changed forever and the stage is set for the other, temporally earlier books in the Milieu series.I like this book and the whole series, but the Kindle version of this book is clearly a poor OCR conversion of the original book. I didn't find it as annoying as some, but it IS fairly annoying that most of the more glaring issues could probably be fixed in about an hour or less of editing. Heck, a search and replace of torc for tore would likely take &lt;10 minutes and would fix about 50% of the issues.Anyway, I think it is is still worth getting this book in Kindle form, but I do hope the publisher eventually updates and fixes the editing/proofreading."},{"Title":"The Adversary: Saga of Pliocene Exile (Vol. 4 in the Saga of Pliocene exile)","review":"This last book in the Pliocene series is great.

Most people leave the house then when returning one girl finds a surprize in the kitchen. The main problem in this book was that R.L. Stine tried to put too much suspense in it and it sort of gets old. just buy a used copy for a penny for reading when you have nothing else to do. I reccomend that you get the babysitter 1 by R.L. It's one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"All-Night Party (Fear Street, No. 43)","review":"I really liked this story. The reason I liked this story was because I love all R.L.Stine stories also because they are scary. I love scary, mysterious, and horror stories like that. Another reason I loved this story was because the way they put murder stories and how they keep making you want to read because of the awesome hooks they have in the stories. R.L.Stine is a great author of scary stories.There was Hanna, Gil, Patrick, Gretchen, Jackson, and Marco. It was a girl named Cindy's birthday, which they are all her friends. So for her birthday they kidnapped her and brought her to this island called Fear Island. As a joke they did it for her birthday for a surprise birthday. Patrick said there was a killer on the loose at Fear Island. But the party was a blast they wouldn't let a killer ruin their party. Or would they? Cindy was found dead on the floor. Did Patrick make that up? Did one of her friends kill her? Read the book it's an awesome book.Who I would recommend this book to is a girl or boy. Only thing is you have to like horror, mysteries, or scary stories.

You have the party of a life time and end up dead"},{"Title":"All-Night Party (Fear Street, No. 43)","review":"Gretchen has only lived in Shadyside for six months, and already she has made quite a few friends and is dating one of the hottest guys at school. It is one of her friend's birthday, Cindy's and they have planned a literal all-night party to celebrate. After 'kidnapping' Cindy and taking her Fear Island these group of friends plan to have the best times of their lives. On their way to the island they learn a killer has escaped is on the loose, but they will not let this slow them down in their party goals. But right away things start to get weird and the 'killer' party really begins. When one the Birthday girl's body is discovered the search for the real killer is underfoot, but that is if they can discover who the killer is before the killer finds them first.At first when I started to read this I couldn't help but think of I Know What You Did Last Summer, which I loved so I was thrilled to read this book. Our main character, Gretchen, is very keen and aware - particularly aware of Jackson who keeps staring at her and giving her the creeps. Is he the killer? Or is it Marco, her boyfriend that she can't wait to get away from? Or is it one of the girls? You think you know and then a new clue is found and you are not so sure anymore...I loved being on my toes the entire time. I really had it in my head who the killer was only to discover I was wrong. Love that! That is one thing that R.L. Stine always gives you, a surprise ending. He never lets you down in this sense. It is odd however, growing up on Fear Street books, that the Fear StreetS are paranormal but rereading the 'normal' Fear Street I have not come across any that are paranormal based. In a way this makes them that much more scarier - the real fear is reality. A must read for anyone who loves R.L. Stines or for those in the mood for a good mystery thriller that is also a quick read."},{"Title":"All-Night Party (Fear Street, No. 43)","review":"On Cindy's birthday her friends throw her a surprise party on Fear Island.

Especially to anyone who likes mysteries. I finished this book in about 2 - 3 hours."},{"Title":"All-Night Party (Fear Street, No. 43)","review":"Somehow, my library said this was the first book in the Fear Street series, but it's not...its way down on the list, it's 45 in the series. All-Night Party does fine as a stand alone book, though I do wonder if there isn't more about the location and background (since I believe all the stores are set in and around the town of Shadyside). In this book we have a medium cast of teenagers who set out to jokingly kidnap their friend Cindy to her birthday party out at a deserted cabin on Fear Island. During the botched kidnapping, one of the friends reveals that here is an escaped prison inmate out on the loose, but that doesn't stop our intrepid party goers. All in all, it's a pretty typical set up; kids alone on an island with no phone, a remote cabin, dark and stormy night and tension amongst friends while the spoiled and selfish birthday girl is unaware that she's made her very last birthday wish!The characters include Hannah Waters, Cindy's oldest best friend; Gretchen Davies, a relatively new girl who's just glad to be accepted by the group but is sometimes put off by Cindy's selfish and vain behavior; Gil Shepherd, Hannah's boyfriend (who used to be Cindy's boyfriend until her parents wouldn't let her see him anymore); Jackson Kane, the kinda intense and creepy guy, a loner; Patrick Munson a friend whom Cindy loves to tease; and Cindy, the spoiled and self-centered birthday girl. They're all pretty typical teenage characters full of angst and melodramatic goings on...Hannah and Cindy vie for Gil's attention; Cindy likes to have whatever Hannah is wants whether she really wants it or not, and so on.All-Night Party takes all that, throws in the prospect of an escaped killer convict, mixes in a dark and stormy night and you've got an easy set up for a teenage murder-mystery! When Cindy turns up dead, the party goers initially think the maniac is on the island, but it slowly dawns on them that the killer isn't some unknown lunatic...it's one of them. That's when things get interesting...who did it? Read though this quick little mystery and see if you can piece it together before the big \\"reveal\\" at the end.Overall, All-Night Party has good atmosphere and the antagonism between the characters is good, but occasionally grating (a bit overdone), and I enjoyed figuring out who done it (early on unfortunately), but it was still a fun read, kind of the way a B movie is still fun to watch even though you figure out who the killer is halfway through the movie! I give it three stars, a light and entertaining murder-mystery with classic horror elements."},{"Title":"All-Night Party (Fear Street, No. 43)","review":"This is a great book by R.L. Stine ofthe Fear Street books. As all R.L . Stine booksthis is a mystery. But this is a much different wayto approaching the genre of mystery.This is about a group of students at Shady SideHigh School. When one girl's birthday approaches, theydecide to throw a surprise birthday party for her onFear Island which is about two miles away from their houses. Littledid they know one boy brought a gun. When one girlnoticed it she asked him about it and thenhe looked down and said that his dad gave himthe gun for the trip because he told his sonthere was an escaped murder on Fear Island. He said he did not want to ruin theparty so he never mentioned it. So they go anyway butwhen the party girl is found dead in the kitchen theyall fear for their lives. Was it one of their friendsor the escaped murderer?I would recommend this book to Sixth, Seventh, and Eightgraders. This is considered a young adult book.

Rather than turn out another normal size book on Route 66 the publishers had the great idea of making it pocket size, four by six inches, landscape and with FOUR-HUNDRED all-color pages. I predict that this will be the standard book for those who want to make the trip. Each of the eight states that 66 goes through has a chapter, they start with a simple map, comments about landscape and climate, then the text details what to look for along the way, with the help of historical and contemporary photos, a linear map with places and mileage goes across the top of all of these pages.Between all the route pages are some lovely spreads of Route 66 Americana which repeat themselves throughout the book, Route Food (pages 174-175 has Red-Hot BBQ Beef Ribs) Transport (168-169 has a 1936 Harley-Davidson) Music of the Road (Woody Guthrie on 156-157) and Famous Sites (Wigwam Village, Holbrook, AZ, on 294-295). The books production is excellent, good choice of photos, well laid out pages (a tip of the hat to designer Phillip Clucas) with colourful graphics behind the text on most of them. The back has a book list, useful resources guide (including websites) and index.I recently reviewed 'The Final Cut Route 66' by German photographer Gerd Kittel. Eighty-three wonderful photographs of what he saw along 66 and I think it is the perfect book to complement Nick Freeth's travelogue. Kittel has the knack of producing really good color in his photos. Both books do justice to a unique and fascinating bit of America.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Traveling Route 66","review":"Compared to other Route 66 books, this one rates far below them.

There's also some glaring mistakes, which could throw you off. If you want to travel '66, this is NOT the book you want to use.For a \\"look see\\" book, OK, but your money would be better spent on something like \\"Route 66: The Mother Road\\" by Michael Wallis.If you want to travel the route, spend you money on \\"Route 66 Adventure Handbook: Updated and Expanded Third Edition\\" by Drew Knowles or \\"Route 66: EZ66 Guide for Travelers\\" (best choice) by Jerry McClanahan.If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this book."},{"Title":"Traveling Route 66","review":"Don't let the size of this book fool you.

I won't repeat what she said but want to tell people not to dismiss this book because it was written in 1978. Some advice is timeless, especially for people starting out (at any age). I recommend buying this book for any teen ager or young person in your life. It's inspiring and give real life, usable help for making your life be what you want it to be. Less philosophical (great but now what do I do with it) advice and more practical tips a person can remember throughout life. One of my favorites is Mark's advice on remembering the difference between what is \\"urgent\\" and what is \\"important\\". Important eventually becomes urgent, of course when people allow themselves to waste time doing things they don't really care about but seem urgent only because they are asking for attention now.

After all, what good is speech-language therapy if the client does not use the skills outside of the therapy room?Dr. Owens' book, Language Disorders: A Functional Approach to Assessment and Intervention, addresses this issue in great depth. The book shows how a conversationally-based, client-centered approach to assessment and intervention will greatly increase the likelihood of generalization. It also shows how the traditional approach of teaching language targets separately and out of context may not be the best method to achieve generalization. The book stresses, rather, to assess and train language where it will be used: in conversation. Owens also discusses at length the assessment and intervention of culturally and linguistically diverse children.One major point made in the book early-on regarding intervention is the idea of making a plan for generalization when picking language targets, before therapy begins. So often SLPs make the mistake of addressing generalization toward the end of intervention, resulting in the SLP choosing inappropriate targets and/or the client showing a lack of carryover to novel contexts.Owens also includes numerous guidelines and procedures that could be especially helpful for the school-based clinician. The appendices in the book are exceptional. Most impressive is Owens' extensive index of preschool literature, complete with suggested targets for remediation for each story. Also, a detailed table of language targets accompanied by functional activities for each is provided. This book is a valuable tool for anyone who works with individuals with language disorders or language differences."},{"Title":"Language Disorders: A Functional Approach to Assessment and Intervention","review":"This is the worst textbook I have ever read, and I've been taking classes in a variety of subjects for the past 15 years. There are countless spelling errors, atrocious grammatical mistakes, references to tables that do not exist in the book, and a seemingly endless supply of redundant anecdotes.

It is an edited book, meaning that many authors devote their energies to the analysis of a single aspect of the glorious and heartbreaking history of Mexico. Thus, while each topic is well covered, there is some lack of narrative flow. Editor Michael Meyer is the author of another excellent history \\"The Course of Mexican History\\" that has a great narrative pace combined with a high level of detail. However, his book has been criticized for slighting the colonial experience. So, I guess with a story as complicated, long and eventful as the history of Mexico, you must sacrifice some narrative flow to provide detail or sacrifice detail to narrative flow.That quibble aside, this is truly an excellent book. The colonial experience is vividly detailed with sections on the resistance of the Indian to exploitation, the social stratification of the Indian class during the colonial period, and the role of women in society including marriage and childbirth. Further, Santa Anna, an enormously polarizing character comes in for justifiable criticism (Texas, his ideological flip flops and lack of constancy to any of his allies over the years) but also is praised for his bravery and consistent patriotism and opposition to all forms of foreign domination of Mexico.Finally, the role of ideology in the revolution is explored. While there were socialist overtones to much of the rhetoric that came out of the revolution, pragmatism and Mexicanidad prevail. That is, a truly independent course, truly Mexican, emerges without the ideological straight-jackets worn by other revolutionaries.A remarkable effort and a recommended read to anyone with a interest in Mexican culture, history and politics."},{"Title":"The Oxford History of Mexico","review":"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. I am an adult student of Spanish and have developed a keen interest in -- but am still a relative novice on -- the history of Mexico. I bought this book after having read several short accounts of Mexican history -- for example, various travel guide history sections (including the relatively thoughtful Insight/Discovery Channel Guide). Additionally, I have studied Mexican history on several academic websites. I bought this book hoping to &quot;pull it all together&quot; and get a solid foundation. Instead, I got book that was admittedly interesting ... BUT was a disjointed collection of articles written by different authors in different styles that (1) assumed a much greater base knowledge that I had and (2) concentrated on just a few social and political issues and eras and left huge chronological gaps. So ... I'd recommend that you buy this book ONLY if you don't need it ... that is, that you already are conversant in Mexican history. A better selection as a primer might be The Course of Mexican History by Meyer, Sherman and Deeds -- designed as a textbook, but pretty readable."},{"Title":"The Oxford History of Mexico","review":"A must-read book to understand M&eacute;xico's post-modern conscious.

Written as a kind of Part Two to Kipling's previous hit, &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill&quot;, &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; continues where its predecessor left off. Like the first book, &quot;Rewards&quot; once again follows the tame adventures of little Dan and Una as their adventures with Puck (of &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; fame) give them new insights into England's fabulous past.Once again our unlikely heroes (and their unlikely guide) are visited by some relatively obscure but important members of England's great moments. These include everything from a lady of Queen Elizabeth I's court to a half-English half-French smuggler from the years of the French Revolution. Though the stories in this book vary incredibly in quality, Kipling has extended his narrative by quite a bit. Suddenly the kids are meeting a caveman that gave his own eye for a knife and consequently ended up a god amongst his people. Going completely overboard, Kipling includes a smuggler that tells a story about his travels amongst the Seneca of North America. His tale praises (of all people) President George Washington, making the man out to be just shy of a saint. I doubt very much that there are American works of fiction out there that praise our first president even half as much as Kipling's book does here. Some of the characters from the previous book reappear in this one for a brief encore. Once again we meet Harry Dawe, the stonemason who was knighted by King Henry VIII for saving him thirty pounds. There's Sir Richard Dalyngridge again, telling the last and most drawn out boring tale in the lot. In Harry's case, his reappearance is an extension of his somewhat foreshortened previous adventures. In Sir Richard's case, there is no such excuse.There are things to love in this book, of course. The poems are just shy of brilliant here and there. It's difficult to keep yourself from singing them once in a while. They're just so doggone rhythmic. And there's a lot of humor in these stories too. Puck at one point introduces the kids to an overly affected astrologer who saved a village from the plague (he had the right methods but the wrong reasons). Then there are lines in this book that could keep you awake and twisting for days. How quickly can you say, &quot;I tell you now that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep faith, even though he may save his soul by breaking faith, is the faith for a man to believe in&quot;? Even better, how quickly can you understand it? The book also gives chummy nicknames to some of the world's most infamous men. Suddenly Napolean Bonaparte is being referred to as &quot;Boney&quot; and Sir Francis Drake is reduced to a mere, &quot;Frankie&quot;.The best way to tell if you'll enjoy &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; is to read &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill First&quot;. If you read that one and enjoyed it then you should have virtually zippo problems with this later creation. Personally, I loved it. I thought it was a great little English History 101 (though I can't exactly remember the difference between the Normans and the Saxons anymore). If you read everything with the exception of the last chapter, I think you'll find it undeniably charming. And who knew Puck enjoyed hearing about business transactions? You could learn a lot from a text like this."},{"Title":"Rewards and Fairies","review":"\\"Rewards and Fairies\\" is the sequel to \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\". I am very glad it is currently in print. Sometimes it goes out of print, sad because I find it one of the best books for young people. Dan and Una, two children growing up in the English countryside, meet their old friend Puck, a long time vistor to the farm where they live. Puck has used the leaves of the magical trees, oak ash and thorn, to wipe out the children's memories of their past visits, when Puck introduced them to the ghosts of the people who lived on and loved their land before them. In this book, the children and their visitors range further afield, visiting the chalk downs and sheep country where their father grew up. There they meet an early man-god, who sacrificed his eye and his mortality to protect his people and the sheep from their enemy, the wolf. They meet a French and English smuggler who introduces them to American history.

Anyone whose main interest is not in makeup/fasion but still want to appear polished in public should get this book."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"This is the make-up book my friends and I have been searching for -- techniques and sane suggestions for women over 40. There are pages for younger women, too, but finally there's something of substance for women in midlife who cannot -- and should not -- try to look like their daughters!Thanks, Bobbi Brown, for remembering the aging population. We still want to go out looking great, not overly made-up. This book is a wonderful start -- and I would love to see more like it."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I bought this book almost 5 years ago, and all the advice it contains is not outdated yet. Good advice on how to apply makeup, which are the best shades according to the age, hair color, skin tone and even race (I am Hispanic, although not the typical black haired with olive skin). After reading the book, I decided to highlight my hair and it really made a difference! The only thing I did not like is that sometimes, it became sort of Bobbi-centered, due to the great amount of pictures of herself and her family and relatives."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"My daughter ordered this book and has these comments:This book attempts to cover each age group in the population, suggesting targeted beauty, well-being, and health tips. It fails miserably, because it is not accessible for most readers, who might get a single page devoted to them personally. The tips are mostly common sense (exercise, eat right, etc.), and while this book tries to be holistic in it's scope, we all know we should take care of our bones and relax...it's nothing new or anything to get excited about. It is a bare-bones collection of photos of people who could walk the runway at any age, and tips that read more like the sugeon general's recommendations, and less like a true beauty insider's secrets. Really no practical info here, I expected more from a makeup guru like Bobbi Brown. Did she even have any part in this book's production? Seems like it could have been written by anyone...and had her name slapped on to sell more copies."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I was hoping that this book might give me tips on how to apply makeup, what would work best for my face shape, lip shape, eye size, skin color, etc. But it was too general in my opinion. I haven't found any tips that I have carried with me. So I'm still looking for a good book on how to apply makeup!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I think this book is pretty outdated now.

It does not have tons of pics, but it contains tons of info"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"AT LAST! I cannot believe that a book has been written for ALL ages....whenever I am reading a magazine (or book) about make-up, it sounds like women are no longer interested in looking good after 50! NOT TRUE! In just a few years I'll be reaching 70 and I want to look as good as I can at this age, and Bobbi has great suggestions and tips. I loved this book. I am SO tired of reading about make up suggestions for 20's, 30's 40's 50's then NOTHING, like women over 50 or 55 no longer exist. Also, seeing older women on tv, just on arthritis commercials. Can't we see some pretty older woman on a commercial for make up, or a hair product???? When I was reading Bobbi's book, I felt I was \\"still in there\\"...someone like Bobbi knows there are women like us who care about themselves. She helps us use makeup the right way for all ages!!! Thanx Bobbi......you made MY day."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I am a 46 year old mother and wife. ALthough my husband and I are almost empty nestors (next year) I will always continue to try to make myself look my best for me and my family. Your book allowed me to read and learn the natural way to do this. No on needs to be heavy handed when applying make up. It seems by your books that the more natural looking the make up the more beautiful you are. Letting your flaws come through can show ones beauty. Thank you for your inspirations."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I find this book to be better and more complete than Bobbi's first book. It contains basically the same techniques, but presented in a different format. It is less restrictive regarding colors and makeup application and uses more real women for models. Also, the tone is less bossy, and I liked the aproach to makeup divided in several age groups. My guess is Bobbi read all the bad reviews on her first book and tried to improve it. Well, she succeded.If you don't own her first book and would like to read something of hers, definitely buy this one, don't waste your money on both. This one is more complete and has better pictures. Whereas you might be a little uncomfortable with her way of speaking (don't do this or that...) you'll appreciate her advice in the end. After all, she did come to revolutionalize the makeup industry with her natural approach to makeup. Before her, the choice in foundation colors was very limited and basically pink-toned. She was the one who suggested women should wear yellow-toned foundation and natural blush (not the diagonal stripe along the cheekbone). Many people may not realize it, but the current trend to make makeup natural is here to stay and she brought it forward!!! Thank you Bobbi, because of you we see less mask-like pink foundation, less horrible blush, and even less brown liner on the lips! If you haven't changed the way you apply makeup n several years (or decades), you will love Bobbi. Also, if you are in a makeup rut and use foundation blush and lip liner in this way you should DEFINATELY buy this book and liberate yourself of the horrid 80's style of applying makeup. You'll be grateful for being able to show your most natural and pretty face!!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I had this book for a few weeks before I picked it up to read. I was pleasantly surprised. Going in, I felt as if I knew everything there was to know about makeup already. Years of reading fashion magazines and getting makeovers had put me into a comfortable groove. Yet Bobbi did teach me a few new tricks with the tips she suggests in this book. I whizzed through it in one evening and found it to be an easy read. I think the biggest thing women forget is that if they're 40 and still treating their face as if they're 30, they're not doing themselves any favors. Bobbi reminds us of the essentials we need to know at each age. Sure, there are some unnecessary bits in the book that I already knew. But maybe the next woman won't know those things already. Everyone can just pull from it what they need."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"&quot;Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution&quot; is a guide to looking good and staying healthy from your 20s to your 70s and beyond. Six chapters cover each decade of your life, starting at age 20 and going on to beyond the age of 70. In each of these chapters, Bobbi explains what kind of make-up and cosmetics products you should use and why. After that, there's a chapter about staying fit and healthy. It includes information about the kind of nutrients you should be getting during each decade, too. Also inluded are tips on make-up and applying it, including how to find the right colors for you. My favorite part of the book were the chapters about the kinds of tools your would need to apply make-up. Plus, an entire chapter covered cleaning out your make-up drawer/cabinet/bag, with advice on what to keep and toss, and it also included a general timetable for make-up's life span. Many more topics were covered in this book, including caring for your skin, answers to beauty questions, quick fixes for beauty emergencies, beauty while you're pregnant, and much more. This book is an essential guide to beauty throughout your entire life."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I am definitely an admirer of Bobbi Brown, whose lovely makeup designs can actually be worn by real women in real life. Her book &quot;Bobbi Brown Beauty&quot; is one of my favorites. However, much of the advice in that book is repeated in this one. There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life. However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication. I would only purchase this book at a bargain price."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"This may not be the one for you. That having been said, however, I love this book. I consider it to be a beauty \\"what-for?\\" book. The pictures in it are absolutely gorgeous and they are of real-looking women. That is a definite plus for me. I love Bobbi's style of doing makeup. I love seeing real women wearing it. However, there are no step-by-step instructions for different looks as you find in Kevyn Aucoin's books. This may be a drawback for many people.There are, however, good common-sense guidelines for health and beauty (particularly good skin tips) and general instructions for makeup application. Bobbi does still like her rules, but her approach is much less stringent in this book than it was in her first effort (Bobbi Brown Beauty). I love the chapters on beauty guidelines by the decade (20's through 70's and beyond). I also appreciate the \\"Beauty by Skin Tone\\" section. I don't fit any of the classifications listed, but it is very interesting to read her recommendations for several ethnic groups/skin tones based on each group's inherent strengths.The \\"It Runs in the Family\\" chapter is full of beautiful family portraits which I find inspirational as well. The makeover section is small but useful and the \\"Just Add Color\\" chapter gives helpful recommendations, especially if you are looking for Bobbi Brown Cosmetics products. I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you are looking for an inspirational beauty guide. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"I'm a makeup junkie, so I eagerly awaited this book. If you have other makeup books, especially those by people like Kevyn Aucoin, and her earlier work &quot;Bobbi Brown Beauty&quot;, save your money. It is just a feel good about being a woman book, not a makeup book. The only reason I gave this book two stars is that right in the beginning a compare/contrast section shows how photo retouching remarkably alters photos. That section should be recommended reading for all persons reviewing fashion magazines."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"Bobbi Brown was in her mid-forties when she wrote this (a time of life she laughingly calls the \\"oh s$@t\\" decade\\"), and her years of playing and working with makeup and hundreds of different faces, skin colors, tones, and types, not to mention products of every kind, inform this useful and enjoyable primer on how to successfully use makeup at *any* age.Kudos to Bobbi for featuring women who aren't all WASP-y looking and twenty-something. There is a big wide world of women who remain interested in looking their best once they're out of college and beyond the first few years of their professional life. Bobbi knows that for them, it's not just about making the boys sit up and take notice anymore (though gosh, it sure is fun when they do). It's about feeling good in one's own skin (literally and metaphorically), making the most of what you have with good sense, good humor and good taste. Nothing over the top here -- nary a Tammy Faye Baker paint job in sight -- just practical advice for making the most of your own brand of \\"pretty\\", whatever that might be. Bobbi is an advocate of the \\"less is more\\" approach, and the results are beautiful. Enhance, don't disguise, your assets. More makeup will only call attention to the things you think you are hiding -- and too much makeup will age you faster than almost anything else. As a woman on the \\"wrong\\" side of 35 (though I wouldn't take a million bucks to get back the last ten years of my life), without question I've received the most compliments when I'm wearing the least amount of makeup. Buy good stuff, apply it well, READ THIS BOOK -- and people will notice. Be prepared to turn a few heads ;-). What woman doesn't want to look her simple, beautiful best? Bobbi gives you confidence that you can do it, with a minimum of fuss. Very empowering, I think.Other just-as-good books in a similiar vein: Chic Simple Woman's Face, and Sonia Kashuk's Beauty (which includes a DVD!) These three books together could easily form the modern woman's library of beauty/make-up/skin care -- they go way beyond \\"wash your face at night and always have Kleenex in your purse\\" but aren't so technical or over the top that they posit the unattainable. Sure, they all feature good looking people -- some of them models -- but that's not ALL they show. How many people are model material anyhow? These are books for the rest of us -- the other 99.9% of the female populace. Hurrah to THAT!The only way Bobbi's empire could be improved is if she made her line \\"bunny-logo\\" worthy; certifiably cruelty-free, or better yet, vegan (without any animal testing OR ingredients). She'd capture a whole new swathe of women who shop by the bunny -- and no, not Hugh Heffner's bunny logo ;-). Another wise move would be for her to roll out a line of less expensive (but still quality) items in middle-market department stores that have a certain cachet (Tar-jhay, anybody?) Sonia Kashuk's done that and proved that there's no need to spend a fortune to get really nice stuff. (End of editorial!)"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution : A Guide to a Lifetime of Beauty","review":"Why do I call this the everything book. Because it really does cover everything you need to know when dealing with beauty. Some may think that when discussing beauty one is only talking about make-up. But many of us know better; if you're aspiring to be a beautiful woman, for the rest of your life, than make-up is just the tip of the iceberg. Bobbi Brown goes into great detail about what you eat, skin care routine, exercise, vitamin intake, and many other things that are crucial in keeping yourself beautiful. And the best thing is that she categorizes it based on age, 20s-80s. This allows someone like me to not only easily look up my age bracket and find out information, but also allows me to prepare for when I get older, and take on some new habits that you I have missed when I was younger. Brown also talks about more than just beauty, but about being a healthy woman. I really love her information on vitamins, which ones are important for your age, and what those vitamins do for your body. I have yet to buy this book, but I've copied so much useful information out of it, I might as well invest. I have no concerns about getting old, but looking old, and this book will really help me get rid of that concern."},{"Title":"The Leavenworth Irregulars","review":"William Blankenship's \\"The Leavenworth Irregulars\\" is a caper novel with a difference. Good idea, but not handled well.The \\"caper\\" is an army payroll heist from Fort Riley by three ex-GIs who met in the army prison at Fort Leavenworth. The heist is well thought-out and well executed, with no one getting hurt and the gang getting away cleanly.The kicker is that a couple of Fort Riley soldiers figure out who did the heist and determine to recover the money for themselves. The tone changes from cleverness to brutality as these bad guys pursue the good thieves.Plot is above average for the heist; so-so for the hijacking of the loot. Characters are pretty much cardboard. Action scenes are not bad but predictable.If this were a movie, I'd say it was \\"made for TV\\". Not bad, somewhat entertaining, but not satisying."},{"Title":"Breadmaker's Guide","review":"I love this book! I have been baking bread for several years, but had never tried the batter breads.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Breadmaker's Guide","review":"This is by far the best little cook book I have ever used, the directions are so easy and she manages to takes the guess work out of bread making.

Her first book on soups and quick breads is just as great. I highly recomend both books."},{"Title":"Breadmaker's Guide","review":"My brother recently started making his own bread. He tried different recipes online but wanted a book that had a bunch of different bread recipes all in one place. He hasn't used the book yet, but he did seem impressed with it."},{"Title":"The Biographical Dictionary of Musicians","review":"The main reason that any practising musician or other music professional of any real sophistication would continue to use Rupert Hughes' musical handbook, \\"The Music Lovers' Encyclopedia\\", has been for the sake of the biographical portion, here available separate from the rest of Hughes' venerable old handbook and dictionary, frequently reissued over the last (20th) century. An edition of this enchiridion, including not only the biographical part but the terminology lexicon and the rest of it (forming together that \\"Music Lovers' Encyclopedia\\"), from the early 1950s, is the one which I used as a young music student from early adolescence onwards.There are numerous other such seemingly superannuated dictionaries of musical biography (especially in German and in English), and this one is not even among the very best of suchlike. If one were to make comparisons of it, for example, with similar works, such items as, among them, \\"Baltzell's Dictionary of Musicians\\" or back editions of \\"K&uuml;rschners Deutscher Musiker-Kalender\\", Hughes' work would be of less intensive usefulness. Nonethess, Rupert Hughes' work remains useful, as other older works of the kind do for much the same reasons. Unlike many such others which are even more desirable to track down for purchase than Rupert Hughes' compendium happens to be, his work is relatively easy to find for sale, usually inexpensively, in used book stores in the Dominion of Canada and in the U. S. of A.The biographical entries (which are in the portion of Hughes' larger work that is of most abiding interest) are rather perfunctory, succinct, and usually accurate, but that part of the guide, happily, includes the names of many minor composers, musical editors, performers, once widely respected (but now largely forgotten) pedagogues, and others, especially of the 18th and 19th centureis, for whom one seldom encounters entries in later music biographical or general music dictionaries and cyclopaedias. For tracking down such musical \\"lesser luminaries\\", even if one might wish that more more ample information about them were included, at least what the modest entries provide makes for a good departure point for learning, at the very least, the \\"bare essentials\\" (dates and so forth) about these figures, and often a bit more as well."},{"Title":"Smokie's Last Job","review":"I actually &quot;ghost wrote&quot; about half of this book!

Marco, the suave rocker with a deadly secret, has spent centuries searching for someone who would love him for himself. With an attraction akin to the love shared by \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and played out in \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" Ria Dimitra weaves her own suspenseful story. Through realistic dialogue and vivid characterization, she allows her readers to bear witness to the story that unfolds before them. Who wouldn't feel the frustration and utter panic as Kassie's younger brother Izzy realizes that Marco is a vampire and tries to warn and protect her, but Kassie won't listen, and her two best friends don't believe him.Highly recommended for teen through young adult readers (and anyone with a fascination for vampires!) I'll be waiting for the sequel, but in the meantime, I'm grabbing a copy of her first novel, The Blood Waltz.."},{"Title":"Fiend Angelical","review":"I devoured this book in one sitting! This is the best vampire romance I've read in a long time - and I've read a lot!Marco Visconti is the ultimate bad boy - good looks, charisma, he's to die for. Kassie meets him for the first time when she goes to hear his band play at a club. Of course, Kassie can't help falling in love with him. But what she doesn't realize is that Marco is a 700-year-old vampire and her life is about to be turned upside down. Her brother Izzy figures it out first but no one will believe him - after all, everyone knows vampires aren't real!It's been a long time since I was a teenager but a good love story transcends time and age - remember Romeo and Juliet! I really liked how the author uses the vampire themes we're all familiar with, yet steers away from some of the over-uses cliches (Marco does NOT turn into a bat and fly around!) There's also more to the story then meets the eye - Marco's neighbors from 700 years ago and Kassie are the same religion but, where the neighbors used it to exclude him, Kassie uses it to make excuses for him. The characters are original and believable and even the minor characters seem real - the priest, Fr. Dimitri (an obvious wordplay on the author's name!), the next-door neighbor, and I especially enjoyed Izzy, the younger brother. But this story obviously belongs to Marco and Kassie - I wanted so desparately for them to find a way around their problems! I can only hope there's going to be a sequel!"},{"Title":"Fiend Angelical","review":"Fiend Angelical is an interesting, fast paced vampire romance novel. It was a younger group of characters than I expected but that's good because older teens/young adult readers will be able to relate to it. The heroine is a pretty, young Greek Orthodox girl. I found that provided a unique perspective to the story. Her vampire love interest, Marco, has all the features a woman would find appealing - he's beautiful, musical, mysterious and vulnerable in his own ways. Some parts are very sexy. The reader experiences the caring, concern and feelings of all the characters. You will find everything you are looking for in a Gothic romance! Worth a read!"},{"Title":"Fiend Angelical","review":"I'm a vampire romance fiction fanatic. Whatever book comes out in the vampire romance genre, I buy it. I can safely say that I've read enough vampire romance to know the difference between a good book and an average one. This counts as an average vampire romance. Below are my reasons why this book is merely \\"average\\":1. The vampiric hero, Marco, was not really well-developed. While reading the book, the author didn't spend a lot of time developing any real sympathetic qualities about Marco for the reader. Usually when a flawed character is the hero in a story, there have to be some redeeming qualities the reader can pick out. The author didn't really seem to spend too much time detailing any redeeming qualities for Marco - or enough to have them stand out. I never really got a sense of \\"who\\" he was, and sadly, Dimitra didn't go into his \\"story\\" until 3/4 of the way through the book - the wrong time to introduce the tragic hero's background. As a result, as I was reading the book I also got the creepy crawler feeling that the other characters got about Marco. He seemed like a vampiric pervert who liked virginal teens. Because the author failed to develop any sympathetic qualities about Marco, I never connected to him or his feelings for Kassie. There was also no interior monologue to really clearly define who Marco was and what he was thinking.2. Vampires have enough time in their undead lives to amass a monetary fortune. Considering Marco is 700 years old, there is no reason at all that he should be living in a condemned factory building with furniture he collected from trash heaps and bins. I was quite unimpressed in the book when Marco took Kassie to his \\"home\\" and it ended up being a run-down, trashy dive (even Kassie described it as such in her own words). If Marco still lived in poverty after 700 years of existence then why should Kassie give up everything to be his mate? He can't provide for her!?!3. The love between Marco and Kassie didn't even seem authentic or magical. When a writer creates a love story, the reader should feel the chemistry between the two characters bounce off the pages and the reader should know that the two must be together. That kind of chemistry was not present in this story. I read a lot about Kassie saying she would do anything for Marco - even die for him - but what lusty teen doesn't think or feel that about any boy they are crushing for? Furthermore, Marco didn't really exude the caring and loving gestures of a man/vampire in love -- he seemed like a horny vampire. Asking Kassie, and under-age teen, to come to his next show bearing her cleavage without a bra doesn't really fall into the \\"romantic love\\" category to me. In addition, I was not impressed by their first love scene, in which Marco merely stips off his clothing to lie naked on his dumpster-dive mattress and asks Kassie to join him. Where is the loving seduction? If Marco truly loved her and treasured her, don't you think he would have been more couth in his seduction of his one true love???All in all, I was disappointed in this story. It had great potential, but it was not fully fleshed out. I read Dimitra's _The Visconti Devils_ before this book and I must say that it is obvious that this book was her earlier novel. I thoroughly enjoyed _The Visconti Devils_, and it will remain on my keeper reading shelf. Dimitra did an INCREDIBLE job with the characters, romance, and overall storyline for that book. However, _Fiend Angelical_ is not my idea of a great vampire romance. There are better books out there.I really wanted to like this book, but I have to be honest. If you decide to ignore my review and buy it out of curiosity, I hope you revisit my review and re-read the points I made to see if I was right after all."},{"Title":"Fiend Angelical","review":"...she was waiting for Romeo...they had a love worth dying for...What part of this doesn't make you want to read it?

When I received it, I set everything else aside and dove in. I am glad I did.

I must make the point that Velvel is not writing tragedy; as bad and intractable as he shows relevant matters to be, his writing is infused with the optimism of a man still committed to realizing the American Dream, and his characters are paragons of virtue who refuse to betray their ideals - no matter how badly they suffer from their commitment to honesty and morality. Trail of Tears, even more than Misfits in America, basically shows that no good deed goes unpunished in the America of today. Success comes to those who are greedy, immoral, unethical, always prepared to stab anyone in the back to further their own interests. What has taken place in the legal profession has spread throughout the entire culture, Velvel laments, giving us crooked lawyers, business scandals of the worst sort, judges who ignore their constitutional duties, a government that can no longer be trusted, and presidents who commit immoral acts and \\"lawyer\\" their way out of them when they get caught. The problem is endemic, but Velvel is doing something to facilitate change in his role as dean of the Massachusetts School of Law (geared toward those too often denied the ability to study law) and as the author of this compelling series of books.Trail of Tears centers on the career of Lionel Wolfe, a character we became somewhat familiar with in Misfits in America. Wolfe's career is one of such injustice that the reader cannot help but be enraged at the undue suffering this good man if forced to endure. Like Harry Brohnz, the protagonist of Misfits in America, Wolfe emerges from law school with his home-grown commitment to honesty and social justice intact (despite his Michigan professors' best efforts to purge him of all ethical thoughts). He still believes that hard work and upright behavior lead to success, and he cannot betray his ideals, no matter how obvious it becomes that they stand as huge impediments to his career. Over the course of that career, we seem him punished for his hard work and commitment time and time again.Wolfe leaves the Department of Justice to take an academic position at a small D.C. law school. Having taken the dean at his word, he is appalled to soon find himself stuck at a law school seemingly determined to remain mediocre (despite the dean's promises), struggling to support a growing family on a low-paying salary (without promised raises) and abysmal health insurance. A few years later, he is in line to become the new dean of the law school, eager to take the steps necessary to improve it, when he is turned down at the last minute because he is Jewish. Forced to seek part-time work to supplement his paltry salary, Wolfe finds work at several area law firms over the years. Each time, he meets with much success and actually puts in more hours than each firm's full-time lawyers, only to be fired for the most unethical of reasons: his superiors are jealous of his knowledge and talent, he is too honest, a secret cabal of partners does not like him, etc.As one of the first lawyers to pursue antitrust work, Wolfe is a valuable asset everywhere he works, and he meets with great success in the cases he works on. He eventually leaves the academic world altogether to become a partner in a well-established law firm. After his greatest trial success, however, he finds himself demoted and then effectively fired (and in those days, partners simply were not fired or forced out) - his biggest mistake, it turned out, was actually handing over all of the documents the opposing side asked for in discovery. In the perverted legal system of the last few decades, this is a big no-no. Clients and lawyers simply hide any relevant material they don't want the other side to see. Wolfe's turbulent career also introduced him to all sorts of unethical behavior such as the practice of overcharging clients, hiring lawyers under false pretences, and putting power in the hands of secret cabals who make decisions based on their own self-interests.Wolfe's story is truly a tragic - and infuriating - one. He suffers the ignominy of being fired four times, each time for unethical reasons and despite his personal success and commitment. Time and again, he is left scrambling to support his family while most of his fellow lawyers, schmoozers and liars all, are simply rolling in dough. By the end of this book, his spirit is almost broken.One should not look for answers as to what is to be done in the first two books of this series. In Misfits in America and Trail of Tears, Velvel has shown his readers what is wrong, how bad things are, and how the American Dream was perverted so sickeningly. I daresay he has been amazingly effective at proving his case and showing how all Americans suffer from this culture of elitism, unethical behavior, and unpunished criminal behavior. The next two books in the series will address conditions for change, as Wolfe (like Velvel himself) does what he can to change the pervading culture by co-founding a new law school (which places him in direct conflict with the pervading legal culture of elitism and unethical behavior)."},{"Title":"Trail of Tears : Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century: A Quartet (Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam, a Quartet, Volume 2)","review":"\\"Trail of Tears\\" is commonly used to refer to the forced relocation of the Cherokee Native American tribes to the Western United States in 1838. An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died on the journey, which in the Cherokee language is called \\"Nunna daul Isunyi\\" (\\"The Trial Where We Cried\\"). When I first glanced at the title for this volume, which is Volume II of Lawrence R. Velvel's \\"Thine Alabaster Cities Clean: A Quartet,\\" I transposed the vowels in the first word and thought it was entitled \\"Trial of Tears,\\" which would be somewhat apropos because it is about the legal profession. But the real title still applies because the volume tells of the forced relocation of Lionel Wolfe. The second protagonist to Harry Brontz in Volume I, \\"Misfits in America,\\" Wolfe is the hero of \\"Trail of Tears,\\" although we are clearly talking a tragic hero rather than an epic one.If \\"Misfits in America\\" was an indictment of what constituted a legal education when Wolfe and Brontz attending the University of Michigan Law School, then Velvel turns in \\"Trail of Tears\\" to the problematic practice of law. Set in the Washington, D.C. of the 1970s and 1980s, we read in growing horror as Wolfe is hired and fired time and time again because he is intelligent, ethical, self-effacing, and afflicted by a sense of justice. Given the way the world works it is clear that it sees these qualities as being faults and the idea that getting along with people is more important than being right or even being competent really turns my stomach. That those people are not worthy getting along with and must be dealt with only because of their positions rather than their value as human beings is but a final insult added to the accumulated injuries. Then again, ever since I first went to graduate school is became clear to me that merely being competent at your profession in this world would put you not just in the top half but the top quarter (at least) of most professions.I find Lionel Wolfe to be a kindred spirit. I was the only person on my college debate team not to go on to law school and become a lawyer and I would drive my debate partner to distraction by wanting to find and run an affirmative case (consumer product safety) in which I really believed (mandatory seat belts and air bags). When I considered law school I assumed I would have to be a prosecutor, since I would, like Wolfe, want to be on the side of truth and justice, even if that turned out not to be the American way. But if there is one thing I learned about debate, as a competitor and as a coach at both the high school and college levels, it would be that all the world is a game, which is exactly how most lawyers approach the profession. Velvel touched on the impact of college athletics as it changed the university environment in his day, and the importance of winning competitions certainly carried over into the practice of law he details in this volume.A single instance of being lied to, taken advantage of, and then fired would be enough to drive most men over the edge, so reading as Wolfe goes through the experience four times is downright depressing. Because his wife and children are quite happy living in the Washington area, Wolfe keeps trying to find work there and I became so concerned for Velvel's protagonist that I found myself actually entertaining the hope that Wolfe might leave his family before he is crushed like a bug (he might be better able to support them in the lifestyle to which they had become accustomed by finding employment some place else). When Wolfe actually entertains such thoughts himself it struck me as a clear indication that he had reached his professional and personal nadir, but it is noteworthy that \\"Trail of Tears\\" ends with a pointed parable that proves beyond a shadow of doubt that despite his declining fortunes professionally and economically, Wolfe finds himself at the end of his personal trail of tears with his soul intact. Besides, Robert Bork thinks highly of Wolfe as a lawyer, and that is no small endorsement.One of the aspects of Velvel's fictionalized memoirs that I have come to really enjoy in the way he reconstructs Wolfe's perspective from distinct points in the chronology. Each firing in the narrative cycle compels Wolfe to reconsider what has happened to help discern the true motivation for his termination, and while Velvel does engage in some foreshadowing on each score, I like the way Wolfe's thoughts are contemporaneous to the events and not imbued with the omniscience that retrospective reexamination entails. To put it another way, I like not only what Wolfe thinks but the way that he thinks. I know that Velvel is the co-founder and Dean of the Massachusetts School of Law and am looking forward to see how we get from where poor Lionel Wolfe is left at the end of this \\"Trail of Tears\\" to the ongoing attempt to redefine what it means to get a legal educational and to practice the law in this country."},{"Title":"Trail of Tears : Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century: A Quartet (Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam, a Quartet, Volume 2)","review":"As I have been reading through 'Misfits in America' and this sequel, 'Trail of Tears', I am reminded in certain respects of Amoz Os, the modern Israeli writer, who, upon being criticised for some of the political stances of his characters, pled the defense of the characters being fiction - and therefore, by implication, that the stances would likewise be fictional, not necessarily his own. I get the same sense when reading this, that Velvel is using this fictional tale, drawn from his own experience, his own profession and his own time to critically examine the state of affairs both current and recent past, both in society generally and in the legal/judicial profession specifically.Velvel's idealism continues from the first installment. Drawing from Abraham Lincoln's idea that it isn't good enough to do well for oneself, but rather one must also help fellow humankind, and exploring the less materialistic aspects of what the American Dream should incorporate, Velvel proceeds down a path that really would lead to the proverbial 'city on a hill', with alabaster towers that gleam in the distance. Alas, Velvel is not writing that kind of fiction. His fiction remains close the corridor of the progress of history, and so we see in compelling and interesting situations how the idea of America falls short in different ways, while still maintain the ideal.Velvel's text in this second volume (originally conceived as part of a trilogy, and later growing to become part of a quartet) continues the story of the first volume, in which the central character was Harry Brohnz, but this one focuses more directly on the character of Lionel Wolfe, whose life suffers from many of the nascent and growing problems brought forward in the first volume - elitism, dishonesty, selfishness and self-centeredness, and a long litany of evils that are still present in society today, particularly in the legal profession.Wolfe, like Brohnz (and like the author Velvel), is an idealist who maintained this outlook after law school. Working variously with the Justice Department, academic institutions, and private law firms, Wolfe suffers from discrimination because of his Jewish identity, and suffers from his lack of willingness to 'go along to get along'. Wolfe is a tragic character in many respects, rather like martyrs of old who continue to do the right thing despite the repercussions that the established powers with a more worldly mindset (in this case, power and profit motives are high on the list) inflict upon him. Wolfe was involved in cases that involved the Vietnam War, anti-trust issues, the SEC, and other problematic entities; he made potentially poor decisions (like not accepting a deanship at a Chicago law school), and had to endure continuing troubles even after securing a partnership in a not-so-prestigious law firm that nonetheless had its own internal political problems. When Wolfe lost his job, it was not at a time when lawyers would jump at the chance to sue for wrongful dismissal, and he had trouble finding people to help him in his lawsuit. After a less than satisfactory settlement, Wolfe secures another partnership, only to lose it too largely due to ethical problems with the way the firm is run.Wolfe finally had to face the situation that Washington was not for him. 'He had tried to be honest, diligent, modest, he had tried to maintain integrity, but none of these traits cut the mustard in D.C. Honesty, modesty and integrity, indeed, were positive drawbacks there.' This volume ends on a note of integrity, with Wolfe declining to take the high-profile and profitable case of the deportation of a possible Nazi war criminal, despite Wolfe's growing financial distress.The title, 'Trail of Tears', hearkens back to the injustice of the government toward the Native Americans in the early history of the United States; some things remain the same, as Velvel's narrative demonstrates.Lawrence Velvel is a great storyteller. Perhaps this is unexpected from an academic in the legal profession (Velvel is Dean and professor of law at the Massachusetts School of Law). This quartet is the kind of series which compels the reader to keep reading; even though the general ebb and flow of history are fairly well known, the details that are presented keep the reader looking for more, and the personalities presented are also very interesting - perhaps even more so at the moment, as the country watches the retirement of and selection of a Supreme Court justice.Five stars!"},{"Title":"Trail of Tears : Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century: A Quartet (Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam, a Quartet, Volume 2)","review":"It's hard to review an achievement such as Lawrence Velvel's tetrology \\"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam\\" but suffice it to say, the struggles to create a law school\\"for the people\\" are portrayed in these books in exquisite detail.The accounts are fictionalized, for obvious reasons, but as fiction, this is of course a flop--it's not even a roman a clef. This is a documentation of political infighting, conflicting goals, treachery and unbridled power-grabbing. As a depiction of American politics at any level, corporate, governmental or scholastic, it's a winner. You really have to read the entire series to get the full impact, so I won't review each individually. If you have been to law school, deal with lawyers or professors or if you want insight into political scheming, this is a text of huge merit."},{"Title":"Sammy Miller on Trials (Cycle World Library)","review":"This is a great little book for motorcycle trials enthusiasts. It was published in 1971, so is somewhat out of date, but there isn't much published material on this subject anyway.Sammy Miller is the 11 time world champion trial rider. Nowadays he runs a motorcycle museum in Britain, but at the time this book was written he was still active in the trials arena, giving demonstrations and lessons around the world.A motorcycle trial involves riding a difficult course, usually at low speed, without stopping or putting down a foot. The sport originated in Europe during the 1920s as a method of testing the durability and flexibility of bikes and cars. (MG cars made their name in the car division of trials.) As bikes (and cars) got better, the trials got harder and harder to the point where only specialized vehicles could make it through the courses.Shortly before this book was published, Sammy spearheaded a complete changeover from traditional heavy four-stroke bikes to lightweight Spanish two-strokes. This book covers both types, although the most modern bikes shown seem like antiques compared to modern trials bikes.The two-stroke revolution made the bikes so capable that the courses became even more difficult than before--where with a four stroke a typical &quot;hard&quot; section might have impenetrable mud or a steep rocky hillclimb, modern sections are so tough that they can't even be walked.This book gives a snapshot of the situation in trials just as the changeover from old to new was taking place, but it still has a lot of good advice on bike maintenance, trial strategy, training, and sportsmanship.A great classic book."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"This was the first book I read in the series and one of the best. Morgan seems very vonerable and I can see why she acts the way she does. {*5*}! In the other books she's totally different, rough and tough. I liked her character best in Not That I Care. I liked that she told about her life so far and about her parents breaking up. You should read this book."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I Loved this book.Morgan is just like me.She has the same feelings and thoughts.I think that anyone around 11-13 would love this book.It was sooooo cool!I have also read what are friends for and that was great too.They are the coolest books and I hope that Rachel Vail comes out with some more-by the way do any of you know that #5 is coming out,it's called Popularity conest."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"This seris was the best I have ever read. I have read all of them exept for the one by Oliva because that one wasn't at the Library. These books are realistic, and it makes you feel like you are really in the book experiencing everything that happens to the characters. Also, you read a story written by one girl and then she is mentioned in all the other books with a different view point. I loved it and recommend it alot"},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I LUVED THAT BOOK! I used to hate Morgan but after I read her side of the story, i realized that she was really a softy, but she's been thru too much pain. I reccomend this book! :)"},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"The Friendship Ring books are very well-written, and are fun to read. The charecters are sooo different, which proves that opposites attract. Theres the mousy Prima Ballerina with the over-protective mother (thats CJ), theres the super jock who has too many sisters and wants everyone to like her and has a huge crush on her backdoorn neigbor (thats Zoe), theres the rebelious, moody girl witht he dead beat dad who thinks jacks are a great gift (thats Morgan), and the little geek-ish girl with the crowded teeth and major hottie of a brother (thats Olivia). All these 7th graders at Boggs middle school are friends (most of the time) despite their differenses. They go threw just about everything you would expect them to. If i were you i would read them. Also, the book about tommy (Fill in the Blank) is a good read. It lets you know the guys side."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"Read this Book! You'll love it! The whole series(for grades 4-8) rocks! I can totally relate to Morgan. The only problem was that it all took place in one day, but otherwise, it's awesome!"},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I loved this book because Rachel Vail can pry into the mind of middle schoolers and come out with a realistic, and captivating, story. It's not all wishy-washy, sappy, and so cute you could throw up kinda story. It's real. It's funny. It's true. It can happen to anyone. Her characters are people that we can relate to. She made me feel like I was reading Morgan's mind (same with CJ and Zoe and Olivia), as if I was standing right there over her shoulder and watching her life."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"Morgan is trying to get back at her friend for leaving her but at the same time she is facing family problems. I loved this book and would recommend it to girls from 5th through 8th grades. I read the whole series (except for &quot;what are friends for&quot; which hasn't been printed yet)and all the other girls in my class have started to read them.I am in fourth grade and even though it is geared for older girls I still loved it just as much. I hope these books get more popular and I can't wait until the next one comes out!"},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"Rachel Vail combines Morgan Miller's personal insight to all of her classmates' presentation objects and a story behind each of her own. The transitions into the next chapter are outstanding. The wonderful descriptions completely draw you into the story. You feel that you are sitting right behind Morgan in her 7th grade homeroom class."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I thought this book was really good except for the fact that the whole book was bascially set in one day. Besides this this book is great. The whole Friendship ring series is really good."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I just read the book called NOT THAT I CARE--one in a series of 4 in THE FRIENDSHIP RING. This book shows what I am expiriencing. I am in 6th grade. The main character in this story, Zoe, is in 7th grade. People in her grade are dating. People in my grade are dating. Like I already said, this book shows similary what her and I are experiencing. I rate this book 5 stars and recommend it from ages 9-11. HAVE FUN READING!"},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"This book is amazing.

The story and characters seem so animated and real! If I didn't know better I'd say that this is a true story!"},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I think this book is exceptionaly writen by an incredible author. I love how you can see Morgans view of things that have happened in previous books."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"The other books in this awesome series soar above this one, mainly because, if you have nothing in common with this sligthly morbid girl, you can't appreciate her story.

However, if you read the rest of the series, this is a good one to read, too, because you'll understand Morgan better in the other books."},{"Title":"Not That I Care (Friendship Ring)","review":"I hated this book. First, it wasn't all that interesting, and second of all, it was really boring for me though. This wasn't the best book Rachel Vail has ever written."},{"Title":"Ultima Thule","review":"For all of you who were disappointed in Merwin's pick for the Yale last year (and I must include myself in that category), I say give this one a chance. McCombs is obviously a carefull crafter with an excellent command over form and a love for the language. It is his love for the language, for images, and the music of the poems, something too rarely seen in contemporary poetry that kept me reading and re-reading, often out loud. This is lyrical, musical work that wants to be read out loud. I only gave the book four stars because sometimes the poems seemed too distant, a little too buried in the caves of Kentucky. This seemed especially true in the long sonnet sequence, an excellent example of McCombs' talent but simultaneously a little too stiff, a little too enclosed in the form. (But please realize that this could be my own personal predjudices against form poems.) The fact is I believe McCombs' form poems were far better than many of our mature, well-known poets. My other concern with the long sonnet sequence was the voice. Supposedly a personna poem written from the perspective of a slave who taught himself to read by smoking Mammoth cave's tourists names on the cave walls, I couldn't shake the feeling that McCombs' privileged, well-educated voice was seeping through. But then who am I to say what a slave would think or say or sound like. The fact is McCombs beautiful writing, his musical lines, his word choice and imagery, are what makes this an excellent volume--leaps and bounds better than many previous Yale selections. As an aside--McCombs studied at the University of Virginia under Charles Wright. A lot of great poetry is coming out of that program. James Kimbrall, winner of Sarabande Books Kathryn Morton prize; Judy Jordan, winner of The Acadamy of American Poets 1999 Walt Whitman Award; Jon Loomis, winner of Field's first book prize; Lisa Williams, Mary Ann Samyn, Larissa Szporluk--all prize winners. It seems to me writers coming out of that school are extraordinary talents who deserve to be read and bear watching."},{"Title":"Ultima Thule","review":"Davis McCombs is a man of many gifts: phrase, metaphor, story, imagery, message and even wisdom--an unexpected gift from the winner of a literary prize recognizing the work of &quot;younger&quot; poets. Consider his reflection on fame:&quot;But fame,like the fire in the hearth, must be fed:a bundle of twigs soon needs a log to stayalight. And then full thirty cords of oak.&quot;There is irony in McCombs music. The poet's voice, his voice, is emancipated when he finds the voice of a slave, Stephen Bishop, who worked as a guide and explorer of Mammoth Cave (Kentucky) from 1839 to 1849-- 140 years before Davis McCombs took the same job.Like Stephen Bishop, Davis McCombs' leads tours through &quot;the dark country&quot; providing his readers with light and music along the way.If talent were trees, then Davis McCombs' talent is oak and he has a full thirty cords on hand; and maybe more."},{"Title":"Ultima Thule","review":"It seems to me that Davis McCombs's Ultima Thule has something particularly and refreshingly American about it. His writing shows a real craftsman's touch and sureness of hand. This remarkable book of poems is more than a reflection on the natural wonder of Kentucky's caves, it is a rare and mysterious exploration of the human spirit past and present."},{"Title":"Ultima Thule","review":"Davis McCombs's poems vividly evoke a strange and fantastic landscape. Kentucky's Mammoth Cave and the world above it are so fundamental to the narrator's voice and the poet's that it is as if all these elements are of a piece. What a tremendous debut!"},{"Title":"Ultima Thule","review":"How beautiful to listen to slave/cave guide Stephen Bishop reflect on life through the continued metaphor of the cave. Yes, the voice belongs to a contemporary white university man, but the words are so real and the thoughts as deep as the bottomless chasms he describes. Thank you to WS Merwin for choosing such a poet, who does not dwell on the vulgar and the ugly as so many do, but instead drinks in beauty."},{"Title":"Ultima Thule","review":"Recently I spent an extended vacation exploring Mammoth Cave National Park. I was amazed at the vastness and calm of the place. It has a grandeur and a haunting quality. Amidst it all I made another discovery: the powerful, in truth--the GREAT--poetry of Davis McCombs.Somewhere in his evocations of place and suggestions of identity McCombs finds a beauty much like that of the caves. For the most part it isn't flashy. It is solid. It calls. It is true.I'm not a huge fan of \\"narrative\\" poems. Most such literary beasts should become brave and full enough to stand as short stories. The language and, God help us, rhymes are more torture in such cases than poetry. Yet here in McCombs we have a master of narrative not seen on these shores since Poe.More powerful than his narrative skills is McCombs's spareness of language. He communicates picture perfect verbal images with the dead-on certainty of phrase of a John Ashbery. He also does it without having to resort to Ashbery's often droning, lengthy verbosity.My favorite thing about Ultima Thule is the sense of camraderie in McCombs's poetry. We journey into candlelit depths and to solitary gravesites. Yet we are not alone. The sense of brotherhood in these poems rivals the best of Whitman and Baudelaire.Poe, Ashbery, Whitman and Baudelaire--these are some of my favorite poets. They are some of the greatest who ever lived. With Ultima Thule Davis McCombs joins their number."},{"Title":"Don Isaac Abravanel, statesman and philosopher,","review":"Don Isaac Abravenel lived at the juncture of the Medieval and the Renaissance, and through the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. His writings help preserve the Jews through this troubled time, but also delayed the resettlement of the Land of Israel.Ben-Zion Netanyahu (father of the hero of Entebbe, and of the recent Israeli PM) first tells of the life of Abravenel, and then discusses his outlook and religion.

However, NuVision has managed to take this great historical work and turn it into the worst published book I have ever seen.It seems as though they printed out the book directly from the OCR with little or no proofing. They apparently had no interest in meeting a reader's most modest expectations. There are frequent obvious readability-compromising typos, for instance the date 1607 on page 117 should be 1667, and 'the' substituted for 'time' on the same page (this particular OCR typo occurs throughout the book). There is even an inexcusable typo in a chapter title - BATTLE OP MALAGA. The missing periods are particularly annoying. There are no chapter titles at the top of the pages making it difficult to see where chapters begin and end, there is a detailed table of contents (not shown in the Amazon preview) that is not formatted at all and virtually useless, and quoted passages are not even indented. All paragraphs are separated by a full blank line throughout the book with no variation, thus there are no breaks mid-chapter. It is amazing how tedious reading becomes due to this little defect. Even the title on the binding of the book does not have enough contrast so is difficult to read. There is no index.There was no care given to making this book, no pride in the work. Nobody read through it to proof it. I have never seen anything like it."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Mahan uses some detail and technical language to demonstrate particular naval engagements from 1660-1783, but apart from being just a lecturer on naval warfare and an analyst on tactics, he demonstrates how the use of the general navies, or the strategy of using a strong navy to protect the fleet of an aggressive merchant marine, is the single most important root cause of advancing economic and therefore military prosperity in any nation. Using Great Britain as his main example, he also details the Dutch fleets to demonstrate their reason for becoming a European superpower in their own right. Later he identifies the presence of the French navy, apart from any material success in its engagements, as one of the determining reasons why America had a chance to win its independence. Finally, as he hints of the supreme commercial and military importance of the proposed (Panama) canal, against the declining state of the American navy and the paltry condition of its merchant fleet, he urges that America's prosperity if not survival depends on the powerful revival of its sea power.An excellent read, a great general history book, and very lucid explanations, easy for the layman. If you enjoy history you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"In this book, U.S. Navy Captain Alfred T. Mahan presents what he considers the six key elements of sea power and shows the impact their application or misapplication has had on history. Citing numerous historical examples, he shows how nations have prospered or suffered through use or misuse of their naval assets. His book is rightfully considered essential reading for any historian of naval warfare. However, its impact does not stop there.Mahan shows how nations thrived or declined during the 17th and 18th centuries through prudent or imprudent application of naval power. He contends France, Holland, Spain, et al. prospered until they allowed their naval power to dissipate. Meanwhile, Britain became mistress of the seas. British colonies provided raw materials for her industries, while her armed fleet insured uninterrupted commerce. He equates Britain's loss of her American colonies with inappropriate deployment of her fleet, contrasted with France's skilled strategic use of her own. This section will interest readers of American history schooled only on Washington's land campaign at Yorktown.Mahan's book has had a tremendous impact on history. It unquestionably shaped the imperialistic policies of pre-World War I and pre-World War II Germany and Japan respectively. Students trying to ascertain why leaders of those nations acted as they did should read this work.The elements of sea power are the same today as in 1900 when this book was first published. With a world economy as interdependent as today's, Mahan's principles are as valid as they were in the 1600's and 1700's, perhaps even more so. German war philosopher, Carl von Clausewitz's classic treatise, \\"On War,\\" is considered a must read for every Army officer. Mahan's work is to the sea-battle as von Clausewitz's is to the land. Historians, military strategists, and architects of America's foreign, economic and national security policies should read this important work to gain insights on the necessity of protecting vital and vulnerable sea lines of communications worldwide."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Despite the other reviews of this book offered above, with which I must disagree, for the serious student of naval history and tactics, this is a classic, and required reading if for no other reason than to understand the influential thinking of the naval tacticians and strategists of the early 20th century. Mahan was to naval warfare as Von Clauswitz was to land warfare. While the reading is not easy for a late 20th century casual reader expecting thrilling tales of Hornblower, it is true grist for the mill of the serious student of naval history. I disagree that the work is outdated because it deals with pre-steam naval warfare. The fundamental concepts are as applicable as Sun Tzu to land warfare. Mahan is not the end of the analysis, but was a tremendously important influence."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Granted Mahan is out of date as some of the other reviewers state. Additionally, he is a hard read and it is often said that most people only read the first chapter (which outlines the basic principles) and skip the rest. Nonetheless, the book has value as a historical document. For good or ill, Mahan had a profound influence on the formulation of American Naval Policy. Today's Blue Water Navy (most recently promoted by former Navy Secretary John Lehman as the &quot;Six Hundred Ship Navy&quot;) is built around the fundamental Mahan principle of building a fleet to destroy the enemy's fleet on the high seas. The U.S. Navy, one hundred years after Mahan, is only now adopting a new, littoral strategy fundamentally different from Mahan's."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Mahan was a lecturer at the U.S. Naval academy at the end of the nineteenth century.

Although another reviewer has indicated that this work is obsolete, the principles set forth, and the observations made by Mahan have reflect great insight. It is a superb text, recent issues being thoughtfully illustrated as well.

With the passing of empires his doctrines became obsolete. He discussed the history of the British Empire in its struggles with France prior to the napoleonic period. He was of the view that the possession of a large fleet with secure bases was the key to retaining a large empire. An empire in turn was the key to the wealth of nations.His writing contributed to the development of the German navy at the beginning of the century and indirectly to the tensions which led to the first world war. The history of Japan between the wars was characterised by a whole hearted adoption of his ideas.An examination of his work is a key to understanding much of what happened in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"In reading Mahan, I felt his exposition overreached the applicability of his theory. His selection of evidence seems motivated by a hidden agenda. The meaning he asserts seems to go beyond what that evidence can support. But I have to be forgiving. History isn't science.We rely on the experience, knowledge and intuition of a grand expert of naval strategy. We haven't the opportunity to replay Trafalgar a hundred times to harvest its truths. We can't really know whether the French had the intrinsically superior strategy and the English dominated merely by favorable throws of fortune's dice. Did Mahan really see the British navy would have an American successor?I note the Prime Ministers, Presidents and Princes of the First and Second World Wars relied on this expert. Thus Mahan's book itself is a subject of history, an event that shaped the great saga of nations. For this reason, one can't understand naval history without reading Mahan."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Introductory chapter provides classic overview of importance of naval power and is alone worth the price of the book. Historical chapters are perhaps less relevant today in an era of air and space power, as they were written during the transition from sail to steam navies.

I learned a great deal about the evolution of naval warfare over a 2000 year period. The coverage of naval combat in the day of sail was very interesting. Also of interest was Capt Mahan's view of England's mistake in not peacefully recognizing American independence, thus creating an enemy and denying itself access to friendly Naval facilities in its ongoing struggles with France. Much of the book was dedicated to the praise of the Royal Navy, its strategy, tactics, and professionalism; especially when compared to the French and Spanish Naval tactics. This book set the stage for the modern US Navy."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Alfred Thayer Mahan's classic account of seapower is absolutely essential for anyone interested in understanding why command of the seas has so drastically affected the fates of nations in war and peace. Although most of the book covers the historical naval events from the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665 through the War for American Independence ending in 1783, Mahan's work is actually a brilliant manifesto demanding that naval warfare receive the same respect and study given to land warfare, and proving that though naval tactics change with new technologies, just as army tactics do, naval strategies consist of great eternal principles that are as true for us today as for the Ancient Romans. The creation of a seapower able to test those principles is limited by certain pre-existing characteristics of peoples and their lands, but if these characteristics are advantageous, then a nation's control of the sea is virtually assured, often regardless of reverses in battle. This philosophical attitude not only puts Mahan in the ranks of Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, and Jomini, who sought universals in land warfare, but gives him the added glory of making him a cultural historian.The basis for his entire thesis about naval supremacy is found in the first chapter. Here Mahan enumerates the six \\"principal conditions affecting the sea power of nations.\\" These are geographical position, physical conformation, extent of territory, number of population, character of the people, and character of the government. The first, geographical position, is shown by the advantages an island nation like England possesses over continental nations like Holland or France. The former need not worry about invasion except by sea, while the latter must juggle their forces to protect themselves from invasion by land or sea. Commanding positions near great thoroughfares, such as the British have had over the English Channel, Gibraltar and the Mediterranean, and the Suez Canal and its gateway to the far east, also contribute to seapower.Mahan says of his second characteristic affecting sea power, physical conformation : \\"The seaboard of a country is one of its frontiers; and the easier the access offered by the frontier to the region beyond, in this case the sea, the greater will be the tendency of a people toward intercourse with the rest of the world by it.\\" Thus, he would say, so long as Americans lived close to the Atlantic they were dependent upon Great Britain politically and commercially, but when they began their westward movements to the interior of the continent, this bond gradually began to weaken and they became more and more self-sufficient.Extent of territory, the third characteristic, means \\"the length of its coastline and the character of its harbors.\\" Mahan's example of the Southern Confederacy and its lack of a standing navy, a seafaring people, or a significant coastal population shows that a long coastline, if left unguarded, can be a detriment. The presence of the above-mentioned items would have made even the most powerful blockade hopeless, and given one aspect of seapower to the beleaguered South during its brief time as an independent nation.The fourth characteristic, the number of people following pursuits at sea, those on land working in positions of mechanical skill building or repairing vessels, or those just available for shipboard service, represents a reserve power that leads to a nation being able to become a seapower. A good example of this is New England and the number of its citizens engaged in such pursuits prior to and during the War of 1812.The fifth item, national character, refers to an aptitude for commercial pursuits. Such nation's tend to produce, export, and import goods, and this therefore indicates a nation's reliance on ocean travel. Once more the English, that \\"nation of shopkeepers,\\" as Napoleon is supposed to have called them, have been leaders here for most of the past 300 years. The sixth and final thing affecting seapower, the character of the government, means whether or not a nation's leader or leaders push for commercial and naval maritime pursuits. Richelieu had a profound effect on France developing a powerful navy during his administration of the affairs of France during the reign of Louis XIII, and so did the Congress and President after the entrance of America into World War II. The new laws and ship-building programs put into action by these two branches of the national government made possible the throwing back of the Japanese Imperial Navy in the Pacific, the island-hopping campaign, the dropping of the bombs, and the unconditional surrender of the Japanese in 1945.While many talented naval historians can come up with their own characteristics, whether three, six, ten or twelve, Mahan's thesis is unquestionably sound and has taken the study of seapower, and the actions that lead up to it, to untold heights in the century since it was first published. The book was researched very thoroughly and deeply, and remains a must-read for any who would discuss naval history or strategy.It must be recognized that Mahan was writing for a specialized audience in Victorian America, and we must not fault him too severely if his style was not as readable and literary as it might have been. After all, he did prove that while naval tactics change due to technological shifts, naval strategies and the ways nations become sea powers do not. They are as fresh as when the war fleet of the Athenians splintered the hated Persians at Salamis, or when the English rode the waves of glory upon the blood-dimmed tide of Spanish arrogance in 1588."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Influence of Sea Power may be old, and written in the nineteenth century, but it is still a useful book. Mahan outlines six principles of what makes a strong seapower: geographic position; physical features; territorial extent; population size and character; and finally, the government's policy.The basic strategic principles are still valid: the seapower has the ability to drive his enemies flag from the ocean, and oceanic wars are won by decisive battles between capital ships at sea.But Mahan also warned his readers that seapower was not the only driving force behind historical events; it was but one element. An aspect of Mahan's work that is often forgotten by his extremist followers.Mahan's work covers the period in good detail, and is a must read for anyone starting out in naval history. But one must remember, it is a history, and Mahan was looking to the past for laws of human behavior; a popular style of history in the late-nineteenth century."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Despite being over a hundred years old, Mahan's classic text on the importance of sea power in wartime is both accessible to the modern reader and applicable to modern naval thinking. In fact, I've been finding that many of these \\"ancient\\" historical texts are far more enjoyable than some of their contemporary counterparts (see my review of Henry Adams' History of the United States, Vols. I & II). Mahan takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of the wars between the years 1660 and 1783, focusing on the role that sea power played in all of them. Although some of these wars were mostly confined to the continent of Europe, Mahan makes a potent case that in all of them the control of the seas played a critical role in the outcome of those wars. Mahan deftly shows through example how Louis XIV's designs for continental Europe were completely frustrated by England's control of the seas, which brought to England sources of revenue far in excess of her island-bound resources. He spends the last 200 pages going over the whole naval operations surrounding the American Revolution, looking at and extending beyond North America. As great as this book is, there are a two things that hold it back from a five-star rating. The first is his descriptions of actual naval battles. It was difficult to piece together what was going on because of Mahan's extensive use of nautical terms such as \\"starboard tack,\\" \\"leeward,\\" \\"windward,\\" etc. He did go over these in his introductory chapter, but briefly and not in a way that they would stick out in an average reader's mind. Thus, the naval battles are good for people with a knowledge of nautical terms and naval tactics, but not the average reader. The other is his use of racial theories in his introductory chapter pointing out why certain countries fared better than others in terms of sea power. While this was the prevalent theory of historiography during Mahan's era, it is still disgusting and disconcerting to the modern reader's ears. Just plug your nose and try to get through it quickly. All in all, this is a fine read on how naval superiority is critical to the success of nearly any country at war."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"We were very dissapointed with this book.Very poor printing, words all over the place and nearly impossible to read in places.Very little punctuation.Overall a sub-standard product."},{"Title":"The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783","review":"Got a copy of this for Christmas.

Their bond was so close, it aroused suspicion and finally jealousy among Rumi's followers, who plotted against Shams and eventually had him killed.Rumi was inconsolable.

Ahhh... those were the days when I didn't have a care in the world... except what book to read next!"},{"Title":"The Weathermakers","review":"Ted Marrett is a brilliant young meteorologist who has one goal: To see humanity turn weather control into a reality...and, along with several friends who stick with him through just about everything, he will do anything to accomplish that goal.The Weathermakers is a fine early novel (written in the mid-1960s) from Ben Bova... a master of \\"modern-day\\" and near-future science fiction. Despite having been written more than forty years ago, Bova displays the clear knowledge and mastery he has of the physical world in this novel and which shows up again and again in subsequent novels.The Weathermakers is recommended to anyone who enjoys Bova's works or is looking for a solid piece of science fiction."},{"Title":"The Weathermakers","review":"Good story line, believable characters, believable plot given the assumptions. Ironic how some of the old science fiction guesses about future technology came close to the truth while others are still far off."},{"Title":"The Weathermakers","review":"I'm guessing that this book is a reprint of his 1973 'Weathermakers'. I have been a Bova fan for a long time and have always enjoyed reading his books. The concept and characters that are determined to control the weather was initially intriguing. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to sustain the book the whole way through. Having read most of his works I was disappointed. If this had been the first Ben Bova book I ever read I probably wouldn't have finished it let alone buy any other of his works. I kept waiting for the book to pick up but it never did. The 'Weathermakes' was only slightly better than boring, it just fell flat overall. On the plus side his ability to see how the future of technology would unfold forty years before cell-phones and flat screens is always amazing."},{"Title":"Savage Conquest","review":"it was a good book a little long too many people more then one storyline mix together"},{"Title":"Savage Conquest","review":"The book came promplty and was in very good condition.

Fitness enthusiasts will enjoy the workouts included in this book."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"I'm not a PhD on the subject, but as a lifelong \\"fitness enthusiast\\" (read: two points shy of OCD) I've seen dozens of books on diet and exercise and have managed, through judicious culling of available material, to distill a program out of it all that has eased considerably my transition from extended adolescence into midlife crisis.Lately haven given up running and 80% of my weightlifting activity in favor of dance class, hiking/hill sprinting and bodyweight circuits, the stability ball is the single most important piece of gear I use. The core conditioning I've learned in the course of various rehab cycles relies on it, and having revamped my program based on the ball and related movements I'm always looking for new information about it.This book is the most comprehensive out of half a dozen or so I've seen on the subject. It contains sections on each body part and a full range of medicine ball movements for explosive conditioning. If I would have known 30 years ago what I know now, I'd have been ten times better off using the programs in this book than the folklore-laden, body builder-based training I was using.If you want to build the type of conditioning that will not only make you a better athlete but give you survivability throughout your life, this book would be an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"I start all of reviews with 5 stars and then take away stars with something that I don't like.I think this book is a great book. It's a very comprehensive book showing you all of the different exercises available with a stability ball and even some exercises that I didn't know could be performed with a stability ball. Very well put together.I do have two complaints though. 1) You have to have a partner for several of the exercises listed. I'm not taking away a star for that though, because other people did have it in their reviews and somehow I just skimmed over that part. 2) There's not really a good workout regiment in the book. They give you all of these exercises and then don't really culminate them well. Yes, there are a few \\"workouts\\" in the back of the book, but they only seem enough to whet your appetite. I am horrible about coming up with my own workout plan. I guess I'm just not creative enough. Seems like something they could add in a revised edition.All in all a good book though."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"When I was a kid,I remember seeing the guys who boxed at the YMCA gym using Medicine Balls as part of their training. Medicine Balls went by the wayside because people lost interest in using them. So I find this great book on Amazon, with a lot of great exercises showing how to work the medicine ball into your routine. The book is clear and fun and can be used by both men and women.I tried some of these great exercises with my wife and a friend of hers, we all had a good time, and everybody liked the Medicine Ball Workouts!!! Now we are all going to use these routines on a permanent basis. My only complaint is that they don't tell you what weight medicine ball to get. The website provided showed very expensive balls. I got a 15lb ball... at a Sports Store.( Most stores don't carry the 15lb size so you may have to shop around)."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"This book is worth twice the price. The accompanying DVD is also worth twice the price. It's a lot of information for the money!Background: until a couple of weeks ago I exclusively lifted weights for strength training. Then I hurt my back, and decided I needed to get some more dynamic training into my regimen. I bought a few medicine balls, and immediately hurt my back again! (In a different spot.) I ordered this book (along with Gambetta's medicine ball book) to teach me the right way to use medicine balls. I was a bit unsure about this book because I really didn't want all those stability ball exercises -- I was just looking for med ball ex's.In the meantime I went to a few stability ball classes at the Y because I figured that they wouldn't hurt my back. I actually enjoyed them and looked forward to the book's arrival.The exercises in the sample program look pretty easy, that is until you watch the DVD and learn the *correct* way to do them. For all you macho guys out there who think that stability balls are for sissies, well let's just say that after I completed the beginner workout, I felt like I had been beaten by hammers all over my body. But in a good way! :-)The DVD is very professionally produced. They film the exercises from multiple camera angles, and use slow- and stop-motion liberally to illustrate the critical parts of each exercise. (My 3 and 6 year-olds were mesmerized!) There is narration during the slow/stop sequences telling you what to watch for.Short story, I sent Gambetta's book back because it pales in comparison to this one.By the way, today I went to the Y and it was a beautiful day (60 degrees in February!) so the place was empty. I had my choice of an empty weight room or an empty aerobics studio. I chose the studio and the stability balls! What does that tell you?"},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"You really get your money's worth with this book and DVD. As a personal trainer I already know a lot of balance ball exercises, but this book really taught me some new tricks. There are some very challenging exercises for the core. There are quite a few exercises that require a partner which is great for me as a personal trainer. I highly recommend this book. The DVD is a real bonus."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"If your into ball training. Strength ball training is the only book you will need. This has every possible excercise you can do with a strength ball. Plus some! Highly recomended for the ball trainers. Plus you can do it at home,for you television buffs,even in front of your T.V."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"This is a great addition to any personal trainer and group fitness instructor's library. Some might complain that it takes a partner to do some of the exercises, but from a training stand point you WANT your clients to NEED you--just think for a second, if your clients didn't have to do partner exercises, then why would they hire you? Besides, even if you go to they gym regularly and you know your way around the weightroom, I would suggest getting yourself a workout buddy to help with motivation and program adherence.For the beginner, I would not recommend this book because most of the exercises are pretty challenging. I thought I knew every possible exercise on the physioball after going to Core Workshops in New York, but if you get this book I promise you will spend your money wisely.If you don't have a gym, then spend the money to get a medicine ball and a physioball, an investment of about $100, and you're well ahead of the game when it comes to fitness. It's also a great book for any of you functional training and sports performance junkies out there, you could definately use some of these with your athletes.The DVD is an excellent addition to an otherwise packed-out book of stabilization knowledge. The book doesn't tell you what poundage (or Kg) because the author assumes that you are smart enough to know your limits about what you can chuck around."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"When I decided to get back in shape, I was always mistified by the people who were using swiss balls. At times I was temepted to get a trainer session or two, then I stumbled onto this book. There are 69 exercises concisely explained, and clearly illustrated grouped by area worked. My only complaint is that a few of the exercises (maybe 10 or 12) require a partner to do. All in all after a few weeks I can feel the results, and I didn't need a personal trainer to get results using stability balls."},{"Title":"Strength Ball Training","review":"For a number of years I have been doing a challenging program involving fairly heavy weights, stretching, and aerobic exercise. I was in good shape but not making progress, even when I increased the weight load. Lots of work on ab machines helped but did not completely shape up my core.Last summer a trainer introduced me to a few exercises using stability balls. A few weeks later I found this book on Amazon. The first thing that impressed me was the quality, the amount of care that has gone into every aspect of the book and accompanying dvd. The introduction explains the approach and cites recent research. The instructions and photo accompanying each exercise are clear and helpful and the beautifully produced DVD demonstrates proper form for many, though not all, of the exercises.I tried the sixteen-week program and saw dramatic changes not only in my core but also in my upper arms and legs. I'm now following the same pattern using some of the exercises from the program and some new ones, changing the selection every four weeks. Each exercise has advice about progressions so the possibilities are really endless. Some strength training programs are illustrated with photos of people who resemble the Michelin Man. The people in this book look like regular people in very good shape. That's how I'd like to look.

And neither can Jan Freed. If you haven't read this award-winning, multi-RITA finalist yet . . . well, what are you waiting for? Her characters walk off the pages and into your heart. Her writing resonates with emotion, her stories sing with her incredible voice. And now, in ONE TOUGH TEXAN, she offers up the wonderful Matt and Abby as well as an awesome cast of secondary characters so real you'll want to step into the pages for a nice long vacation on the ranch -- not to mention for the down home cooking!"},{"Title":"Sweet Memories / One Tough Texan (Harlequin 50th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition Volume 2)","review":"Sweet Memories is not one of Spencer's best, but it is in good standing with her exceptional ability to bring the reader into the story. She knows her characters and writes of them as if she is the actress portraying the part. She must have used a model for this heroine, because she wrote a little too close to home about the typical red head, fair skinned woman and her personal problems with blushing, sun burn and frizzy hair syndrome. All in all, the characters were perfect, the setting was perfect and like I said, you really felt you were in their lives. Spencer is a very descriptive writer and researches her settings in depth no matter how simple the setting. This one really brings you into the typical American home in the late 70's/early 80's.As for the Freed book, it was pathetic to compare her to Spencer. There is no comparison. Freed started out with a great concept and went off in the strangest direction. Two chapters into the book and they're getting mugged in a latino ghetto? Huh? What did that have to do with anything? Just bring the hero and heroine together in any light and stay there. That's what LS does so perfectly. She writes a romantic story about 2 people. She doesn't stray from them. I put the book down at that part and would have thrown it away if it weren't for the fact that it was my only copy of Sweet Memories.Jan Freed should try READING a Spencer novel before she attempts to share a book jacket. If I were LaVyrle, I'd sue the publisher!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Memories / One Tough Texan (Harlequin 50th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition Volume 2)","review":"I have read everything La Vyrle Spencer has written and Sweet Memories is still one of my favorites. These characters are so real they come off the pages. Spencer develops her characters so that you feel what they feel and you understand the choices they make.

I only regret that she has stopped writing."},{"Title":"Sweet Memories / One Tough Texan (Harlequin 50th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition Volume 2)","review":"I'm a L.

I admit to being a relatively new romance fan, and I like the snappy fast paced romances prevalent now. The slow, dragging story, zero action, and painfully self-conscious afterschool special &quot;message&quot; (Breast reduction surgery can be a Very Good Thing!) made this story a chore to get through, although the writing is very good.The Jan Freed story, &quot;One Tough Texan&quot;, on the other hand, is everything I like. There's certainly nothing new to the plot--rancher has to raise orphaned niece and falls in love with the woman acting as a nanny/surrogate mom to the little girl--but Freed makes the characters come alive as individuals who are quirky and believable. It's too bad you have to buy both books to get this one, but it is definitely worth it!"},{"Title":"Sweet Memories / One Tough Texan (Harlequin 50th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition Volume 2)","review":"Don't know what everyone else was reading, but both of these stories were terrible, in my opinion.The first one, I already left a review for under the solo book.The second one, Abbey just rubbed me the wrong way, I guess.

Part of the blame falls on the lack of institutional memory at HUD (referenced in the Zhang and Weismann paper in chapter 2 of this book), but serious critical insight into this program has been a long time in coming. Given the considerable impacts this program has had and continues to have on urban ethnic and racial minorities, that is a major public administration shortcoming.Using the ongoing Chicago \\"Plan for Transformation\\" experience as a springboard, this volume furnishes the best one volume treatment of ongoing American public housing \\"transformations\\" currently available. This book is highly informative; in addition to containing chapters on the historical context of 1990's \\"transformation,\\" the book also furnishes analysis of what the demolition of public housing actually looked like on the ground, who stood (and stands) to benefit from the gentrification engendered by the demolition of high profile public housing, and also contains some excellent critical analysis of the \\"new urbanist\\" premises that were built into the HOPE VI program in the early to mid 1990's.This book is a much-needed critical antidote to the architectural determinism of much of the \\"smart growth\\" and \\"new urbanist\\" dogma still seeping out of this country's leading urban and regional planning schools. One noteworthy example: New Orleans, post hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Armed with the information this book contains, advocates and activists nationwide should be able to stand on more equal footing with the well compensated \\"consultants,\\" professors, and graduate students that were responsible for the demolition of many historic public housing communities around the United States.Note: This review refers to the paperback edition of this book, which is considerably more affordable than the hardcover version. The binding of the paperback edition is pretty flimsy (pages are already falling out of my almost new copy), but the lower price makes that acceptable."},{"Title":"The myth of Christian beginnings","review":"A well-written, critical and thought provoking study of how the Church (or perhaps better: churches) have understood their own past, from antiquity up to the present (the \\"present\\" being 1971 when this book was first published). In other words, it is not a traditional presentation of church history, but rather a discussion of how the past, and specifically the past of the Church, has been understood and presented throughout history. Still worth reading forty years later. And a comment concerning the one-star review: that review is apparently a reaction to a lecture held in 2012 by the author of this book - forty years after this book was published. I did not attend that lecture so I have no idea what the reviewer is so upset about, but the review seems to have very little to do with this book from 1971."},{"Title":"The myth of Christian beginnings","review":"It is striking that this book seems to have the rather historically dependent point that mythic beginnings for an error-free Christianity should be looked at with caution. Yet, this is the same author who will soon give a lecture at the University of Virginia claiming that the real source of religious freedom is in the same Early Christian era. Now if history teaches anything it is that intellectual types can come up with justifications for any bizarre notion of derivation or etiology if given enough latitude. But simple honesty and temperate scholarly inquiry delimits the matter of religious freedom's genesis to something that actually had a tiny real momentary belief in it, in something at least recognizable to the modern sense. Nothing remotely exists in that regard in Early Christianity. It is pure fraudulence to claim it does. To make such a mountebank claim calls into question every other scholarly judgment an intellectual has made, for it is so outlandish. It is only the quite contemporary need of some to make simple agitprop for a faulty historical notion that drives this nonsense. There is simply not one coherent phrase by any figure of this period calling for anything remotely like what we accept as religious liberty. Period. To fantasize about it on the basis of some contextualized historical ramble of re-jiggered text- interpretations is just wretched. It is meant to deceive, and is certainly not a virtue. Amazingly, this man is even not the worst it seems. One recent article which somehow got published in the Penn State Law Review by E. Gregory Wallace, and cites this man Wilkens, traverses history like a children's romper room. Somehow in such tellings a mass of past intolerances are as nothing compared with the fantasy desire to believe that they mean something else. It is proof that pure fantasy can easily be published, and that people are scarcely embarrassed by personal foolishness, such that people spend their lives trying to make their fantasy lives jibe with history. That is not scholarship. It is a very base pursuit for a life."},{"Title":"Cruz / Ortiz","review":"ISBN: 1568980884: Copiously illustrated with photos, plans, sections, elevations mostly in B&W;, but also color of good quality, short project descriptions, hardcover published by Princeton Architectural Press on a high level, graphically beautiful.CONTENTS:10 Introduction: Bending the Rules19 SELECTED WORKS:20 Housing Project on Calle Do&ntilde;a Maria Coronel30 Adaptation of the Old Courthouse Building for the State Historical Archive and Municipal Archives38 Adaptation of the Candelaria Bulwark to a Maritime Museum48 Housing Project in Carabanchel56 Santa Justa Train Station78 Offices for the Culture Bureau86 Housing Project in Tharsis96 Huelva Bus Terminal112 New Provincial Government Building in Seville126 Port Buildings in Chipiona134 Madrid Community Sports Stadium150 Bridge Over the River Maas155 List of Plans and Projects168 Biography170 Bibliography"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Rock Mechanics","review":"This is a good book, kind of classic in rock mechanics.

Both of the girls attend a school called Holebrook where young and wealthy girls go to get into the top colleges in the nation. It is a school that types like Whitney Seward went to before she was found dead in her father's apartment. The suspects range from Whitney's own father to a shifty nightclub owner that had been with the young girls recently.Melanie Vargas' investigation leads her to many dark and dubious places that she has to navigate by thinking quickly on her feet. In these adventures she is joined by Dan O'reilly, an old love interest who is back in Melanie's life. Together they will have to figure out who is behind the deaths as more begin to occur that are connected to the case. This book for me was fairly entertaining, Martinez' sophomore effort into mystery genre I would say was a success. The book, while it seemed pretty formulaic to me, kept me turning the pages until I was finished. I would recommend it to those who love mystery and have a soft spot for steamy romantic scenes."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"Michele Martinez's second book, 'The Finishing School', is a dramatic thriller that makes for a good poolside story - suspense, romance and murder. After the suspicious death of two teenage girls from one of New York's most elite preparatory schools, district attorney Melanie Vargas is taken on a dangerous manhunt through the streets of Manhattan to the forests of Puerto Rico. Accompanied by her sexy crush Dan O'Reilly, Melanie's adventure allows for an exciting page turner that provides more than one captivating plot line. Martinez's book is one that will appeal to a broad audience for its easy read and intriguing storyline. However, if you're looking for a more analytical and realistic read, you may want to search elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"District Attorney Melanie Vargas gets swept up on the wrong side of the case in Michele Martinez's \\"The Finishing School\\". Instead of the usual surrounding of desks and paperwork, Melanie goes undercover with the help of hunky FBI agent Dan O'Reilly to solve the case of two dead socialite teenagers. Melanie must also balance her work life with her home life: her one-year-old daughter, with soon-to-be-ex-husband, is ill and yet her boss won't let her off the case. Running on the fumes of sleep and plenty of coffee, Melanie, Dan and their motley crew traipse through New York City's posh Miss Holbrooke's School and the exclusive and constantly moving nightclub Screen. And through all of this Melanie wears heels.Martinez's sophomore novel is a fun airport paperback read. Not much is below the surface of the fast-paced plot, but it manages to hook the reader into turning the page. If the reader wants, the case can be solved, or one can just enjoy the ride along with Melanie."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"I thought that this installment of the \\"Melanie Vargas\\" series was leaps and bounds better than the intro-book \\"Most Wanted\\" which showed potential, but never quite got there.I thought that the way that Ms. Martinez advanced the story of Vargas and all of the central characters was very intelligent and done in a way which brought a very different side out of the main character. Additionally, the twists and turns were all very plausible for me and not contrived. I was definitely impressed with the story line and of the three \\"Vargas\\" books that I've read this one definitely provided the most visual-style for me where I could practically picture the \\"underground subway clubs\\" and the halls of the boarding school.Excellent second effort!! I just wish that the 3rd book \\"Cover Up\\" kept up with the new bar that was set in \\"The Finishing School.\\""},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"The first chapter had me interested and thinking I had found a well-written mystery novel. By the next chapter disappointment was setting in, and, after that I mostly skimmed the pages to the end. I didn't care for the main character, by the end she was acting silly, \\"oh, why did I give my cellphone away in this extremely dangerous situation?\\" It also started out grippingly about the kidnapped girl, but, the suspense and terror of it fell apart, too. This book is too long, way too long. The way the man, Dan, talked was off in many places, to my thinking. Dropping his g's at the end of words, saying ain't-who does this guy work for again? The baby was sick too much, too. I didn't like this book."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"I have all four of Michele Martinez's books. I love reading them. Waiting for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"I say that this book 'Finishing School' is a guilty pleasure due to the fact that Martinez writes this story both loose and fast. She toys with shmaltzy romance and logical jumps that leave one cringing. However, the writing is pretty darn good for a genre story, I was really into the plot and had to force myself to put the story down for breaks.The plot is good. Two girls over-dose on Heroin and Martinez then follows Melanie Vargas she leads an effort to uncover just exactly what really occured. Most of the fun here is the plot, so I wont give anything away. I applaud Martinez' ability to meld together two seemingly disperate strings of crime together.I totally look forward to reading more books in this series. Most of what I find fault with here are what you would expect from an author just finding her own voice. I hope that in the future she hits a little harder and lays off the sentiment."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"When two overpriveleged, popular white teenagers wind up dead from a heroin overdose, Federal Prosecutor Melanie Vargas gets a call from her boss in the middle of the night wanting immediate results. One of the girls, Whitney Seward, is the stepdaughter of an important politician who is currently running for Senate. Melanie is expected to find the drug dealer who sold the girls the heroin, and bring him to justice swiftly and quietly. But to Melanie, this OD case isn't as open and shut as it sounds.For one thing, the dead girls were students at the elite Holbrooke school, a wealthy private school. On the night that they died, another student went missing as well--a scholarship student, Carmen Reyes. Carmen's father is the janitor in the building where the girls were found, and she seemed to have no connection to the other girls. For this reason, Melanie finds it hard to believe when the same heroin the girls overdosed from is found in Carmen's locker. It all just seems a bit too easy, and Melanie is determined to get to the bottom of things. She wants to find out what really happened to the dead Holbrooke girls, and to bring Carmen Reyes home alive--sooner rather than later.At the same time, however, she's been assigned to a task force with her ex-love interest, Dan O'Reilly. Dan is a third-generation cop with a body made of steel who Carmen almost dated awhile back. When he winds up on the same case as her, she wonders if she'll be able to stop thinking about his body long enough to get her work done. When these two get together, they have to work to keep their minds out of the past and their feelings for each other, and instead focus on the case at hand and figuring out who would have wanted to murder two innocent teenagers--who it turns out might not be as innocent as they appeared.The Finishing School is the second book in Michele Martinez's series about Federal Prosecutor Melanie Vargas. I never read the first book in the series, Most Wanted, but had no problems following the story without it. Their are a few ends left untied (like how Melanie and Dan met and their past history) but most of it is covered pretty well in flashbacks. I thought the story was fast-paced and entertaining, even though romantic suspense generally isn't my thing. I can usually figure out the endings of these sorts of books pretty early, but that wasn't the case with this one (I did figure it out, but only in the last 50 or so pages). I'd recommend The Finishing School for anyone in the mood for fast-paced and entertaining romantic suspense."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"I just finished Most Wanted and thought it was good, so I immediately wanted to read The Finishing School. What I liked best about this book is that it stood alone. The author did mention briefly the case in Most Wanted, however I thought one could read this one without having read Most Wanted. The plot was good, with interesting characters. I hope Ms. Martinez continues with this series. I want to read more about Melanie and Dan."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"Sexy Federal Prosecutor Melanie Vargas, soon-to-be single mom, is called in to view a Park Ave. crime scene that is literally a mess. Two students from a posh private girls' school appear to have OD'd on heroin, dying particularly painful (not to mention smelly) deaths. To complicate matters, one of the school's charity students, Carmen Reyes, is missing, and seems to have been the supplier.Enter Dan O'Reilly, hottie detective with whom Melanie had a brief fling that ended disastrously, now assigned to this case. Sparks fly, as Dan and Mel try to cooperatively solve the crime while fighting their intense desire for one another. Together with their team, this duo exposes internet porn, additional grisly murders, sordid drug runs, embezzlement, political corruption - talk about nests of vipers...Dan and Mel, of course, eventually take down the scumbag drug and sex lord, but not until they behave, on page after page, like adolescents instead of the seasoned professionals that they are supposed to be. They exchange nasty insults rather than discuss their personal differences. Melanie inexplicably sends an 18 year old (boyfriend of one of the dead girls) on several undercover operations. She remains in an incredibly dangerous, demanding job that prevents her from properly caring for her toddler. Wild hunches and risky moves lead to their ultimate success.There is a crime novel buried somewhere within this overwrought romance, but be prepared to put up with a lot of sleazy, unlikeable characters, in the worlds of the upper and lower classes alike."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"Michelle's second book was even better than the first! I'm not completely finished reading it but the excitement is almost coming to an end. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"The story was good, but a bit far-fetched. However, the further I got into the book, the more difficult it was to actually finish it (which I eventually did). The problem was that as the story progressed it became more and more like a trashy romance novel, making it difficult to enjoy the story itself.Unless the author can get away from her emphasis on the childish behavior of the heroine, I doubt I would ever pick up another of her books."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"Both beautiful and tough, federal prosecutor Melanie Vargas grew up in Manhattan.

Nothing is contrived and everything is well researched. A finely written mystery."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"A funny thing happened to me on the way to the bookshelf. Michele Martinez, in the short space of two novels, has become one of my favorite thriller writers, and her protagonist, federal prosecutor Melanie Vargas, one of my favorite characters. This was not entirely unexpected; Martinez's first novel, MOST WANTED, was an extremely impressive debut by any standard. She fulfills and surpasses the promise of that work with THE FINISHING SCHOOL, her sophomore effort.I had a very minor quibble with MOST WANTED; federal prosecutors, for the most part, don't get as, uh, actively involved in their cases as Vargas seems to be. I of course understand why she does, within the context of a thriller novel. Who, after all, is going to read a book about someone who spends most of their days reading exhibits, turning pages, and trying not to upset stacks of files on their desk? In a book the federal prosecutor is going to be out hitting the street, fighting crime, kicking rear and taking names. It's the type of situation that creates the need for suspension of disbelief.This is the reason that I fell in love with THE FINISHING SCHOOL (and in lust with Vargas). A few pages into the novel, Vargas's supervisor (the wonderfully and terminally oppressive Bernadette DeFelice) admonishes Vargas about getting \\"overly involved\\" in her investigations. Martinez's nod and wink to the foible of the genre is at once endearing and a hint of what is to come. \\"Overly involved\\" indeed. In more ways than one.The finishing school of the title is Miss Holbrooke's School, a sprawling private institute of primary and secondary education for women. In the midst of a school fundraising drive, two teenaged students (one of them a Senator's daughter) are found dead as the result of apparent drug overdoses, and a third is missing. The investigation reveals that one of the students has been leading a tawdry double life, one that has led her into dangerous associations, including contact with New York's underground club scene. At the same time, the paths of the dead girls and their missing classmate lead back to the school and indirectly to the office of the school's headmistress, who has some secrets and an agenda of her own.Meanwhile, Vargas's investigation brings her into contact with some colorful and dangerous characters, and also forces her to renew old acquaintances with Dan O'Reilly, last seen in MOST WANTED. The promising relationship between O'Reilly and Vargas has ended --- or has it? Apparently Vargas didn't feel that she had time for a relationship, given the responsibilities of single motherhood and her job. Martinez, by the way, pays remarkable attention to detail in every facet of THE FINISHING SCHOOL, and her accounts of Vargas's childcare difficulties --- including the wardrobe emergencies that came with them --- are a first-rate touch.There is also a moment --- a very small moment --- near the end of the novel involving a paper clip. It is only a transitory scene, but it is absolutely perfect and ultimately essential in maintaining the illusion of reality that Martinez has created. With only two novels under her belt, she has mastered the ability to render intimate moments softly erotic without sacrificing either passion or elegance. Gentlemen, if you are puzzled by the question of what women like, and want, I would submit that the answer is contained within the pages of THE FINISHING SCHOOL.This is an absorbing work, one that by turns will keep you reading furiously and absorbing carefully. And Vargas, exuding class as she does, is far more than a one-night literary stand. You'll want her back again and again. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"The finishing school was a wonderful read.

She is duty bound to find out the truth of their deaths. This truth-finding takes her to the very heart of danger, but she hardly flinches. She is very brave and tenacious. I liked this book because it didn't have too many characters to keep track of, and the plot twists at the end made sense and were somewhat expected if you payed close attention to clues along the way. Sometimes other authors try too hard at the end for a plot twist, and it just ends up being very confusing. This leaves me anxious for another book in this series."},{"Title":"The Finishing School (Sound Library)","review":"Once again Michele Martinez makes use of her intimate knowledge of combating drug dealers and the intricacies of prosecuting hardened criminals to tell a powerful and compelling story. This novel stars the protagonist of her first book, Federal prosecutor Melanie Vargas, and a cast of characters that includes many from that same novel but also introduces some new players.Melanie's hard-charging and very ambitious boss has saddled her with a difficult assignment: find and prosecute the murderer of two rich young girls, students at a posh and prestigious East Side New York school. They have been found dead in the home of one of the girls' parents - who also happens to be a very influential politician who does not intend to let anything hurt his chances for election. Heroin overdosing is a messy and painful way to die, but there are other complications here as well. A young Latina girl who attends the same prestigious school - on a scholarship - is missing. Has she been kidnapped? Has she run away? Is she the supplier of the drugs?In addition to the deaths of the young girls, a substantial amount of money is being siphoned out of the accounts of \\"Miss Holbrooke's School\\", on the order of millions of dollars. What is the tie to the drug overdose deaths of the the two girls?Of course, complicating all this is Melanie's partner for this assignment. He happens to be Dan O'Reilly, and they are both hurting from the last time they were together, because of the angry and painful way they parted. Difficulties arise because of the intensity of their emotions, making things even harder than they already are.If you have ever watched one of the popular TV series that show law enforcement and prosecution, and wondered what happened between scenes, this is the kind of book you'll love. It explores more than the bare bones of the story, allowing us a peek into not only the procedural aspects of the case, but how the interactions of the characters on both sides of the law affect their thoughts and actions.Get this book and read it.

The story opens with writer, Nigel Adams in his third year of the funk of the millennium. In order to get away from it all, he runs off to a villa in Tuscany, where he depletes the wine cellar while watching it rain every day. Jeez, he's so depressing you find yourself shouting, &quot;Get a life.&quot; Actually, it takes the first third of the book before this begins to take place. The exotic Nicky (Nicholas Rosario di Medici Borja from the Spanish branch of the Borgia family by way of Guam) shows up at the villa one night and it is hate at first sight. With the help of Nonna, Nicky's grandmother, a relationship is sparked between them and they return to San Francisco where the mystery begins.It seems that publishing heiress, Evelyn VanDeventer Iversen, has drowned while on a camping trip with her new, younger and poorer husband, who happens to be a bull-riding cowboy. Suspecting something out of the ordinary Annarita, her daughter and a college classmate of Nicky asks the pair to investigate.Their investigations take them and their budding romance from the hills of San Francisco to Arizona and Utah. Along the way we meet studdly cowboys, truck-driving females and their co-sleuths, Matthew with his unending supply of adult-sized, kiddie-themed robes and pajamas and Thao, whose boxes of doughnuts will have you raiding the cupboard for midnight snacks.Love's Last Chance was a very entertaining read, and I look forward to more Nigel and Nicky mysteries.

And Nicky, now fresh from the shower, is astonishingly patient while gently helping Nigel get on with life. The murder seems incidental--the growing relationship is the thing set against the crime which means that the heroes must fly around the West to solve the puzzle. Ah well, with that kind of money, who needs an advance purchase ticket? They and their friends are a lively community but it is the Nicky and Nigel that are the centrifugal force that keeps it all balanced beautifully. I hope they will be soon off on another adventure.

In this account of a Crocodile artist and his prospective customer, Elephant, Velthuij paints pictures of Crocodile's paintings, as well as illustrating the text. Many of these text-related pictures are drawn with framing borders, thus increasing the \`play within a play\\" feeling. There's also an interesting comment about the enjoyment of art; Velthuij suggests that one's imagination--playing across an empty canvas-creates the best pictures of all. Elephant is initially angry to learn that the creative magic lies within in hi head rather than the \`painted\\" picture, but finally realizes \\"the real beauty of your masterpiece.\\"The book, therefore, is simultaneously pro- and anti-art, if art is defined as a person-made tangible object. It's a little bit confusing, but I doubt that this book's audience is going to get into the philosophical musings that an over-educated adult may contrive.

This is the Hermetic Circle....\\" Sounds rather like Jung's concept of synchronicity, though Jung also speaks of Hermetic links with past and future in these discussions._While both sections cover a remarkable amount of the core meaning of the life work of both men, there is also a personal sense here. You feel like you are meeting them yourself, are also guests in their houses. Not that the ideas are all rehash either- here and there something new pops up. An example would be how in one of the interviews with Jung the discussion turned to how both the ancient Greeks and the Native Americans both thought from their hearts and not their heads. Thinking exclusively from one's head is the result of dissociation between ego and Self- and sets up a tension that may tear a person or culture to pieces. In any case, you feel that you know both men. Of course, Hesse's novels were autobiographical in the deepest sense (and it is reaffirming to know that he actually was an accurate reflection of his characters- it wasn't just a show.) As for Jung, he states outright that he wrote primarily for his own process of individuation and that the fact that so many others read him made him frankly uncomfortable._I was glad to see that my own perceptions of these often misunderstood and misinterpreted men seem to have been accurate from the start. For me too it was like a conversation with old friends- relinking with the Hermetic Circle."},{"Title":"C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse","review":"Serrano was a writer and diplomat who sought out 2 masters as a spiritual/philosophic seeker. Fascinating biography, mixed with Serrano's own fixations.Serrano later fixated on Adolph Hitler, so there certainly seems to be a germanic bent that he followed. ReadBlack Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identityto see the strange path the author took after his encounters with Hesse and Jung."},{"Title":"C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse","review":"I discovered this book during a bleak time in late 2002, and magic and mystery returned to my life as a result. The book inspired me to make the pilgrimage to Chile to visit the author, just as he himself had visited Hesse and Jung decades earlier, and I will always cherish the memory of the afternoon I spent with him in Santiago in March 2005.Unfortunately Serrano has now passed beyond this world, but his spirit lives on, forever part of the Hermetic Circle he writes of in this wonderful book.Frank McShane, who was a friend of Serrano, has rendered it brilliantly into English, but despite its accessibility few will ever read it, partly for reasons Serrano himself mentions on the very first page: \\"Even today, I would go half-way round the world to find a book if I thought it essential to my needs, and I have a feeling of absolute veneration for those few authors who have given me something special. For this reason I can never understand the tepid youth of today who wait for books to be given to them and who neither search nor admire.\\"Today, of course, few even read at all, and especially not writing like this, so saturated in meaning and magic, and filled with synchronicity, from the bee sting that caused Hesse to be at home when Serrano first visited him to the lightning bolt which struck Jung's favourite tree the night of his death.People who believe the universe is a dead machine will laugh at this book...but let them. Serrano already mentions them in a chapter called 'The Dream': \\"They were untroubled by doubt and had no concern for vital essences. [...] The last exponents of a world of flesh and blood had departed and, with their concern for a living earth with gods and demons, were considered by this new generation of anti-men as romantic idealists, the product merely of a decayed bourgeois society...\\"Serrano's book, on the contrary, belongs to that living earth of gods and demons. Just read it and immerse yourself in the magical atmosphere of Bremgarten and the great world of dreams, and the essence of a Legend beyond time or space."},{"Title":"C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse","review":"Steven B. Herrmann, PhD, MFTAuthor of \\"William Everson: The Shaman's Call\\"It has been said by many Jungian's that Jung's attitude was not aesthetic, but with the recent publication of his Red Book, it is clear that he was a skilled artist, a calligrapher and also a poet. The early misunderstanding by Jungians about his basic psychological attitude towards art has much to do with Jung's own judgments towards the products of his active imagination experiences. He did not view them as art. Miguel Serrano was one of the first friends of Jung who saw through his empirical and scientific attitude to the artist underneath. He thought that Jung passed beyond the frontiers of science when he said to Serrano in a reverie: \\"Somewhere there was once a Flower, a Stone, a Crystal, a Queen, a King, a Palace, a Lover and his Beloved, and this was long ago...\\" In this marvelous book, which I loved reading many years ago, Serrano says that Jung spoke these words \\"as though he were in a trance.\\" \\"Nobody understands what I mean,\\" Jung said to his friend, \\"only a poet could begin to understand....\\" (60). Moved by what he had heard, Serrano told Jung: \\"You are a poet\\" (61). After his interview with Jung, Serrano began to wonder if there was a \\"second language\\" in the process of individuation described by Jung that is \\"waiting to be discovered\\" by one of his disciples, an \\"underlying language\\" which \\"is already there as a palimpsest\\" (64). Serrano felt this hidden aspect of Jung's works needed only to be interpreted by \\"a priest, a magician or a poet\\" (64). Serrano captured this latent shamanic meaning in Jung's works, and although he may have mislabeled it as the achievement of a poet, many of Jung's works border on poetry. For this reason I find Serrano's Record of Two Friendships to be a first attempt to arrive at a synthesis between a scientific and aesthetic view of Jung. With the recent publication of the Red Book, the preponderance of evidence that he was indeed an artist and a poet is leading towards a more balanced view that shows how prescient Serrano was. This is a beautiful book, one that will be of interest to anyone interested in Serrano's writing, in Jung, and in poetry and literature."},{"Title":"C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse","review":"I read this book and really enjoyed the intimate details about Miguel's meeting with Hesse and Jung - I have been a Hesse fan most my life. However, I was incredibly shocked and disappointed to learn that Miguel was a Nazi supporter! and supported Hitler throughout the war! Absolutely disgusting and disturbing that someone who could love Herman Hesse, so much, could also be a strong Nazi supporter. I'm at a loss of words. Like me, I'm sure most readers of this book have no idea about Miguel's dark roots. It depresses me to have to write this review.

The reader is a fly on the wall during Serrano's visits to these spiritual giants over the years.

Serrano has helped Jung and Hesse become 'companions' in the background and trajectory of my life. And these are some friends to have! Imagine that..."},{"Title":"C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse","review":"I agree with the other critic Ben. Serrano interjects himself way too much into the story. His ego takes over the story telling. The interviews were excellent reading. This was my first introduction to Hesse so that was helpful."},{"Title":"C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse","review":"While I enjoyed this book, it fell short of the other reviews posted here. I'll preface my review - my readings of Jung are more limited than Hesse. I would rate the Hesse portion 2 stars, and the Jung Section 4 stars.Serrano romanticizes both Hesse and Jung to the point that they are portrayed as spiritual leaders. Serrano reminded me of a wide-eyed traveler who enjoyed idealizing the East, never really becoming entrenched in the culture. Spirituality isn't found by moving to India as much as Serrano alludes. It is possible my cynicism is a result of a recent trip to Asia where I encountered many travelers that reminded me of Serrano's worldly immaturity, although his later fascination with Nazism lends itself to my analysis.I was looking forward to the linkage between these authors and East theology/philosophy, but I think Serrano came up short. Some ideas he purports came from Jung or Hesse were around long before either author was born, and I do not think either author would say otherwise.Serrano fixates, at times, on himself a bit too much. Maybe some readers find Serrano interesting, but I was reading the book for insight into Hesse and Jung.Serrano wrote about Hesse as if Hesse were the Buddha. If you are interested in spiritual guidance I'd search elsewhere. Personally I think Hesse led a life of greater inner turmoil than Serrano lets on in this piece. I can appreciate the other reviewer's comment about people misunderstanding Hesse, however I found reading Hesse's \\"Wandering\\" more fruitful than this work.I did enjoy the Jung section. Serrano focuses less on himself in the Jung section and has more detailed accounts of interactions which I found fascinating. However, my readings of Jung are somewhat limited so the section may not actually offer much insight compared to other works.I'd recommend reading the book for the Jung section, but maybe get this book from the library rather than buying it."},{"Title":"Cruel Habitations","review":"For reasons I cannot figure out, if there are any, Kate Charles seems neglected in this country. Her books seem made for those who like classic English mysteries with a darker side to them (although not as dark as Elizabeth George, for example). Her characters are fascinating people with multifaceted personalities: they give the feeling that they have lives outside the mystery itself. To achieve this multilayered effect, Ms Charles has a long lead-in to the mystery in which she introduces her characters and their lives before any real mystery receives their attention.The emotional lives her characters lead seem based in a genuine perceptiveness. The flip side of the &quot;village mystery,&quot; a side that allows the claustrophobic nature of village life to intervene, appears strongly in her books. Ms Charles manages to convey this claustrophobia without adversely affecting the anglophilia which her readers no doubt share. Ms Charles also comes across as a trifle high-church, but again she combines this with a warmth that allows it all to remain appealing.Unlike the classic cozy mystery, Ms Charles' books are emotionally complex views of English village and church life, and I enjoy them immensely. Her lead characters have a slight tendency to submissiveness, but this contributes to the sense of realism that one can maintain while reading these excellent books. In this book in particular, one can cheer on her lead character as she leaves behind the cult to which her family had belonged."},{"Title":"Cruel Habitations","review":"&quot;Cruel Habitations&quot; is an absolutely absorbing and riveting read. And although this novel is billed as a 'cosy mystery' and the main focus of the book IS the unresolved whereabouts of a young woman, Alison Barnett, this novel does nonetheless center more on the emotional lives of the residents of the cathedral city of Westmead, and on that of Jacquire Darke, Alison's sister.Jacquie and Alison Barnett have led rather restricted and circumscribed lives as members of a nonconformist sect. However, Jacquie is about to be married, and has privately resolved to have at least one grand fling before she settles into the prefect stay-at-home wife mold that is expected of her. She manages to persuade her parents to allow her and her younger sister, Alison, to go to Greece for a holiday. Once there, Jacquie's fast behaviour makes Alison very uncomfortable. But it is Alison, and not Jacquie that ends up in trouble. Alison falls rather hard for another British holidayer, Mike, and later finds herself pregnant. And when her family finds out of her predicament, Alison is literally thrown out onto the streets to fend for herself. Eleven years pass and no one has heard a word from Alison since that fateful day. With the failure of her marriage, Jacquie has moved back home to live with her parents and to take care of them. And with her father's death, Jacquie discovers that he at least had never relinquished hope that Alison would come back home again, for he has divided everything equally between the two sisters. With her father's asserts frozen, it becomes imperative for Jacquie to find Alison at once. Motivated by both guilt and need, Jacquie embarks on the quest to find her sister. And this soon takes her to the cathedral city of Westmead, to the town in which Alison believed that Mike lived. Will Jacquie find Alison happily married, and with children, or will Westmead prove to be a dead-end?&quot;Cruel Habitations&quot; is rich in atmosphere. Kate Charles does a wonderful job of projecting both the confining and claustrophobic environment of both the Free Baptist Fellowship that the Barnetts belonged to, as well as the enclosed and insular world of the cathedral city of Westmead. But what really captivates in this novel is the relationships that the denizens of Westmead have with each other. True, wondering if Jacquie would uncover more clues that would given her a clearer idea of what really became of Alison, did take up a lot of my attention; however I was also caught up with the marriage woes of Sophie and Chris Lilburn, new residents to Westmead -- Sophie's difficulty at conceiving a child, coupled with her feeling of estrangement and abandonment in Westmead, is taking a toll on the marriage. And then there is the strange and suspicious behaviour of the ex-Head Verger, Leslie Clunch, who gives Sophie the creeps. Why is he so obsessed with her? And then there is the unresolved murder of a young woman who was found strangled in the very street that Chris and Sophie now live in... How all these seemingly disparate threads all come together, is what makes &quot;Cruel Habitations&quot; such riveting reading. Kate Charles's prose style is both restrained and lyrical without being florid, and her manner in which she portrays her characters is crisp and to the point. And although this is a rather lengthy tome, that leap frogs over a decade, and between the towns of Westmead and Sutton Fen, I was surprised at the rate in which the novel unfolded -- continuously, smoothly and quickly.&quot;Cruel Habitations&quot; is a great read, especially if you're looking for something a little more substantial than a mere murder mystery. It is such a shame that Kate Charles's novels aren't being released with more fanfare, and that they are not more easily available. I can only hope someone with the power remedies this situation, and soon."},{"Title":"Cruel Habitations","review":"The mystery plot was riveting enough for me to read straight through the second half until I finished the book two hours before sunrise. And Charles' visual descriptions of people are interesting, better than her descriptions of places. I can somewhat picture the cathedral town of Westmead in my mind but cannot picture the flat East Anglian fen. Perhaps Charles meant it to seem ugly and forgetable to the reader?Charles takes a high-church perspective throughout the novel, to which I am very sympathetic of course. I actually wanted to read it for this reason. However, I was skeptical when the unchurched Sophie would compare a woman's legs to the columns of a Romanesque church or when Jacquie from a nonconformist family would use a high-church term. I also couldn't help feeling a tad sorry for the uniformly bad light in which \\"those\\" fundamentalist nonconformists were portrayed. In addition, ten-year-old Frannie's way of thinking didn't seem much different from those of other adults in the novel.Perhaps it's because I'm a man, but I had great difficulty connecting with the theme of a barren womb. I've \\"seen through the eyes\\" of even crazy people before in other novels. Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the obsession or depression felt by the two barren women here. Luckily, all these emotional issues seemed to be solved or put aside quickly at the end, as in any happy-ending novel that leaves me cautiously content."},{"Title":"Music ho!: A study of music in decline,","review":"What was Constant Lambert thinking? Music, Ho! What? Actually, Lambert was thinking of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, when, at a lavish banquet, everyone yells out, \\"The music, ho!\\" Whereupon enters Madian the Eunuch (no, I could not make this up), who just as quickly makes a wordless exit when Cleopatra remarks, \\"Let it alone; let's to billiards.\\" Mr. Lambert, rightly, will not let it alone, and instead writes a very incisive and witty commentary on modern music. Considering that it was published in 1934, the book's arguments and observations are still startingly relevant today. A warning, though: there are a few observations about race (including one about Jews)that would be considered beyond the pale today. With that caveat, I still highly recommend this sparkling commentary on music which makes clear why Constant Lambert was the model for Anthony Powell's portrait of the modern, witty, intellectual composer, Hugh Moreland, in Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time."},{"Title":"Death in the Tiergarten: Murder and Criminal Justice in the Kaisers Berlin","review":"I found this to be just an extremely interesting and valuable book on a topic that has received relatively little attention in this country. While there has been much speculation on the issue of whether the legal positivism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries facilitated the Nazi co-opting of law, there have been few if any empirical studies in English of how criminal justice operated in Wilhelmine Germany, and Berlin in particular. The focus here is on the culture of the criminal courtroom, and how such influences as interest groups, an aggressive press, juries, the changing role of defense counsel, public opinion, the use of experts, and sociological theories of crime all impacted on the process.The book is very well structured to lead the reader through vauable background before getting to the heart of the analysis. Hence, such topics as the \\"free law movement\\", the German criminal code, the role of the judge, the three stages of a German criminal trial, the power of prosecutors, the quality of defense counsel, and the role of the new mass press are all discussed. One of the most interesting facets of the book (at least to me as a defense counsel) is how tame and even passive the few defense counsel were initially. Professional norms, backed up by the \\"Honor Courts\\" ensured that vigorous criminal defense was foreclosed, although this was to change in the early 20th century. This resulted in a particular disability for defendants, since false confessions were so prominent a feature of proceedings at this point.But, as the author so cogently explains, much was to change in the period immediately prior to Weimar. More use of documents at trial became the norm; police procedures were reformed; mental disability as a defense was developed; expert witnesses began to limit the power of prosecutors, and a more vigorous defense bar emerged. The book examines several trials in detail affording a valuable empirical perspective on the changes infilitrating the criminal trial process.Professor Hett's research is prodigious, and the extensive notes are extremely useful, though most sources are in German. His command of the material is superb, and, when coupled with his well-constructed discussion, this makes for an extremely valuable resource. An absolutely indispenable source for anyone, beginner or advanced student, interested in this fascinating topic."},{"Title":"A Prince for Jenny (Loveswept)","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

In the case of A Prince for Jenny, Webb could have done something great, but instead made the story too perfect from the start and too short (under 300 pages and for the Loveswept line that only fits short stories.)There just wasn't enough of a plot written for it really to matter. Jenny is mentally disabled but is this perfect painter with such loving family and friends. One can believe about the loving people in her life, but her being this prodigy painter for the famous and elite is too fantasy to be true!! And the hero falling for her so quickly is too hard to be believable. The first few pages, Webb shows the hero, Daniel as brooding and being a hard man, spurned by the witchy ex-wife. Then by some feat of a miracle by meeting Jenny, he changes to an overloving and optimistic individual, a 360 to be exact.Everything happened so fast, from the hero falling in love to the courting, to the marriage. Jenny was considered practically perfect except for her mental capacity.Maybe if the story was expanded a bit more, and more realistic, it could have been a gem. Instead the reader rolls their eyes and wishes for the writer to give the audience a little more credit.So close to giving us something worth reading, but not quite yet!KatiebabsDriving Me Crazy (Harlequin Next)"},{"Title":"Voice production in singing and speaking,: Based on scientific principles,","review":"I have a bit of an interest in the actual scientific study of voice production, which is somewhat ironic considering I talk very little (usually) and I'm not much of a singer.

It is obvious that it was during the Jacksonian Era that many of the policies and ideas Thomas Jefferson wrote and spoke about came to fruition and it was accomplished mainly by the efforts of the radical, libertarian wing of the Democratic Party called the \\"Locofocos\\", respectfully.Author Jeffrey Rogers Hummel said it best that: \\"No one other than [Arthur] Schlesigner has better appreciated the genuine radicalism of the Democratic Party's support for laissez faire and hard money policies in opposition to the Whig's conservative defense of government intervention.\\"I think Schlesinger's trying to link Jackson and his policies with those of the F.D.R. and the New Deal are weak since they are diametrically different (and the reason for the four stars) but his book is a fascinating and enlightening account of the politics of Jacksonian America.I would point out that Schlesigner is off the mark regarding the weakness of Jackson's successor, Martin Van Buren. In case you are interested, Professor Hummel has published an article on Van Buren which can be read for free on the internet.In his essay, Dr. Hummel points out that not only was Martin Van Buren much more radical and doctrinaire than Jackson, he bodly proclaims Martin Van Buren as the greatest American President!Despite the book's flaws, it does not detract from the overall quality of it and the Pulitzer Prize for History Schlesigner won for this account is well earned.If you like to read books along similar lines, I also recommend \\"All On Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery\\" by Henry Mayer which details not only the life of William Lloyd Garrison but the abolitionist movement itself. The abolitionists also contributed greatly to the ideas espoused during the Jacksonian Era/early to mid 19th century for their focus on the hypocrisy of America's 'support' of the institution of slavery."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"What it is: A political history of the US focusing on the 2nd quarter of the 19th century.

It is tough reading, and there are a few somewhat opinionated comparisons between the 1940s and 1830s, but it is outstanding history."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"It appears to me that THE AGE OF JACKSON has been judged a classic for a very simple reason. It still rings true. Schlesinger painstakingly describes what it was that most distinguished the Jacksonians from their political predecessors. Put simply, they were the first politicians to appeal directly to the working people and the small farmers and ask for their votes.What the Jacksonians promised these ordinary folk was economic determination. Sound familiar? Today, we know this as equality of econcomic opportunity. Various means of getting there have been envisioned throughout our History. Times have changed. Yet, the goal remains. Read this book with THE POLITICS OF RICH AND POOR by Kevin Phillips (another classic) and it makes perfect sense.It seems strange to us today that the industrial workers and small farmers of the 1820s and 30s aligned themselves politically with the plantation aristocrats of the Old South. I believe this is just another example of the old adage that \\"politics makes strange bedfellows.\\" You know, our Revolutionary War alliance with King Louis was pretty strange too."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"I was forced to read The Age of Jackson in fulfillment of credit in AP History.

For years, however, historians attacked Schlesinger's central argument that politics and society in Jackson's era were torn by class divisions. After a few generations of scholars advancing arguments to tear down Schlesinger, the profession may be turning back to his old class ideas (see Chants Democratic by Sean Wilentz, for example).

It provides many valuable insights into the period. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"This book is not a biography of President Andrew Jackson. It is instead a discussion of the developing soul of the United States and the meaning of freedom, and the ongoing unfolding of democracy as we know it.At the inception of the United States, as the \\"Founding Fathers\\" developed the ideas expresed in the Constitution, an unresolved issue was what \\"equality\\" would mean. Would it mean equality based on personal status, property, and wealth, resulting in some having greater influence than others? Or would it mean equality based on a leveling between each individual, resulting in all having (at least theoretical) equal influence?An additional element was the existence of a central US bank and the system of money. Would only silver and gold be recognized as \\"money\\" for legal tender, or would banks be allowed to print paper money that would be subject to vagaries of inflation? Those favoring \\"hard money\\" were seen as proponents of the concept of unequal status (those who have the gold make the rules), while others favored the concept of a bank issuing paper money and \\"liquid\\" credit in order to facilitate individuals who may not have access to gold and silver, so they could buy and do business.Andrew Jackson saw the existence of the bank as a destabilizing influence that was exceeding its charter from the government, and claiming that once created it was beyond and not subject to the government, thus setting up a \\"rival power\\" with the US government. It was for this reason that Jackson de-chartered the bank, much to the consternation of the business interests who relied on the fluid funds and the \\"common man\\" who needed access to easily-transportable paper money.The conflict over the concept of equality of property vs. equality of individuals (common laborers) continued to unfold through the 1800's, as trade unions and groups of laborers attempted to unite to improve their working conditions. Was a trade union to be seen as a group of individuals exercising their individual right to require a certain wage for their work, or was a trade union an illegal \\"association\\" that prevented transactions between individuals? This conflict energized much of the early 1800's, as sides on the bank issue reflected one's orientation with \\"capital\\" or \\"labor.\\"Later, the conflict took on new forms, in disputes over tariffs (benefitting the merchants and/or the laborer, depending on whether you were a buyer or a seller), and also the issue of slavery, which was the surface of a bigger conflict between northern industry and southern plantation labor. (Again, capital and property vs. labor).These complicated elements thread through the politics and presidencies of the first half of the 19th century, leading up to the Civil War, with continuing meaning for the Rooseveltian \\"New Deal\\" period in which the author wrote, to the present day. Throughout, as ideas evolve and parties develop on these issues, the political parties themselves slowly transform their ideologies and platforms, as parties that champion new ideas slowly gain influence, then become in their turn the stagnant \\"establishment\\" that is supplanted by the other. The ongoing conflict between \\"capital\\" (business interests) and \\"labor\\" (the common person) unfolds to the present day, with continuing implications for what it means to be \\"free\\" and to be \\"equal\\" in America.The author's thesis is that these struggles underwent a significant period of transformation and development in the \\"Age of Jackson\\" and beyond, leading up to the currents causing the Civil War, and that they continue to the present day.Initially I found this book hard reading due to its cumbersome style of writing (thus four stars instead of five). It is a bit of \\"work\\" to read it through with understanding. But once I got further along, it become quite fascinating, with much fruitful content for reflection. Anyone interested in politics, American civic affairs, the labor movement, economy, slavery, Civil War, social rights, etc. would do well to make this a part of their foundation of understanding in such topics.I found this excerpt (p. 335-336) to be a thought-provoking passage, with implications for today's neo-conservatives:\\"As long as individual responsibility existed in the economic system, as long as a single code more or less governed business and personal life, the Jeffersonians were right, and that government was best which governed least. But these were the moral characteristics of a society of small freeholds, as Jefferson well understood. When the economy became too complex to admit of much personal responsibility, when ownership became attenuated and liability limited and diffused, when impersonality began to dominate the system and produce irresponsibility, when, in short, economic life began to throw off the control of personal scruple, then government had to extend its function in order to preserve the ties which hold society together. The history of government intervention is thus a history of the growing ineffectiveness of private conscience as a means of social control.

Along the way he was also a top \`braintruster' for the Kennedy New Frontier and stalwart intellectual defender of the traditions of Franklin Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" long after that had lost its cache in Democratic Party circles. Thus, Schlesinger was a long time political opponent of mine and of all militants who have called for a break from the twin bourgeois parties of capitalism, Democratic or Republican. Nonetheless, his Age of Jackson is an important book to study as an overall guide to understanding the formation of American capitalism, particularly finance capitalism, as it emerged in the 1820's and the rudiments of creation of a politically conscious working class movement. The Age of Jackson may not be the last place to stop, given the immense increase in scholarship concerning this period since Schlesinger's book was written in the 1950's, but it is certainly the place to start. His copious footnotes and source references will aid one in studying the available sources from fifty year ago.The central story line of the Jacksonian period economically, socially and politically was the fight over the establishment, continuation and rechartering of the Bank of the United States which despite its name was a privately owned corporation headed by the notorious Nicholas Biddle. In short the story was, as almost always under capitalism, about the money. Hard money, paper money, metallic money, federal money, state money, no money. It is all there. As confusing and, frankly, somewhat trivial as the issues may seem to the 21st century mind the various fights determined the path of capitalist formation for the rest of the 19th century. One does not have to be a partisan of any particular monetary policy to know that if the Biddle-led forces had won then capital formation in the United States would have taken a very different turn. Thus, the essential Jacksonian victory on the bank question is one that militants today can give a retroactive endorsement.While this book does not go into the slavery question in any great detail or into the cultural and social milieu of the times except tangentially this is why, in a previous review on William Jennings Bryan, I noted that the last time militant leftists could seriously consider supporting a Democratic Party presidential candidate was in the time of Andrew Jackson. Just to list later presidential names and their political programs should make every progressive shutter. I also, however, noted in that review - But damn, that was long ago. The continued dependence political support of the DemocratsBy the likes of Schlesinger and his progeny has politics in this country spinning in circles. It is time, more than time, to move on.Although control of the money was the underlying premise for the political fights of the day they also represented some very different appreciations of what American society should look like. Schlesinger goes to great pains to highlight the various factions within each of the coalescing parties that would come to form the Democratic and Republican two-party system that we are familiar with today. Moreover, these fights had different implications for differing sections of the country. In that regard the names Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun and Henry Clay and their various congressional devotees can generally stand to represent the various sectional interests. One might also note that names that became familiar in the immediate pre-Civil War period, like Abraham Lincoln, James Buchanan, John Bell, Gideon Welles, William Seward, etc. started to receive political notice as secondary figures during this period. One should also note that this was a period of political realignment and that the political situation was fluid enough that with changing political winds the various leading personalities were as likely to change sides as not. Readers should pick up the trail that Schlesinger only alludes to on the importance on the third party Liberty and Free Soil Parties Despite that lapse dealing with the various political manifestations of the period is the strongest part of the professor's book.Of particular importance to those who want to learn about working class history in this country and are baffled by the lack of political class consciousness of today's working class as represented by an independent class party is the story of the rise and fall of the first trade unions and working class parties. Although this is a period of the rise of industrial capitalism in America it is nevertheless still fairly rudimentary and agrarian concerns still dominate the political landscape. This is reflected in the programs, concerns and the organizations that various parts of the working class formed at this time mainly, it appears, among the more skilled workers. One should note that on a political level, although not uniformly, the American working class of the 1830's was more politically class conscious than today's working class. Which pretty well defines our problem today. One should also note the tendency of working class organization to block with other forces, mainly urban Democratic Party Jacksonians. Today such a policy is called the \`popular front' and is the sole strategy of the American labor bureaucracy (the only question seemingly being which bourgeois faction to block with). Militants today, as a matter of principle, are opposed to that strategy. However, back in the 1830's there were issues on which working class organizations could have, and should have, blocked with bourgeois parties. That, unfortunately, would not have saved them from oblivion as it was just too early, the forces were too small and unorganized and too politically immature to break out of the general Jacksonian democratic aura."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"Schlesinger's core premise is that, in Jackson's era, Democratic politicians were great and good, and their opponents were stupid and evil. Amazingly, this fact remained true into the 20th century. Even more amazingly, the sole exception was Lincoln, who was really an abolitionist Democrat, during the infancy of the Republican party, before its capture by Big Business. (Schlesinger omits any discussion of the Democratic party's capture by Big Slavery in decades before the Civil War). As such, this is a heavily propagandistic example of \\"The Whig Interpretation of History.\\"Since the American intelligentsia is already arrayed against them, conservative readers shouldn't waste their time. The only exception would be for a conservative wanting to study techniques his political opponents use to spin history. For that purpose, two stars.For young Democrats unfamiliar with history, who want to revel in some of Team Donkey's past Super Bowl victories, uh, I mean, their party's past political triumphs, sure, pick it up. Two stars for that. But if that applies to you, make sure you get a newer edition. DO NOT buy a used edition with the orange cover. I see from \\"Search Inside\\" that the newer edition keeps the mawkish sentimentality about Jackson's slaves grieving at his funeral, but I can't find in it Schlesinger's approving quote of a racially derogatory pro-Democrat ditty from the 1844 election, \\"The n----r vote/is not surprisin/we's all for Clay/and Freylinghusen.\\" I guess Schlesinger or his editors gave his manuscript the Ministry of Truth treatment to reflect that the Democratic Party has always been an ally of African-Americans."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements. Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook. By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old. This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals. He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook. They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed. Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people. Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson. There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research. Pity he doesn't know what to do with it."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"The author, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., is probably the most overrated historian of his or anyone else's generation. He sees the Jacksonian Era through the eyes of a 20th Century Social Democrat and tries to paint his history of that non-socialistic age accordingly. It is true that Andrew Jackson was a populist who hated northern bankers and &quot;stockjobbers&quot;. But Jackson hated this new economic elite because it had cornered much of the country's economic and political power and not because he believed in mass government redistribution of wealth or a large nanny state, two of Dr. Schlesinger's pet political beliefs.Jackson was more of a states' righter than George Wallace,Strom Thurmond or almost any conservative politician scratching out a career today. States' righter Andrew Jackson put the national treasure in state banks and was famous for vetoing national road appropriations. There is some use for this volume as there is some facts to glean. The greatest value of Mr. Schlesinger's history is that it instructs the discerning reader on the techniques a historian can use to paint history to contort to his own ideological vision. If the history is highly specialized and the historian excellent at public relations, as Dr. Schlesinger was, he can leave naive students of history thinking that Andrew Jackson spawned FDR, JFK and LBJ and that the Age of Jackson was some sort of grand left-wing era.If you want to learn about the era,read Robert Remini and some others who don't have ideological axes to grind."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked up this book off the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"This book is a classic of American History, and is very much a chapter in Schlesinger's broader project of discovering the roots of (then-) modern liberalism through history. This is a book that is best described as a history of ideas, and particularly of the idea of democracy as it expanded in the 1830s and 1840s, embracing universal suffrage and economic as well as political egalitarianism. The book very much reflects the time in which it was written and the debates which it was part of, and, like much history of the period, seeks to refocus discussion of American history away from themes of frontier and nationalialism.There are several things this book is not:This book is not a comprehensive history of the period;it is not even a social or economic history of the period;it is not a biography of Jackson (indeed, Martin Van Buren may well receive more ink than Jackson in this book); andit is not an attempt to write a definitive work; rather, it is a voice in a rather lively debate.Schlesigner's voice in the book is clear and open. His own biases and prejudices are on the surface, not hidden and not given any claims of a \\"disinterested\\" scientific approach. Yet his research and his mustering of support are thorough and meticulous, and he is just as clear in discussing the shortcomings of his analysis (such as in the closing chapters) as in describing the shortcoming of other's analyses.His fundamental argument is that the Jacksonian intellectual tradition was the first American intellectual tradition to clearly recognize a need for economic as well as political egalitarianism, and the first to make good on the fundamental concept that \\"All men (still men in the Jacksonian age) are created equal.\\" He focuses on the entire intellectual movement of Jacksonian Democracy, not exclusively on the General himself, and shows the differing currents of thought and how they interacted to create a policy that fundamentally based itself on addressing a conflict between classes.Schlesinger's project does have difficulty in dealing with reactions to slavery, which cut across class and ideological lines, and he wrestles through this to recognize in the end that a fundamental conflict of the time was the conflict between a sectionally and ideologically motiviated politics, resulting in much \\"crossing of aisles\\" and in radically different alliances in the 50s and 60s than existed in the 30s and 40s. Perhaps, however, it is just as important to examine ideologies that go beyond the Jacksonian economic perspectives and focus on underlying religious and moral views. Schlesigner also wrestles briefly, and less successfully still, with the impact of immigration and the opening of the frontier on the development of American political ideas. In doing so, at the end of the book, however, he is more laying out the areas needing further work than attempting to actually tackle the issues in detail.Some of the many strenghts: Schlesigner provides us with the most coherant discussion before or since of the failure and demise of federalism, gives us the best history before or since on the battles over the 2nd National Bank, and brings out significant parts of the Jacksonian inheritance that had long been underappreciated. He incorporates original material into his work in a way that animates the material, makes it clearly understandable, and provides it context. Perhaps most importantly of all, he contributes a voice to American history that is personal and open, and puts the biases and personal intellectual struggles of the writer on display as part and parcel of his analysis.Since Schlesinger's time, much has changed, but, in the developing debates Jacksonian Democracy is perhaps even more relevant. For example, there is again an alliance between economic and religious conservatives as there was in the Harrison/Van Buren election. Other reviewers have criticized, for example, Schlesigner's finding of common cause with the radical Jacksonians given Schlesinger's prediliction for \\"big government\\" liberalism; yet Schlesinger is very clear and insightful in showing how that the Jacksonian opposition's early view of limited government was inspired by the clear alliance of government and business at the time to the detriment of the common person, and that the view of government involvement developed significantly as the Jacksonians consolidated power and then watched it dissipate. We are once again in an era where the conservative party is increasingly the party of a bigger, more expansive and intrusive government, one which actively promotes policies geared toward conservative causes and business interests, and where liberals are, once again, more often the voice of governmental restraint. Schlesinger's analysis is helpful in tying together the development of differing approaches to government all in a common attempt to serve and respond to egalitarian social concerns. Schlesigner also is careful to call out the discontinuities between Jacksonian Democracy and the New Deal, highlighting in particular the struggles of the Jacksonians with industrialization, immigration and slavery.While this book is highly recommended for all, and, indeed, is among the very best American History works, it is particularly recommended for those seeking intellectual roots for egalitarianism."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"When, as a young man, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. published &quot;The Age of Jackson&quot; he gave us an insightful volume about the founder of the modern Democratic party, and of the critical generation of U.S. History that followed the presidencies of Madison and Monroe, and preceded the woefully incompetent administrations that helped to precipitate the Civil War. From the vantage point of the year 2000, it is easy to criticize the author for failing to take Jackson to task for his vile policy toward native Americans. It is also much harder for intelligent Americans of today to understand the merits of Jackson's opposition to the Bank of the United States. But his opposition to the Bank of the United States was derived from a populist streak that makes liberals cheer, and his position on other major issues justifies the honors bestowed on him by today's Democrats (just as Republicans have &quot;Lincoln Day&quot; dinners to annually honor their party's best President, Democrats have &quot;Jefferson-Jackson Day&quot; dinners to honor their party's two founders).&quot;The Age of Jackson&quot; is probably the second place that all college history students should turn to, as they study pre-Civil War America, second only to getting the raw outline of events from their required textbook. Of course, the Schlesinger book is no longer the final place for the student's research; more recent, albeit less well-written works must be studied as well. Still, historians would be hard-pressed to ignore this classic."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"As has been pointed out by other reviewers, Schlesinger's work is essentially an all-out assault on conservatism in American politics masked as a history of Jacksonian America. Not an attack on the \\"conservative\\" position on this or that topic, mind you. Rather, he argues that there is some sort of innate dark side in America - the conservatives - that has consistently and relentlessly tried to deprive society of freedom and liberty at every turn.Schlesinger twists and bends and stretches American history in his attempt to show how the national saving grace of liberalism has continued in one uninterrupted line from Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln to Wilson and, finally, to FDR, even though the issues, parties and arguments have changed radically. (Had this book been published in the late- rather the mid-twentieth century, I'm sure the author would have demonstrated the role Johnson, Carter and Clinton played in that continuum.)Schlesinger saves his most impressive feat of historical casuistry for explaining how and why the Democratic Party wasn't \\"really\\" the political party of slavery and oppression. By 1848, in Schlesinger's analysis, the two central parties, Democrat and Whig, existed in name only. All the radical (read \\"truly liberal\\") elements of the Jacksonian tradition had joined the Republican Party by 1858 (conveniently allowing them to take credit for the Civil War and destroying American bondage), but were back in the Democratic Party by the time big business usurped the GOP during and after Reconstruction.With such a contemptuous and sarcastic review, you might be wondering \\"so why the 4 stars\\"?Well, it has been said that the field of economics progresses one funeral at a time - and I would argue the same holds true for the study of history. Whatever this book's faults, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. is one of the most influential historians of the twentieth century and this book shaped the minds and ideas of a generation of liberal intellectuals, including senior Democratic statesmen. For anyone interested in learning more about Jacksonian America and understanding one popular, albeit controversial, interpretation of its roots in modern American liberalism, this book is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"In the sixty years since Schlessinger wrote TAOJ, our attitudes towards history have changed. Sparked in part by the civil rights movement, we now realize the importance of Jackson's policies towards the Native Americans. In this sense, as Schlessinger and all other historians before the 1960s fail to note, Jackson was deeply flawed. Still, no one is either all good or all bad. Schlessinger paints a very good and convincing portrait of Jackson's policies towards white Americans. He shows the logic behind Jackson's opposition to the Bank of the United States and support of hard money beautifully."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. THE AGE OF JACKSON was inspired by the author's support of FDR's New Deal, not World War II. Jackson's Democrats are FDR's Democrats, and the anti-Jackson Whigs are the anti-FDR Republicans. Therefore, any theme that did not support Jackson's image as a democrat and enemy of the wealthy was ignored, such as Old Hickory's genocidal policy against Native Americans. However, within his limitations, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. is a brilliant historian, and THE AGE OF JACKSON was well deserving of its Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"I found it very hard to rate this book. In the end, I chose between three and four stars, and went with four. But, at various times, I considered everything from two to five.This book has several serious problems. The most important is the incredible bias of the author. This bias is evident, to some extent, throughout the book, where Schlesinger's very liberal views taint almost everything he discusses. The last section of the book is particularly outrageous. It is, essentially, a very biased, distorted attack on legitimate policy views held by some moderates and conservatives. (By the way, I am not an arch-conservative; I'm a moderate who agrees with Schlesinger on many political and policy issues, but who doesn't think they should warp his account of history so much.)Still, the book is a classic, and not without reason. It's well-written (unlike a lot of history I've been reading lately), lucid, and thoughtful. The story of Jackson and the politics of the first half of the 19th century is fascinating and very important to ones understanding of the development of the U.S. At the time at which this book was written, it advanced significantly our understanding of Jackson and this period -- even if subsequent research and analysis has improved on it. And, it's a good read.So, I recommend this book as long as you go into it knowing its weaknesses and understanding that a lot in it is colored by Schlesinger's own political views."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"Many conservatives love Andrew Jackson and hate Franklin Roosevelt; many liberals love Franklin Roosevelt and hate Andrew Jackson; rare it is will you find a historical scholar with the cojones to point out a truth that most are loathe to admit - that the two men, though separated by a century, represented manifestations of the same basic ideology, and as such should be admired by anyone who adheres to progressive political values.Arthur Schlesinger - a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian (for this and one other book) and a high-ranking employee for Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adlai E. Stevenson, and John F. Kennedy - is supremely well-qualified to render a verdict as to Jackson's legacy. This he does, and in spades, in a book that brilliantly captures the spirit of the Jacksonian Era even while digging deep into the political, economic, social, cultural, religious, and intellectual life of the time. This book is in part a chronicle of the movers and shakers of the Jacksonian movement(Martin Van Buren, John Calhoun, Jackson himself, and countless others), but it is primarily an all-encompassing chronicle of a political movement that has been more or less forgotten today. Anyone who doesn't recommend this book either doesn't know much about American history, or has an ideological agenda that they wish to foist upon you which is impeded by the facts presented in this volume. Ignore their imprecations and read it anyway."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"This book is one of the worst works ever written on Andrew Jackson. My main problem is that the author seems to want to believe that the Democratic Party has basically been around in much the same form as it was during the New Deal. FDR may have been the savior of America in the 1930s, but Andrew Jackson was his prophet. This just is not true (Schlesinger also attempts to establish the kinship between the two in reverse in his three volumes on Roosevelt as well, but not in the same degree as he does here).The only real eternal verities in American History are the ones originally represented by Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson at the establishment of the US. Simplified to their essence these are a belief in a strong federal government (Hamilton) or a weak one (Jefferson), a desire for wide spread equality (Jefferson) or confidence in the rich and well-born (Hamilton). Positions on these matters change throughout the extent of US history. There is no continuity between either of the two parties. Schelesinger's primary failing is not to recognize this.Jackson and Roosevelt may have shared a basic vague sense of equality among the populace, but there the similarity ends. Each probably had a radically different view as to what peoples constituted the American nation. Words like &quot;democracy&quot; also changed over time in the 100 years that separate the age of Jackson with that of Roosevelt.The biggest difference Roosevelt's notions of what government should and should not do would have been an anathema to Jackson. Jackson, who came into office determined to thwart John Q. Adams and Henry Clay's ideas of the federal government funding &quot;internal improvements,&quot; would have been appalled by the New Deal. Jackson hated the idea that the federal government was funding roads and canals, the WPA and PWA would have sent a shiver down his spine. Roosevelt and Jackson had to radically differing views as to the role of the federal government. Arguments for any kinship between the two break down when one compares and contrasts their respective goals and visions. Jackson has more in common with Ronald Reagan than he did with FDR.Another shortcoming in this book is its coverage of Jackson and the Indians. Were he to live in our own time, Jackson would be the most appalling racist and a large measure of his prejudice was focused against indians. While a number of other people did share Jackson's views, there were also those who did not and were appalled by the forced removal of indians from their property in Georgia for the discovery of gold there. Jackson did love the people, particularly if they were white and land speculators. Indians were not part of his calculation.While Jackson is an interesting and important president, this is not the first book I would recommend. More useful is Robert Remini's three volumes on Jackson which is better at putting Jackson in the proper context."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"It amazes me that this work continues to garner high praise after all this time, when the work of other scholars (Remini in particular comes to mind) has only undermined nearly every argument that Schlesinger makes. I don't see how anyone can regard his thesis as being the least bit credible these days.Schlesinger commits the cardinal sin of a historian: he enters into his research with a thesis etched in stone (in this case, the belief that the Democratic Party from Jackson to JFK & beyond has had a consistent political philosophy) and then tries to prove it using the historical record, come hell or high water.What we are left with is the absurdity of Andrew Jackson (self-proclaimed enemy of centralized government) being put forth as some sort of proto-New Dealer, while the evil nasty Whigs (how Schlesinger failed to see the similarities of Henry Clay's \\"American System\\" with any number of FDR's programs, I'll never know) are cast in the role of Bob Taft & the gang. I suppose that it makes sense to Schlesinger, since elements of the shattered Whig party went on to form the antebellum Republican Party. However, I imagine that more than a few States' Rights advocates might tend to see an awful lot of similarity between Abe Lincoln & FDR.It doesn't help that Schlesinger frequently slips into the role of advocate rather than being a scholar. The good guys seem to be squaring off against the bad guys far too often. The Whig party is grossly oversimplified and characterized as a solid, coherent bloc. Nothing could be further from the truth, and the lack of cohesion was largely responsible for the Whig party splintering hopelessly beyond repair in the 1850's. One would never get this impression from reading Schlesinger.Reluctantly, I would have to recommend this as being essential reading, only because it has been part of the canon of Antebellum studies for so long. However, I can only hope that it loses influence with every passing year. Read it, but for more accurate studies of the era, also read Remini's works, Michael Holt's \\"Rise & Fall of the American Whig Party,\\" and Freehling's (finally completed, thank fortune) \\"Road to Disunion\\" series."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"Not only is this a classic Progressive interpretation of Jacksonian era politics, it offers great insight into how intellectuals of the forties understood the New Deal and saw it foreshadowed by Jackson and Van Buren.

I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon first.The book provides a great deal of detail about all of the characters in American politics and their views during this period. That's the good part.However, the book has many weaknesses. First, it doesn't provide a good background on the political issues. It assumes that you are already fully knowledgable on the American system, the Missouri compromise, the bank war, etc., etc. Second, Schlesinger is extremely biased by his own left-wing politics and that comes across in his writing of history. It doesn't seem like he is providing a balanced picture. Third, the book is somewhat boring. He is not that talented of a writer.I would not recommend this to the typical reader of history. This would be a good reference book for someone doing very detailed study of this period."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"When Arthur Sclesinger wrote this book about 1939, he wanted to justify American involvement in World War II. He told Jackson's story alright, but from the hidden perspective of his own times. Today, we have many different interests and Schesinger's book is passe. There is much more to the age of Jackson than wars and politics, although from the content of this book you would be hard pressed to see that. Save your money. But Remini's biography or any number of more uptodate accounts of this great age."},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"Andrew Jackson was born to poor Scotch-Irish immigrant mother on March 15, 1767. Jackson's father, after whom he was named, was killed while working on the new homestead. Just after Andrew Jackson Sr. was killed Elizabeth moved in with her sister. \\"Elizabeth took charge of a large household that now included eleven children\\" (5). It was in this large household that Andrew Jackson grew up in. However, his mother, though she ran the household, was largely treated as a guest. Elizabeth was a welcome help as her sister was an invalid.By 1781, during the War for Independence, Jackson's mother passed away. Two years later, he was only 16 years old he learned he had a small fortune waiting for him in inheritance from his grandfather. It was not long that the money was gone and he was in debt. He wondered aimlessly through his young adulthood, bringing shame to his extended family because of his reputation for living fast and being quite the \\"rake\\". Many young ladies' parents believed that \\"he would get himself killed before he was many years older\\" (14). During this time he is described as being \\"entirely callous to the feelings of others\\". This would be an accurate description of Jackson through his entire life.After a time of stumbling about, he finally landed on trying to practice law and was admitted to practice on the 20th of September 1787 in Wadesborough, North Carolina. Barely 3 months later the North Carolina State Legislature decided to send judges and advocates over the Appalachians to help settle the frontier dockets. This was the perfect opportunity in the eager young man's eyes to further himself and to become a true gentleman. Less than a year after gaining permission to practice law he was insulted by a true gentleman lawyer, Waightstill Avery, \\"the prominent attorney who had refused to accept Jackson as an apprentice\\" (16). He felt slighted and challenged the man to his first duel. No doubt Jackson enjoyed the sense of honor the duel gave him as he was later involved in several more duels.This was the birth of Jackson's life as a frontier gentleman. This was the only kind of gentleman that Jackson was capable of becoming, which in some Easterner's eyes was no gentleman at all, but a mockery of landed aristocracy. He was not thriving in the East, but taming the West, and the rules of society were different. He moved through the echelons of society in the growing town of Nashville in middle Tennessee. Marrying into the prominent, but at the moment desperate Donelson family.\\"Jackson entered politics to become a judge; he played politics to become a general\\" (39). He was already involved in politics and had gained a bench. However, it was not long that he pulled the connections he had with Blount, the politician of Tennessee, to become the judge advocate for the militia. And he eventually gained the rank of major general and remained the leader of the Tennessee militia through the War of 1812. It was not until the end of the war that Jackson gained his true fame. He and his men were at New Orleans in January of 1815 and beat the British with a loss of 13 total casualties. 6 dead, 7 wounded. The British sustained around 1600 dead and wounded. Jackson is often not given the full credit for the victory, but confusion, fog and other things are also handed the laurel. At the time however, the nation began singing the praises of their new hero \\"Old Hickory\\".It was a short jump into the Presidency from there where he served two terms and managed to divide the Democratic-Republican party. He was a man who took things intensely personal. For example, the issue of nullification. The issue was whether or not it was the individual State Legislatures that decided the constitutionality of new laws and if they had the power to void them at their borders. Jackson being essentially a westerner deeply ingrained in a Southern mentality, was a big proponent of state's rights. This seems like it would have been an issue he would have allowed to go through. However, his deep sense of \\"l'estat c'est moi\\" meant that these states were personally attacking him. He would never stand for that and killed the issue.Another example of his taking issues and political maneuvering personally, and his stance on state's rights, was with the Bank. The National Bank of the United States was a sound financial institution of the day. However, men like John C. Calhoun (Jackson's one time Vice President), Henry Clay and Daniel Webster were all big supporters of the Bank. They had committed treason against the person of the President so he would be sure to kill whatever they supported. He was already determined that the Bank was out to kill him. So, Jackson hired and fired a company of men to be the Secretary of the Treasury until he found one to be his lackey. Once the right man was found, Roger B. Tanney, he was able to withdraw all the federal money from the U.S. Bank and put it all into smaller state banks around the country. In doing so he rendered the Bank financially ruined. Calhoun and the men of his company were sure to not ratify as many appointments as they could in Jackson's cabinet as to stall any more of his policies from passing.Curtis aims to portray Jackson as a man searching for vindication. I find Curtis portraying Jackson as a man simply searching. Jackson desires respect and respectability more than anything. During his two terms as the nation's executive he reminds me Orson Wells' famous portrayal of Citizen Kane. Always looking for appreciation, willing to play both sides of an issue for the pleasure of being right or honorable. Too often in Jackson's life, as in Kane's, these things were not two sides of the same coin. Curtis portrays Jackson honestly, and seemingly true to form. Curtis gets lost often in his own analysis and should stick to the facts, allowing them the room to speak for themselves. The best example of this is the \\"psycho-babble\\" covering Jackson's early life. Most readers will be able to see the scars Jackson bore, perhaps unwittingly, through his life when the facts are observed plainly, rather than thru Curtis' lingo.I have come away from reading this book feeling that some questions are not answered. The portrayal of Jackson's relationship to his enemies seems to be missing some details. Also, the voice of Jackson himself is largely missing, except when Curtis wants to point out Jackson's delight in sport or his 18th Century penchant for being over dramatic. At least Curtis shines a mocking limelight on Jackson's \\"dramatis personae\\" only to show how his personality thrashed about to show off. He does this all the while wanting the reader to take into serious consideration how Jackson was deeply affected by the traumatic events in his early life. I found Curtis to be fair in his attempt to understand a complex and difficult man to appreciate. I liked Jackson, though I would not like to know him personally. From a distance I could admire some of his qualities, at close quarters he would loathe me.blc"},{"Title":"The Age of Jackson","review":"I read a lot of books and have been doing a number of reviews and this is one of the only books that I couldn't finish. After beginning to read this book I found that it just bounced all over the place. The book was not focused on anything or anyone in particular especially Andrew Jackson. If the book did focus on one thing in particular then it was details of the types of personalities some of the men around Jackson had, which I am not sure how one could be so familar with that not knowing any of the people personally. Sure you can learn something about personalities from letters but the detail about personality types was too much. Spending too much time on small detail does not make for great reading nor does it help one to see the big picture behind the story. So if what you like in a book is learning about personality types you will love this book.The book also seemed to be written by a some what biased point of view by the author. The title should have been something like Politics in the early 1800's. This book will NOT keep your attention from one page to another.

The protagonist, Billy, is an apparently backward kid. The three worlds of the play are home, school and field. Home is Billy, his brother Jud and his mum where he is neglected and beaten up. School is a boy lost in a muddle of many others each hoping for futures out of this existence. Billy's solace is his pet kestrel, on which he lavishes all the tenderness he has never known. That's why the field where he flies his bird is a world of adventure and of escape. A land without maps or boundaries.The author manages to create an image in the reader's mind that gives him a deep insight into Billy's live and his problems. You feel with the protagonist and also feel sorry for him.That's the reason why I really enjoyed reading this book and if you like rather sad books that make you think even after finishing them I would recommend you to read &quot;Kes&quot;!!!"},{"Title":"Literature (Resource Books for Teachers)","review":"\\"Literature\\" is a great little book for those wishing to start utilising literature in the classroom. The book is arranged into broad sections with a variety of texts and activities that can be done with a class.There would be very little preparation for the tasks themselves, other than photocopying. One would need to provide some supplementary work to go with the activities and texts, which would make them all the more useful.The \\"Starting Points\\" section is mainly shorter texts to get the class started in using literature. The \\"General Approaches\\" section gives ideas that can be used with other texts, though with a sensitivity to the text type and its suitability to the activities. The \\"Developing Ideas\\" section brings a more personalisation to the task, which more input required from the students. The final \\"Over to You\\" section gives ideas on bringing out the language of the text. There is an appendix, as well, so that you can take some ideas and use them with texts of your own choice.Overall, this is a pretty good book.

Her designs and methods (as photographed in the book) produce clothing a little funkier and &quot;ethnic&quot; than much of what I've seen; usually when quilting techniques are adapted to clothing, the results have a kind of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; look to them, in my opinion.Mashuta generally relies on simple geometric shapes and works her art in the folding, piecing and decorative stitching. Many of the clothing designs she has worked up for this book seem to be borrowed from classic Asian styles.Although I like a lot of what's offered in this book, much of it is fairly complex; there are not a lot of smaller projects featured here. Theoretically, a crafter could adapt the techniques to smaller projects, but the novice might have trouble envisioning how to do this.I do like the clothing pictured in the book, but many of the colors have gray or brown undertones and don't really excite the reader like some other more vividly photographed needlework books. While I find myself coming back to this book time and again for ideas (and I will continue to), it's not one of my favorites.

She remarks,As a historian, I felt I could not present Jews for Jesus without providing a historical overview of Jewish believers in Jesus and messianic missions since the time of Christ. The long heritage of reaching out to Jews with the Good News of Jesus began with the apostles themselves. The Jews for Jesus organization can be understood only in the light of this remarkable heritage. I confess that I have not previously included messianic Jews in my subject matter. I have followed the course of earlier historians, who since the days of the apostolic church have been telling the story of the Christian church without giving as much as a sentence to Hebrew Christians. I have been changed by this project, and that omission will not occur again--not in my teaching nor in my ongoing writing of a church history text. The followers of Jesus are one, and to omit any part is a loss to the whole. (p.40)One remarkable account that Ms. Tucker tells in this historical overview is the story of Joseph Rabinowitz (1837 - 1899). This nineteenth century Russian Jew became a follower of Jesus as a result of a spiritual experience he had on the Mount of Olives in 1882. She remarks,&quot;He had gone to Israel (then called Palestine) hoping to establish a Jewish colony, but was disappointed to find conditions unsuitable for settlement at that time. He had brought with him a New Testament, primarily to use as a geographical guide, but it proved to be more than that. Before leaving the country, he spent a solitary time near the Garden of Gethsemene, where he sat down and reflected on the dismal state of the Jewish people.Suddenly a word from the New Testament, a word he had read 15 years before without heeding it, penetrated his heart like a flash of lightning: 'If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed' (John 8:36). From that moment the truth that Jesus is the King, the Messiah, who alone can save Israel, gained power over his soul. Deeply moved, he immediately returned to his lodging, seized the New Testament and while reading John's Gospel, was struck by these words: 'Without me ye can do nothing' (John 15:5). In that way, by the providence of Almighty God, it came about that he was enlightened by the light of the Gospel. 'Yeshua Achinu' (Jesus our brother) was from then on his watch word--the message he took back to Russia.&quot; (p.72)Ms. Tucker notes that upon his return to Russia Mr. Rabinowitz founded a movement called the 'Israelites of the New Covenant' and used many Jewish traditions that were absent from Christian churches. He frequently taught in parables the most famous of which was the parable of the Lost Wheel:&quot;Two foolish people were traveling in a four-wheeled wagon. Noticing that the wagon moved heavily, they examined it, and found that a wheel was missing. One of the foolish people sprang out, and ran forward along the road, saying to every one he met, 'We have lost a wheel. Have you seen one? At last a wise man said to him, 'You are looking in the wrong direction! You should seek your wheel behind the wagon, not in front of it.'This is the mistake which the Jews have been making all these centuries. They have been looking forward instead of backward. It may be said that the four wheels of Hebrew history are Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus. The Jews have been looking into the future when they should have been looking into the past. This is why they have not found their fourth wheel.But God be thanked that the sons of the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31; Hebrews 8:8) have found Jesus, that most important wheel of all. Abraham, Moses, and David are, after all, only types and forerunners of Jesus. Thank God, we have found our brother Jesus, our all in all, who is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption (1 Corinthians 1:30); in whom alone we have found light and life, liberty and love, both for the great present and for the still greater hereafter. And now we look with longing eyes and joyful hearts towards the brightness of His appearing&quot; (p. 73)In addition to the historical overview of Jewish missions presented in Ms. Tucker's &quot;Not Ashamed: The Story of Jews for Jesus&quot;, I also refer readers to Ruth Rosen's &quot;Testimonies of Jews Who Believe in Jesus&quot;, a very inspirational collection of contemporary autobiographies of Jews, from various walks of life, and their accounts of how they became followers of Jesus."},{"Title":"Not Ashamed: The Story of Jews for Jesus","review":"JFJ paid Ms Tucker...to write this book - it is not history, but rather tells their story as they paid to have it told.

Being a believer in Jesus is not for everyone, even if the L-rd intended it to be so! Some will fall away, some will be overcome by the cares of modern life, some will succumb to &quot;anti-missionary&quot; arguments.That is the privilege of each and every person on planet Earth. We each, we all, have to make our own decisions. But the mark of the truly mature, I would submit, is that those who dissent are happy to let others make their own choice, without disparaging or dissing those who choose differently.Ruth Tucker's masterful examination of the issues surrounding Jewish belief in Jesus will inform, educate and challenge every reader.

The fact that the author condones Moishe Rosen's slapping his missionaries in the face with the expectation that they wouldn't flinch to show that they were ready to be his slaves is disgusting. She also says that he paid 1.4 million dollars in CASH to buy a brownstone in NY, while his missionaries work 14 hours a day is just another example of how abusive this cult is. They do absolutely nothing to help the poor or anyone for that matter. Moishe started this cult to enslave people to make money for him to live the life of a rich man. The group's \\"worker's covenant\\" requires the workers to get permission to date people (see ex jews for jesus website for full text).The author calls herself a historian, and she is living proof of how PEOPLE write history and that they often change things to suit their own beliefs. She is not a credible source of the true nature of this disgusting group. They brainwash people and work them to the bone so they are too tired to question. As the author says, married couples are separated for months on end (so much for family values), and though they are told to report any money they are given from family over $500 (see worker's covenant) Moishe Rosen lives quite well. If you go to his website, you'll see that he is so fat that he can't even walk anymore. He has eaten himself into diabetes and a motorscooter type wheel chair. Guess jesus didn't hear his prayers for help with controlling his appetite.Read the book but read between the lines. If you know anyone caught up in this group, you'll see clearly why they have to abandon contact with family and friends who don't agree with their nutcase views.

I'm a Gentile believer who has been involved with the Messianic Jewish/Jewish-Christian community for the last 7 years. In the summer of '97, I was an intern for Moishe Rosen, their founder. I also got to know several of the staff members well, especially their executives and heads of their different branches.This book is really accurate. Many of the stories I have heard before. The story of Jews for Jesus is primarily about proclaiming the gospel. For all the flaws of this organization (or any organization) or the people in Jews for Jesus, people are missing the point. This group of people are incredibly committed to proclaiming the gospel. From being around them, I can tell you it is downright infectious. This is what the book, and their story, is all about. They are incredibly serious about Jesus and His gospel. Hardworking, but fun-loving.Having worked under Moishe Rosen closely for about two months, I would like to say that this book is inadequate. He is an incredible personality, which cannot come accross in a book. Being discipled by him is an amazing experience, and I feel blessed by it. His concern for people is genuine, and I believe it shows in this book. But I did want to point out that this book cannot capture him fully for the reader.This book does not gloss over problems, but it does not gloss over the wonderful things as well. The author's background in investigating other Christian and cultic groups served her well here, esp. because of all the &quot;cult&quot; allegations against the group. She helps to give a well-balanced, historical perspective.Lastly, she also does not fully capture the friendliness of the people I met and worked with.

Make no mistake - Christianity is not related in any true sense to the revelation at Sinai. Its only links with the Torah given to Israel are grafts which came to be used as material for a poetic mystery cult. &#65533;Christ&#65533; is a Dionysian figure, a Greco-Roman product, although Christianity was influenced by a small semetic sect found in the Holy Land in the first century of the common era and the mystical aspects of Judaism have been liberally reworked by Christians for two thousand years. Yet Christianity&#65533;s true forebear is not Judaism, and therefore not the G-d of Israel, but rather the pantheism and Egregore of the Orphic mystery tradition of the &#65533;Alexandrian&#65533; Roman Empire. From there, it is a short swim back to Egyptian magico-religious practices. The authority for much of this tradition is still found in the Egyptian stream. In a Jewish sense this could be said to be other than angelic, although those within this stream would strongly disagree. Nonetheless, it is not Torah. G-d&#65533;s relationship with Israel through Torah, stated clearly, is 'olam'- forever, everlasting, for all time. There is no use-by date. When the moshiach comes, may it be speedily in our days, peace will come, return for the Exiles, and a love for the Hebrew G-d in all people. The moshiach will thus fulfil the prophecies and peace will reign, Torah will be adhered to, and no one will ever again bow down to a man in place of G-d, an error which G-d was careful to warn the Israelites against(Devarim 4:9-19) Suffice it to say that in the manner of the Israelites release from Egypt, Liberation is found in Torah and Mitzvah; these are the ways to G-d as revealed to Israel by G-d, again and again; IF one accepts Torah, all other &#65533;ways&#65533; are paths of process hedging towards or away from Torah and Mitzvah, and therefore G-d.Shalom"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This novel has many positives -- a story propelled by a strong command of language, a colorful and very accurate voice of the teenage narrator, as well as a world full of believable and engaging characters. But what makes Luna a must-read by all is its message of tolerance. Don't get me wrong, it is never preachy; it abides by the tried and true notion of great writing: Show, don't tell.This is a book for anyone, and anyone will enjoy it. However, Julie Anne Peters does not shy away from subject matter that is, unfortunately, still taboo in her teen novels. We need novels like this for our young readers especially, so that they may learn the essential lesson of tolerance that an unfortunate majority of adults have yet to learn, and therefore cannot teach.One of the fundamental reasons for books, for art, is to teach, to expand one's mind ... and in this Julie Anne Peters never fails."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"\\"Luna\\" was on a subject that I normally wouldn't read about, but this book was so realistic and well-written that I couldn't put it down.

It was an absolutely wonderful book that I would recommend to everyone ages 14+."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book is simply fantastic, It starts out kind of rocky, and you may find yourself going on and off reading it.

She was my brother!\\"Here is a wonderful book for teens (targeted for 15 and older) who need a healthy introduction to transgender. It is fiction. It is also educational. The story blends a broad spectrum of general problems of teens with the stresses of coming out transgender. Hidden in the story is a pretty complete Transgender 101.The story is written from the perspective of Regan, a female high school sophomore. Her brother Liam, a brilliant senior, can't stand the person he is during the day. His true self, Luna, reveals herself only at night. For years, Liam has transformed himself into the beautiful girl he longs to be with help from his sister's clothes and makeup in the secrecy of their basement bedrooms. Now everything is about to change. Luna is preparing to emerge from her cocoon.Their father is stereotypically macho. He insists Liam play sports, including going out for the school baseball team - which Liam hates. Meanwhile, Mother just goes along. When Liam asked for Barbie dolls and a bra for his ninth birthday, Dad freaked out, while Mom passed it off as a joke.Regan knew better. Liam/Luna has been playing with her Barbies and dressing in her clothes for several years. As they matured into their teens, Regan helped Luna in selecting clothes and applying makeup. Finally, Luna convinces Regan to go shopping with her at a nearby mall.Liam/Luna's history is told through a series of flashbacks, including attempts at self-castration and suicide - both unsuccessful. Regan's story encompasses more than her relationship with her brother, who she claims always felt like her sister. She has a number of girl friends, one of whom really likes Liam.She also has a developing interest in Chris, a student from her chemistry class. Regan is afraid that Chris will not associate with her if he finds out about Luna, which leads to several humorous incidents - and Regan's normal teenage angst."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I think this is Julie Anne Peters' best book to date. A goodinsight is provided into what it means to be trans, withoutbogging down in details. Telling the story from Regan's pointof view makes it easier to explore the major problem withtransition, the reactions of everyone around you, and alsoprovides many subtle ways to look at the social constructionof gender without becoming pedantic. This is a must read foranyone dealing with trans issues. Don't miss Peters' otherYA books, either!"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Julie Ann Peters, author of Keeping You A Secret, ventures out again with a new novel geared toward GLBT teenagers. Readers are introduced to 17 yr old Liam and his younger sister Regan who has to bear the secret that Liam has entrusted her with -- Liam really identifies as a girl inside. This novel, told from the perspective of Liam's younger sister Regan, brings readers into the world of the struggle of a transgender teenager's life and the difficulty to transition from a biological male to a female identity.The book was a very interesting read, however I was slightly disappointed that it was from the sister's perspective. I understand the purpose of sharing things from her perspective, and therefore it becomes a great book for transgender allies (or creating new Trans allies). Transgender teens will identify with the struggles of Liam (or Luna as he chooses for his female name) as s/he deals with being honest with her/himself, her/his family and friends about who he really is. It's great to see a writer taking on a challenging subject that is seldomly (if at all) represented in the YA literature genre. Bravo Julie Ann Peters! Can't wait to read whats next.- (...)"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book shows the strength of a bond between a sister and brother. The way Regan supports her brother is wonderful. I had heard great things about it before I started it, and I wasn't dissapointed."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I really enjoyed the way this book is written. Its informative and pulls you right into the lives of the main characters Regan,and Liam.I would recommened this book to any young person who is questioning their sexuality, or just to anyone who needs to learn to feel empathy for their fellow human-kind."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I just finished Luna, and boy was it good! A real page turner, I just couldn't tear myself away. This book really makes you think more about what it's like to be a transgender, and to understand the concept. When I was reading this book, I often felt as Liam, (or Luna) did and the things and feelings that he had to go through. I strongly recomend this book!"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Regan's brother, Liam, is one person by day and another by night. Literally. During the day, he is Liam but during the night, his inner-self comes out in the form of Luna, a girl. She spends the night in her sister's bed room, trying on wigs and clothes.Regan is the only one who knows about Liam's true identity and she isn't exactly sure how to deal with it. Besides dealing with Liam, she struggles with normal teen problems - boys, grades, and her job.When I picked up this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. For my local book club, we had to read a book about accepting people and another one of the girls suggested this book to me. I have absolutely no problem with the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender issue but I wasn't sure if I could handle reading about it in detail, especially not knowing what to expect. However, since I respect Julie Anne Peters as an author (Far From Xanadu is brilliant), I decided to give it a try. I wasn't let down.This book is great and you should definitely read it as long as transgender doesn't bother you. It doesn't go into too much detail, but explains the struggles of Regan dealing with her older brother whom is truly a girl inside. The characters are believable, the dialogue is great, and the plot is amazing. It's definitely a book you won't want to put down once you start. I read it in less than five hours with a few breaks. Even if you aren't sure you'll like it, give this book a chance!"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This is a compassionate look at a family which includes a transgender (MTF) teenage 'son.' The first person view-point character isn't transgender, but is his supportive sister, for whom the burden of her brother's secret has become almost unbearable. The author has done her research well, and manages to make the story about as upbeat as is possible while remaining true to the difficult reality of the trans teen. Luna is fortunate, as a 'computer genius' she has the resources to make it on her own, without descending into a world of drugs and prostitution if rejected by her family. Strongly felt, sincere, with understanding and compassion even for those characters who can't wrap their mind around the reality of transgender, this is a story that should be read by anyone interested in trans people and their families."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book was a much-needed contribution to anyone interested in transgendered teens. There's not a lot out there! It was riveting and wonderfully drawn. Congratulations to Julie....AWESOME"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"The book follows Regan, whose brother is transgender.The story is unique as it's not often presented in the YA genre. I adored the story but felt a little alienated from Liam (Luna). I think the book would have been better told from her point of view.But I absolutely adore Julie Anne Peters for writing this. It's beautifully told, and a good short read. I'd definately recommend this to anyone curious about the subject."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I picked up this book from the library, and then couldn't stop reading it. I finished this book in one day, then re-read it with my girlfriend. The writing is spectacular, the prose perfect, and the subject really needed to be put out there for young people to read about. The every-day language combined with wonderful imagery left me wanting to read everything from this author that I could get my hands on.Before reading this book I had seen movies about transgendered people (like the movie \\"Boys Don't Cry\\", which anyone who read this book and enjoyed it really must go see), but this let me look deeper at what it feels like. Through a combination of flash backs, observations, and direct statements from Luna I started to realize exactly what it means to be transexual and how much courage and strength it takes every day. This book stretched my mind and heart to the plight of people like Luna who don't ask to be the way they are and struggle constantly to be what they know they are inside."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I just finished reading Luna and thoroughly enjoyed this book. It let me fall right in to the lives of \\"Luna\\" and her sister Regan, mother (a bit) and father (more, but not likeable). I saw this book at a book store and the title and cover caught me eye. After reading the jacket cover I was intrigued. It being a young adult book meant nothing to me. I am 59+ years and it was for us all. This is a subject (transgender in teens) that you don't see covered many places, either for kids or adults. Parents could learn a lot from this book. What to watch out for, and more importantly, what support and help they could give a child going through this. The scene where the two little girls get to . . . well, I won't go into detail and wreck this part, but it was very telling and you could picture exactly this going on and how important it would be right there on the spot for the mother (the father wasn't present at the moment, thank God) to react correctly to the situation and help a child crying out for help with his (her) truth. Great book and will hold it for when my granddaughter and grandson get older and should be learning about this part of human nature, and I do believe it is human nature and not some horrible freak. These things would happen to animals is they could process to this level just as homosexuality and lesbianism (is that the correct word?) do happen in the natural world, even though there are some who would deny this and say it is an abomination against God. Not so my dear reader. Thank you Julie Anne Peters for a great book and I will probably go on to read your others, with such a great introduction to your excellent writing and handling of this type of subject matter. These kids need all the help they can get in this world of ours."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Clearly, it's important that books like this are written, not only so that teens who are transgendered have a voice in young adult literature, but also so that our society as a whole has a chance to better understand gender identity and gender expression.Regan's older brother Liam has always felt as if he was different. Through the years, he's been closer to her female friends than any guy his own age, and he's always been interested in typically \\"feminine\\" toys and clothes. Eventually, Liam begins to transform his outward appearance for certain outings and lives a secret life as Luna, who is a reflection of his true female identity. Regan helps Luna hide this secret from their parents and everyone around them, but as social and family pressures start to build, Regan starts to resent how Liam/Luna's choices are affecting her own.I'd read many glowing reviews of this book, and it was nominated for a number of awards when it came out in 2004. For me, however, this novel wasn't quite the reading experience I was hoping for. Firstly, Luna's story is so interesting that I really wish that the book had been told from her point of view--or even in third person omniscient. Luna's story is the reason I picked up the book, and it became a little frustrating to read everything filtered through her sister Regan's thoughts and emotions. Regan also behaves pretty selfishly and stupidly a number of times throughout the story, and while some of it might be understandable, I really didn't feel deep enough love and support from her for Liam/Luna to make up for it, other than some kneejerk defensive reactions.I might have felt a little more lenient if this had been a middle grade book, as the level of complexity isn't very deep. The story line is so straightforward that I could probably have guessed its outline ahead of time (I could almost picture the checklist of acceptable terminology that had to be covered) and most of the characters do no more or less than what you really expect them to do. I don't feel as if I'm that well-versed in transgenderism, but none of the revelations or behaviors really surprised me all that much (from Luna or from her friends and family), and most of Luna's personality seems to be pretty stereotypical--she seemed so much more of a symbol to me than a real living, breathing, thinking, emotional human being. The way the story is told is also a little jumbled, and the flashbacks are rather awkwardly inserted into the story in no particular order.It's nice to see that this is not one of those melodramatic stories that ends on a tragic note, however. I'm glad that teens can find not only struggles to identify with in books like this and Suicide Notes by Michael Thomas Ford, but that there are also feelings of resolve and hope. Still, I wish that these characters had more emotional depth and that they interacted on a deeper, more meaningful level, rather than just mingling in surface activities (dates, trips to the mall, playing video games) or conversations that center around this topic alone. It would have made for a much richer and much more rewarding reading experience...not to mention a much more realistic one.I've seen many positive reactions to this story, and if other readers find it more insightful than I did or are moved by it more than I am, then I'm happy that that's the case. This book certainly offers the opportunity to open up a dialogue about some important topics, and there's plenty of value in that."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Stirring, sensitive, realistic. Here's a writer who loves kids, loves them as they really are; teenagers in fact, who are not always that easy to love. The dialogs and motivations are authentic, the characters rich and enjoyable even when they really get us down. Her beautiful exploration of a kid working through a decade of gender pain is matched by her portrait of that boy's sister who has always loved him as the girl he really is. Astonishing."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I really loved this book; it made me look at and destroy the prejudice inside me, and put me in a transgender's shoes. Every page brought new horrors and delights, and made the horrible things that people that are so drastically different as Luna go through amazingly real. I'd recommend this book to everyone; it made me think really hard for a comparatively easy read."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Let me start out by saying that my very, very strong feelings about the ending of this book may have a great deal to do with the formatting of the Kindle version. The last 30% of the file is NOT Luna, but previews for four other books. Watching the scroll bar at the bottom, I was pretty sure that when the ending rolled around, it was just a resolution of minor conflict #2 or so, and that the real climax was yet to come. I have no way of knowing how satisfied I would be with the ending if I had known that it was the ending... at the very least, be warned that the actual novel ends at about 69% of the scroll bar.With that said, though, I did enjoy most of this book very much. As someone who grew up basically ignorant of anything other than \\"straight\\" and \\"gay,\\" and was probably very unintentionally rude to the first trans girl she met because of sheer ignorance, I wish this book had been around when I was in high school. Luna's story is one worth hearing, especially perhaps to young people who may just not know how to deal with a similar situation when it arises. I really like the fact that the story is told from Regan's perspective. We don't have to get inside Luna's head specifically to feel her pain, and Regan's pain as the loving sister who wants to help (most of the time) and just doesn't always know how is very real, and very important in today's diverse world.Oddly enough, I felt somewhat sympathetic toward their father as well. It's hard for a parent when their child isn't the child they always hoped for and dreamed of. His actions here are hardly commendable, but they're human, and one of the things I liked the most about this book was the very believable variety of reactions that Luna gets. Not everyone is understanding, not everyone is intolerant. Most people fall somewhere on the spectrum in between.My major gripe here is that it seemed too short, that I felt that I was just getting to know the characters and care about them (I would have liked to see more of the mother especially), and that the ending seemed very abrupt. Obviously, life does not usually tie things up in a clear \\"good over evil\\" kind of victory. We're not going to see everyone suddenly become loving and accepting overnight or anything... but the end felt very unsatisfying. Again, this might just be because of all of those previews and a misleading scroll bar, but I feel like I was pulled out of these characters' lives very abruptly, too soon, with too many loose ends left unexplored.Recommended for the educational value... I might check it out from a library rather than purchase it, though, if I had known how short and disappointing the ending would feel."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I read this book after I came out to my lesbian friend as being a female-to-male transgender myself. My head got buried in the book and it was hard to take it out! I'd stay up late at night reading and study halls were full of this book. I finished it extremely quick and wouldn't mind reading it over and over again.Luna and Regan are both two extremely strong girls. Luna, because she's amazingly strong by not giving up completely and Regan for dealing with her sisters problems and school. I would red this book over and over and over again until it fell apart and then some.Definately a must read for the GLBTQ Supporter or GLBTQ. Or just anyone wondering what its like to be a trans. =D"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Julie Anne Peters has based her writing career by writing books which transmogrify non-mainstream topics into mainstream reading material. Following Keeping You a Secret (nominated for the 2004 ALA Best Book Award), Peters has delivered Luna, which promises not to disappoint.In Luna, Peters introduces readers to what appears to be a normal family through the voice of Regan, a teen who is immersed in normal things; her babysitting job, her homework, and a cute boy. However, the definition of \\"normal\\" is soon challenged, and Peters takes the reader on a romp which asks them to redefine little dwelt-on definitions of societal constraint, while gently promoting tolerance through personal-type narratives.Within the first few pages of the novel we are introduced to Luna, who wakes Regan from sleep to ask how a dress looks. After a page of sibling bickering, Regan tells us, resignedly, that she does care about Luna. I can't help it, she tells us, \\"she was my brother.\\"Between all siblings is a bond, which at the very basis can be defined as a series of child-vs-parent confidences. Siblings don't rat out siblings - and Regan and Luna/Liam are no exception, as Regan's flashbacks explore Liam's emerging, distinctly feminine personality through his formative childhood years.The novel deals primarily with Luna/Liam's journey of expressing a transsexual identity, thinly veiled by Regan's narration. Born into a male body, Liam struggles with the feeling that he should have been born female. The reader travels with Regan as she deals with how daunting it is for Luna to try and transition, as well as with her own feelings of resentment as she keeps Liam's secrets. Though it is evident that she loves him fiercely and supports and recognizes him as Luna; her sister.Luna's story is presented against Regan's own - which occasionally comes across as a little strained. Regan points out one too many times that she feels her life is \\"all about [her] brother,\\" which creates awkward moments in the text. At times, the reader is left to wonder why Regan is unable to step away from her brother, and why Luna appears powerless to do anything without her sister. However, these problems pale in the light of the overall novel.In Luna, Peters walks the fine line between educating an audience at large and speaking to readers who struggle with similar issues. Peters breathes new life into this familiar school and coming-of-age story by changing thematic boundaries, weaving a novel exploring the search for self-identity and tolerance-of-self which all teens experience in growing up."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book is incredible. It is an amazing story and the book ended far too soon. The author uses flashbacks very effectively and you are able to sympathize with both Reagan and Luna/Liam. It's great to see literature for us teens dealing with topics such as transgender teens because it's not something that's ever brought up. I really loved this book and am going to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"LUNA is the first book I've ever read that deals specifically with transgender issues. Although you get a feel for what the book is about by reading the back copy--in effect, that Regan's brother, Liam, is a woman trapped in a man's body--you don't get the full spectrum of what this actually means until you reach the end of chapter one.\\"Rolling over, I muttered, 'You're such a freakshow.' Her hair splayed across my pillow, tickling my face. 'I know,' she murmured in my ear. 'But you love me, don't you?' Her lips grazed my cheek. I swatted her away. As I heard her slog across the floor toward my desk--where she'd unveiled her makeup caddy in all its glory--a sigh of resignation escaped my lips. Yeah, I loved her. I couldn't help it. She was my brother.\\"Liam is the type of boy who, even as a small child, wanted to by the Mommy when he and Regan played house. For his ninth birthday, he asked for a Prom Barbie and a bra. Now, as a senior in high school, Liam is consumed with letting out Luna, the name he's taken for his female self. His dad, of course, is adamant that his son will finally play baseball. His mother, lost in a world of uppers and downers, pretends not to notice when her son offers to fix dinner or do the laundry. And Regan, the only one who knows her brother for who he is--a sister named Luna--is losing sleep and a chance for her own life by hiding the secret.Something has to change, and it finally does when Luna decides to go all the way, to actually become Luna, the woman he knows he is. But what will it mean for his family, especially Regan, who has spent so long loving her brother, protecting his secrets, being a part of his life? It might just be time for Regan to have a childhood of her own, and for Luna to come out of the darkness, out of the shadow of the moon, and into the light.LUNA is an emotional, heartfelt read that deftly deals with the issue of transgenderism in a way that makes it believable and important. I had never really thought of what it must be like for someone who believes they were born with the wrong body, but after reading LUNA, my heart and support goes out to anyone who has ever suffered with this issue. This is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I think \\"Luna\\" is a great book. It shows the reality side instead of everyone just accepting you with no qualms. Luna faced her fears eventually and went after her dream. Whomever we truly are should be celebrated and not looked down on. Luna faced both sides. Anyone LGBT or straight should read this book.

Even if they don't fully understand what's going on. Must read book!"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"The book was a nice simple read, touching on the surface of what it would feel like to have a family member struggling with gender dysphoria. In contrast to what I was hoping for in this book what I did find was refreshing and touching. I would have never thought someone having to hold a big secret like that could really tear at your very being, making your life sort of revolve around the subject. I would recommend this book to a younger reader, but as short of a story as it is the journey that Luna takes on gives hope to some who may have very little to none. The fear of actually living with gender dysphoria in a household that turns a blind eye to it as if to shut it out or make it seems fallible would add tremendous strain on oneself. The writer does not really give way to many emotions throughout the book until the very end which was a bit upsetting. Thanks to you if you found my review helpful before making your purchase."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This is a fantastic novel exploring the transitioning process of a highschooler through the perspective of her sister. Regan struggles tounderstand her brother Liam's need to live his life as Luna. She has lovedhim unconditionally and has been his only support as he has explored hislife as Luna, waking Regan up in the middle of each night to try on newclothes with a different wig and lathering on some make-up.In school, Regan alienates and isolates herself from the other students,not wanting to make strong connections with anyone for fear of having totalk about her brother, Liam. But one day, a new boy asks to be herchemistry lab partner, and strangely he hooks to her mysteriouspersonality. Regan struggles to form a relationship with Chris, pushinghim away for fear of revealing too much about Luna. But soon Regan finds anew sisterly bond with Luna, as Luna helps her prepare for dates andexcitedly wants details after each encounter.The novel has well interlaced flashbacks to Regan and Liam's childhood,focusing on events that have shaped Regan's understanding of Liam andLiam's interaction with others indicating his T-girl (trans-girl)tendencies. Annie, Liam's best friend since kindergarten, is highlightedin these flashbacks, showing a complex relationship between the two,especially as they age and Annie sticks with Liam, wishing he'd change hissexuality (she thought he was gay) and marry her. This naive dream comessmashing down with an ultimately happy ending when Liam finally decides toembrace Luna and live as Luna full time.This is a great novel, and a wonderful introduction to the strugglestrans individuals face when transitioning and embracing their identity.Putting it in the perspective of Regan allows a reader to relate byhighlighting the struggles not just of the individual transitioning, butalso of those closest to them. I highly recommend this quick read."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Book Talk: Regan loves her brother and wants him to be happy, but his secret is keeping her up at night, literally. Although her brother seems like any other boy, he feels like he's a girl. He knows what might happen if his secret is discovered, but constantly hiding who he is takes its toll. His one refuge is sneaking into Regan's room at night to try on dresses and apply make-up. It's the only place he can be himself. But eventually there comes a day when night-time excursions aren't enough. He longs to show the world who he is, but even though Regan loves and accepts him, she's afraid that the rest of the world might not.Rocks my Socks: I really enjoyed the characterization in this story, especially for Regan and Liam/Luna. The characters really have some meat to them and they protagonists are not perfect and they make mistakes and I love that. I also found the issues explored fascinating and am glad that someone wrote a YA book about it. The story was also compelling and I found myself staying up late to finish it in one sitting.Rocks in my Socks: I felt like the focus of the novel was too split. The narrator is Regan and I feel like she's supposed to be the protagonist, but the way the novel is told it feels like the main character is really Liam/Luna. Liam/Luna is the character that has the biggest change from beginning to end and is the center of the story arc. But there is also a fair amount that's just about Regan and parts of Liam/Luna's story that are left untold. The most frustrating part for me was that I really like Regan's story line as well and I felt that the novel ended at the completion of Liam/Luna's story arc and left Regan's unfinished. I suppose part of the point of the story is that Regan's life is focused around Liam/Luna rather than herself but that didn't make it any less frustrating. There were also a lot of flashback scenes peppered throughout the novel that eventually seemed a bit redundant. Since I stayed up late to finish the novel I ended up skimming over the flashback sequences near the end of the novel so that I could get on to find out what was happening in the plot.Every Book its Reader: I'd recommend it to 9th grade and up who enjoy contemporary issues fiction in general or glbtq fiction specifically.For more of my reviews, visit [...]"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book tells about a girl named Reagan who's brother, Liam, is a T-girl or transgender girl.

Sorry but I really feel cheated of story and value when it ends at the 67% location.Happy Reading all, StephenI am developing my own, R_b_S (Read_by_Stephen), rating system;0 - Could not, did not finish the book.1 - Managed to get to the end of the book but only by skimming or skipping sections looking for it to improve.2 - Read all of the book but didn't like it.3 - Read it all and was not completely dissatisfied but will not read a second time and will probably not buy any follow up book.4 - Read the book, didn't like it enough to read again, but would consider buy the \\"next\\" book if one was available.5 - Read the book, probably will not read again but liked it enough would look for the \\"next\\" book if one was available.6 - Read the book and liked it enough it stays on my tablet so it can be read again easily.7 - Read the book, liked it enough the author makes my personal list of authors to check for other books to read.8 - Read the book and enjoyed it enough that I plan on reading it again.9 - It was so good I was up way past my bed time to finish it.10 - Aaarrrgghhhh someone chain the author to their computer so we can get the next book as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Mes not much of a book person. mes had copys buts was lost durings a moves. glad mes coud get a new copys. mes was toweds abouts this book by a friends. mes counds nots puts the books downs mes wub its."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Mostly good but I really wanted more insight from Liam/Luna than from her sister. But overall, a good read for young adults about transgender/gender identity."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I thought it would be a light-hearted book but it turned out to be a serious book about a transgender boy. It tackles many issues such as gender identity, expectations, self-denial, and stereotypes. This would have been fine, but I wish these issues were weaved better into the plot. As it is I felt many situations were contrived, predictable, and preachy. Sometimes I felt like the author was lumping in a bunch of issues in an attempt to make the work profound. I don't like the handling of flashbacks and information dumping either. All the supporting characters seem like cardboard cut-outs. Except when she's dealing with Liam/Luna, I don't empathize with the narrator (Regan) at all. She comes across as some emo-kid wannabe. Full of herself and so sure of her silent suffering. The whole Chris attraction feels so fake-- the forced chemistry with Chris reads like a bad romance novel. The O'Neill family is a total nutcase. Regan and the rest of her family had grated on my nerves so long I just couldn't bring to empathize with them much, except when Liam/Luna comes to play. He/she is the only character I liked to a degree in this book.And another thing, the book was mostly boring. I honestly don't understand why this book has so many glowing reviews beyond the fact that Liam's plight is realistic and that it's LGBT."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I absolutly LOVED this book!!!!! The end though dissapointed me, I wanted to know what happens to regan and liam/luna. I desperatly am waiting for a squel!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I read through Luna, it took me about a month when a very good book can take me a few hours to read. The storyline was good, but everything in the book moved so slow and there was barely any action to it."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This is a story dealing with a topic not often dealt with in YA fiction - transgender teenagers. Regan is fifteen and her life is dominated by her older brother, Liam (Lia Marie, and later Luna, at night). She has drifted apart from friends her own age because of him, and in order to try and help him she has offered to let him use her room at night, to try on girls' clothes. The only thing she has that's *hers* is her babysitting job for a family she sees as perfect and normal, in sharp contrast to her own, with her drugged-up mother and domineering father.Regan is a sympathetic character, a girl who tries so hard to be there for her brother when he needs her, but also someone who resents how she has to be everything for him, his sole confidant, and who alternates between feeling sorry for him and for wishing that he could just be normal. She also has her own dilemma, involving an infatuation with a boy at school. \\"Luna\\" is Regan's story as much as it is Liam's.Liam/Luna's story is dealt with effectively as well, with flashbacks of their childhood showing early signs that he really did want to be in a girl's body. The separation of gender and sexuality is also made quite clear, and the idea of constructed gender roles is also dealt with (though not as much as I'd like to have seen it discussed - but the perfect amount for a YA novel). It is by no means a definitive transgendered-teen story but it shouldn't have to be, either - it's merely the story of one girl in a boy's body, trying to break free.A worthwhile read that will hopefully challenge readers' ideas towards gender and sex while telling a compelling story."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is the first young adult novel written about a transsexual teen. Luna/Liam is a girl that was born in a boy's body. The only one who knows the truth is Regan, Luna/Liam's younger sister. Regan has spent so much of her life protecting and worrying about Liam that she really hasn't developed and identity seperate from that role. She has no friends, and she is a loner and an outcast at her school. And she is frightened and freaked out when Luna begins to go public with her secret. Luna is well-written. The anguish and fear of the characters is palpable and real.This book is so important because it is the first of its kind. I never really knew that much about transgender people before, and although I am a huge supporter of GLBT people, I did not understand transgenders, and I was uncomfortable about the subject. This book showed me that Liam/Luna was just as normal as any other person...they had just been born in the wrong body, and there is nothing freakish or weird about it. On the contrary, it was agonizing to read how desperate and hopeless Liam felt trapped in a body that was so horribly wrong for him. This book is groundbreaking, and needs to be read not just by young adults, but everyone who feels weird about the idea of a transsexual. They do not ask for this pain, they do not want to scare people. They just want what is in their hearts and minds to match their bodies.Much thanks to Julie Ann Peters for tackling a very hard subject and presenting it with heart, dignity, and hope.~Anna M. Nelson, Young Adult Librarian, Seabrook, NH"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is a gem of a book, very unique in character and style. The book outlines the life of a boy who knows he is really a girl in a boy's body. He is a Transgender. And to be even more poignant, the story is told from the perspective of his sister, who is 2 years younger.Julie Anne Peters goes to just the right lengths to accurately describe both the emotional and environmental situations. Some of her most eloquent statements are made with regard to the manner in which Liam/Luna's transmogrification, transition, metamorphosis affects those around him/her as much as it affects him/her and sometimes even more. The one who truly empathizes and suffers the pain almost as much as Liam/Luna is his sister Regan. She is Liam/Luna's confidant, his/her enabler, and his/her instrument to the realization of his dream. Despite all this good, Regan suffers most terribly with the knowledge of her brother's suffering.The writing technique that the author uses is particularly fascinating. She does some most effective flashback sequences that are truly artistic. In addition, she is quite adept at writing the text and the subtext (what is going on in the character's mind and how it differs from what comes out of their mouth) that her paragraphs are like little sparkling emeralds in a field of rock and dirt.In addition, the story moves along well. The reader has no time to get bored or complacent. And the messages departed along the way show all too well, how society makes life very difficult; not just for the normal, but also for the extremes, and not in any rational proportion. Just as life plays itself out; sometimes advantageously, but more of the time, unfairly. As we all know, life is not FAIR, but sometimes we surely wish it were.This book is highly recommended for all people interested in cross gender relations and in the phenomenon of Transexuality. It does a good job explaining the difference between transsexuals and homosexuals. And it does it in a manner that is very intimate and not objectionable. It truly is a mirror on today's society and should be viewed as such."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is the story of transgendered high school senior Liam/Luna, a girl trapped inside a male body, and his younger sister Regan, who has been his only confidante throughout their childhood and teenage years. Author Peters brings in gender issues on a larger scale with a sexist chemistry teacher, pressure from Liam's dad to take on a more masculine role in the world, and deathly gender-neutral parenting performed by the family Regan babysits for. Peters has made an important contribution to the field of YA literature by presenting an inside look at living a lie forced on you by society, as well as how a gender identity crisis affects the members of a typical suburban family. Filled with touching highs and lows, Luna is highly recommended to teen readers and to any reader interested in GLBT issues.If you liked Luna, try Carol Plum-Ucci's What Happened to Lani Garver."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Think Joan of Arcadia, only God dresses up like a girl after dark. Okay, so Luna's not exactly God, but there is much wisdom to be gained from this encounter. Luna is Liam, Regan's older brother, and, well, sister. Or as Regan says, \\"half brother, half sister,\\" which is hilarious when she says it. Because the thing about Luna the novel is that Peters tells the story of Regan and her transgender (TG) brother, Luna with wry, engaging humor that immediately puts the reader at ease with this unusual situation.Luna/Liam's story is told through the eyes of Regan. Luna is about to come out of her cocoon. Because Regan has lived with and loved her brother all her life, she's grown accustomed to his girlish ways. Through flashbacks she realizes that she's always known that even as a kid, Liam was never comfortable in the role of boy. Her sorrow is that she's losing her brother, Liam. Even though she's the younger sister, Regan's life has revolved around keeping his secret. For that reason she also feels a sense of dread about Luna's emerging strength. Her fear for Luna is that she'll be ridiculed or humiliated. As much as Regan wishes for a life of her own, without Luna, she's never done anything to make that happen, revealing her own dependence on her brother as Luna grows stronger. In this way, their lives are remarkably intertwined and the notion of their inevitable separation is heartbreaking, yet compelling.Regan's humorous outbursts and observations -- especially of their parents -- betray her genuine perplexity with the whole situation, while lending a sense of normalcy to the raw emotions swirling through their lives. Understanding Luna -- and therefore any TG - through Regan's eyes becomes an oddly spiritual journey, challenging readers to think beyond outward appearances and stereotypes, to look deep into the soul of another individual and love the person inside enough to let her go.Copyright (c) 2004 by Peggy Tibbetts"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book is an amazing step forward in YA literature. Other reviewers have given you the premise of the plot, I just wanted to add that I thought it was BRILLIANT that it was told from the sister's point of view. Within the largely conservative area I live in, not a lot of people would be interested in this book had it been told from Liam/Luna's point of view. But as it comes from the sister, it's a safe vantage. It's the perfect vehicle for introducing a LOT of people to an issue they might not have understood, nor something they would have wanted to understand. I do think, looking at it analytically, that this book is more useful as an advocacy tool than one of the fictional self-help sorts. At any rate, it's a giant step forward in YA lit for transgender issues. And it's a well told, well written story to boot."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This was a great book. It's written at a young adult reading level, so it's quick - I think it took me an hour to read. It's a book about a girl who has a transsexual brother (in other words, he feels like a female and feels like he was born in the wrong body). His sister is forced to keep it secret and sacrifices a lot for \\"Luna\\". There are parts of the book where I felt as if I were Luna - not that I'm a transsexual, but it really makes you feel the devastation and public humilation that transsexuals go through.Also, I loved the ending."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"What is there to say about Luna? It was a story that definitely needed to be told. And the idea behind the name was wonderful. Luna. Moon. It is a wonderful name for a person who can only be released at night. It represents the girl inside the boy perfectly while still keeping the first letter the same and therefore somehow still keeping the essence of Liam all the while giving her all the spice and inner freedom of Luna. And really, isn't that what everybody needs and longs for? The freedom to be who they were born to be without having to hide in the light of day only to truly emerge at night. This book is a must read for anyone who is struggling with their own gender issues or has self-image/concept issues. Or even if you are just going through some rough times. You will be able to relate to the characters. I promise. When I got done with this book, closing the back cover was like closing the door on a friend who had been with me through everything. I almost felt as though the characters were real. And the thing about it is, even though we don't think about it, they might be. They may not have the same name or even look alike but somewhere out there is a Liam, a Luna, and a Regan. And the weird thing is, you might know them and not even know it."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This is an amazing story. It is a view of a transgender that is informative and helps you to understand and be empathetic towards others. I do agree that the trasgender Luna (Liam) could have used some development, however, that is not a major setback. I definetly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Want to know how to write a young adult novel? Read this book. It is the work of a master author of teen books, at the very peak of her career. Others have written about the landmark nature of the book's transgendered theme (and I agree with all their praise). But an equally exceptional aspect of this book is the fact that the struggle and journey of the main character, who is not transgendered, but who lives in the emotional \\"shadow\\" of her transgendered brother, is just as fascinating as that of the brother. Regan is a prickly, often angry kid--not your usual plucky YA heroine. But the resulting story is one of the truthful, and riveting, teen books I've read in years."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book is simply amazing. It reeled me in from the first chapter where you first learn of Luna's true identity. It is wonderful for me to truthfully be able to say that I read this book in less than 10 hours. I rarely ever put it down, only for dire need of food or water. Even then it hurt to take my eyes away from the pages. This story is such beauty, it is a wonder I didn't re-read the entire book after finishing it.The only thing that upset me at times was the protagonist, Regan, got annoying and whiny at times and sometimes sounded slightly stupid. Even with that, I think this book is amazing and deserves an award of excellence.The thing I found most compelling was how very emotional you felt throughout the entire journey. You really got to know the characters and their feelings and hardships. I admit that I had tears in my eyes during the very emotionally compelling ending because you see how strong sisterhood really is, even if it is between a boy and a girl. I very much enjoyed how Liam/Luna kept revealing her true self to more and more people throughout the book. It was really a great emotional experience for me.If you have eyes, I suggest you go to your local library or bookstore and read this book. You will have no regrets you did."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"holy wow! this book was amazing! get ready for my gushing, because nothing less will do. Luna confronts head on the issues of growing up as a transgender teen, through the eyes of a sibling. with pitch-perfect pacing and writing, this is a book that will stay with me for a very long time.Regan is a girl that is just trying to find herself, but is constantly overwhelmed with her brother Liam's secret identity of Luna, the girl within him. not only does she live in his shadow of his academic brilliance, she also has to hide his secret. every night, he comes to her room and transforms into Luna, the beautiful girl he's always known he was. the beauty of the story is so simple - in their own ways, they both just want to find and become themselves.\\"Who was I? I didn't even know.I knew Luna better than I knew myself. I knew what she wanted - acceptance, love. The same exact thing as me.\\"the writing was clear and concise, with some really great moments of dialogue. at times funny, and others gut-wrenchingly sad, this covered the emotional spectrum for me. and with Regan as our narrator, we were slowly exposed to the issues of growing up transgender, which really made the entire story more palpable than if it had been told from Liam's point of view. the whole thing was just brilliant, really.as a YA book, i was so impressed with Peter's ability to tackle expectations of identity and gender in such an approachable manner. utilizing the expectations of parents and friends, we see the struggle of both Regan and Liam as they find themselves. this book had me so emotionally involved and sympathetic, not just towards Regan and Liam (or Luna), but to everyone involved. and to me, that's a good book!\\"The gender scales didn't extend equidistant in both directions. For example, if you were a girl you could be off-the-scale feminine and that'd be fine, but if you acted or felt just a little too masculine, you were a dyke.Same for guys. Mucho macho, fine. Soft and gentle, fag.\\"i would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. it was excellent."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This is a truly moving novel. There need to be more books on the topic of transgendered teens out there. There are so many young boys and girls out there that need to know they are not alone in this world, and books like these are so very comforting. I have loaned it to many of my friends and the consensus is that it is truly amazing. I have read everything Ms. Peters has ever written and I truly hope she has many more to come, especially on this topic. If you are, know, or are interested in the topic of what it means to be transgendered, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I definitely haven't read any other young adult books on the topic, but it is an important one, and this book illustrates exactly why. Luna is the chosen name of Liam, a transgendered individual, who is trying to find their place in the world. The book is narrated by Liam/Luna's sister, Regan. I was greatly educated about what being transgendered is like to the individual and those around them. Luna illustrates that being transgendered isn't a random, once-in-a-while thing, that it's a constant state of being taking over someone's life. There are two stories going on at the same time, Liam/Luna's, and Regan's. Regan is trying to gain a life of her own, but her sibling needs attention, and as the keeper of his secret, Regan's life revolves around Luna's. In addition, the kids are constantly struggling with their parents, and watching the interactions with their dad was probably one of my favorite parts of the book. I was very confused at the beginning with the difference between transgendered and transsexual, and was glad this was cleared up in the end. I was disappointed by the ending, but then again, I should have seen it coming. Leaving, while incredibly depressing, was the right thing for Luna to do, making for such a bittersweet ending, Luna flying off and Regan getting a life of her own. I really recommend this book if you are interested in transgender issues, or if you, like me, had no idea about them and what they were, and are in need of a little enlightenment.Rating: 4.5/5"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"When I bought the book I had already read numerous glowing reviews of it and quite a lot of people recommended this book to me. The thing I love most about this book, is that you don't have to be a teenager to understand it. But especially if you're a GLBT person, you'll relate better to the main character's feeling of loneliness, depression and wanting to be free. The story starts out slow and the flash back gives enough information of the mom's character and hints of how Luna has always been there. The sister character is almost unreal though, probably because I have never meet anyone with siblings who went as far as Regan's willingness to set her sister free. In the end, I thought that it's a great encouragement story for transgendered kids out there who struggles in their everyday lives to conceal their truth, who wears mask and living in a foreign body, who long for acceptance starting from people close to them and maybe eventually, the world at large. I will definitely tell my straight friends to read this. Never hurts to broaden your horizon by reading a good book."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is a touching story of love and growth. The characters are wonderfully alive and the situations they face all too real. Sometimes comical, and often heartrendingly poignant, Luna is definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Regan is desperate for her own life: a good family, a circle of friends, and perhaps even a boyfriend. She wants to feel like her life is normal, except she has to deal with something that she can't tell anybody about. Her brother, Liam, is transgender. He lives his life day to day in a boy's body, but longs to look like the girl he feels like on the inside. Regan keeps the secret, and allows Liam to transform nightly into Luna, but as she gets older, the secret becomes harder and harder to deal with.This book is told in the point of view of Regan, but I felt her bond with Liam was strong enough to allow us to understand his emotion's as well. I loved the flashbacks that Regan had about her childhood throughout the book. They were strategically placed to allow us a bigger insight in to their lives and struggles.Luna has a unique storyline when dealing with Liam, but most people can relate in some way to the siblings. Regan and Liam aren't that much different from each other, for they both wish to be loved and accepted. I enjoyed this book immensely and felt that Liam's struggles were dealt with in a nice, realistic way. I only wish that we could continue their story and find out what happens to Regan and Liam in the future. Luna is funny, thought-provoking, and emotional.More? www.shootingstarsmag.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is a well written description of growing up transgender. I speaks of the complexities and heartbreaks of living in an intolerant world. I would recommend it to anyone who relates to transgender issues."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"this was a phenomenal story about struggle and rebirth. the story focuses on a transgendered guy through the eyes of his sister. and quite honestly i didn't go to sleep last night as i read it from start to finish.the whole story is about how luna (liam's true self) is trapped within liam, and liam is a construction what the most acceptable way he can exist without revealing his true self turns out to be, which throughout the book we are told is like a shell of a person. regan, the sister, has known from a young age that her brother is really a sister and devotes her entire life to keeping up the facade of liam and dealing with luna's problems. as a result regan doesn't really have an identity. both she and luna are repressed 'liam' liam being society's rejection of transgendered individuals, and 'liam' stifles those who know the truth to the point where the death of the individual wouldn't matter because the spirit, their soul, is already dead, crushed by society's rigid rejection. as depressing as that sounds however, this book is a phoenix rising out of the ashes story. for most of the novel everyone rejects luna, even regan and liam as they are more embarrased and wanting to keep luna underground more than anything else. as the story progresses however, luna decides that she needs to make herself known, she needs to break free, so she hesitantly goes about doing this, at first just recognizing this fact, than taking ever growing steps toward freedom. people accept or reject her as this process takes shape, but the only viewpoints the readers focus in on are luna/ liam's and regans. we never hear the final conclusion the other characters come to, which is appropriate as we can fill in our own selves or those we know into those characters, because this is very much an unfinished story as sexism still exists in a huge way today.for most of the book regan is just used as a lense through which the reader can learn about luna and has no personality or character of her own, but she along with luna, comes to the realization that she has no 'self' because of 'liam' and though she doesn't act on it the way luna does, she gets proddings from the outside world (in the shape of a new guy in school) to bring attention to her own life and not focus everything on luna.i teared up a few times reading this. everyone has an inner self to let out, it's a struggle we all go through, some more so than others."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I enjoyed the vivid portrayals of the four family members -- mother, father, sister and Luna, the male-to-female transgender teenager. Luna is impatient and exercises poor judgment, just as one would expect of a teenage transgender individual. Luna's younger sister is actually the central character, as she finds herself conflicted, caught in the middle and consumed by Luna's needs, all of which is tough on a shy teenager trying to make her own way through school and relationships. The reader pulls for her every step of the way. Although the book's crisis scene is somewhat predictable, it is still entertaining as it impacts the well-characterized family members. There is even a twist or two at the end to make for a very satisfying read and a sense of completeness, even though Luna's life in many ways is just beginning."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This book really gets into the mind of a teen girl with her brother's secret eating her whole and finally setting her free. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"A Wonderful book, disturbingly true to reality, my own at least. Glad to hear its tough in some schools, I'm sure more will pick it up as time goes on and more people become aware."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"This is a worthwhile read about a transgender teenager screaming to come out in the open and the struggle involved. It is told through the eyes of the sister and how her transgender brother's battle affects her life as she just wants to be normal and fit in with her peers. She's torn betweeen supporting and standing by her brother and yet wanting to avoid it all and live her own life. It was a bit depressing in parts, but overall I think it was enlightening and inspirational. It's message is to be who you and true to yourself at whatever the cost."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"LUNA by Julie Anne Peters is a one-of-a-kind book. Very few novels today focus on a transgender teen, and Peters, rather than write from the perspective of one, shows us Luna's struggles through the eyes of her sister. This idea was smart because it gives readers who could not understand reading from the perspective of someone who is transgender the opportunity to gain an understanding from an outside point of view.While the book is well-written and the characters easy to fall in love with, I do have a few complaints. While I commend Peters for taking on a topic not talked about as much as it should be, I feel like Peters does not portray Luna as realistically as she could. If you are going to create a new genre in YA as Peters does with LUNA, I think you owe it to young readers to portray it accurately. I feel like Peters' display of Luna misses the mark. I know many transgender teens, and Luna's character feels like Peters gained her knowledge through Wikipedia rather from life experience.Beyond that, however, the book is still a good read for young readers searching for authentic YA novels. I would not use LUNA as an example of what transgender teens are really like, but it is still a great read and a step forward in YA novels with transgender characters."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"The opening scene perfectly sets the stage for what is an emotionally charged novel. Regan is a compelling and well-developed character. The scene where she escorted Luna to the mall made me cry. There were certain times where I started to skim the flashbacks because they got to be more a lesson in gender than a part of the story line. I would have liked to have seen more real-time scenes with Liam/Luna instead of the snippets of what she used to be like, but I understand why there had to be flashbacks.The LGBT YA genre is very limited in terms of really putting a focus on gender identity and trans issues. Most of the other YA books that feature trans characters treat them as something to be studied. In this book I can really start to gain an understanding of Luna's pain and her determination.Overall though, this is a groundbreaking novel and should be part of any high school reading list. It never will be... but if only I were in charge of curriculum."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is a great read. The characters are well developed and the plot pulls you in very quickly. The family dynamics are dramatic but believable.Luna shows a transgender youth in the beautiful light of an adoring younger sister. Julie Ann Peters does a great job of showing Luna/Liam's struggle with their gender. Luna's pain is deep and palpable but so is her inner strength. You get the feeling, long before the plot tells you one way or the other, that Luna is someone who will rise above her struggles.How Luna's gender identity and crisis shapes her sister's life form the backbone of the book. Regan is kind, compassionate and caring but Luna's needs are greater than she can handle. At times she hates Luna for what Luna's gender issues are doing to both of them, but through it all the love the two share shines through.To grow up transgender is hard,but to have a trans sibling is hard too. This book is a rare gem that shows the pain but also the incredible humanity of the transgender experience. It is well worth reading for anyone, but a must read for anyone who cares about a transgender individual."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"A heartfelt, respectful story about a transgendered boy and his family. Gives readers a lot of background and a way to understand the difference between being gay and being transgendered. As a middle school teacher-librarian, I have known a number of teens over the years who struggle with all kinds of issues. Even though many teens self-censor their true feelings while in public (school), Luna is a reminder of the \\"back-story\\" the \\"unseen\\" faced by these teens-- a struggle those around them are too often not cued into.I especially appreciated the portrayal of the family dynamics and the unintentional damage loved ones can cause when their personal expectations are faced with a differing reality. This story was hard to read at times, the pain is palatable and a couple of times I felt like cringing (sort of like watching an impending train-wreck). As valuable and well told as this story is, the subject matter makes it a book for mature teen readers. I plan on ordering a copy for my library because the opportunity to safely explore the topics of tolerance, gender, self-acceptance and respect for differences is too important to pass up."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"Luna is a gripping and emotional book that tackles some hard topics. It is well-developed and handles these issues thoughtfully. I loved that the book was written from Regan's perspective, because we get to not only see the effects of being transgendered on her brother, but also on her family and her own self. I feel like if it was written from Liam/Luna's point of view, it would not seem as authentic, because I find it terribly hard to believe that an author could accurately capture the emotions of a transgendered individual without experiencing it personally. One complaint that I have was that Regan seemed to let her brother's secret take over her life. Yes, it's a big secret to keep and it's hard to be the only person there for Liam, but she really lost all of her own identity. I didn't find this very realistic, and it made me kind of mad at Regan. Overall, an intriguing read that I think everyone should read in order to educate themselves and find compassion for people who are different. This book really gets you to think and I can greatly appreciate when YA does that. We need more young adults books like this one about transgendered and transsexual teens. We really do."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"A novel that taught me how it feels to be a female trapped in a male's body.Regan has a secret sister, Luna, who only comes out by the light on the moon. Regan tries to live an ordinary teen life, but this secret she carries weighs her down, and she feels as if she can never be normal. But she loves her brother, Liam, too much to cast him aside.Reading Luna, my heart went out to both Regan and Liam, and I truly understood for the first time what it's like to be a transgender: it's hell. Because of their close minded parents, Liam is forced to live a lie. This talented, brilliant young man has closed himself off to the world so much, he's contemplated suicide. Why do we force people into stereotypes? Why can't we accept them for who they truly are?Luna is filled with heartache, but it's also a ray of hope. I would have liked to see more about Regan's budding relationship with her boyfriend, but Luna's story eclipsed all that. The book ends suddenly leaving you with the feeling that everything is up in the air. It's a realistic end, and what would be expected of such a deep and truthful novel."},{"Title":"Luna","review":"I'll be honest--I wasn't planning on reading this book so soon. The subject it deals with--transgender(ism)--I was a bit hesitant about it. But then I was beta-ing this manuscript for a friend (?) that also dealt with a transgender, I thought it'd do good to read a book beforehand to offer some good tips.Not only does this book shed light on the controversial subject, its also an AWESOME story. I was expecting it to be a slow-paced, informative (and somewhat didactic) novel, and boy, was I surprised! The voice of the MC Regan (a girl, btw)--marvelous and so real! Her brother Liam, who is a transgender and has been one for a long time (he transforms into Luna at night, or actually, becomes who he really is) and the relationship between him/her and Regan was often heartbreaking. Regan's selflessness for her brother brought me to tears once, and I totally understood why she wanted to be free of the burdening secret and live for once.Julie Anne Peters' writing was beautiful, and at the same time filled with so much voice and humor...I'm definitely reading all of her works soon. You should read this book even if you aren't curious for an insight into transgenders. It's a beautiful, heart-wrenching story about acceptance, the love between siblings, the love between friends, and growing up. Read. This. Book!"},{"Title":"The Diviners: A Book Length Poem","review":"The Diviners is McDowell's book length poem about a family as it falls apart through five decades. It's a poignant story told in iambic pentameter, and is a prime example of the comeback the narrative poem has been making (as is Dave Mason's \\"The Country I Remember\\"). The first chapter, \\"The Fifties\\", is truly a great piece of work, and appeared in a slightly different form in the Best American Poetry 1989."},{"Title":"Basic College Math a Problem Solving Approach: A Problem Solving Approach","review":"This second edition has been retitled Basic College Math: A Problem Solving Approach from Arithmetic: A Problem Solving Approach based on feedback from instructors from all over the country.

I can finish off one book start to finish with no stopping in under 4hrs. So to say that the book is to short or makes short cuts. Well lets just say there are ideas and things that could happen to drang out the book even more, but has anyone ever noticed a book gets BORING if you drag it out to far. With Christine's books its a matter of person prefrence and understanding of the series to comprehend."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I absolutely loved this anthology. The only thing I could have asked for was more. I hope we get to see more of Joie and Traian. I think the story foreshadows more adventures to come and this one is another brillant addition to the dark series. Christine Feehan builds the characters and their story with a passion for everything that touches your heart and soul. I even found myself in tears at times when you feel the love between the two growing. I've read everyone of her books and this is a wonderful addition to my collection. Can't wait for next book to be published."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I've been waiting and waiting for this book, with stories by Christine Feehan, Susan Grant and Susan Squires. I am VERY happy with the escapes from reality that these three authors have given us...Christine tells a Carpathian story with a bit of a twist...an alpha female! Excellent, excellentSusan Grant's story was different from her usual stories...a furistic world after destruction...wonderfully doneThis was my first read of a Susan Squires story...very well done. I like the idea of the &quot;companions&quot;. will be looking for more from this authorI'd like to see more of these characters and plots in future books...These three women are auto-buys in my house...recommend that you put them to the top of your auto-buy list &lt;G&gt;"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Dark Descent (Christine Feehan)...Traian Trigovise is an ancient. Sent out hundreds of years ago by the prince to hunt the undead, his soul started to blacken years before. Never daring to hope that he'd find his lifemate, he is shocked when he meets Joie Sanders. Soon he realizes that she is not just a figament of his imagination, but flesh and blood. Joie is drawn to the caves where she first saw the man that could heat her blood. Certain that she is going crazy, she sets out to prove to herself that she is not. This short anthology is action packed with battles with vampires that will keep the reader hooked. I felt that this story didn't have the emotion of the others, as it was so short. It isn't a bad addition to the Dark Series, it just seemed like the story didn't develop as the others in the series did. Joie was way too excepting, unbelieveably so.The Star Queen (Susan Grant)...Definetly different. Romjha B'kah is one five raiders that protect the world that many are trying to keep from being destroyed. Living underground to avoid death, no one has seen the light of day in years. It wasn't until he heard an impassioned plea from Taj Sai, that Romjha realized that he wasn't living. He was exsisting in a void. He vowed that night that he would find peace for their world and claim Taj as his own. Taj Sai was now the master bombmaker after her predecessor was killed due to stupidity. The years that followed she grew closer and closer to Romjha, but never realized the extent of his feelings. Together, along with their people, they fought for a world without war, a world where they could enjoy the sun, and their women and children would be safe.Sacrilege (Susan Squires)...Magda Ravel was made into a vampire several hundred years ago. When she was abandoned by the one that made her, she went on a rampage, leaving dead bodies in her wake. It wasn't until Julien came back and saw what he created that Magda realized how much havoc she had created. For one hundred eighty years, she learned to control the Companion in her, and it seemed to be working. She was sent back out into the world, leaving the one person she trusted. Pietr Vladamiroff realized that he had loved Magda for a century, perhaps even longer. When she left he felt that part of him was torn from his body. Suddenly all his training couldn't make his supress his emotions. When his mentor and guide told him that he would remove temptation, Pietr broke his Vow and went after Magda. Together they defeated an evil that was undefeatable. Pietr then proved to Magda that together they would balance each other out. This book was probably my least favorite of the three."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Just an ok book. Feehan's story was her typical Carpthian novel but it wasn't long enough to develop the characters. Star Queen by Susan Grant. I thought was awful and wouldn't ever want to wish on anyone. The third is Sacrilege and it was average at best but at least had an interesting twist on things. Overall, I would save the money and buy secondhand or go to the library."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I was really dissapointed in the &quot;Dark Descent&quot; anthology. This should be a complete Book. It leaves you hanging &amp; wondering what happened to all the characters. What a great read it would be if Ms Feehan would only complete this story. Otherwise I wish I hadn't read it. To become involved in a story &amp; there is no ending is depressing enough but there also is no beginning &amp; a real lack of character development. Everyone I know who has read &quot;Dark Descent&quot; would like to see this story finished &amp; hope Ms Feehan will consider this."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"... I didn't like these stories. Reading the stories in this book is like when you watch a movie, only you've missed the beginning, and you have no idea who the players are and where the story is going. The only thing I can think of, is if you read these authors all the time, then these stories make sense. Otherwise, like me, you find yourself wondering why you bought this book."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"This short story finds us with a cast of memorable characters. Joie Sanders finds herself communicating telepathicly with a man named Traian Trigovise who she found while \\"flying\\" after being shot. Also introduced in this story is Jubal and Gabrielle siblings to Joie. With many twists and turns the plot thickens leading to bigger things to come from Feehan. I can't wait for the next exisode!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I'm a big fan of Christine Feehan's Dark series and looked forward to this latest one, though lamenting the fact it was a short story, wanting more even before opening the book. It was a disappointment. There was very little character development, a disjointed plot that seemed to be more repeats of other plots than a new one, little deep emotion between the hero and heroine. In short, an unsatisfying read. I highly recommend every other book in the series, most especially Dark Prince and Dark Desire. To anyone who read this story first and decided not to continue with the Dark series, don't let it turn you off. Truly the others books are wonderful."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Courtesy of Love RomancesTraian Trigovise is one of the ancient Carpathian hunters, sent out over a thousand years ago by the former Prince. He has dedicated his life to hunting the undead, evil vampires, once Carpathians, who have chosen a life of evil and power. Traian was returning home to see his new Prince when he happened across a pack of vampires working together, incessantly searching for something unknown to him, that can only be incredible power, the only thing strong enough to make these usually solitary creatures join forces. He was severely injured in a battle with them, and was going away to heal when a vision of beauty, unlike anyone he had ever known, comes to him.Joie Sanders is a self-employed bodyguard, selling her protection services to those in need. She is injured on the job, not for the first time, and uses her psychic abilities to astral project out of her body and away from the pain of her wounds plaguing her. While free and floating she ventures far, into the Carpathian Mountains, where she happens upon a beautiful ice cave and sees him.... One she thought but a dream.Both are startled to find each other, Traian especially, when he sees color for the first time in hundreds of years, realizing she is his lifemate, the other half of his soul. As they both heal from their injuries, much time passes while they take advantage if their mind link, though Joie is convinced she is going crazy... hearing that voice in her head. When she is on a caving expedition, they meet in the flesh, him again being severely injured, trapped by the vampires, in a mysterious wizard's cave, where Traian is sure the answers sought by the evil ones can be found. Joie comes to his rescue, with the help of her brother, Jubal, and her sister, Gabrielle.All is still not well though for Joie and Traian. While she adjusts, remarkably well, to being mate to such a wonder of a man - who is very old-fashioned - the vampires are still seeking their elusive answers, which Traian needs to prevent, as he is convinced only something able to grant unsurpassable power would be reason enough for vampires to unite. They are in a race against time... to prevent the vampires from finding their answers, all the while they lean what it is to be lifemates.Ms. Feehan has written yet another gripping tale of passion in the incredible Dark saga. Joie is probably one of the most memorable heroines to date in this series, showing a fierce independence and strength of her own, as do all the heroines, but she just stands out in the memory banks, making her a more then perfect mate for one of the ancients, the strongest of the Carpathian race. Traian is the typical alpha male in most ways, his desire to protect his mate as strong as is normal for his kind, but with an understanding and respect for Joie's need to feel empowered and strong in her independence.Also of note, Ms. Feehan expands her world even more, adding a fantastical element in the form of the wizards' world, complete with magical spells, curses, and dragons. She has added new factors, evidence that her world is far from being complete. As always, one will be captivated from the first paragraph, featuring the vivid battle of Traian vs. the band of evil undead. She holds the reader in her spell all the way through the final climactic scene resolving one storyline, but leaving another wide open, hopefully to be carried into future books in the series.Those skeptics out there who claimed the Dark saga was getting old and stale are in for a surprise as that couldn't be farther from the truth. Ms. Feehan's voice is as fresh as ever, and with all the new elements to the saga being added in this story, the excitement is bound to continue for a long time coming. The only thing wrong with this story was that it was way too short!Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2003.

I'm going to step forward with some important info that a casual reader may not notice about this book:THE ONLY ONE is an anthology of three novella--each a sequel in some way, shape or form. Presumably the idea is that readers of one world will buy the book, read the other novella, and search out the other volumes to the various worlds. An interesting concept--but with one flaw. Unless you read these series, these short novella are NOT going to be as interesting.So--if you enjoy Grant's STAR series, or SQUIRES' Sacrament, or if you collect Feehan's DARK stories--you may want this anthology. If you read all three, it's a definite must-buy, just to see what these authors add to their worlds... if you haven't read anything from any of them... give the anthology a skip and pick up the first book from the world that MOST interests you."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Three dark romance stories unfold within this single novel.First is Dark Descent by Christine Feehan. Joie Sanders was one of the best bodyguards around. Wounded during duty, she ended up in a hospital for treatment. Joie dealt with the pain by imagining herself in the mountains. It was a trick she had often used, never suspecting that she really was traveling outside her body. In those mountains she met Traian. He was wounded as well and lay in a dark cave. Once their minds touched Joie could not escape Traian's voice. He had linked with her, knowing instantly that she was \\"the one\\". He had waited several life times for her.The second is The Star Queen by Susan Grant. Romjha B'kak was leader of an elite group called Raiders. Tai Sai was th group's bombmaker. The group was about to meet some royal outsiders from the stars that would change their lives!The third is Sacrilege by Susan Squires. Magda had been at the Mirso Monastery to overcome her addiction of taking the last drop of blood from her victims. Those within the monastery taught against pleasure and emotions. Love was to be avoided at all costs. Those who failed the teachings were hunted down by the Harrier and executed. When Brother Pietr believed Magda ready, he sent her to San Francisco. She was met by Davinoff and helped to blend in. But Pietr had done the unthinkable. He had fallen in love with Magda. When his mentor, Rubius, found out of Pietr's feelings, he sent the Harrier out to assassinate Magda, though she had done no wrong!**** Paranormal, Science Fiction, and Romance blend together for this collection of novellas. I enjoyed every minute as I read deep into the night. ****"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I am a great fan of Mrs. Feehan Dark Series books. I have just finished Dark Symphony and I enjoyed it very much. I ordered this book \\"The Only One\\" book from Amazon.de and I had to wait so long for this book (I don't know why it took so long to get here). I was really excited when I finally got it last week.But after reading 3/4 through the book, I was ready to chuck it away. Sure, the story of Dark Descent by Christine Feehan was good (though not long enough! what happened to the evil vampire?), and The Star Queen by Susan Grant was also OK - not so exciting and looked like rushed writing, it seemed.But the vampire story by Susan Squires was really a yawn. There were many terminology/events in there that it took me a while to read and grasps the story. I realized it's even more far-fetched and unbelievable than the Carparthians series by Mrs. Feehan. After reading about evil vampires in Mrs. Feehan's books, I can't switched immediately to read about good vampires after that. Hence, it would be advisable in the future not to mix them in one book! It's really a turn-off. That's why I am giving this book a 3-stars.My recommendation is that if you have not bought this book, I would advise you to just either read Mrs. Feehan's story in the bookstore or borrow the book from a friend. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"On rare occasions you find an anthology that produces winning stories from all authors involved. The Only One is one of those rare finds.Susan Squires' Sacrilege took on the awesome task of making Magda's less than lovable character from Sacrament into a heroine that you are cheering for by the end of the story. Course if you had a hero like Pietr working for your love, *sigh* well read Sacrilege and you'll see.Susan Grant has done a prequel to her Star series, showing us where the Star King, Star Prince and upcoming Star Princess received their honor and integrity. Taj inspires Romjha to be the best that he can be while rebuilding their world that has been destroyed. A story that shows how tragedy and a difficult challenge can make us all better people. A love story that is truly inspirational.Christine Feehan continues her Dark Series with Dark Descent. Traian, one of the ancient Carpathians is coming home to meet his Prince before facing the dawn when he runs into a pack of vampires, wounded he has gone to ground. Joie, bodyguard extrordinare, is also wounded, performing an astral projection to escape her pain, floats in to Traian resting place, sees Traian and wow colors and fireworks ensue. The humor and action in this story are not to be missed. Ms. Feehan again extends her world of Carpathians, teasing us with knowledge of the growing threat from Master vampires working to destroy the Carpathian hierarchy. The wait for her next Dark story is going to be sooo long.This anthology was wonderfully well done by all three Authors. The Only One is a definite keeper and an instant classic in this reviewer's opinion."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"In Christine Feehan's Dark Descent I was very disappointed. Being a big fan of her Dark Series I was REALLY looking forward to this. I found the story line too hurried and much more suited to traditional romance of I love you, you love me so let's get married, have children and live happily ever after. The characters were too accepting of EVERYTHING supernatural and this made the story very unbelieveable. A true disappointment in a well loved author. She is much more suited to a longer story line than a cramped short story.Susan Grant's Star Queen was definitely a move in the right direction. I have never read her before but the story was much more believable even though it was more futuristic. I could read more of her work and find enjoyment.Susan Squires' Sacrilege was another book on the move upward. I enjoyed this reading and found it to be very informative and filled with believeable sci-fi action and suspense. The story line was well thought out and although this is a short story, It moved you along at the right pace. There were no short endings or wondering what happens next. She also left room for a sequel and I hope she accomplishes this in a longer story line."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I bought this book specifically for Feehan's contribution, and sadly it just wasn't up to par. I am all for an author refreshing serial stories like Feehan's Dark series, but she has completely abandoned the formula that has successfully worked for 7 books. Dark Prince through Dark Guardian were excellent and well worth the wait. The other two after that, Dark Symphony and Dark Descent, were just plain wierd and silly. This book lacked any sort of premise and it went completely south when it started to introduce numerous characters (who really didn't need to be there) and numerous sub plots (that frankly didn't make sense). I didn't particulary like the hero, and the heroine got on my nerves very quickly. I had to force myself to finish a story that is barely 150 pages long. Someone needs to tell Ms. Feehan that Alpha males are what makes the Carpathian men so yummy. You don't abandon a winning formula half through the game. The sad fact is I have little anticipation for Dark Melody which is Dayan's story because the plot is so outrageous. I only hope that someone gives her a quick check on reality so she can return to writing the stories that readers truly love. Unfortunately, I was so disgusted with Feehan's story that I didn't even bother to read the other two. After the horrible beginning from CF I throw the book in the MAT Pile (Maybe Another Time Pile)."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"VERY!!!! Traian is amazing. Dark Descent is breathtakingly arousing and quite the adrenaline pumper. You begin with action and end wanting more. Ms. Feehan has done a superb job continuing her Dark Series, this is a must have for all Carpathian fans. I'd love to give this more than 5 stars!!!"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I picked this up because I am a fan of Christine Feehan. I had not read anything by the other authors at that time. After reading this, I would definately read more by them and I am totally hooked on the dark series. I would recommend the series to anyone who is hooked on Vampire stories with some romance thrown in. The characters are larger than life and a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"The Only One contains three stories written by Christine Feehan, Susan Grant & Susan Squires.Dark Descent by Christine FeehanTraian is hunting a pack of vampires in the Carpathian mountains when he finds Joie, whom he immediately recognizes as his lifemate. Traian does not have much time to explain things to Joie and relies on her to persuade her brother and sister that they have to trust Traian if they want to escape the caverns that they were exploring. On their way out, they discover an old treasure trove of the wizards who passed away long ago. However, the wizards' spells still work just fine. As Traian battles the vampires, the wizards' spells and Joie's doubts about him, he is one busy man trying to claim his lifemate and keep everyone alive! I bought this book just because Ms. Feehan had written a story in it and I enjoyed the story, but was a little disappointed because it is so short! Still, it was good to read a story about a Carpathian who had some limitations, which made him more vulnerable and human-like. If you have enjoyed the Dark series, you will enjoy Traian's story and I am hoping that Ms. Feehan is using this story as a set up for more interaction with wizarding stuff.The Star Queen by Susan GrantRomjha B'kah is dead inside. Everyone thinks that he just needs time to recover from his wife's death, but Romjha has given up hope for his people who were forced to hide underground to when the imperial raiders came to destroy his planet. But when Taj Sai gives an impassioned speech about how destiny is not a matter of chance, but of choice, Romjha comes alive again. He is determined to rid his planet of the invaders and to win the heart of Taj, but he has great patience and is willing to wait until he is the man that Taj deserves as her mate. This was my first chance to read anything by Susan Grant and I enjoyed it very much. The story was great and had a nice flow and was the perfect length. I found the characters well developed and fascinating and look forward to reading more in Grant's Star series.Sacrilege by Susan SquiresMagda was being forced out into the world after living in the safety of the Mirso Monastery for centuries. It was true that, when she first was left at Mirso, she hated the place, but, as time passed, she found a kind of peace and could use the Nine Precepts to keep her companion, that which made her a vampire, under control. She wanted to stay at Mirso and begged Brother Pietr not to send her back out into the world where she could be tempted to kill humans again, but it was time for her to start living again. Magda felt bereft and alone, clinging to the Nine Precepts, one of which was to feel no emotion, to survive. When the Harrier, the hunter and slayer of her kind, showed up to kill her, Magda had no idea why, but she quickly discovered that it was because Pietr had fallen in love with her. Pietr, her teacher, the one who taught her not to feel, Magda refused to believe it and tries to reject Pietr's love, but the two lovers will need all of the power that they have to defeat the Harrier and have some kind of life together. This was my least favorite of the stories. Although it was well written, I just didn't feel very much for the characters and felt that I was a little out of it because Magda was a character in Sacrament, one of Squires' other books, which I have not read. Still, it was interesting and I liked Pietr's character, too bad that we couldn't have learned a little more about him instead of Magda!"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I had this book laying on my book shelf for quite some time and decided to finally pick it up.

As for the other two stories, I also felt that I missing out on something -Susan Grant's story couldn't hold my attention as the heroine was so annoying -I did not find her to be likeable at all. And as for Susan Squires story, I guess you have to read her other books to appreciate this one.

The concept was fun and a good introduction to her series for a &quot;newbie&quot; like me.The other stories in the book were entertaining but if I had had the choice of picking them up and reading them as singular titles I probably would have not bothered.

These characters were like real people to me. The reason why I did not give this book a 5 is because of Susan Grant's part it was a little slow and you can't get into the characters. I am a big Christine Feehan fan and have all her books just waiting for the next book.I have to think the bookstore attendant for introducing her to me.

Will order again."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I rarely enjoy anthologies yet I continue to buy them, go figure. However, &quot;The Only One&quot; was an enjoyable read &amp; worth the money.Christine Feehan's Dark Descent is the best of her Dark series and deserves an A+. Joie is a great heroine but I can see why some fans won't like her since she's not the usual helpless little girl. Joie is a woman capable of seriously wounding 2 vampires without her hero protecting her.And how great a hero is Traian? I love this guy. Traian really understands Joie and is her perfect mate. He's the typical Dark hero but on prozac. This is the 1st Feehan hero I've read that wanted the heroine happy, not just his. These 2 will have an equal partnership and a great life together. My only complaint is that I wish Dark Decent was a full length novel.Joie is wounded and has an out-of-body experience to escape the pain. While she's out floating around, she meets Traian who's also wounded. After hearing her voice Traian realizes Joie's his life mate. Joie is convinced she's nuts so she sets out to find Traian.Susan Grants' The Star Queen is an ok read. I tried typing a description but I'm too bored by the story to remember the details.Susan Squires' Sacrilege was very good, I'd give it a B+. It's a sequel to Sacrament (which I haven't read) but I don't think it's required to enjoy this story. Ms. Squires has written an different kind of vampire. The heroine, Magda, was the villain in the previous book and the hero, Pietr, has been her jailer/teacher for the past 183 years. Magda has been taught to be a Vulcan (emotions and having any fun at all is extremely bad) so she's being released. But Magda gets the last laugh because she awakens Pietr's emotions and this sends them on the run for their lives from the crazy head Vulcan-wanna-be."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"The Only OneDark Descent by Christine Feehan***Joie Sanders is a bodyguard with telepathic and other inhumane powers. Joie and her siblings Jubal and Gabrielle go cave hunting in there spare time. Traian is an ancient Carpathian male who is severely injured while fighting several master vampires who have teamed up and are looking for something in the caves of the Carpathian Mountains. Joie is hearing voices and thinks she is going insane. She is drawn to a cave and talks her siblings into accompanying her. They find a whole lot more than they were looking for.Traian and Joies' story is a bit rushed and incomplete. Joie is mentioned in Dark Symphony and so is the Carpathians past relationship with wizard's. I recently read Dark Symphony and between the two stories, the unfinished business is piling up. Another thought-all of the \\"human\\" characters in this story too easily accept the existence of vampires, dragons, shapeshifters, etc. Is Ms. Feehan setting us up for a finale? I love this series and am disappointed that the author has begun shortchanging the main characters by overcrowding their story with incomplete subplots.The Star Queen by Susan Grant**Romjha B'kah is a raider commander and Taj Sai is a bombmaker, their homeland was destroyed during the war and their people live in fear inside a huge cave.Well, this anthology is getting worst by the story. I can get over the fact that I can't pronounce the characters name but it was very hard to make it through the first 60 out of 97 pages. The main plot is the destruction and rebuilding of their homeland, the couple don't even seem to have any chemistry and their story has no anticipation buildup. I'm again disappointed because this does not live up to Ms. Grant's norm. Oh just in case you were wondering, Romjha is male and Taj is female. I know Susan Grant can do better (read Contact) and look forward to it.Sacrilege by Susan SquiresI could only read a few pages of this one because: #1 Magda is a not-so-nice character from in Sacrament (not one of my favorites). #2 Based on that story you can only get to Mirso Monastery by horse and buggy. #3 The first 2 of this anthology are disappointing and at this point I have a desire to move on and I hope to come to terms with these things and read this story in the near future."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"When I bought the book I thought...Wow! But as I began to read my excitment turned to disappointment. The first story is a repeat of the second story in Dark Prince, the second story was all over the place and I counldn't get into it, and the third? Yawn!!! I love Christine Feehan's work but I would not have bought this book if Ihad known the contents."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"After reading and collecting the series of Christine Feehan books, I was VERY disappointed in this book that seems like it was put together in a hurry. Its always nice to know the story of each character in the Dark Series, but this story would have been better left unwritten. This is the first, and I hope last, Feehan book I have ever turned in to my local book exchange. The other two stories were not memorable, I have forgotten them already."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Christine Feehan is one of my favorite authors. I have had this book on preorder for months. I read it last night and was very disappointed. Part of the problem in the Feehan story seemed to be the editing. There was one part where Gary was able to communicate telepathically with Traian, but the story never indicated when the two had exchanged blood. The end was also very strange. I turned the page and thought to myself \\"Are you kidding? That's the end of the story??! Nothing has been resolved!\\" I really hope this is just a little bridge to the next full length novel because I was very disappointed when I finished the story.I bought this book for the Feehan story alone, so if you are in the same boat, you will want to read the story just in case it is setting us up for the next book, but be prepared to be left hanging!!!"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"i read this book primarily for christine feehan's dark descent. i was disappointed in the many inconsistencies in the story and the lack of character development, however i was quite intrigued by the plot and its hints of future things to come. i think ms. feehan has somewhat redeemed herself from her more recent dark symphony which i thought was an absolute disaster (every author in entitled to one dud i suppose), but this work could have been much better. in the future, i believe ms. feehan should reconsider submitting works from her dark series as novellas and simply write complete novels which due her and her characters justice. although these two most recent works do not represent her best efforts, i will continue to read her in hopes that her next novel will be as engaging as dark magic and dark fire (my personal favorite)."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Christine hits a winner again. I just love her alpha males and kick butt mates for them. I would have prefered that her stories be written without any other authors, I perfer not to be distracted from Christians world when I am reading her books, so thats why 4 stars instead of five. Keep those vamps coming Christine."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I was very much looking forward to the next book in the Dark Hunter series (Christine Feehan) This was a big disappointment. Where was the character development? I could complain at length about inconsistances but would end up giving away the story. It read like a comic strip. The story seemed full of teasers for future books. The ending was terrible, this was too short to engage the reader (who would have to have read previous books in the series to make any sense of the plot). I felt like that about the other short stories in this anthology. I kept thinking I was missing a big chunk of the story line."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I AM A HUGE CHRISTINE FEEHAN FAN, I HAVE ALL HER BOOKS. I LOOKED FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THE ONLY ONE AND WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. THIS STORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL LENGTH NOVEL. THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON THAT COULD NOT BE FULLY DEVELOPED IN SUCH A SMALL BOOK, THE CHARACTERS GOT CHEATED BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL BUT WERE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED AND THE END JUST LEFT YOU HANGING. I HOPE THIS BOOK IS REWRITTEN FOR A FUTURE RELEASE DATE BECAUSE IT COULD BE GREAT."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"As someone has mentioned in a earlier reivew, I can understand their disappointment. I am a great fan of Christine Feehan and even her story line was not good. There are no words to describe the remaining two stories because there was no plot build up at all. If you are a fan of Christine Feehan, I would recommend any other books than this one."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Christine Feehan does another Carpathian tale - Dark Descent. Triain is another of the hunters sent out so many centuries ago when the fate of the Carpathians was first anticipated by their prince. Traian's lifemate is Joie Sanders who is a bodyguard and security expert. She comes well armed and prepared to defend herself and those she loves. They meet in the Carpathian mountains, which is a nice return, although much of the story is set in an extensive cave system, or in Joie's hotel. Joie is sure she is going crazy, because after an \`astral' meeting on her part, she keeps hearing a voice in her head. Triain is delighted to find his lifemate, although presently taken up with fighting a master vampire. Until Joie comes looking for her delusion, bringing her family too. The trio of humans are great, their relationship very strong and well developed in a short time. Gary (from Dark Magic) reappears here, and I was very glad to continue his byline in the connected tale. A great, if short, addition to the series.The Star Queen by Susan Grant jumps into the formation of the alliance that forms the Galatic Council and the writers of the Treatise of Trade (used so cleverly in \`Star Prince'). I have enjoyed that a number of Grant's sequels (Contact and this story) have been prequels, each going back a step - we have the foreknowledge of our dealings with the ancestors and what they have wrought to add to the enjoyment of the struggle to get there.The premise of Susan Squires \`Sacrilege' is a very interesting one. It treats vampirism and the need for blood in a religious way so that the blood lust can be overcome or at least managed. Magda has been one of the worst, but after over 800 years of tutelage, has emerged without wreaking havoc and drinking human blood for that time. Pietr, one of the Old Ones, was her tutor. She had long known she loves him, but it was only when she was sent out from Mirso Monastery into the world once more that he realises that he loves her too. Self flagellation and a series of essentially tortures follow, but ultimately he follows her into the world, casting aside at least a portion of his vows to go to her. But his own mentor is not best pleased with the defection of one of his brightest stars, and sets a horror on his trail.If you like any of the above authors, you'll enjoy their stories. I did not like them all equally - The Star Queen seemed to have great pieces of the story left out, constrained by it's short length, which was a shame. And Sacrilege did not have enough \`good times' to counterbalance the pain - for example what Pietr went through before making his decision to leave the monastery. But I would have loved for them all to have been book length, and think that especially the last two suffered because of the page constraint. This is not to say I do not recommend the book - each author does her bit well, exhibiting in each case more of the reason why regular readers follow their work."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Sorry..... I'm just not a novella person..Dark Descent is a novella in the anthology 'The Only One'. I only made it through the first story. I was sooooo bloomin' frustrated at the end of that one story! The story line was excellent - or could have been. There was a slight new twist, or maybe I should say, new information concerning the history of the Carpathians, or actually about time even before the Carpathians.... when the wizards ruled... it was sounding really good.... but it was sooooo short! Yes, I enjoyed the story..... there just wasn't enough of it. I truly wish this had been a full length novel...."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"This story really shows the difference of how we all react to the Dark Series. I thought this story was one of her best and wished it wasn't a short story. I liked the fact that Joie was more sure of herself and had some skills to help out her mate(since she was human). Since I just started reading this series recently, I had the advantage; it was included with the Dark Prince when I bought it."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Susan Grant's The Star Queen was fantastic! If you have read any of her Star Series, you will definitely want to read this. You'll get to learn of The Dark Years and how the Vash Nadah began. As always Ms. Grant's detail is exceptional. Both h/h are so likeable and fascinating, and yes, the hero is very sexy. If you haven't read any of her Star Series (shame), get them: The Star King; The Star Prince; and in August, The Star Princess.Christine Feehan's Dark Descent was wonderful and thrilling, as are all her other books in the Dark Series. As a regular reader, I didn't have to read the same background and descriptions. It cuts right to the chase and I though that was very refreshing.Susan Squire's Sacrilege was so entertaining. Susan's writing makes me shiver, laugh, gulp, and I can't seem to turn the pages fast enough."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I have to admit I was curious how 3 authors(only one of which I had previously read books by) could write one book...I did not realize they were 3 short stories and am glad for it but dismayed as well. The three stories were each well written...full of detail and romance and intrigue, HOWEVER, they were too short. I enjoyed reading each but felt myself longing for so much more and for each to be a full length novel. I particularly felt the ending to Christine Feehan's Dark Descent left too much open and hope to have that story continued. Susan Grant's The Star Queen atleast included an ending which made it more bearable when it was over. Susan Squires Sacrilege left me wanting to read a book about Pietr and his rise, fall and rise again so hopefully he will come to life, so to speak, in another book. I have read two of her previous books, Sacrement and One With The Night...her characters and storylines always beg to continue on...I like that Julien and Sarah were brought into this short story as I found myself craving more of them after One With The Night ended.I recommend The Only One for those who love romance winning against all odds and for those who prefer short stories and even for those who will like me, wish there were more pages for each of these stories to be had.Linda"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"good short story and opens up other's as well"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"My review is based solely on the story \\"Dark Descent\\": I haven't read the others. I typically do not care for \\"romance\\" novels and have always stuck with the horror genre. At the recommendation of a friend, I decided to give the Dark Series a chance. (Vampires, maybe it wouldn't be too painful.) I started from the beginning with \\"Dark Prince\\" and had a hard time getting through the first chapter. But I pushed past my personal resistance to the romance concept and found myself enthralled with the plight and passion of the Carpathian males...simply...I was hooked!!! Since then, I've read most of the series and have greatly enjoyed every story; except this one. Maybe my upset was because it was a short story and felt incomplete. It was pale and boring compared to the depth and drama of the other stories. I was especially disappointed with the character Joie. I enjoy a strong female lead, and there are many in this series, but her reactions were unacceptably \\"casual\\". In fact, I felt all the characters were shallow, flippant and fatuous in comparison to what I had come to associate with this series. The story as a whole felt very juvenile. I give the rest of the Dark Series five stars, excellent drama, passion, suspense and excitement! If you like a strong independent female lead, read \\"Dark Guardian\\". Jaxon has some similarites to Joie, yet she is a much more believable (and likable) character. Perhaps Mrs. Feehan should stick with full-length novels; it seems she needs the pages to build the suspense and depth needed for the right effect."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I bought this book because of Christine Feehan because until recently, she has been one of my auto-buy authors.Unfortunately, I haven't been enjoying her new books all that much. Lair of the Lion was the last new book I've enjoyed from her, albeit it had a hokey ending. Although, Dark Fire is my favorite of the Carpathian series, Dark Legend and Gaurdian seemed to be exact replicas of Dark Fire in that so many of the phrases and sentences were exactly the same. Dark Symphony just made me grimace, as I couldn't stand either the hero or the heroine.Feehan appears to be stepping away from the Alpha Male character which her previous books focused on. Instead now, her heroine's are independent plucky females who just happen to partner up with a Carpathian. For the Carpathian characters she's been writing so long, the romanctic intensity just isn't there.In this anthology, Dark Descent, the story starts out interesting enough, but because of the amount of time spent with the misc characters like the family member it just took away the romantic elements. In Dark Symphony, so much dialogue from the various members were distracting and non romantic. The same thing happens in Dark Descent. I just could not find myself caring either way what happened to the characters. Of Feehan's short stories, I would have to say Dark Dream was my favorite, here you see the intensity of the need for both the hero and heroine had of each other. In addition, it was nice plot from beginning to end. Whereas in Dark Descent, if a new reader of Feehan was reading, you're kind of thrown into this plot device of researching at what vampires are looking and the whole thing about wizards that really is never resolved at the end of the story. Sorry, but the plot was not that interesting in itself. Interesting in seeing how it fits in with the wider picture of all the Carpathians, but as a short story it was not easy to follow.I have never read a Susan Grant book because the heroines never seem to be the type of heroines I would like to read about. The Star Queen kind of proved me right. How an aplha male could have waited years before claiming his love for a girl just seemed ridiculous especially waiting out her love affair with some other man. I really did not understand the world they live in, nor the quick epilogue like conclusion. After reading this very un-romantic sci-fi peace, I'm still not inclined to read Grant's books.The surprise of the three stories was the Susan Squire story. This is my first introduction to her writing. I have to say that of the 3 stories, this by far was the best story. I would have given the other 2 stories about no star to 1 star, but Squire story was about 4 stars. I liked the heroine having been the bad person and now is looking for redemption and forgiveness. It was easy to understand her pain and her motives. In fact the star couple from Squires other book is seen from the eyes of Magda, the bad girl. The plot worked very well within the limited pages. Both hero and heroine work hard at trying to ignore the love they have for each other because of different reasons. The hero is a monk with rigid moral codes, and the heroine hides her feelings for Pietr because he has been her mentor for the past 2 centuries. I enjoyed the love story between Pietr and Magda. But reading from Madga's point view I began to dislike her orginal creator and his mate Sara as well. The blood sucking was a little gross and unromantic. And all the calling to this Companion within themselves was confusing.Overall, I would not recommend buying this anthology."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I like Christine Feehan's books, and have read all her Carpathian novels...this short story is too short. I couldn't believe it when I turned the last page and the story was over...many issues are not resolved. I imagine that some of the issues raised in this story will be dealt with in a future novel, but it is still disappointing..."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"\\"Dark Decent\\" by Christine Feehan. Ancient Carpathian hunter Traian Trigovise realizes tracking this cunning vampire won't be easy as Gallent is no fledgling. His belief proved right when the trap is sprung. In Austria, Joie Sanders takes a bullet protecting a US senator and his wife. Many miles apart, a psychic link between the injured duo sends Joie climbing the Carpathian Mountains to rescue Traian, not realizing the danger she is in and the love she will find.\\"The Star Queen\\" by Susan Grant. On Sienna, Taj Sai believes life would be better for the decimated survivors of her devastated planet if the warlords were eliminated. She blames men like her childhood friend Romijha B'Kah for the destruction of their orb. Romijha joins the woman he loves to save what is left of their failing world.\\"Sacrilege\\" by Susan Squires. To contain her need to kill, vampiress Magda Ravel has resided in Mirso Monastery for about two centuries. Judging she is ready, Brother Pietr throws out so that she can prove that she can live among those whom she renounced. In San Francisco, Magda must relearn to live, but still thinks of her mentor back in the European monastery.Though the Susan Grant science fiction romance tale is different than the supernatural novellas of Christine Feehan and Susan Squires, all three well-written stories will make believers out of readers. The terrific tales are set in the trademark realm that each author is famous for having created. Fans of any of the three authors will enjoy this worthy collection and seek other books by the remaining writers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I have been a long time fan of each of these authors. For the new fan who wants to taste each of their works, I am not sure if this is the place to start. All three stories are related to other stories and if you are not familiar with them, you might not be able to follow along smoothly. I did not love the stories in these books. For the fans of these authors, you will probably want to read these stories to keep up with what is going on in the series. For all others, I might steer clear of this book.Dark Descent: (3 star) My least favorite of the three books. I like Ms. Feehan's Carpathian series, but felt that this story was too short and tried to do too much in the confined space. If this was a full length novel, then the story would have worked much better. The last few books show that Ms. Feehan wants to take this series in another direction (or two) and I have no problem with that, I am just not sure this was the right medium to introduce the next level.The Star Queen: (3 star) This story was ok. It felt very rushed to me, and like Feehan's story, I think would have been better served if it were a full length book, not a short book in an anthology. There is a bit of back story that if one is not familiar with the other books (Star King, Star Prince, etc) might confuse the reader. I thought our hero and heroine were pretty well defined characters, but would have loved to have seen more depth.Sacrilege: (4 star) I enjoyed this story the best out of the group. Again, Magda's story follows from Squire's Sacrament and if one is not familiar with that story, they might be confused. This book is written with more depth than the others, and I think holds up the best on its own. My biggest problem with this book is that I never got close or felt like I got to know our hero."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Maybe I'm spoiled,but,and I did buy it, Ms.Feehan is a fantastic writer. Putting the other two with her made the whole book a watery read if not worse."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I have been a fan of Christine Feehan for years, and own all of her books. I specifically bought this book for her &quot;Dark Descent&quot; story - a continuation of her dark series. I was so disappointed by this story, although it starts out well and grabs your attention the story never really has a chance to grow, just as it starts to get interesting it ends - with no real resolution and quite a few unanswered questions. As the other reviewer stated, I too got to the last page and said that's it? Are you kidding me?! It was such a let down, as Traian and Joie are great together and I would have liked to see their relationship and story line developed more. And what about her mother?! Was really looking forward to that meeting. Was that part of the story edited out for time? I really felt cheated and believe that they deserved to have a full book of their own to really tell their story. After reading this one, I don't believe an anthology is the best way to tell her stories. I hope that this was just a preview for a more in depth story line in another book. As for the other two stories, I also felt that I missing out on something -Susan Grant's story couldn't hold my attention as the heroine was so annoying -I did not find her to be likeable at all. And as for Susan Squires story, I guess you have to read her other books to appreciate this one."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"These books are good, just extremely repititous. they basically give the backstory over and over in each book."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"CHRISTENE FEEHAN IS THE UNDISPUTED MASTER OF THE WRITTEN WORD I HAVE READ EVERYTHING OF HERS THAT I CAN GET MY HANDS ON.

In fact the best part of this book might be the cover art -- which doesn't say much for the writing.\\"Dark Descent\\" by Feehan was a disapointment. It started off at least mildly interesting; a female body guard, astral projection, and of course the instant recognition of \\"lifemates\\". But the characters were shallow and very gullible. Joie's sister is a doctor specializing in microbiology and she didn't have a problem with vampires, dragons, etc? Sure, they can communicate with each other through telepathy but that's a far cry from watching someone change into a wolf. The story just seemed like it was written in a hurry with no attention to details.\\"Star Queen\\" by Susan Grant was absolutely awful. This story could have been written by an elementary school writing student -- and they'd have flunked. The main characters were very unlikeable and unrealistic. The male lead waited years to approach the female lead despite the uncertainties of their existence. And when they did get together it was a one-night-stand sort of thing where the hero is flying off in the morning to almost certain death. The heroine is not happy with this decision. They argue, make wild, passionate love, and he leaves. Turn the page and he's back! Not only is he back but the entire universe has been rebuilt. No explaination, just an epilog type ending that says nothing. Very poor writing. And the not-so-subtle religious preachings didn't add to the overall dismal story. Apparently Ms. Grant spent more time trying to find unpronouncable names for her characters than she did in giving them personalities and a plot.The last entry, \\"Sacrilege\\" by Susan Squire, was probably the pick of a poor crop. I've never read anything by her before and I think it would have helped if I had. The story wasn't terribly original and was hard to believe; a vampire monk who had been essentially brainwashed for over a thousand years suddenly sees the light all because of a rather obnixious female vampire? I don't think so.There are better anthologies out there. If you have to read this, read it at the bookstore or library but don't waste any money."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"I have read all of Ms. Feehan's \\"Dark Series\\" with the exception of Dark Prince which I have Pre-ordered.

I will read more by Susan Grant, I've discovered her!"},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Three wonderful authors combine in this anthology to prove that you can get a gift anytime of the year, not only Halloween or Christmas.Ms. Feehan returns readers to the shadowed world of her Carpathians. Troian long ago lost his ability to see color or to feel, as he searched for centuries for his lifemate. He has almost given up when he has a one of a kind meeting with the woman who is his destiny. Loving Joie gives him not only his life back, but a family. Yet, the evil threat of the fallen members of his race threatens to steal his newfound joy. It will take everything not only he and his lifemate have, but call upon the resources of her family as well to defeat them.Susan Grant provides her fans with a bit of history on the people who have made hers a beloved series of futuristic novels. Fans will appreciate the added depth the prequel gives to her other books.Ms. Squires' contribution is an extremely well written continuation of SACRAMENT. She dares to take a villain and turn her into a heroine. The gothic mood is often lightened with quirky humor as Magda deals with the confusing world of the present. Yet before she can achieve her goals and prove herself, she may find that her reputation is more of a handicap than she anticipated. Truth, love, and the importance of the past are all themes that are tenderly portrayed.**** Love is the one thing no one can live without, as each novella reveals in its own unique way. Though newcomers to any of the authors may find themselves a bit lost, it is a reward for fans, and a book that will definitely be a special keeper for more than just this reviewer."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"All three of these stories provided me with a glimpse into the continuing worlds of these writers. I did not mind that they were short stories, sometimes that is a great way to get to know if you like somebody's writing. Ms. Feehan created a heroine I just loved to read about and I wouldn't mind seeing more strong capable women portrayed as romance heroines. Susan Grant did a wonderful job with her world building. This is important in a sci-fi story. Her treatment of the heroines response of anger showed that she has really thought out how people forced to live under these conditions might respond. I would love to see more stories set in the following years or maybe even how things got so bad. Ms. Squires story was third for me because I am not fond of vampires who regret their life choices. Still, I understood why she did it, Magda was not a born vampire but a made one. It was not a choice. I would like to have seen more world building in her story, so that I could understand the choices her characters made better. Still, this is far and away a super story and I wouldn't have missed it. I believe that this book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Only One","review":"Each author tells a short story related to the fantasy world they have created in their full books.

I thoroughly enjoyed THE ONLY ONE and would especially recommend the anthology to anyone who wants a taste of what these amazing writers are capable of.

This is a great addition to the dark series but I hope we see more of these characters. This really needed to be a full length book.

A+"},{"Title":"Pepper (Flamingo Original)","review":"Tristan Hawkins's first novel is a simple story of a male-female relationship which turns complicated. As such, it is not unlike High Fidelity by Nick Hornby. But while Hornby's narrator, Rob, is a kind of homme moyen sensual, Richard, the hero of Pepper, is only representative of man's worst excesses - a solipsistic, drug-taking, insecure adman besotted with the skin-challenged secretary Pepper.As absorbing as this moral tale is, however, the book's verve is what makes it noteworthy. In contrast to Hornby's arid prose, Hawkins writes with terrific brio and a sense of invention that flirts with brilliance. A gifted pasticheur, he mimics (among other things) ads, hymns and trashy women's magazines as he satirises the junk around us which we use to add meaning to our lives.Some will argue that High Fidelity is more 'profound'. Fair enough, but Pepper will give you a lot more laughs (not to mention a name for that sinking feeling when you say or do something regrettable after one drink too many). There are greater tragedies in life but while Hornby continues to gather plaudits for his unambitious, preachy facsimiles of Anne Tyler, spare a thought for Hawkins, dead at 31, who wrote a funnier, gutsier and virtually unknown book that has already all but vanished into the ether...."},{"Title":"History of Home","review":"Quintana won the American Book Award for &quot;The History of Home&quot;.

It's Liu's third book, and it's delightful. That's a strange word for a technical book, but it's true! This book is both practical (down to earth) and occasionally funny.I must admit... I haven't read all 588 pages yet, but the sections I have read are all clearly written, well illustrated and there is just enough background information to make the topics interesting. For example when he discusses the possibility of BSIM3 calculating a negative back-gate transconductance, gmb, or a negative mutual transconductance, gm, he points out that a negative gm has actually been reported in a real device, and gives the reference. Then he gives a checklist you can use to help prevent the negative gmb problem in your model.I was particularly interested and amused by his explanation of the \\"Killer NOR Gate\\" in section 4.2 \\"Problems with the 40/60 Partition.\\" This circuit caused a lot of interesting e-mail discussion a couple of years ago.His chapter 3 contains a very good 130-page \\"ALPHABETICAL GLOSSARY OF BSIM3 PARAMETERS.\\" Anybody who works with BSIM3 knows you need a handy list of all the model parameters and what they mean. Liu devotes a couple of paragraphs to each, and he recommends leaving many of them equal to zero!I'm more of a SPICE model user, not so much a theorist, and I found this book to be exactly what I needed.The other recent classics on this subject are Cheng &amp; Hu's MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide (1999), Arora's MOSFET Models for VLSI Circuit Simulation (1993) and Foty's MOSFET Modeling with SPICE (1996)."},{"Title":"MOSFET MODELS FOR SPICE SIMULATION INCLUDING BSIM3V3 AND BSIM4","review":"William Liu (SML Modeling Expert/DMTS) has recently authored an excellent text on the BSIM3 and BSIM4 SPICE models.

However, this time I was glad I perservered, as that is really barely the topic of the book at all. This book explores the emotions, secrets, and memories of a group of related women whose ages span nearly 70 years. The style, which is often memories described in an almost stream of consciousness style that moves freely through time, depicts what happens to thoughts in people who are simply re-exploring their past, are victims of Alzheimers or of physical illnesses. I enjoyed the mood created by their thoughts and memories and the way the author gradually revealed more and more bits of difficult events in these women's pasts.

This book I am having trouble getting into. The main character, Virginia, is so depressed and angry it makes it hard to read about her or relate to her permanent bad mood. I also find it hard to keep track of the relatives and relationships between all the characters in the story.

Illustrator Martha Alexander portrays her as a bit of a pixie (even though she is bright green and definitely wants her own way).Having things her way can be difficult as she lives in a hollow tree with a ghost, a bat, and a gremlin. These three also have minds of their own. About all the ghost wants to do is float above a large steaming black pot, while the bat likes to spend his time hanging in the broom closet. The gremlin is usually found snoozing in the dark, damp under the sink cupboard. Thus, little green witch is left to do all of the \\"unhousework.\\"The poor thing worked herself into a frenzy spreading soot, hanging cobwebs, and dirtied laundry. One day she found some pumpkin seeds and asked her tree mates to help her plant them. Do you think any of that lazy trio would lift a hand (as if ghosts had one)?Well, the little green witch planted the seeds all by herself and it wasn't too long before the pumpkins were fat, ripe, and ready. Once again, she asked for help in picking them. Same story - not a one of the trio would come to her aid.Now, the little green witch didn't take this lack of community spirit lying down.

This is Tamera Alexander first series, and a great introduction to a wonderful new author.The story follows Annabelle Grayson, a woman whose husband had accepted her past and loved her in spite of it. Upon his death, she is left alone to fight the bitter memories of a previous life she can't change.Haunted by angry words said to a brother now gone, Matthew Taylor struggles to find his way.

Can Matthew understand his late brother's acceptance for a scarlet woman and discover the reasons he'd loved her, for himself?Tamera Alexander weaves a beautiful story of God's abounding love and forgiveness. Her characters come to life as each page turns.

Both in subject matter and the sweetness in how it was handled.This enjoyable and touching novel should appeal to historical and romance fans and those who love to see God at work changing lives and hearts.A solid, well-crafted novel with moments of pain, beauty and love that almost take the reader's breath away. The further I stepped into the story the sadder I became at the approaching ending.The only complaint I could log would be that the book wasn't long enough to give a day by day detailed description of life between the main characters. I felt like I missed little shreds of developing relationship - a sign that I got overly involved with the characters.

She decides to leave Fountain Creek, Colorado to start fresh in a new home in Idaho in hopes of leaving behind her failures. She seeks to hire a guide to take her to her new beginning.Two men respond to her want ads. The younger one Matthew Taylor is running from his past just like Annabelle is. He applies for the position that he sees as a chance to start anew, but is stunned to learn if hired his employer is the Widow McCuthens, the woman he blames for his friend's death though he admits he helped cause the wrong that will haunt him for ever.The second Fountain Creek Chronicles (see REKINDLED) is an inspirational tale starring two souls with much remorse over errors they made that cost them and others plenty. The irony of this superb Americana is that Matthew scorns Annabelle though he holds himself in contempt too. Readers will be hooked early on to learn why as Tamara Alexander provides an interesting Reconstruction Era tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I read the whole series.

Matthew believes himself to be a righteous man, but Annabelle Grayson brings out the worst in him at every turn. Her past serves as proof to him that she can never change, and he refuses to consider otherwise. Matthew accuses Annabelle of being a conniving woman who is out for everything she can get, and he is slow to realize that extending forgiveness to others and accepting forgiveness for himself are both necessary to achieve true freedom.Matthew's accusations grieve Annabelle, who longs to make the most of her second chance at life. Unfortunately, the only way for her to do so is to escape the small Colorado town where gossip keeps her past alive. She and her husband set out for Idaho, but his death forces her to return to Willow Springs. In a final, desperate bid to leave her past behind, she advertises for a trail guide to take her to Idaho and receives a shock when she meets the first applicant for the job--Matthew Taylor. Thankfully, a second man applies for the position. As Annabelle makes her way north with her trail guide, she seeks her young friend, Sadie, who disappeared several months earlier. En route, Annabelle discovers that life is not always as it seems, and past actions, no matter how hurtful, can be forgiven.Tamera Alexander's second novel in her debut Fountain Creek Chronicles series highlights her talent at featuring an aspect of Christian living, in this case, forgiveness, in a real-life context. The historical, western flavor of the novel comes through clearly and portrays the wilds of Colorado and of life on the trail with accuracy. Furthermore, Alexander's strongly drawn characters and realistic, compelling plot draw readers into the story and entice them to read \\"just one more chapter.\\" I look forward to the final novel in this series, Remembered, coming June 2007."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"i was so anticipating the ongoing story of REKINDLED.i did not think i was going to love it as much but the characters were so human and flawed that you could not help to identify with them. i love how annabelle took a chance on matthew as her guide even though he was so surly and rude to her.she kept the faith of god and helped matthew to see how much god loves and forgives.i'm hoping that ms.alexander is going to continue with another sequel and will be checking her website regularly to see so."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"It's not the product.

In fact, I dare say I loved Revealed even more than Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which used to be my favorite book...period. The title Revealed is so perfect and sums up the story in so many ways.What made this book so amazing? The characters were not just flawed, but they grew throughout the story. Especially the hero. To me, this is the most powerful redemption story I've ever read. The tension between the characters was truly believable. As they got to know each other more they discovered that many of their assumptions about each other were not true, which meant they had to change things about themselves because of that revelation. Is that cool, or what?I don't want to spoil the story for you with too many details, but there was just so much healing and character growth in this novel that it sets it apart from most historical westerns. Sure, you still have the sleazy characters that you want to choke, and they were believable, too. But there is just more depth to this story than most. The spiritual threads were delicately woven throughout the book and not at all preachy, IMHO. And that first kiss was perfect. The finger trailing the lip. The look in his eyes. The romantic waiting. The fact that he said he'd wait. So many things understood between them without a word. Oh, and her scary feelings of love (as a woman should feel) and the wonder of it all was fabulously done. She experienced how special things could be with Matthew.One of the things I loved best about this story was the theme of how you can't love others if you don't know what unconditional love is. Johnny rescued Annabelle from a horrible life and prepared the soil for her to experience true love for the first time in her life. I also loved how the author used Annabelle's concern for Sadie to reach Matthew as well. Their relationship was so well done, as was the guardedness on Sadie's end. Several times my eyes misted. Great emotional impact! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Once again Tamara Alexander provides us with a story you take to heart and love. With two of the characters from her first novel, Tamera weaves a tale of God's love and forgiveness for even the most broken of lives. Matt Taylor and Annabelle Grayson are drawn together when he learns his deceased brother's pregnant widow needs an escort to take her to join the wagon train she had to leave when Jonathan died. She wants to continue the journey to Idaho to live on the ranch Jonathan claimed there. Matt agrees because he believes the ranch should be his, not Annabelle's. Because of her past life in a brothel, Matt feels she isn't worthy to bear the name of his brother and even doubts the unborn child is Jonathan's. Matt and Annabelle travel westward and during the trip, they learn to respect each other and to trust God to take them safely on their journey. Along the way Annabelle, with Matt's unexpected help, is able to rescue a young friend, Sadie, from life in a brothel. The ending has a wonderful twist that wraps up the story in a most satisfying way. This is one that will be hard to put down once you start reading."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Revealed is the second book in Tamera Alexander's Fountain Creek Chronicles and readers will be pleased to know that Tamera has written another powerful story of two broken people seeking redemption from their past. This is the story of Annabelle Grayson and Matthew Taylor, pivotal characters in Tamera's first book, Rekindled.After the death of her husband, Annabelle chooses to follow his dream and travel to Idaho and the land he had claimed. She wants to start afresh and locate her young friend, Sadie who has disappeared. Annabelle advertises for a trail guide to accompany her on the arduous journey and is shocked to discover that Matthew Taylor, her late husband's brother, unwittingly reponds. Matthew despises Annabelle and wants nothing more than to expose her as the conniving and immoral woman he believes she is.Tamera's deft hand writes a tender and realistic story of two people struggling to move beyond their tainted past into a fresh and forgiven future. Annabelle and young Sadie's haunting past is sensitively portrayed as is Matthew's guilt and regreat over his broken relationship with his brother. Matthew's unforgiving prejudice towards Annabelle reveals a tendency in most of us to pass judgement on prior behaviour rather than on a person's current character and conduct. Revealed is a moving story which challenges you to consider how you view those around you in light of God's grace and forgiveness to us all."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"When a prostitute is bought out of a brothel and marries a man she does not really love, the reader wants to dislike her right away. Soon enough, Annabella was my hero, even with her jaded past. A tragedy, and we met her as a pregnant widow. Matthew Taylor needs a job, so he applied as trail guide for Annabelle's trip to Idaho and the land her deceased husband loved.To say these two literally despised each other would not be stretching the truth, both had deep, dark secrets and both had reasons not to trust the other. However, Matthew got the job and much of this book is about the long, 900 mile journey, searching for tiny little Sadie, a 15 yr. old prostitute, nearly losing their lives in the process. Why was Matthew so edgy and seemed to look over his shoulder a lot? The wanted posters told Annabelle some of the reasons--- she was traveling with a criminal.This book deals with many issues, prostitution in the early settlements of the West, the dangers of whiskey, gambling and women all thrown together and the struggle to forgive oneself even after God has shown complete forgiveness.Traveling by wagon was not easy, especially when two people who disliked and distrusted each other were alone for three months and there were inate dangers as well as physical and environmental ones. Personally, for me, I related completely to the subtle description of dementia of a very elderly, mean relative.I have already begun my search for book three by this author. Where did she come from and how did she get to be such a sucess so quickly? Books one and two only slightly overlap with towns and people and book three has a huge reputation to live up to. Thanks for the Christian, historical fiction book that shows the power of change when asked of God."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"RevealedBy: Tamera AlexanderCovered wagons and western skies, damsels in distress and bounty hunters, all make dreams of days gone by.

I have stayed up till 3am the past few nights finishing these books. I think Tamara Alexander is becoming one of my new favorite authors!! These books are a must read!!"},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Unlike others, I was compelled to read this book because of Annabelle's previous occupation and once I started, I could not put the book down, compelled by the artistic way Alexander drew me into the hearts and souls of the characters by her incredible talent to write them in an honest and compelling way, set to the backdrop of an incredible story. It is a story about grace and coming to truly know and believe that grace.I'll try not to \\"spoil\\" the story too much in my review, as I hate that in other reviews.\\"Revealed\\" starts out with Annabelle losing her husband and her regret at not being able to love him the way she wished she could. In her travels to grant her husband's request of being buried by Fountain Creek, she must find another driver to help her meet up with the wagon train that she and her husband were traveling with to the ranch he owned. The new driver turns out to be her husband's brother who did not approve of Annabelle and her past.The story follows these characters on their journey, both physical and emotion. We are captivated by the way Alexander shows in authentic ways the growth of both characters throughout their struggles.I can't wait for the next series coming out next month!"},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I really liked this book. I read all 3 of the Fountain Creek Chronicles series and this one was my favorite. The characters were easy to like and the plot was great."},{"Title":"Revealed (Fountain Creek Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"This book was fabulous!! I was riveted from page one and I didn't put it down till I had finished it. I read the entire thing on a six-hour car ride. The characters were so real; they all had flaws and secrets. And the relationship between Annabelle and Matthew was developed beautifully. Though they started out butting heads and almost hating each other due to past experiences, they each came to terms, growing individually and then developing a solid foundation for not only friendship, but also for an angsty and subtle romance. It was obvious that these were God-fearing people, but I was a pleasantly surprised to read something a little different than the Christian fiction norm. It was more a change of heart, a change of perspective, forgiveneses and acceptance rather than the typical conversion that we read so often.My only advice would be to read the previous book \\"Rekindled\\" first. I didn't realize this was the second book in a series, so I didn't understand alot of things. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE PREVIOUS BOOK FIRST. I have yet to read it, but it's on my desk at home waiting for me. And the next book in the series, \\"Remembered\\" will be released soon, and I can't wait to read that one as well. I'm so impressed with this debut author and what she has to offer her readers. Her writing style is sharp and descriptive, but not too flowery or over the top. Alexander has the skill and ability to pull you into the book so you see every scene and feel every emotion. Everything about this book flowed and fit just right. This is a five star book for anyone who likes historical fiction and Christian romances all wrapped up in one amazing package."},{"Title":"Black Inventors of America","review":"This book was unique when it was first published in 1969.

I was quite interested throughout, and was satisfied with the ending. It just wasn't a great book. The villians (in this case, priests and other clergymen) are all treated as prop charactors, as if Lackey meant to go back and edit in some personalities once she finished sketching out the plot. All of the &quot;bad&quot; guys were steriotypical villians with no clear motive and no originality. But the book was entertaining, I'll give it that much."},{"Title":"The Robin & the Kestrel (Bardic Voices, Book 2)","review":"The Lark and the Wren left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. It was a *good* book, but truely lacked in several elements. It's sequel, the Robin and the Kestrel seems to have picked up some of the pieces to produce an interesting novel.The main characters are developed nicely, and for the first time, I didn't find myself groaning at the idiocy of either of the leads. The 'enemies' though, made me wince a little because of their resemblance to cardboard cutouts. While we do hear a little about the antagonists past, it's hardly enough to satisfy a curious reader.A small annoyance for me, was also the 'fade to black' scenes. It's wonderful that the leads have such an intimate relationship, but it doesn't need to be mentioned every night if the author won't follow up with a scene.Finally, this book does seem to bash a modern religion a little, but most shouldn't take offense, because it also provides some sympathetic characters from identical beliefs.All in all, Mercedes Lackey is a wonderful writer, and while I feel a bit generous about giving this book four stars, her unique style helps ease the decision a little."},{"Title":"The Robin & the Kestrel (Bardic Voices, Book 2)","review":"This was a great book and it kept me on the edge of my seat.

I love the way the author progresses at a logical and interesting pace from one storyline/book to the next. The Robin is still incorrigible and despite her scrape with the dark mage still lets hubris and attitude get her into another dangerous situation. Robin's husband,the Kestrel is a really nice guy who's still learning to be himself. I love that they revisit Wren's old haunts and end up playing for and helping the the ghost themselves while destroying a bunch of annoying, self-serving, undereducated or overpriviledged idiots in the process. The story also introduces us to more of the nonhuman species, and they're a lot cooler than the humans, in preparation for the third book."},{"Title":"The Robin & the Kestrel (Bardic Voices, Book 2)","review":"Mercedes Lackey never fails to entrance her readers.

It is book two of the series, and both continues characters from the previous book and introduces new characters that reappear in later books. The series should be read in order. The book begins with Free Bard Kestrel (a.k.a. Jonny Brede) and his wife, the gypsy Robin (a.k.a. Gwyna), traveling from Birnam in a gypsy wagon. The first half of the book takes them through a series of adventures that lead them to Gradford. The second half deals with events in Gradford, including the attempt of an evil priest to take over the city as a dictator (one can recognize the usual historical process of scapegoats, strong-arm police, a charismatic leader, etc.). It describes the strategies used by the general population to survive during such a reign, and has an eventual confrontation between good and evil. Overall, it is an entertaining book that holds your interest."},{"Title":"The Robin & the Kestrel (Bardic Voices, Book 2)","review":"I liked this book very much. It is light reading, and although some of the characters lack depth, it's still a good story. What I'm wondering, though, is who selects the cover artist, and does the author have no say in it? The picture on the front of this book couldn't be more inappropriate to the content of the story if the artist had deliberately set out with that in mind!**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTRobin and Kestrel are investigating a plot by an evil priest who, among other things, has imposed very harsh rules on the inhabitants of the town, including modest dress for women. Robin must attempt to be inconspicuous as she pretends to be a respectable trader's wife instead of a gypsy. Yet the front cover has her dressed in some kind of jacket thing that opens to the waist with no apparent form of fastening, and the swell of her breasts visible. Very modest, to be sure. Meanwhile Kestrel is dressed like some kind of court jester. Do these artists even read the books they are illustrating?I have the same complaint with the art on the cover of the Eagle and the Nightingales. Nightingale is described as a tall, slim and elegant woman with very long black hair. The picture shows a dumpy woman with mid-length brown hair. If I were the author, I wouldn't be too thrilled!"},{"Title":"The Robin & the Kestrel (Bardic Voices, Book 2)","review":"This book is my favorite one in the bardic series. Although I enjoyed Rune's story, and also liked Nightingale, I love Robin and Kestrel. They are such an awesome couple, and are good at fighting 'old time crime' if you will.

He sent me this book out of the blue as we had not seen each other for many years. Strangely enough, it arrived at a difficult time for me. I took an afternoon off and read the book. This is not a panagyric or metaphysical homage though the inspiration for &quot;finding each other&quot; was communion with Jesus.

The premise is interesting, if somewhat done-before(Michael diMercurio and Stephen Coonts have done this in THREAT VECTOR and AMERICA respectively)- a stealth submarine is hijacked by a mix of Libyans loyal to Qadaffi, Ukranians rebelling against the new Russia and a group of Serb paid mercenaries. The sub sinks various merchant shipping in order to hijack valuable components for its SS-N-19 nuclear-tipped missiles. But where can it be tracked to if it's invisible to ordinary sonar? Why, enter the ultra secret STONY MAN covert ops team, featuring Mack 'The Executioner' Bolan, Jack Grimaldi leading a SEAL team, former SAS operative McCarter and a token Russian with technical know-how of the sub. Exciting action scenes on the sea and below it, in Serbia and Italy where operative Carl Lyons meets a Mafia clan who are out to destroy the enemy for personal reasons. And it's no more than 330 pages. Don Pendleton crams a Clancy-esque story into an easy-reading action story that's also suitable for older teenagers to read. The narrative is good, with not too much unnecessary detail and no subplots going off on tangents as you get in some novels on the same sort of subject. All in all, another good time-filler entry in a long-running series."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF AIRPLANES","review":"OK, I,'ll admit it. When I saw this book at an airliners collectibles show, my knees went weak. I am a softie when it comes to nostalgia. You see, I had this book as a child (though many people say I haven't quite grown up yet). I flew on those DC-8s (such as the bird pictured on the cover) and 707s (illustrated on the frontisepiece, striking a provocative pose with JFK's new jet-age terminals in the background).This book was first published in 1951 and remained in print for more than two decades! The contents are a mix of aeronautical technologies from all these years. The section on how fly an airplane shows a Ryan (North American) Navion, a sporty four-seater built between 1947 and 1950. The Sikorsky S-58s are from the mid- to late 1950s; some of the types of helicopters illustrated have long disappeared, while others are still in production to this day. The Lear Jet and Boeing 727 were added around 1963, while the jet engines are still frozen in the pre-1960 era of the turbojet (prior to the much more economical turbofans of today). The artwork showing the cabin and flight deck, likewise, are pre-1958 - the light greens and pinks really take you back to that era! As you can see, even if some of the technology is somewhat dated, this book more than makes up for it in nostalgia.As a side note, the original 1951 edition featured the then-new modern miracle of the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (if my memory serves me correctly), so if you are a fan of propliners as well, you might want to pick up a copy of that edition as well, even if some pages will be repeated. Enjoy the trip!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk Home","review":"While this book was good enough to finish, it was nothing I would recommend to a friend. It was fairly transparent and predictable.

I especially liked his recommendation against 6.

Many of the recommendations are similar but the theory in Kosten's book is up to date. One small quibble: the cover says the book is written by a &quot;Najdorf expert&quot; but Kosten explicitly disclaims being an &quot;expert&quot; in the Najdorf, whatever that means, in the Preface. This book is a good place to start for those trying to take up this challenging but always interesting opening.

After the wedding she is sent to a convent to grow up as she is only 13.Years later Conar and Melisande meet again when her home is again being attacked.He rescues her again and they fight then she is abducted.At this point most of the remainder of the story is told in flashback.The hero was a pretty decent character but the heroine behaved like a spoilt brat throughout the story.She's 13 at the start of the story and continues to act 13 to the end of the story.Conar deserved someone who was woman enough to accept the fact that the best way to protect her people and her home was to marry him and accept it without all the fuss that she made.I lost track of the number of times she called him viking;he knows he's a viking we know he's a viking did she have to keep saying it? It was a good story but the heroine's childish attitude spoilt most of it for me. The scenes with Conar and his family going into battle were far more interesting than any scene with the heroine.Rhiannon and Eric(The Viking's woman)made appearances,also Erin and Olaf(Golden Surrender).They helped the story to get a 3 star rating.The story would have been alot better if the heroine didn't fight the hero all through the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL!!!First off,I'm a little partial because I absolutely LOVE Viking Romances!In Lord of the Wolves, Heather Graham weaves an intricate tale of love, suspense, trust, and passion.

By the end of the story I was hoping our wonderful viking hero would wake up and leave her on the mercy of her enemies. Melisande keeps repeating herself in all the conversations, so it felt like I was reading the same page over and over again."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"This is the third in Graham's Viking trilogy (Golden Surrender, The Viking's Woman and Lord of the Wolves). Set in 9th century Ireland (Eire), England and the north coast of France, this is the story of Prince Olaf of Norway, the first Lord of the Wolves, and his bride, Princess Erin, daughter of the Irish High King, the Ard-Righ of Tara, and their descendants. I warn you that the Viking men in this series are strong willed, arrogant and domineering and those in the last two books are half Irish. Their loves are independent, stubborn and courageous women who have lost much and still can fight with the best of the men. They have no intention of allowing a Viking male who has taken everything from them dominate them. But then wolves and the cubs of wolves mate for life or so says the druid who is advisor to the Irish king's family--and these men are wolves.Each of the marriages is arranged over the objection of the females who fight the husbands who have laid claim to their lands and to them. This third in the series tells the story of Olaf and Erin's son, Conar, who like his father is known as the Lord of the Wolves for he has been great in battle, and Countess Melisande whose castle lies on the north coast of France. Melisande's father, Count Manon, a virile and handsome man, loves his daughter deeply and takes pride in her beauty (which is considerable), her intelligence and her independence. At nearly 13, he knows her growing beauty and her vulnerability as Countess will require that she must one day wed and he's been surveying worthy candidates for the eventual day. With such a purpose in mind, he invites the Wolf's son, Conar, from Eire (Ireland) who he's been impressed with before, to visit his lands in France and meet Melisande. He will not force her to consider him if she doesn't like him, however. Melisande does not know that. Conar arrives just as the Count is slain by a neighbor who covets his daughter and his lands. With the Count's men now leaderless, and believing Conar will protect their lands, they decide Melisande must marry Conar (though the marriage cannot be consummated for many years). Melisande, who takes an instant dislike to the arrogant and demanding Viking, is forced into the marriage. Conar is only willing to marry the difficult child to get the lands. Once wed (in a hasty ceremony), he sends her away to Ireland to his sister who is a nun so she can grow up. His family falls in love with her and many years later he decides to come for her. But she has escaped to his brother, Eric, in England and has no intention of being Conar's wife in truth. Instead, she wants an annulment. But Conar will \\"never\\" let her go.My only problem with this 3rd in the trilogy is that I never read a single conversation between Conar and Melisande that was not a fight over some demand of his. He gave his body to his mistresses and his mind and heart to his family and his rune reader, the lovely blonde Brenna. So when he decides he loves Melisande, I'm wondering, based on what? Great sex? Apparently. Anyway, it does come together in the end but it's a bit of a stretch getting there. In the other books in the trilogy, the couples at least seemed to find some things in common. Still, it's a worthy series, and as always, Graham delivers a good tale."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"I thought the book was okay although Mislande's, character worked my last nerve. I thought the writer took there dislike for each other on the surface a little to long. You would think after someone saves your fortress, advenges your fathers death and then save you. Could there be a little more gratitude. Some of the chapters could have been minimized. But other than that it was okay."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"Heather Graham is a genius! I forgot to put her on my list of authors of \\"favorites\\". She had written this book and The Vikings Woman several years ago and I just read it recently. OH MY STARS!! It had me on the edge of my seat and attacking my hubby. I wish she would write some more like these two."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"I started reading this author on a recommendation. I bought two of her books, this one and the Viking's Woman. I can honestly say this one is WAY better than Viking's woman, but that's not saying much. I know it's a task trying to create a realistic hero, who's structured properly for the period of the novel while exhibiting romantic and loving traits, but that's the gift of a creative writer. Graham seems to be lacking in this creativity. Is it too much to ask that a ROMANCE novel contain at least a smidgen of romantic build up. I do not constitute sex with romance, they're two entirely different animals. Injecting sex in a story does not make it a romantic story, nor does the hero throwing around declaration of possession over his wife constitute romance. \\"You're Mine...I'll never give you up...You belong to me,\\" because of the period, I can accept these statements as loving, if they're mixed in with a healthy understanding of the character's dynamics. Graham does not utilize a writer's ability to build a personality for her characters to create a caring or bond with the reader.The heroine was a yawn inducing bore. Her immaturity was understandable in the beginning because of her age, but it remained through out the story to the last page. Fear ruled Melisande during her initial meeting with Conar. But after that encounter, I lost the motivation for her behavior towards him. I did enjoy the interaction between Conar and his parents. The love, loyalty and genuine affection between Conar, his parents and his numerous siblings was more interesting than the lack luster relationship between him and his *destiny* with the hellion. I can honestly say he tried to bend and show affection towards Melisande, which is the reason I gave this book three stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"read them a long time ago re-read them on my kindle reader what can i say ms heather is so talented she is one of my favorites #1 fan i am."},{"Title":"Lord of the Wolves","review":"couldnt put it down!!!

The first part of the book, Sanborn writes about how the Soviet army managed to tighten draft evasions by rewarding those families that had members serving in the military while confiscating the land of draft evaders and their families during the Russian Civil War.Sandborn also deals with the different nationalities in the Russian empire. Belorussians and Ukrainians assimilated into the Russian army but were later segregrated into seperate ethnic units during the Russain Civil War. While Central Asians resisited service in the Russian army and the Jews were regarded by both Tsarist and Communist officers as subversives and dangerous to morale. The middle section Sanborn descibes how gender roles were coonected to the new Russin nationalism. Both Tsarist and Soviet propaganda stated that Russian men must develop their bodies to protect their nation and the family, while Russian women were required to have sons that could drafted into the army. The final section Sanborn writes how the Russian state would redeem criminals and draft evaders if they rejoined the army, but both the Soviet and Tsarist system would harshly punish pacificit sects. Although the state rewarded violent behavior it could not control it as seen through the various atrocities during the Russian Civil War.The main weakness of Sanborn's book is that he does not write about the treatement about the injured soldiers during and after the Russian Civil War and how this influeced their perception of the Soviet state. Overall this an excellent social history of the Russian army and how it contributed the creation of the Soviet Union."},{"Title":"Alphabet Mystery","review":"I bought this book for my four year old daaughter because we both loved Alphabet Adventure so much. The story centers on little x this time. He decidedes to run away because he is a letter that isn't used very much. All of the other letters embark on an adventure to bring him home. This book is especially perfect for this time of year. There is a spooky castle and a monster M that evokes images of Halloween. At the end of the story little x realizes that he is a very special letter after all. Children love the idea of a mystery and the illustrations in this book are really wonderful. Everytime you read it you will see something new. My daughter especially loves the page where the letters match up to an object that they begin with. My daughter has learned a lot from this book and Alphabet Adventure. I highly recommend them both."},{"Title":"Alphabet Mystery","review":"My first grade class absolutely love this book.

The rest of the alphabet finds little x, rescues him, convinces Capital M that he should be nice, because don't we all love our Mothers, and they all fly back to help form a message on Charley's birthday cake for his Mother. Spoiler: little x gets used on a birthday cake to signify kisses. In short, there really wasn't enough plot to interest my almost 3 year old son past a few readings.

My pre-K class loves it! It includes the whole alphabet and items that start with each letter. It's great fun."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Well-connected, exciting and suspenseful. This book is set in the interregnum after the fall of the Soviet Union and before Islamo-fascism took up the slack on the existential threat front, so the book has elements of Cold War thriller in it (European locales, government cabals), but not the traditional Cold War geopolitical foil.The book only falters a bit with Mr. Ambler's special ability to determine deceit. In fact, the author comes perilously close to recreating the cartoonish Nicholai Hel, Shibumi's ESP-infused super-assassin. Mr. Ambler also has almost superman-like powers SPOILER ALERT except, of course, when he's being conveniently duped by a potential assassin in the climatic final scene. Still a good read though, and recommended."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"At the start, this sounds like a standard Ludlum setup. A spy doesn't remember who he is. He gets out of the psychiatric holding facility with the aid of a sympathetic woman.She goes on the run with him, etc., etc. Add in a Chinese assassin and some US-Chinese political motivation and things improve a little. Not too many thrillers star auditor characters, either, and there is a CIA auditor in this one.It ends at a World Economic Forum in Davos, where Ludlum throws in a plot twist. So, it becomes a decent enough book."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"As a long time Ludlum fan, I can't help but be disappointed by this book. The pace is erratic, the characters lackluster and the ending uninspired. I couldn't help but be reminded of the original Ludlum with that heart-pounding suspense when I read the recently published espionage novel by Ward Larsen, The Perfect Assassin. This is a book with an intelligent plot, incredible characters and a pace that really does keep you up at night. A lot like Tom Clancy but not with the interminable details."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"What a disappointment. I always really enjoyed Robert Ludlum's books. And some of the books that appeared after his death, 'co-authored', weren't that bad. This however is absolutely awful. It is so bad and so unbelievable and so badly written, I had to give up. And I rarely do.Don't buy this, buy an original."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I have enjoyed all the Ludlum books over the years and even after his death, I still found the replacement writers have carried on his skills....UP TO NOW!!!This edition was a rambling stroll thru endless eruptions from a thesaurus that continuously injected wording that was so totally distracting that I lost interest in the storyline. I believe it is time for me to remove the Robert Ludlum series from my future interests."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I'm a big fan of spy thrillers, so I was pretty excited to read this book by the famed Robert Ludlum... Boy, was I wrong. Spy thrillers have always had a strict formula to it, and the reader is expected to be taken on a rollercoaster ride. The characters were uninteresting, the story line was all over the board with no real connecting plots, and I figure out who the real assassin was halfway through the book... So long story short, save your money."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"By: Jeffrey W. Bennett,Under the Lontar PalmandISP Certification-The Industrial Security Professional Exam ManualI listened and enjoyed this book on CD. I rather liked the twists and turns that made the story enjoyable.I am a Cold War spy novel fan and really liked being reminded of the old enemies. I'm not a fan of terrorism thrillers, so Ambler Warning fed my need to be brought back to Europe to rid the world of the evil that grips it. The story even used aged characters from the Cold War Era. Hurray!You'll approve of the justice that takes place through fun and likable characters."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Having read many Ludlum books, I bought this one with great anticipation since for the first time, I heard a radio ad for the novel. I eagerly read and was delighted at the beginning with typical Ludlum suspense and action. As the novel developed, the suspense remained but the action seemed to slow a bit. The last half of the book was a bit of a disappointment as the characters and storyline became unbelievable.I did enjoy the whole concept of the novel but after finishing it I felt a little let down from the hype surrounding this novel. This may sound stupid but who writes these books now that Ludlum is dead?"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"With so many authors out there, writing good books, it is a shame that people are being fed these Mcbooks...Ludlum and Harold Robbins are the worst case...of novels written by others, but using the originals name in order to merely make money.

Awful."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Although he died some five years ago, Robert Ludlum's name continues to sell books. Albeit current titles are often penned by anonymous writers, they continue in the vein of Ludlum's spy/suspense dramas that have fascinated millions. Such will be the case with The Ambler Warning.So, while the hardcovers are not original Ludlum's the Abridged and Unabridged audio books are originals by celebrated stage and screen actor Scott Sowers. His theater credits include A Streetcar Named Desire and Bus Stop; his TV appearances include Law & Order, The Jury, and NY Undercover. With a distinctive voice and drama training Sowers presents an intense, well grounded reading of this thriller.Hero Hal Ambler is kept in a drugged state, imprisoned in a psychiatric facility on one of Virginia's coastal islands. This is a place where former government workers are trapped in \\"deep storage,\\" deemed irrational, far too dangerous to live among society. However, Ambler isn't a run-of-the-mill inmate, he's quite sane.When a nurse is moved to help him, Ambler makes an escape intent upon finding out who he is and who he was. Why has his government kept him captive and why are there no records that he ever existed?Those who might help him suddenly die, and the outside world seems made up of deadends.Spy/thriller aficionados will find this to their liking.

Listening for the redundancy of words was actually far more interesting than the contrived, lengthy, silly plot."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I'm shocked by the other reviews! I enjoyed this book, although some of the writing was choppy and under-developed. Is it the best book I've ever read? NO! But was it entertaining and engaging? Yes!After reading the other reviews, I plan to read other books by this author... I'll be interested to see if there truly is a difference."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Who am I? Where am I? And why are they constantly drugging me? That's pretty much the starting point of this book about Hal Ambler. A spy novel from Robert Ludlum extremely well written with a relatively simple plot and an ending that you're not going to expect.Once our main character clears from the drugged haze and remembers bits and pieces of his former life as a spy--and he remembers his name, he finds that the entire world has no record of him existing and no one knows him. His old College yearbook doesn't have a Hal Ambler. His old college roommate never heard of him... Flawed memory in our hero or world class conspiracy?? Read the book to see!I just listened to the UnAbridged version of the book--all 14 CDs worth of contents. OK, it took me about 3 weeks to get thru it, but, it was worth it!"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"This book is absolutely horrible. I have read many Ludlum novels and while they are all over the top with reagards to the superhero powers of their main characters, they are entertaining. This one is NOT.It centers around Harrison Ambler who is held in a government psychiatric hospital, escapes in the first chapter and then proceeds to discover that he does not exist. It's a slight twist on the Bourne idea. In this case, Ambler remembers who he is, but there is no record of him anywhere; even his face is not recognizable to himself. Ambler then goes on for the rest of the book trying to find out who he really is.The story bounces back and forth among various parties (Ambler, the Chinese, the assasin) with no real congruity. I am constantly asking \\"what the heck is going on?\\". I have been listening to the story on CD and I sometimes blank out on entire chapters and find it makes no difference. There is no real \\"goal\\" or mission that Ambler is on other than trying to find out who he really is. And I think that is precisely what makes the story so boring. No path. No direction.Skip this one. It simply is not worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Loved this book. This author does a great job of keeping your interest and getting inside the mind of the characters."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Having not read a Ludlum in many years, I picked up this book not knowing the real Ludlum was dead. A couple of chapters into it, and I wondered why Ludlum would write this book. I figured he must have had a tight deadline and therefore just rushed it through. The plot was very thin and had gaps where it seemed that the author just couldn't be bothered to write the section. For example when Ambler, disguised as a guard escapes onto a boat, he is given a pistol by another guard. And the scene ends... Ambler is next found on land and in the city. So it's left up to your imagination to figure out what happened on the boat... Not that I don't have an imagination and couldn't figure it out but it just seemed like the author didn't want to write the section detailing what happens. And that's when I started wondering about who actually wrote this book but I kept reading...and it got worse...The Ambler character meets up with the nurse who gave him her pass so he could escape. And in a paragraph (maybe two) she has become his soulmate and they're in love. He doesn't grill her about why she gave him the pass, or what she know about his file, no, instead they talk about her marriage, her past life etc.. and they run off together... and the plot got worse..I won't read any more Robert Ludlum, unless it's one he actually wrote.

First I did not realize this author is dead. I do not that Ludlum has some good books, so I will go look for some of his older novels.The first part of this book was awesome. Than it dragged and dragged and dragged. I knew who the real killer was and was not surprised by the ending. Also, some of the story line was so confusing, or maybe I was just bored."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Sometimes Less is More. The first 200 or so pages were vintage Ludlum, then the new \\"ghost\\" writer took the reins and I though I was reading a Matt Reilly \\"how to cram as much action and killing as possible in a book that makes no sense\\". The central thesis was well crafted in the beginning and reminded me of the Bourne trilogy. Unfortunately, the plot deteriorated and required a scorecard to keep track of all the characters and sub plots. The Chinese assassin should have been developed more and when he was killed off I had to stop reading and say, \\"What was that all about\\"? The twists and turns came so fast and at times were gratuitous. Mr. ghost writer seemed determined to cram as many assassins as he could into the remaining 300 pages of the book; which made the plot turbid. FINALLY, the book reached a slipshod conclusion-most competent readers will long before figure out the surprise ending(?). And then there was the final boat fishing scene on the lake!! What was that all about? OK, now I have a few questions that the book conveniently or should I say incomprehensibly LEFT OUT: 1. WHAT WAS HAL AMBLER'S REAL NAME? Was meeting his old college buddy suppose to clean up all those hundreds of loose ends? 2. What happened to Laurel? Maybe she is back a Parrish Island in ward 4W? 3. Does Ambler(?) still work at the whatever.Ah, loose ends. Mr. Ludlum would never have left so many. So please no more psuedo-Ludlum books. Please be kind to his memory."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"This is the first book I didn't finish. I always finish books, slightly feeling like I can't read a different book until I read the one I've started. But there's a first for everything.The Ambler Warning starts out with Ambler in some kind of mental hospital/prison where he has been for about 4 years, never interacting with anyone but doctors and some nurses. His memory is now pretty shaky and he hasn't even seen his own face during this time. He's been put here as some kind of cover-up that only Ludlum can imagine. He conveniently makes friends with the medication nurse who helps him escape. True to Ludlum style, Ambler finds this nurse after he escapes and they run off together (after she throws herself at him) on an adventure to discover his past, who sent him to the mental hospital, why was he sent there, and how he's going to clear his name. Of course, the two shack up together (I have serious problems with how Ludlum writes women in his all of his books, but that's a whole other problem.) While Jason Bourne is the \\"chameleon\\", Ambler has the \\"super power\\" of observation. **That is the only really cool thing about this book.** He can \\"see\\" if someone is lying. He can \\"see\\" through people. Is this why he was locked up? memory changed? appearance changed?The sequence of events are all too convenient. Anytime Ambler or someone else is close to seeing that \\"Wow, Ambler has been set up\\" they get killed. I read the first 3/4 of the book. I only read that much just because I wanted to see how it ended and to just see it end. But, I was just board with it. The book could have easily been half the size and it would have been a much better book. Ludlum just fills the book with so much that when Ambler \\"discovers\\" certain facts, the reader already saw this coming forever ago. The \\"twist\\" that everyone talks about was so obvious--I asked my husband who had read it if I was correct, and was. Then I put the book down and moved."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I bought this thinking it was, at the very least, an unfinished Ludlum novel. Boy was I disappointed! I had no idea 'authors', who are either in witness protection or too ashamed to use their real names, were allowed to peddle books using Ludlum's good name??? Aside from the cliched opening escape and the highly predictable ending, the author of 'The Ambler Warning' seems to want to impress his/her readers by using dozens upon dozens of the most obscure and arcane words he/she can find in his/her thesaurus. Now I have a pretty good vocabulary, but having to put this book down every 10-15 minutes to look up words just made the reading experience annoying. I, for one, will not read/purchase another novel not written by the master himself!"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I'm enjoying the audio version of this novel. The narrator (Scott Sowers) has a pleasant voice and he isn't bad at the foreign accents or women's voices. I don't expect an audio book to be \\"performed\\"- but just read well, so I'm satisfied. My main complaint so far isn't due to the narrator. The writer uses the same phrases way too many times: \\"It was madness!\\", \\"Madness!\\", and so on. Not my favorite, but I'd probably listen to it again."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I have only read one other Ludlum book and I thought it was actually very good. I understand that Ludlum passed away a while ago and did not even write this one. That aside, the book is an intriguing read overall with a decent plotline and interesting, if somewhat superficial, characters. My big concern with this writing is that it often becomes bogged down in arcane detail which can go on for pages. Many of these sections add nothing to the plot or character development and seemingly exist to add bulk to the book. At times I got the impression the author was just trying to impress me with how much he knows about various topics. I don't mind at all when novels are based on historical fact and rooted in the real world, in fact I prefer it, but if I want to read a textbook I'll buy one or take a class. Overall, this gets three stars for a well-developed plot and fine characters; it's not for everybody though and is by no means a great book."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Parrish Island is located six miles off the coast of Virginia and, while it is officially home to a nature reserve, it more truthfully plays host to a maximum security psychiatric facility. However, given that its patients are ex-state agents with their heads full of highly classified information, it isn't too surprising the facility's existence is kept highly secret. Who actually sets foot on the island is strictly controlled : no birdwatchers are allowed to visit the 'nature reserve', the patients receive no visitors and all staff members thoroughly vetted. Hal Ambler, who is known to officials only as Patient 5312, is one of the few to be kept in isolation - a privilege reserved only for the especially dangerous, or those is possession of particularly sensitive information. The problem for Ambler is that, despite his presence at the facility, there isn't anything wrong with him.Ambler hasn't any idea how long he's been at Parrish Island for, nor even why he's been interred there - he suspects he's there as a prisoner, rather than for any legitimate treatment. Naturally, he's desperate to escape...something that was never going to be easy to accomplish. He's widely viewed by the staff as a lifer, while nothing in his cell could be adapted for use as a weapon - no mirrors, not even a pen or a pencil. However, things change when he manages to connect with a young nurse called Laurel Holland. She proves crucial to his eventual escape - she switches his medication, which allows him to stay alert, provides him with a very useful keycard and tips him off about a boat leaving the island. Ambler's escape, naturally, is successful...however, his problems are far from over. Nobody from his former life recognises him, he can't find any official records of his existence...and, most worryingly, he doesn't recognise the face he sees when he looks in the mirror. It's clear that somebody with a great deal of influence has pulled a great many strings to make all this happen - so it's no surprise that the country's forces, including the CIA, aren't long in trying to track him down. Clayton Caston, a very senior CIA operative who spends much of his his time behind a desk, is central to their investigation. Caston is underestimated by many within the organisation - however, once again, he has a key role to play. Unfortunately, the country's legitimate state forces aren't alone in pursuing Ambler...Hal, understandably, wants to find out exactly what has happened to him and who is responsible - and his past as a Consular Operations operative will prove very helpful in achieving that goal. The tricky part, naturally, will be finding the people who can answer his questions. What had made Ambler so very useful was his ability to 'read' people - he knew when they were telling the truth, he knew when they were lying, he knew when they were relaxed, tense or presenting a front...and he always got it right. However, he was no diplomat : he was a dangerous individual who specialised in very lethal missions. (The details of his last mission, in Taiwan , only come back gradually as the book progresses).An enjoyable book overall - though, after having thrown in so much detail during the book, the ending felt strangely rushed. I a little afraid things would descend to a Dan Brown novel...though I really needn't have worried. The writing's much better than that - even with the book being, at best, only partly written by Ludlum - and there aren't any ludicrous claims."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Twists and turns from the beginning and a surprise ending make this a book worth reading. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"This book was hard to put down and almost always kept me on the edge of my seat. The author does a very good job of building up the anticipation; having several different story lines going that gradually converge, providing some answers, leaving others unanswered until you get further along in the book. I wouldn't call it \\"great\\" but do call it \\"very good\\"."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"While the overall storyline of The Ambler Warning and The Bourne Identity may be different, the outline is a bit TOO similar for me to take it very serious. Okay, by now us Ludlum fans ALL know he died and that the last half-dozen novels have been penned by people OTHER than the unbelievably talented REAL author...some have actually been quite good (The Jansen Directive and the Sigma Protocol are but 2 examples) but come ON...just how long are the publishers going to continue this charade?? It insults Ludlum's vast fan-base and worse yet, insults the memory of in my opinion, the greatest Cold War Spy novelist of all-time.I could go on and on about the plot of the story, but other's have sufficiently gone down that path that I don't feel the need to go over the same territory...with that said, I DO have something good to say about this story: For those who read this book KNOWING it WASN'T written by Robert Ludlum, and do their best NOT to judge it by the master's previous works, I believe that one could actually enjoy 'The Ambler Warning'. Again--this task is easier said than done, but it IS possible. As I sat down to write this review, I originally felt it deserved just 2 stars--and THAT was generous, but that was when I was comparing it to Ludlum's work. As a totally original spy novel unrelated to him, I would almost rate it 4 stars (ALMOST)...I split and gave it 3. I'll let you make your opinion, but again, just don't expect anything near to the past fantastic works of the late, great Robert Ludlum and this book may actually be worth reading...just remember, opinions vary."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I'm extremely shocked by some of the bad reviews on this site, as I thought \\"The Ambler Warning\\" was a really exciting, well-written, interesting read! While I have only read a few of Ludlum's books in the past, I thought this was on par, if not better than the earlier ones I have read.After narrowly escaping from a secure and secret facility for psychotic and/or mentally ill former intelligence officers, Hal Ambler must figure out who he is, who put him in the facility, who are the people after him, and most importantly, why. The book is extremely fast-paced and full of twists and turns you just don't see coming.I HIGHLY recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Ludlum's books!"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I thought that this book was very fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the book. It is a very well planned out suspence, with a great jump start to the story. I wished it ended a little different but then again I always want the books I read to last forever.Great read and buy, you should enjoy the action."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Hal Ambler is patient number 5312 at a maximum-security government psychiatric hospital. Who imprisoned him there and why?Although the ending should be obvious by the time you get there, I found this an intense read. I was thrown once when a wrong name was used. Surprised neither the author nor editor caught this obvious error.The detail of locations and equipment was very precise. Either the author knows a lot about covert equipment and has been all around the globe or does a good job making his details sound believeable."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I'm a person who, once I've begun a book, keeps thinking it's going to get better so I tend not to give up...but I skipped most of the last 1/3 of this mess without losing the drift and by the time I put it down wished I'd never picked it up.The author should be ashamed and so should the decision makers for the Ludlum Estate to have perpertrated such a fraud on Mr. Ludlum's fans. The glaring errors in the first fifty or sixty pages are enough to make the whole plot suspect and the author, whomever he/she may be, uses the word 'madness' so many times the reader begins to cringe at it's appearance.The 'surprise' ending is predictable, the character(s) is unsympathetic and there are so many bad guys and agencies involved, I lost track of who/which was who/which.Don't waste your time...find a new (living) author!"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Publishing this book was a shameful marketing attempt to cash in on Robert Ludlum's name. This unsatisfying book was very boring and left many loose ends, certainly nowhere near the exceptional writing and high standards of the legendary Ludlum."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I understand that people feel betrayed, etc. I had no idea who Ludlum was, this was just somehow at the top of the stack of paperbacks that have been waiting around a few years to be read.I started in and was soon fascinated by Hal Ambler's identity crisis. What does it mean to be me? And then all of his adventures skirting so-called \\"security\\", that was very enjoyable. And, my gosh, when do we have a zero-knowledge proof figuring into a story?It was so enjoyable (not deep, just enjoyable) that I took the train two days in order to finish it off!"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Robert Ludlum is the bar that most writers who work in the international espionage/thriller genre' set their mark to. As a writer, I fall into this catagory. In 'The Ambler Warning' the team that has been left to maintain the Grand Master's estate, have followed course in focussing on currency and interconnected geopolitical plots that are very real and pressing in today's enviornment. And this, giving attention of the real world through the art of historical current fiction storytelling, is what Robert Ludlum did best through his cleverly crafted stories.The reviews across the board are somewhat varied; however, their is no denying that if a reader engages in the thesis of the story regarding the sleeping giant that is China, and how its growing resource consumption rate has and will significantly increase world agendas, then 'The Ambler Warning' does its job in spades. Critically, the reader should look through some of the more lengthy passages of this story, focussing on the political issues presented. A big bonus is that the writer (s?) of this novel do include some real interesting historical facts that support the action and movement of the story. The one writing liberty taken by the author that was hard to believe, and so , gave immediate reason to have suspecion was the somewhat immediate acceptance of Ambler to those he surrounded himself by (I do not want to make a direct statement here). Overall, I enjoyed this book very much. Educational, interesting, and filled with some nicely created characters, this story keeps the living tradition of Robert Ludlum alive and well."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Ambler is reminiscient of some of the original Ludlum stories, especially The Bourne Identity. A spy's mind is majorly mucked up by a Top Secret U.S. agency, the spy gets second thoughts during an operation and so he becomes a \\"liability.\\" Much mayhem involving firearms and martial arts ensues.There isn't much in the way of surprises -- the means of Ambler's escape, for example, is fairly obvious from the beginning -- but Ambler is still a fairly enjoyable read. Ambler using his unique ability to get himself through sticky situations is fun to read about. This book not a real page-turner, but the book is a quick and easy read if you have a couple of hours to kill."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Like the James Bond novels that still pop up thirty years after the demise of Ian Flemming, Ludlum has become an icon. His name alone sells books and we are seemingly getting two or three new ones a year written by different authors. None of these have really been very good, and though The Ambler Warning is one of the better ones, it is still stale.The whole book lacks a sense of suspense or a frantic need to discover that is so prevalent in Ludlums best books. Instead Hal Ambler, the hero here, is introduced to us as the drugs he has been assaulted with for two years to keep him under control begin to wear off. Immediately he escapes from a secret maximum security mental hospital and one action scene with gun toting tough guys follows another.The whole spin on this story is that Ambler's identity has been erased. He has no idea why, and different shadow organizations are competing to hire or kill him as he tries to understand his past. Also in the mix are a couple of lounging analysts who work in the higher echelons of the government on a covert basis. The story skips back and forth from Ambler to these two and back.I really didn't appreciate very much here. The story is almost a direct rip off of the Bourne Identity with small alterations. The prose as I said before, is dead. I did not care if Hal Ambler found out who he was or not, and fights or gun battles felt like they were getting in the way instead of adding tension. Its sort of like when you watch a really bad movie and you start getting a head ache during the tenth overblown gun fight and you want to hurry through it because its just stupid.This is a bad book. Read Bourne Identity. Much better."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"This posthumously published book of Ludlum is interesting andkeeps you turning the pages, but the ending is weak and entirelyunbelievable. I don't know who thought this would work, but turningthe entire story on its head to make a \\"surprise ending\\" really doesn'tdo the truck."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I made it through this book but just barely. About a hundred pages from the end the author had telegraphed the ending so badly I just thought, \\"You have GOT to be kidding! He wouldn't really do that, would he?\\" I then did something that I never do: I turned to the end of the book and, sure enough, the \\"surprise\\" ending was no surprise at all.And the main character's real name should be Rambler not Ambler because every time we turn around he's going on and on about how much he LOVES the woman he met a few days earlier. This is a 40 year old man with nerves of steel? Particularly jarring was this sequence when they are tensely preparing for a major Op:Ambler nodded but said nothing; the simple act of speaking was now an effort. In the next small sliver of time, he would succeed or he would fail. It was as simple as that.\\"We've got two cameras here. Got you one with a 48X optical zoom.\\" She handed him the bulky camera, which was secured to a folding tripod. Both were a sort of drab green.\\"Thanks,\\" he said. He meant, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF.\\"Think he'll be seated in front?\\"\\"Could be...\\"Come again? Did I just read in italics: \\"I love you more than life iteself\\" in the middle of a conversation about cameras?Here's another gem:\\"Thank God you're safe, my darling, my love,\\" she said quietly. \\"Thank God you're safe.\\"\\"You're so beautiful.\\" He spoke the thought aloud without consciously intending to. My Ariadne.\\"Let's just leave,\\" she said, a sudden wild sense of hope transforming her features. \\"Let's just ski down that mountain and never look back.\\"\\"Laurel,\\" hea said.\\"Just us,\\" she said. \\"What happens will happen. We'll have each other.\\"\\"Soon,\\" he said. \\"In just a few hours.\\"Without giving away whether they lived happily ever after or parted tearfully, for all of the tedious effort devoted to the romance, at the end of the book not a single word was expended resolving the relationship or any of his deep, abiding feelings for Laurel. The whole romance felt like a simple plot device trotted out for awhile and then hastily shut in a closet when it was no longer needed.This was generally a disappointing book. I agree with other reviewers that the first half was better than the second."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I bought this book believing it was written by Robert Ludlum. After the first few chapters I thought Mr. Ludlum must have been having a bad book day, because it didn't live up to his prior novels. The excitement and anticipation for the reader just wasn't there. But I kept plodding along, get more and more frustrated. Then I did what I should have done BEFORE I purchased the book. I went back to Amazon and read the reviews and realized I was reading something written by a ghost writer. Then it all made sense -- the unnecessary descriptions, the repetitive verbage, and an extremely slow moving plot line. So, I put the book away. I'll leave it on the shelf for awhile, then I'll go back and read it with a fresh perspective and the knowledge that it was written by an author I've never read before. I'll probably enoy it then, but right now it's a big dissapointment."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died. About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile. It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher! Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious. I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore. Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"If you were a Ludlam fan, and begin reading this book, you will be reminded immediately that he is dead.How sad that a byline has turned into a trademark.If you have a distaste for subtlety, and prefer ideas repeated and underlined in red, buy this book.Shameful exploitation of a decent name."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Ludlum never fails to write a great story with good twists. Just enough description to let you \\"see\\" the action."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"We've all read stories by dead authors. Up until now, however, the ones I've read had been written while their authors were still alive. It's not at all clear how much direction from beyond the grave Robert Ludlum gave to his literary estate and its chosen ghostwriter on this effort, but it was enough to produce a readable and satisfying yarn. One wonders whether Ludlum chose the name for his title character as a nod to his colleague in Trench Coat Heaven.Like countless other spy heroes, Hal Ambler has been cast onto the secret agent's scrap heap: in this case, a psychiatric facility on a fortress island off the outer banks. After making his improbable escape, Ambler discovers he is a man without an identity in the classic spy thriller identity theft mode. This is a problem no one else seems to have, since his existence is well-known to several different factions who track him in an effort either to kill him or to enlist him in a shadowy plot that somehow harkens back to his past life.Not every cliche is employed in this story, but certainly enough of them are to give the reader a sense of deja vu that is even stronger than any experienced by Ambler. The characters are all pretty much stock types, and the dips and twists in the story call to mind a ride on a roller coaster that you haven't ridden in a long time: you know there are twists, you know there are turns; you know there are dips that are designed to put your heart in your mouth. You just don't remember quite where they are, and so are just a bit surprised when they materialize.Not great art, but not bad for a dead man."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"My two favorite Ludlum novels (written by Ludlum or others) are The Bourne Identity and The Ambler Warning, in that order.I've read the novel multiple times and decided to get the abridged audiobook so I could listen to it again during my daily commute.In general, Ludlum's books are a bit long for me. I was curious to see how this one would hold up to losing some fat. I was very pleased. The story moved along at a better pace than in the original, full-length novel. 99% of the key scenes remained, as well as clues you might not realize are clues the first time you experience the story. One key scene when Ambler recalls a meeting he interrupted wasn't included. Leaving this bit out may cause the listener to wonder how the protagonists made an important connection between other characters in the story.Scott Sowers' reading pulled me into the story and kept me listening. I almost wanted to keep driving around just to listen a little longer-and that's after I've already read the book more than once!I consider The Ambler Warning a cross betweenThe Bourne Identity: A Noveland the tv seriesThe Prisoner: The Complete Series. Highly recommended to fans of spy thrillers."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring. I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar.Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, \\"There is NO way he'll get out of this\\" or \\"That would never happen.\\" I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a \\"spy\\" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief. However, this one passed those limits."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I thought this book was pretty cool. I wanted to be the main character or at least have his abilities.

The Ambler Warning was fragmented and disjointed."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"This is the first Ludlum novel I've read. Having been a fan of other authors such as Tom Clancy, Vince FLynn, and others, this novel was a real page turner.

Don't get me wrong; Ludlum was the master of the spy thriller, and his books were packed with intrigue, but he never mastered the art of fleshing out his characters. They never seemed real to me. The unknown writer of The Ambler Warning doesn't make that mistake, however. I felt that his/her characters were very accessible, especially the title character and that of his adversary-turned-sidekick, Clay Caston. And the twist ending, where the killer's identity is revealed, completely surprised me. Not what I was expecting. And isn't that the biggest thing you can ask of a good thriller novel; to be kept in suspense right up until the end? Hats off to the mystery writer here. This was an excellent book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I really enjoyed this book. If you like spy thrillers you will love this book.

I don't want to give away the plot so I'm not going to say any more except--read this book, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"First, did you know that Robert Ludlum is DEAD -- yes he died in 2001 -- but his name or at least the book franchise lives on. Remember The Bourne Identity -- how fabulous he was/how great the conspiracy/intrigue and doublebind of the agent himself. Well, I started this book and got involved...and then it started to fall apart-- first of all, it's too long! 489 pages -- maybe a 100 pages too long. Second the ending is a bit hard to fanthom. The lead character Hal Ambler is overshadowed by a CIA beancounter Clayton Caston and his assistant Adrian-- operating from the back corners of the CIA where the real rogues are caught not by gunfire and doubletalk but by an expense form that hides too much or a supply invoice that shows too much toilet paper being used daily (a real example in the book-- trust me it will make you chuckle. Anyway Caston is a gem of a character -- in fact not unlike Columbo he might make a great lead for an upcoming book series. Some of the stuff is just hard to fanthom -- oh yes let's buy a passport off the street in the Bronx and put in your partner Laurel's photo. Hmm what about computers at the airport which will scan the ID number and find that the passport is stolen or doesn't match the picture etc-- okay so I'll suspend disbelief. It was a hot weekend here in Los Angeles and the trip the book took me from an island off of Virginia (the CIA psych facility) to Paris to DAVOS Switzerland was kind of fun...loved the descriptions of Davos and the VIPs there...lots of Chinese intrigue too-- notice how since the fall of the Berlin Wall the Chinese are always the bad guys-- they're not here--ooops is that a spoiler? Anyway, we never get to know Ambler because of course his identy has been erased....but tha's what the story was all about...the 80's spy novel doesn't really hold up in a new century...and the editor should keep a bit more current on references unless the audience is all over 50? And maybe they are-- KPMG is no longer the name of a big consulting firm -- Elizabeth Taylor's marriages reference are a bit dated....you have to kind of just go along for the ride....the ingenuity of these spies inspires you to just live day to day -- okay so I finished it in two days -- but I really didn't have anything else to read around here....okay it was pretty good...that's the best you get from me. But what about that beancounter--isn't that a cool idea-- a beancounter turned spy...and that Adrian Choi guy -- I'll bet he's a cool looking dude...how sweet that could be....say St. Martin's press how about an option and advance on that for this reviewer????"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"The publisher, St. Martin's Press, oughta be indicted. Secreted inside the book is the info that Ludlum is dead and they've dug up someone called Myn Pyn, who I suspect just graduated from a third-rate writing school.

This would be a great candidate for a Reader's Digest Condensed book, simply because they could remove all the irrelevant political diatribe about imaginary people in imaginary governments that don't matter to the story anyway, and have a nice short story.Very long, and about 75% of the book is totally irrelevant to the story."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Most authors do their best work when living.

I won't recap the plot, others have done that, but the epilog that tried to make everything end nicely felt forced and wasn't true to the rest of the story. New facts were introduced to make it seem ok, but there was very little groundwork laid in the actual story to support it. The Bourne Identity did something similar, but did it much better. I'd have preferred a less happy but more honest ending (like the one Kyle Mills did in his book FADE)."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Robert Ludlum lives on, at least in spirit. The latest work to be issued under his name, THE AMBLER WARNING, is a ghostwritten homage not only for Ludlum but also for Eric Ambler, a departed author who arguably is the father of 20th century espionage fiction. The Ambler of the novel, however, refers to a very confused man named Hal Ambler, who is in the middle of a major identity crisis.THE AMBLER WARNING opens at a clandestine psychiatric facility on a restricted-access island just off the coast of Virginia, within spitting distance of Langley. The facility ostensibly treats intelligence agents who may know too much or who are too dangerous to leave wandering among the general populace. One of these patients is Hal Ambler, who is kept heavily medicated and guarded at all times. When a hospital worker helps him escape, Ambler doesn't think twice before jumping, and almost immediately reverts to form in utilizing the training and skills that ultimately got him hospitalized in the first place.Ambler's immediate goal is to determine who caused him to be hospitalized, and why. There's one problem, however: Ambler does not exist. There is no record of him anywhere. Worse, when he looks in the mirror, he doesn't recognize the man he sees looking back. What Ambler does uncover, though, is that someone is attempting to frame him for the murders of foreign heads of state, with a most significant one being ready to occur within a rather short period of time. Ambler, with the might and majesty of the U.S. intelligence service hunting him, finds a couple of unlikely allies, including an agency number-cruncher who is able to extrapolate conclusions from raw data with extremely accurate results.Ambler himself has an amazing ability as well, one that permits him to read an individual's facial expressions and body language with unerring accuracy and thus determine their true intent and motivation; Ambler is, in other words, a veritable truth detector. But as he races to prevent an assassination that will have worldwide repercussions, Ambler discovers that everything he has come to believe may be wrong after all --- and the stakes are too high for error.THE AMBLER WARNING is reminiscent of the works of both its namesake and of Ludlum, though it is not quite the equal of either. It does, however, serve as a fine introduction for those unfamiliar with those works actually written by Ludlum during his lifetime. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its conclusion. Those of a particular geopolitical bent could argue, quite correctly, that the good guys lost; for readers who keep abreast of world politics and economics, the ending will provide a number of elements for discussion.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Super book with different exciting elements that kept you guessing and wondering about what was going to happen next, then a great ending .............."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"A remote psychiatric hospital off the coast of Virginia is the opening setting of this thriller by Robert Ludlum. Confined there are former CIA agents and other government operatives gone awry. Their knowledge of classified government information is too sensitive to be left to chance in non-secure facilities.When a friend mentioned this book I was reminded of my introduction to Ludlum via \\"The Osterman Weekend\\". I bought \\"Osterman\\" on a whim on a Saturday in the mid 1980s and started reading it late that afternoon. I finished it about 6:00AM the following morning. I just could not put it down. Ludlum's story captivated me and the fast paced action kept me hooked till I finished.When I encountered \\"The Ambler Warning\\" I was aware that Ludlum had passed and that this book was one of the unfinished manuscripts he left behind. Thus another writer and editor had been hired to finish it. Still I had hope that this might be a worthwhile read. At first I felt the old excitement of Ludlum in the plot. I was drawn in immediately and the pace was fast. The unnamed writer clearly has skills and a broad vocabulary that is used well. The sentence \\"In fact, the efflorescence of xenophobia might actually have been good for America\\" from page 438 is a case in point.The character of Hal Ambler, and his rare gift of being able to read people so well, is interesting. However, somewhere along about midpoint of the book I began to feel a sense waning interest. I am still not sure exactly why. The plot is certainly good and the twist at the end, while not completely unexpected, was not too obvious either.So why did Osterman work so well and Ambler leave me wanting? I think the answer lies with the different skill of the two writers. Ludlum knew how to tell a story with pace and ever increasing tension. In his best efforts he could hook the reader early and keep the tension up till conclusion. The ghost writer is certainly skilled and uses an extensive vocabulary very well. However, he (or she) is just slightly less adept at maintaining tension in the story line. Thus, I found myself persevering to finish the book but when done I felt a less complete sense of satisfaction with the read than I did from Ludlum's writing. Having said that though I did put aside two other books I was reading in order to finish \\"Ambler\\".The Parrish Island setting and secret facility for the confinement of CIA agents gone rogue was an interesting premise. The escape by Ambler, the quest for his identity and release from the tyranny visited upon him by those in power is an engaging proposition. Ultimately, even Ambler's discovery of those who put him in confinement (and visited some psychiatric horrors on him) is personally frustrating for Ambler as the twist at the end reveals even more treachery than we had come to expect.Ultimately, I felt the thriller worth reading but it could have been even better if the unnamed author had been able to fully sustain and even raise the tension of suspense as the book progressed."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"The hero, graced by an uncanny knack for detecting liars, meets his match in the beautiful anti-heroine who helps him escape from a veritable psychological prison and leads him inexorably toward a doom planned for him by a sinister consular operations security official operating under the influence of her graduate school advisor, an aging political and historical theorist. The theorist wants to maintain American greatness by fomenting war. The catalyst is to be the assassination of the Chinese head of state at the annual international finance meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The hero who is to be the fall guy for this assassination is led inexorably to his demise by his lover, the beautiful anti-heroine, a drug addict and brilliant method actress working for the security official and her advisor.Thrown into the mix of action characters and sinister plotters is a senior financial auditor from the CIA with a decidedly dogged determination to uncover misdeeds by examining financial records. When the hero and the auditor team up in an uneasy combination of action and cerebral analysis, the dialog becomes quite interesting and, of course, the good guys win due to the unbeatability of the duo.What is most enticing about this novel is the way the author gives us all of the clues but keeps us from really understanding what is going on until just about the end, when the topsy turvey world rights itself and the day is saved. Five stars for the clever plot, one star demerit for the overdone romantic reflections of the hero, another star demerit for a fair amount of belabored text which is just fluff and filler, plus one star for some interesting political reflections.

The poor guy has long passed and the books keep churning out by ghost writers. Some are good...and some not so much. This is one of the not so much variety.This story tries unsuccessfully to recreate the basic Bourne concept. A super-duper spy guy assassin with memory loss. He's not sure who the real person inside him is. Past that, it's standard spy fare. Big conspiracy plot, corrupt government officials, and other spy template stuff.

It would've been better to go re-read one of the Bourne trilogy."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Disappointing book. I've like many of Ludlum's books over the years but this one isn't very good. It begins similarly to the Bourne Identity but instead of waking up on a beach without knowing what has happened Hal Ambler wakes up in a psyche hospital. At times the writing is exciting but then it just slows and is downright boring. I stuck with it and had it \\"figured out\\" early on. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Because Ludlum is my favorite author, I was disappointed to see a publisher use Ludlum's name without providing the true author's name and produce mediocre work. Bottom line, this book lacked the terrific content that you would find in a typical Ludlum novel. It was so cut-up that the book lacked any continuity to previously described incidents within the book. Furthermore, the true author spent more than half the book describing surroundings and things that had nothing to do with the plot. Out of boredom, I found myself skipping parts and not skipping any of the plot. Its only redeeming factor is the surprising ending, even though it took the author less than three pages to cover it. It doesn't even compare to the last two Ludlum novels written by other identified authors. If I was the publisher, I would be ashamed to use Ludlum's name in this manner. But of course, Ludlum's name sells books. Alas!"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"This plot of this novel operates on several different levels - some of which are much more successful than others. Its primary goal is obviously simply to be an old fashioned conspiracy/action/international intrigue thriller in the tradition of Robert Ludlum, the creator and all time master of the genre. Through the person of the central character Harrison (Hal) Ambler it also asks the existential question, what constitutes evidence of the person who we believe ourselves to be? And concomitantly, what constitutes proof of our sanity. Furthermore, it has elements of romantic tension between Ambler and Laurel Holland, whose fate becomes inextricably interwoven with Ambler's own attempts to penetrate the veil of his own identity while eluding the pursuers intent on his murder following his \\"beyond salvage\\" designation. It also allows the wonderful character development of Clayton Gaston, the CIA analyst who operates in the lowest decile of empathy for his fellow human being and is much more at home in the world of abstract analysis and mathematical deduction than in his own home interacting with his family. Lastly, the conversations and actions of the characters on topics as diverse and the emergence of China as a superpower to brainwashing techniques (and the manufacture of memory vignettes) and as seemingly far afield as the relevant inclusion of Theseus and Ariadne provides the author considerable time to thoroughly expound on esoteric topics which lend authenticity to the tale. Perhaps my favorite was the appropriate inclusion of (and the development of the analogy of present day events to) the Chinese legend of \\"the man of ancient times, who set up shop in a village selling both a spear he said would penetrate anything and a shield he claimed nothing could penetrate\\".We meet Ambler while he is a patient in a heavily guarded psychiatric on Parrish Island, Va. He is convinced of his own sanity, and with Laurel Holland's aid accomplishes a daring escape. However, his life soon spirals out of control, and he is forced to rely on his training as a clandestine operative to repeatedly escape his pursuers. Revise and improvise is his mantra, and while it enables him to stay alive he is completely stonewalled during every attempt to make a connection with his previous identity. In this regard, Ambler's problem is in some ways the exact opposite of Jason Bourne in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, perhaps Ludlum's most recognized novel. Bourne had to continually elude his potential killers/captors while trying to overcome his amnesia and discover his identity. Ambler firmly believes in his own identity but all objective evidence contradicts his memories of his past life. One common thread is their history as deep cover operatives and the survival skills which they possess. The other is the duplicity of their government handlers and their willingness to sacrifice them to their larger political purposes. (This is consistent with Ludlum's recurring major theme, one man or a small group of individuals against a larger and more powerful group able to use the machinery of government to its benefit.)While I enjoyed this book enough to rate it four stars, I can understand why it has received mixed reviews. First, I share the dismay of other reviewers that St. Martin's Press and the executors of Ludlum's estate continue to trade off Ludlum's name so shamelessly even while I recognize it is their right to do so. As I have indicated, this book has elements that are very Ludlumesque, but it would treat potential readers much more fairly to indicate whether it was simply inspired by Ludlum's tradition, or the plot outlined by him or if it was developed in consultation with him before his death, etc. Furthermore, while I have some guesses regarding potential authors/collaborators it bothers me that this fact is kept a mystery to the readers. Second, while the detailed informational asides actually enhanced my enjoyment of the story, these and some other elements certainly were stylistically very different from Ludlum's work. Third, while I was taken by complete surprise on some occasions (although I never felt that I was misled), a few plot twists were foreshadowed to a sufficient extent that the tension and surprise were somewhat mitigated for me. Finally, while most of my previously unanswered questions were explained during the conclusion or in the epilogue, there was one major point and minor point which continued to bother me. I cannot go into detail without providing spoilers, but I can say the source of Joe Li's information on Ambler's precise locations never became clear to me.In summary, my rating of this book is as a standalone novel, without reference or comparison to the works of Robert Ludlum. It is a better than average thriller despite its flaws. So, I suggest you read it and discover the true identity of undercover operatives Tarquin, Transcience, Osiris among the many interesting characters. Learn about the truly amazing and unique skill which Harrison Ambler possesses and which is the source of his extraordinary value to his employers. Finally by the end of the novel you will discover whether the following haunting and well known verse is actually symbolic of his existence:As I was going up the stairI met a man who wasn't there.He wasn't there again today.I wish, I wish he'd stay away.Is Harrison Ambler really there, and if so who is it who wishes that he was not?Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"The Ambler Warning is a readable, yet formulaic thriller. What it is most definitely not is the work of Robert Ludlum or any worthy inheritor.I was given this book under the pretense that it was pure Ludlum, simply published posthumously. Several pages in to the first chapter, I was sure this was a mistake. The author lacks Ludlum's gift for subtle, existential descriptions of characters, locales, and situations, which made one feel intimately aquainted, and instead relies on cold, sterile recitation of sensory details. Furthermore, Ludlum's twists and turns of plot often felt like speeding into a blind corner hiding a hairpin turn, those in The Ambler Warning were quite predictable, more like standing on level ground, watching the truck tha is going to hit you close in from a mile away. As an additional annoyance, the author seems to pay much more attention to technical detail, for example, a description of a sniper's tranquilizer rifle. Some may see this as an addition to authenticity, but since the details are not effectively worked in to the story line, it only makes the novel more standoffish.All in all, not a bad evening's diversion if you must, but there is definitely better out there."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Any modern writer who uses \\"My Darling\\" as an endearment should be strung up. I'm a strong proponent in SOD (suspension of disbelief) when it comes to written thrillers and movies, but from the initial Tylenol thing to the ending trigger thing, this piece of work pushed even my limits. It was whiny, highly unlikely, and, in the case of the audiobook reader, passionless, and highly undeserving of the Ludlum name. Skip this one and let Mr. Ludlum rest in peace.

My two major complaints.... 1) this author decides to use obscure words every couple of pages (likes that thesaurus apparently) when more common words would be fine, and certainly less distracting; and 2) the main character is the typical super-agent who you would think would know better than to think he'd be untraceable if he uses a computer to search the internet for secret answers (you guessed it - the bad guys trace the IP address and show up with guns blazing) - BUT THEN THIS SUPER-AGENT DOES THE SAME THING TWO MORE TIMES!

Until this point, I was happy with the collaborations and/or ghost authors that have continued in the spirit of the \\"Ludlum\\" style. This book, however, was so wordy and pontificating that I was annoyed rather than intrigued by the contents. The dialogue is stilted and uninspiring - in some cases verging on riduculous. The descriptions are endless and often meaningless to the story. It does not apprear that the author ever heard the advice given to novice authors: \\"Don't describe a rifle over the fire place unless it will be used somewhere in the story.\\" I found myself constantly asking myself \\"Wasn't there a seasoned book editor involved?\\" I have read worse books in my life, but if you are looking for a fast paced, entertaining spy thriller, there are better ones out there."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Not being aware that Mr. Ludlum had passed away, I eagerly purchased this book. What a disappointment! It's a shame to carry on his name in this fashion.In my opinion, the book was quite amateurish, slow and wordy for wordiness' sake (case in point - the meeting in the airport with the guy using (too many!) fractured idioms, e.g., \\"kill two fowl with one rock\\", \\"birds of the same plumage seek out one another's company\\", \\"all that coruscates (coruscates???) is not gold.\\") Also, as someone else mentioned, the editing seemed lacking (the gun that was seen beneath a bush, highly accessible, then later is was \\"completely inaccessible\\").I won't make the mistake again - there are much better choices around."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"A travesty on so many levels. First the ghost author tries to overcomplicate a plot making everything harder than it needs to be. Next he tries to impress us with the size of his dictionary - since no one would ever use so many obtuse words on a regular basis. To top it all off, the audiobook matches the level of ineptness. The reader is passionless, devoid of any ability as a storyteller. He is but a reader - and a bland one at that. I forced myself to stick it out to the end (only because I was painting the house and needed background noise). On occasion, the bookmark was lost and I debated whether is was worth going back to find my place. There is a reason this is headed for the bargain bin. Do yourself a favor - avoid it and go back and reread some of Ludlum's early stuff.

I've been a fan of Robert Ludlum books for years and have read every one. I've even enjoyed the Covert One Novels. But, I was pretty disgusted at having the Ambler Warning being passed off as a Robert Ludlum book. If the book is going to be targeted at Ludlum fans, and in the inside cover of the book, it mentions that the author was carefully selected, whoever was ultimately responsible for that selection must never have read a Ludlum book in their lives. Whoever was the author of the Ambler Warning clearly tries far far far too hard to project themselves as a high brow intellectual based upon the constant insertion of words like those, which Robert Ludlum would never ever ever use in one of his books. In the first several pages of the book, I counted numerous examples of words that I have never heard before in my 38 years of life. I read novels virtually every day, so my vocabulary is vast and yet somehow, this \\"carefully selected\\" author, that is supposed to carry on the tradition of Robert Ludlum, is able to find opportunities to inject those kinds of words at every turn of the page. In concept, the plot of the story and the way it unfolds was interesting, and if the book had not been passed off as a Robert Ludlum book, perhaps I would have rated it 2 stars instead of 1, but regardless, it is hard to enjoy reading a book if I have to pull out a dictionary just to understand what is being written."},{"Title":"Ambler Warning","review":"I regularly read thrillers, and was looking forward to this one.

This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.Two - The reasonable female.

I liked the way it started with a 'retired' agent locked up in a mental institution and kept drugged. I liked the way that he got out of the institution. Then it had the familiar Ludlum chase senario as he was running from people he didn't know, who wanted him for reasons he didn't know.

Throughout this short novel that covers a 3-day period in rainy cold Warsaw, we glean nothing but despair and cynicism every step of the way. The story begins with the two main characters arguing on the banks of the Vistula on a &quot;filthy day in May,&quot; a telling-enough detail: can anyone ever recall the month of May being described as &quot;filthy?&quot; (Perhaps it is in a figurative sense for anyone bred under Soviet communism: their month of May opened with the traditional May Day celebrations). Our heroine, Agnieszka, is arguing with her boyfriend Piotr because he wants to make love with her for the first time right then and there on the riverbank since &quot;there is no place on earth for lovers to go.&quot; Both Agnies and Piotr live in overcrowded tenements in true commmunist fashion, rubbing elbows with dispirted people everywhere. Agnies' mother is a bitter, hateful invalid, her father a prematurely aging man already focused on his own death. Her younger brother, Grzegorz, is also prematurely old and a defeated, cynical idealist. Her old brother, Zawadzki, is one of the few persons in the story holding onto any hope and keeps plugging away daily at his job as a laborer and says &quot;I want to believe in people.&quot; Agnies herself is jaded yet hopeful. She still believes in love &amp; romance, is at odds with her home environment and keeps studying away for a degree in philosphy at university. What she craves most of all, she tells Piotr, is &quot;peace and quiet.&quot; We seem to get to know Piotr the least. We know that he was in the armed forces and served time in prison for some type of political &quot;crime.&quot; The thread of the story shows how each character looks forward to Sunday, the 7th day of the week, for one reason for another. Agnies' father is to go on a much-anticipated fishing trip; Grzegorz's girlfriend is to give her decision whether to accept his proposal of marriage and Zawadzki anticipates a visit to his fiance on that day as well. True to the cynicism thru-out the story, nothing comes through on Sunday for any of them. Sunday dawns a sleeting, cold day no good for fishing or trips to see girlfriends. Perhaps the title of the book stems from these characters' desperate need for yet one more day in the week to achieve what they so desire? Sunday turns out to be a horrendous day--you must read what happens to everyone! When Monday morning finally dawns, and everyone falls back into their routine, gray existences. Piotr and Angies part ways, true to his earlier conviction that &quot;This is the 90th century. If Romeo and Juliet lived in Warsaw in 1956, they would never have met.&quot; Probably the sum of 8th Day can be read in Grzegorz's &quot;Cynicism is the sole morality&quot; but check out the last line in the book where Agnies' father is standing at the front door and remarks &quot;I wish it were Sunday.&quot; Translator Guterman did an upstanding job with this work, preserving the dozens of philosophical gems Hlasko packs onto every page."},{"Title":"The eighth day of the week","review":"Poland in the 60's.Characters drawned as with no illusions, a boy always drunken not to remember the present and the lack of love and understanding, his sister the only one who has sparkles of faith in the possibilities of humane changes, but at the end breaks down. On the background the system, the lack of morality that becames going over morality and only a try in surviving, no hope in joy. Everything seems to collapse, but at last Poland will remain the same, forever, for only humane beings will fall in dust, the spirit of the country'll remain the same, stifling and atrophying. The country survives because feeds on his inhabithans, on their blood and hopes.Hlasko recreates the disillusion himself lived, and died too early to realize that was right in his prophecy."},{"Title":"The eighth day of the week","review":"I am curious if the author titled this book &quot;The Eighth Day&quot; based on the Catholic/Christian reference to Sunday as the eighth day, the day of recreation. Be that as it may, the book has many merits - e.g. the way it makes the oppressive atmosphere tangible &quot;only with difficulty could she get the damp air into her lungs&quot;. The atmosphere is filled with disappointment, drunkeness, violence, self-pity and self-loathing. A few pages into the novel, I fully expected it to be good, maybe very good.Unfortunately, as the main character Agnieszka breaks in her own way, the plot fails ... there has not been sufficient psychological change to motivate the change in behavior.As an anti-Communist piece of Polish literature, the book is interesting; as a universal piece of humanity under repression it fails. I suspect, however, that the author's talent may have (or will) produced better works."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"As a fan of Bendis' 'Powers' line, I wanted to like this graphic novel, but I had to stop halfway because the story wasn't going anywhere. Sure, the characters are interested in a stash of money that some dead junkies spoke about, but there is nothing of high stakes really pushing this story.As another reviewer mentioned, the 'story' consists of individuals talking...and talking. Unfortunately, Bendis is trying to mimic real-world conversations, which doesn't always work well here. (Of note, there is a black character who happens to be a bounty hunter like the title character Jinx; unfortunately, Bendis decides to have this character speak stereotypically 'gangsta' which is particularly grating). Moreover, there is no one I can really root for in the story. Everyone seems to be self-pitying, or back-stabbing.Where he did a good job with 'Torso' and the aforementioned 'Powers,' I think Brian Michael Bendis misses the mark with this book."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"Yes,our Bounty Hunter heroine,Jinx,assumes the Lee Van Cleef role in a plot taken directly from Eastwood/Leones &quot;Good,Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot;. Well,the ending turns out a little different(and maybe that's the surprise for those who remember the Eastwood movie),but the dialogue here is great. Bendis is a lot stronger as a writer than an artist,and it shows in this volume. I really liked the 4 page spoof of Jinx as &quot;The Incredible Jinx&quot;,mocking the Hulk's short lived female counterpart. Bendis even has a page spoofing the Hostess ads found in mid-late 70s Marvel comics! Bendis reminds me of Frank Miller a bit; Both writers/artists who are better with stories than as competition for Frank Frazetta,and both with a noir fascination. Jinx is worth a look....."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"Brian Michael Bendis is probably today's most successful comic writer. At the very least, he's the most visible, penning a slew of high profile titles for Marvel and practically guiding the core Marvel Universe single-handedly, even while he continues to write the critically acclaimed Powers series.But Bendis didn't get his start with superhero comics. His first truly notable work - and some, including myself, would argue his very best work - is right here in crime comics like Jinx. This, when set alongside Goldfish and Torso, make for an impressive body of noirish crime fiction which proves that, like his Marvel work or not, Bendis is the real deal.Here we have a story about three people - a bald, stupid young crook; a young grifter who wants out of the crime life; and the bounty hunter woman he falls in love with - who are chasing after a hefty payday right within their grasp ... if they can work together without killing one another, that is. If Quentin Tarrantino filmed his movies with 1940s technology, they'd look like this.Jinx may have been originally published as a comic series, but make no mistake, this is a graphic novel in the truest sense of the word. It's dense with dialogue and plot, rich with characters, and is just BEGGING to be on the big screen. Bendis' artwork (that's right, folks, Bendis used to draw) is moody and full of shadows. His page layouts are bold and dynamic. Sure, he does a poor job showing action, leaving the reader confused until the text clears up what they just saw, but that's a minor niggle, since most of the action here is made up of intra-character interplay.And that interplay is a joy to read. Bendis sometimes pushes it a bit too far, trying too hard to make the conversations seem real by inserting dozens of pauses and repeated words, but by and large this Mamet-lifted style sings, flies off the pages, and engages. You can hear these people chatting clear and a bell. Wonderful.As mentioned earlier, when set next to Goldfish (a sort of sequel to Jinx) and Torso, Bendis' early body of work is highly impressive and highly readable. You can't go wrong with any of the three. If you like crime fiction especially, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"I must admit I was disappointed with this story. Sorry to those who found Jinx to be an amazing independent effort from Bendis, but I just couldn't see what the hype was about. Interestingly enough, as if there aren't enough adaptations already, I read they will be turning this into a major motion picture starring Charlize Theron as none other than Jinx Alameda. But, aside from my initial statement, I want to express certain aspects of the story that appealed to me, and others that turned me away.The Pros: Noir makes for some of the most intriguing story telling to date, so instantly I was drawn to the Jinx collection. Knowing Bendis' popular Powers series, I figured I couldn't go wrong with some of his earlier works. Photo referencing was genius. It added a thicker layer to Jinx's world that we don't see often in the comic universe. I'm all about presentation in comics and graphic novels, and I think this was done well (albeit one portion I'll explain in the cons.) Original story crafting was a plus. Typical crime drama setting -- i.e. casual noir -- with some real tragic characters. They carry their own individuality with precision. And finally, when you take it to the streets, this is some epic storytelling.The Cons: Right off the bat, and again, sorry to those who disagree, I could not stand the dialogue. Trying to mimic realistic (real life) conversations just doesn't work on paper. In the movies, yes, because it obviously doesn't sound so scripted. But, your eyes don't accept the words so willingly when you just wanna get through a comic book. Especially a long one, it's frustrating to read someone stutter constantly or people interrupting each other and even finishing each others sentences. And, I really don't want to see \\"...\\" several times in a bubble. But, Jinx has it all. Which brings me to the other minute \\"presentation problem\\" I mentioned in the pros, the conversation bubbles seemed to be a mess, and the tails were too long; may sound petty yes, but in a black and white, they are more noticable and distracting. And finally, I just didn't really care for the story, it took me a while to read it because there are so many slow and boring parts, I was really ready to read a crime drama, but it's not what I got. This is not a spoiler review, so I won't reveal anything about the plot. Just, letting the readers know my opinion.The wonderful thing about comics is that they've segregated themselves from any other art form and mediums on how to tell stories. And there's always something that gets lost in the translation when they are adapted into something else (such as a movie). There's such a unique-ness to it, that only fans can appreciate, and a respect that we can give to those involved in this comic universe. So, I applaud Brian Bendis' efforts, but I, unfortunately, can't carry much of Jinx with me."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"Gives a bad name for noir comics. Dialog is terrible, plotline is a weak rip-off of \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\\" and the art is unimaginative and bland.Even the characters are unlovable, I thought I liked Jinx until I realized she is a whiny, two-dimensional femme-fatal wanna-be.Go pick up \\"The Hard Good-Bye\\" instead."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"With Jinx, creator Brian Michael Bendis returns to familiar territory- street-level crime fiction. He also returns to his popular character Goldfish, who previously starred in his own graphic novel, appropriately titled Goldfish.Jinx is a prequel of sorts to Goldfish. David &quot;Goldfish&quot; Gold, a petty grifter, is plying his trade with his sleazeball crony Columbia, when they are almost run over by a car containing 2 dying thugs- before they die, though, they pass along a tip about a hidden stash of loot...$3,000,000.00, to be exact. The problem is, Goldfish was told the location of the loot, Columbia was told the name it's stored under. So they're going to have to play nice to get the cash. Then along comes &quot;Jinx&quot; Alameda, a female bounty hunter looking to get enough cash to leave her sordid job behind. Goldfish and Jinx fall for each other, Columbia decides he doesn't want to share, the REAL owner of the cash comes looking for it....you can just feel the trouble brewing......The story is well-told, and the book itself is HUGE; a tremendous value for your money. I loved the way that Bendis told the stories of the bystanders at the Arcade. It really made the scene take on more urgency by turning the onlookers into real people, as opposed to potential victims. Jinx is a great character; one of the most fully-developed females in comics, and I loved the dialogue- it's really Bendis' strong suit.The bad...? The same as all of Bendis' other collections- POOR PRODUCTION VALUES. The introduction to the book has the usual transposed pages, a trademark of Bendis. There is also the typical mind-boggling array of misspelled words throughout the book. Bendis seriously needs an editor, and his wife just ain't cutting it.You'd probably want to read Goldfish first- It'll make the ending easier to follow. And check out Torso, also by Bendis. It's amazing!"},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"Before being the main writer at Marvel, Bendis was an indie comic book writer. Writing Torso, Goldfish, Fortune and Glory. Jinx was one of the things that brought him mainstream as Joe Quesada, the editor in chief of Marvel Comics, offered Bendis to write Daredevil and Ultimate Spider-Man based on his writing in Jinx. Quesada didn't like the art, but he loved the writing.I can understand Quesada not liking the art for Marvel comics, but it works perfectly for this noir tale. The art is photo realistic at times and full of shadows. It makes us focus much more on the dialogue, which is Bendis strength.Bendis is very inspired by David Mamet when writing dialogue and I think it works great in this comic. The conversations seem real and it is nice to see unfinished sentences and realistic flirting around in the comic book. The book deals with mainly three characters and all of them are well developed, specially Gold and Jinx. Columbia, the third character, is not as intelligent as the other two, but his mistakes make for a lot of funny moments to happen and also for a lot of the tension to happen, because while not being very bright, he is a very dangerous fellow.Jinx is a good noir story."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"Jinx is very early Bendis (anyone remember 1997?), both illustrated and written by Marvel's latest flagship writer. Jinx tells the parallel stories of a down-on-his-luck con man and a female bounty hunter (the title character). Their paths coincide in a few places, and, at the close of this first volume, it looks like they'll go on to many merry adventures. Jinx is a nice little indy - the protagonists (even the foul 'friend') are all entertaining and surprisingly engaging characters.It feels more than a little dated - like a combination of Swingers and Out of Sight - but pulls it off with great charm. I'm not sad that Bendis decided to concentrate on his writing - Jinx has great visual style, but isn't groundbreaking as much as 'aggressively independent'. Nice for a break, but hard for a series."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"Jinx is one of those crime caper stories. Dodgy characters abound. In fact, the three main characters are dodgy. A con artist dodgy type, a bounty hounter dodgy type, and an annoying dodgy type are what we are presented with.when the possibility of obtaining a whole lot of loot brings some of them together, violence and the usual follow."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"This is not Bendis' best work (that would be his work on \\"Daredevil\\"), but it is an interesting crime tale that has an ending as abrupt and as unlikely as they come.Jinx may be the title character, but she's not the most interesting person in the book. That would be Goldfish, her new partner in a quest for a few million dollars. He comes across as a man you could hang out with but never truly trust. Jinx just seems like a lady you wouldn't to deal with after ten minutes or so.Of course, there is Bendis' trademark dialogue (he writes some of the best dialogue in comics, which is no easy feat), and his art, which is sometimes a little hard to follow. I always thought he worked best when working with another artist (though is \\"Fortune and Glory,\\" which is illustrated by him, is fantastic).There are better crime tradepaperbacks out there. (Any of the \\"100 Bullets\\" series comes to mind.) But this is the one you should give people who aren't into comics, because it will when the art medium some new fans."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"There is a scene in JINX (and this gives nothing away) in which writer/artist Brian Michael Bendis deviates from the plot to show us people in an arcade talking. These aren't central characters - a few of them are walk-ons to The Story, and some of them are extras who are hardly seen again. Very little of what they say has anything to do - even tangentially - with the plot. So for 19 pages, background actors are given the chance to tell their stories, their thoughts, their dreams.Brian Michael Bendis is certainly not the first writer to have an idea for the back story for every one-line character who appears - almost every hack sci-fi writer is at least that obsessive, if not more so. The difference is, Bendis' background tangent isn't merely fanboyish wankery. When Bendis' background characters talk, their stories are INTERESTING. They are funny, they are layered, they are compelling, and there is far more to them than the characters say. After 19 pages, you find yourself wishing not that Bendis had avoided delaying the story, but that you could spend another 19 pages with these extras.In fact, what Bendis DOESN'T give you is the real genius of JINX. It is a masterpiece, a five-star treasure, a genuine thrill from beginning to end. It is one of those books you finish and wish it had gone on for another 100 pages or more. (Perhaps Bendis feels the same, which is why THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION contains almost two comics' worth of appendices and additional material.) Bendis' characters don't just ACT. They BREATHE. They pop off the pages and sing and dance and move. One of the reasons the book feels like it should be longer is because - for all their flaws - you find yourself not wanting to say good-bye to Goldfish and Jinx and, yes, even Columbia. Bendis may also be the only writer other than Quentin Tarantino who can give characters pages of dialogue about the comparitive merits of letterboxing in films without sounding like a bad rip-off of Quentin Tarantino.There is something else that Bendis can do that no other comics creator can. (Or, at the very least, no other writer has tried.) Bendis can draw scenes in such a way that the LESS you see, the more involved into the scene you become. His shadows have weight, meaning, a life all their own. Like Spider-Man's black costume, they seem to move and ooze, following their own laws of physics. Within a few pages, the shadows have become not something to HIDE the action, but rather, the audience's eyes into the scene. If I re-read JINX a thousand times, I doubt I would ever determine how it is that he somehow makes the audience feel more intimately involved in a scene when it is drenched in shadow than when it is flooded with light.This is a conscious decision on Bendis' part. He is capable of the clean line drawings of Sal Buscema - and he proves it in one scene - or the moody pseudo-realism of Bernie Wrightson or the abstract solidness of Dave Gibbons. He CHOOSES not to draw JINX this way. When he uses xerography to depict an object, he objectifies and isolates that object, sets us apart from it. Thus, when an entire flashback scene is done through xerography, it detaches us from the action and makes us feel as though the memory which is objectively \\"true\\" is somehow less real to us than a more subjective and fantastic one.When other writers use tricks like these, they seem like show-offs. Even Alan Moore verges dangerously close to OCD with his obsession to detail and showmanship at times. Bendis never falls into this trap. JINX is a tour-de-force - a re-imagining of \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" and Tarantino movies and French New Wave and film noir into a wholly new and original art. Reading JINX is reading a comic book for the first time. Others have complained about the typographical and printing errors, but even those lend a certain grubby charm to the book - like secretly reading a 14-year-old girl's diary in the days before 14-year-old girls posted their diaries to the Internet for the whole world to read, or like seeing a dirty word written on the men's room wall at a Catholic middle school. Reading JINX is like sharing a taboo secret with a small group of strangers.It is sexy, thrilling, dangerous and insanely cool. It is also utterly brilliant. If you like comics, or if you like crime fiction, or if you just like damn good stories period, JINX is a must-read."},{"Title":"Jinx: The Definitive Collection","review":"If you enjoy Brian Michael Bendis's prose then you will like this work. In tone, it is much more similar to Powers and Alias than his more recent Marvel work. The illustrations are often done with xeroxography (xeroxing pictures), which is quite distracting and detracts from the story, but I doubt he could have published the story without it.The primary characters, Jinx and Goldfish, are both interesting and textured. Jinx is a bounty hunter who has been beaten down by life, and is a precursor to Jessica Jones. Jinx is a small time con man in Cleveland who makes bad people choices. The over story and under story meet in nice confluence that enriches the reader's experience."},{"Title":"The antagonists","review":"This is a great book well written and well researched even if it's just fiction. The history of two great peoples the Romans and the Jew's come to life here in a vivid walk thru what happened in 73 AD in Judea. The characters are as real you and me and you can see yourself standing along side them as the story unfolds. Read this it's great."},{"Title":"The antagonists","review":"This is a historical character study of Eleazar Ben Yair and Flavius Silvia the opposing leaders respectively of the Siracii subgroup of the Jewish Zealots and the Roman Procurator of Judea and General of the elite Xth Roman Legion during the seige of Masada. Gann relied on the works of Josephus and archeological research to create his novel. We learn that contrary to popular belief there were survivors: an old woman and 5 children(including the son of Eleazar) under the age of 5. Josephus' writing comes from his interview with a survivor.The back story is that the fortress had been built by Herod for his own use in the event of a Jewish revolt. After Herod's reign ended, the Zealots escaped Jerusalem and occuped Masada for 3 years prior to the seige. From there they conducted raids against the Romans until the Emperor Vespesian directed Flavius Silva to subdue the nuisance.Gann picks up the story during the building of the ramp designed to access and penetrate the ramparts of Masada and most of the action here is during its building. Silva from a patrician Roman family is a widower who plans to retire to his newly constructed estate in Rome once the inevitable is accomplished. Delays in defeating Masada bring the Emperor's political pressure via Pomponius Falco a manipulative noble sent to Silva's camp. For his part Silva thinks the Emperor doesn't understand the complexity of the situation (sound familar?) and considers Falco an intruder.Other characters to the story include Sheva a Jewess who is Silva's mistress, Abigal an old woman to whom Eleazar goes for advice, Ezra a warrior who surrenders to the Romans during the building of the ramp with the intention of facilitating Roman Legionnaires' disloyalty due to the extreme heat of the area.The story alternates between Silva's viewpoint and Eleazar's. Each discusses his strategy with advisors. A late night negotiation between the two antagonists on the serpentine path to the top of Masada comes to naught.Gann's excellent writing created an engrossing story. I was attracted to it because it is outside his normal subjects of flying and sailing. When published, the book was so well received that it was adapted to a movie starring Peter O'Toole and Peter Strauss.Once the siege is completed Silva disappears from history, while a visit to Masada is part of an Isreali soldier's training."},{"Title":"The antagonists","review":"Having seen the movie, \\"MASADA\\" starring Peter O'Toole, I wanted to read the book on which it was based. The author obviously thoroughly researched the period & does an amazing job of taking us to the site of both the Roman camp known for it's abuse, excesses,inefficiency and debauchery. The Jewish group challenged with the need to remain united, survived in an amazing way largely by the wisdom of their leader [maybe it was true in reality...]. The author doesn't spare us crudeness when applicable. He brought out aspects of Roman life which would never have occurred to me, such as reading famous Greek literature when they had time. Miriam Maranzenboim"},{"Title":"The antagonists","review":"There&#65533;s an old adage that &#65533;victors write the history books.&#65533; \\"The Antagonists\\" is a tale that confirms that old adage. Everyone has heard of the mighty Roman Empire that nearly conquered the world and imposed its&#65533; rule wherever it went. What many people don&#65533;t know that historians do is that Romans went to the Holy Land (Israel) and brutally subjugated its&#65533; people, the Jews. They destroyed Jerusalem, massacred entire villages of thousands as symbols of Roman power, and lined the roads of Israel with crucifixes on which corpses were cruelly hung. In the midst of this Roman killing, some people would not give up no matter the cost and \\"The Antagonists\\" is their story, the story of a small group who escaped to a fortress known as Masada.Masada itself is the name of a fortress built in Northern Israel by king Herod and it was old before the time of Jesus (It was built sometime between 37 to 4 B.C.E.). When the Romans came to Israel, the Jews had mixed opinions about how to deal with the Roman Empire. Thought was split between quite a few groups. The basic differences were between people who welcomed the Roman Empire because of the prosperity it could possibly bring and those who condemned the Roman Empire for its&#65533; cultural depravity (Orgies, gladiatorial combat, sacrifice, etc.). Eventually the Romans made the decision easy by imposing crippling taxes on the people and religious oppression. This was the straw that broke the camels back and all the Jews no matter their political differences united. Unfortunately, their unification happened too late. The Romans destroyed Jerusalem and razed the Great Temple from the Bible. The survivors fled north to a fortress known as&#65533; Masada.\\"The Antagonists,\\" the book by Ernest Gann, is also known by the title &#65533;Masada,&#65533; tells the story of this small group of 960 Jews who defied the Roman Empire by refusing to give in to Roman demands. It tells the story of Elazer Ben Yair, leader of the Jews, and Flavius Silva, general of Rome&#65533;s elite Tenth Legion. It tells the story of how Elazer and his small group decided to commit suicide when it became apparent the Roman army would soon breach the walls of Masada. This mass suicide rocked the ancient world, and many peoples oppressed by the Roman Empire took heart in the symbol of a small people who never gave in. The alternative to giving in facing the fortress&#65533;s defenders was hardly more attractive than death. Once the Romans defeated them, the men could expect to be sold off as slaves or crucified, and the women would be condemned to slavery and prostitution.Much of the basis of the story is historical thanks to the saved accounts of a Jew turned traitor to Masada&#65533;s defenders: Flavius Josephus. Josephus as he is better known wrote a history book known as &#65533;The Jewish War&#65533; that the Roman Emperor Vespasian had commissioned. As the adage goes, &#65533;victors write the history books,&#65533; and Vespasian commissioned Flavius to write a history book that extolled his accomplishments as Roman Emperor including the conquering of Masada. For the Romans, commissioning a person who had actually witnessed the history he was extolling was highly unusual. Most Roman history books were written by men who lived hundreds of years after the events being retold. &#65533;The Jewish Wars&#65533; tells the tale of the siege of Masada from the Roman&#65533;s vantage, but includes details that, to this day, have been useful to archeologists exploring Masada&#65533;s ruins. Ernest Gann used &#65533;The Jewish Wars&#65533; in addition to other references to write his historical fiction novel of the siege of Masada.I recommend reading Yigal Yadin&#65533;s (one of the archeologists who has explored Masada) book &#65533;Masada,&#65533; Flavius Josephus&#65533; &#65533;The Jewish Wars,&#65533; as well as trying to rent the 1981 ABC television series &#65533;Masada,&#65533; which starred Peter O&#65533;Toole. The screenplay of the 1981 ABC television series was made using &#65533;Masada&#65533; or \\"the Antagonists,\\" the novel by Ernest Gann. The television series was very well done and I enjoyed it very much.I highly recommend the novel &#65533;Masada&#65533; or &#65533;The Antagonists&#65533; as it is also known. It is a wonderful novel of fascinating historical fiction.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"Dutch to English and English to Dutch Medical Dictionary with CD ROM: Woordenboek Geneeskunde en Biomedische Wetenschappen Engels - Nederlands / Nederlands - Engels (English and Dutch Edition)","review":"The (mini) CD ROM included with this title isn't a CD ROM of the dictionary; it includes nothing more than a 125-page PDF of medical abbreviations. Therefore, don't buy this title thinking it includes a searchable CD ROM of the dictionary (as it probably ought to, nowadays).The English-to-Dutch half of the dictionary is significantly longer than the Dutch-to-English half. This is explained in part by the fact that most eponymous conditions (e.g. Crohn's, Aspberger's, etc.) are listed only in the English-to-Dutch half. It uses primarily American spelling (since the majority of English medical research is published in American English). Translations are sometimes a bit too spare or don't include as many alternatives or synonyms as they should. Some translations are indicated merely as \\"id.\\" meaning \\"identical\\"; however, this is meant loosely as it implies the user would know e.g. that English \\"anemia\\" if translated as \\"id.\\" would result in Dutch \\"anemie.\\" In other words, you need some grounding in how cognate Latin roots are derived and spelled in both English and Dutch.The print is quite small, and lexical headwords are printed in a very narrow, bold sans serif font, which is quite difficult to read.Despite some serious shortcomings, this is overall a useful and reliable research work, if short. I bought it in part thinking the CD ROM included a searchable lexicon--so that is a major disappointment.

I almost recommend reading the first story last: it is so good and odd and different that you might have to take a break after reading before you read the rest. And you won't want to take that break, because this is one of the best collections you will read this year.Recommended for smart readers of any age."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"A Bit Unusual. This is a rather interesting fantasy collection but it is not for everybody. These ten tales are dark but they are not horror. Some seem to be in our world while others are in worlds twisted and strange. The very first story where a family participates in an act of justice against one of their own should warn the reader of what is to follow.While there are some elements of the fantastic in some of the stories, they are not the focus of these tales. These are not stories of dragons, wizards and fairies, although some may appear. Instead they are tales of the heart and the mind. They take us deep inside the characters in tales where thoughts and not actions are the focus. A fine collection all around.If you enjoy the introspective tale then this collection is for you. If you are looking for dragon slaying and spell casting, then you might want to check out something different."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"Having been given a number of \\"warnings\\" about the intensity of Lanagan's most recent book, Tender Morsels, I decided to get a better sense of her writing through one of her short story collections first.I wish someone had warned me about this collection as well.Lanagan is an intense writer of dark, emotional, human fantasy worlds. There are echoes of older cultures and languages buried deep in these worlds, a sense not so much as coming from another planet but as if reading reports from undiscovered country. It is the type of fiction that reads like literary reportage from a past frontier transported through time. Like something forbidden, these stories are a black juice indeed.The collection opens with \\"Singing Down My Sister,\\" a strange description of a ritual that involves sending a woman out into the center of a lake of tar. Knowing Lanagan hails from Australia, and having grown up with the tar pits of LA, it wasn't too illogical a step for me to imagine a sort of hybrid Aboriginal culture that appeared to be redressing some sort of wrong through an old, odd cleansing process involving tar. But no, this is clearly something else as the event at hand is actually an execution, a slow death in front of an audience with a wake built in. Equally fascinating and disconcerting, the effect is how I would imagine it to be watching surgery being performed on myself while fully conscious.Short story collections by their nature must start off strong and bold. They must open with a story full of promise for the rest of the collection yet not be so strong as to let the reader down along the way. Reading \\"Singing Down My Sister\\" it almost feels intimidating to continue with the rest of the book. If the rest of the book is anywhere near this intense it might be impossible to finish.Fortunately, the book wasn't impossible to finish. Unfortunately the rest of the book was equally intense.Each of the stories contained so completely build their worlds - unique and richly textured worlds at that - this it is possible for each story to sustain its own book. \\"Red Nose Day\\" delves into a dark world full of professional clowns and the hitmen who kill them, with more than a hint of allegory aimed at the Catholic church. \\"The House of Many\\" posits a clash of parallel worlds that fluidly includes a Middle Ages cult surrounded by a more contemporary society rich with cars and candy. Demonic angels that help children break free of oppressive adults. Queens who prefer the company of dancing gypsies to their own kingdoms. Lanagan plucks the familiar image and icon and from our consciousness and folds them deftly into something new, a magical literary origami.I think the warning I would have wanted was more in the form of advice. I think these stories should be savored slowly, with a lot of space between them. Perhaps as ways of cleansing the palate between other books. One after another, the power in these stories makes reentry into the world difficult. Better to dip into these waters with some reserve.Whether this has helped me to better enter the world of Tender Morsels has yet to be determined. As it stands, I feel richer for the diversion."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"A dreamy affair, this book traverses the boundary between reality and the hyper-real with breathtaking skill. The storylines are often unimportant, taking a back seat to the prose, which flows and twists with great dexterity and poetry. This is a strongly visual book that would certainly appeal to readers of all ages. It would be of particular interest to those with a predilection towards fantasy. There is a strong thematic of family bonds throughout, and though no time period is mentioned, the nature of the writing and storytelling (strong family themes, the near absence of any technology) gives me the impression that most of the stories are set in the distant past, which only adds to the otherworldly qualities. I like the title as well because blackness is a strong image created throughout, almost like the book is an anthology of stories from the dark ages."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"I have nothing but praise to offer for the range and depth of Margo Lanagan's creativity. Her worlds stretch beyond, her characters beneath, her eerie tone deeper than any collection of short stories I've ever read. These ten short stories, touted as young adult, might pass as such to some, but not to me. These tales are older than young adult, despite their characters' ages. The tone and voice of these stories is not distinctly young adult, but something more vast.Community burial rituals, reeking wrestling angels, wandering hopeful brides, loyal escaping elephants, and other bizarre images litter this collection with a freshness that, when her worlds came to life, sang to my soul. Perhaps it was just this reader, but some of the stories lost me completely. Maybe I'm not as savvy a reader as I think myself to be, but I do expect myself to be able to understand what's happening in the story. There were a couple of the stories, I confess that I stuck through in hopes I would \\"get them\\" later on.But those were the exception. I enjoyed her fresh use of language, her frequent linguistic inventions that worked, her bold exploration of words. The young adult world needs more short story collections like Margo Lanagan's, which was one of the 5 finalists for Best of Young Adult at the 2006 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. To be named among such authors as Per Nilsson, John Green, Markus Zusak, and Andreas Steinhofel is no small feat.And neither are her stories.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"Based on the jacket description, I thought this would be a book of short stories delving into different aspects of the human soul and psyche, both dark and light. That is not what I found and certainly not how I would sell this book. While I was impressed with the first story, and the level to which the author managed to draw the reader into the characters in a few short pages, it was the only one that I thought was worth reading. The rest were, for the most part, simplistic, unoriginal, woe-is-me pity the poor people drivel. While some of the stories, such as \\"Red Nose Day,\\" may have benefited from more in-depth development and background information, most of the stories were simply lacking in every sense of the word, I didn't care about the characters, I was mostly bored by the plots, and I wasn't intrigued by the \\"worlds\\" the author created. As for this book being an exploration of the darker side of the human spirit, tame is the only word I can use to describe it. Perhaps I have more experience with dark literature than the average reader, but I would say light gray is about as dark as this book gets. For readers who are interested in exploring the range of the human psyche, from its best to its worst, I would recommend the Black Jewels series by Anne Bishop and the Kushiel's Legacy series by Jacqueline Carey. Bottom Line: If you are looking to be intellectually stimulated or even truly entertained, look elsewhere. This collection will fall far short of your expectations."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"This book was recommended to me by my short story writing teacher at TAFE because Margo Lanagan is such an expert in compressing a story in a way that is so very descriptive. Every line is newsy and colorful keeping the reader turning the pages.I enjoyed all the stories of this book because every one took me to a place that I've never been or even heard of before. I was transported and found it easy to become one of the characters. The only criticism I have of Margo's writing is that she often left the reader questioning, &#34;then what happened&#34; at the end. Maybe that is a good idea and lets the reader work out their own ending. I prefer neat and tidy ending with all questions answered.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes short stories and appreciates great imagination."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"I really love short story collections: the satisfaction of reading a tale in a short amount of time, the completeness of a world in a few pages, the feeling of \\"oh I wish this was a novel\\" when I finish a great story. When they are fantasy stories, it's even more exciting because anything could happen next. That's the way I felt while reading Margo Lanagan's excellent BLACK JUICE.There were many times when I had no idea what was happening, and I mean that in the most complimentary way. These ten stories merit many re-reads and discussions. After reading the stories, I would hop on the internet to see if I could find out more...I needed to know what was happening in these worlds. This is subtle fantasy; it could be in the future or in an alternate world. Lanagan never spells things out for the reader, she just slides in details that make the reader pause. For example, in \\"Perpetual Light\\", the family cat catches wild animals as most pets do, \\"But sometimes he lost his head and ate half, and brought us the rest, the light gone out of their eyes and the mechs and biosprings trailing.\\" There is no more explanation given, even though the reader is desperate to know what this means.Lanagan is a talented writer whose choice of words leave the reader aching. In the eerie \\"Yowlinin\\", the protagonist says, \\"Who did I think I was, all these months, following and watching him? This must be what they call lovesickness. But the love has fallen from my eyes now and left only the sickness.\\" Lanagan takes the ordinary and shows it in a way that challenges, unsettles, and enchants her audience.Younger readers could be frustrated by the lack of resolution to the stories, but I loved it. I look forward to one day further exploring these stories with my students, pondering how Lanagan can do so much in so few pages."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"Although I feel I have an edition with much nicer cover art (December 2004), if you have an appreciation for obscure, poetic literature and want something highly original and creative to read and be inspired by, I recommend Black Juice. Margo Lanagan is a writer unlike any other I have read. While a few reviewers have noted that her work is very dark, I want to say that it is also very tender. I also want to offer a differing view that Lanagan does indeed delve into dark and light aspects of the human soul or condition, and I feel she does it beautifully.I purchased this book on whim while browsing a book store over five years ago and I'm so glad I did as it gave me a new appreciation for creativity. I only wish my borrowed copy was returned so I could read it again."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"I had to purchase this book for a Young Adult Literature course. Initially I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy it but once you get used to the thick dialect and the dark nature of the authors work it's really quite interesting. It is a compilation of short stories. They are not themed with each other at all but they all have a continuity of strange perspective, dark humor, very difficult dialect, and characterizations that resemble Edgar Allen Poe's works. If you wind up having to buy it, don't fear it."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"I read a lot. I read a lot of YA fiction. This is the only book I've ever read that stopped me breathing. I'd heard this book was good, but it took me a year or two to read it. I was on holidays - maybe too relaxed - and lying on the floor of a beach house when I read Singing My Sister Down. It took many seconds for me to start breathing again - the air had just gone completely out of my lungs. I took the book to the Writing Class I was teaching and, even though it was not the topic for that week, I read that story. I had to share. Someone started crying and just couldn't stop. Lanagan is a masterful writer. She affects people. Not all writers can do that."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"This book was evil and we can all relate to at least one of these stories. It was ten twisted tales about, in my pespective, life. They were sad and scary stories, each one of them had a very distinct story line. I suggest this book to teens over the age of twelve and all others who understand it."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"This is the first I've heard of Margo Lanagan, but I feel it won't be the last.Black Juiceis a collection of short stories of the superb quality I have come to expect from the genre's Australian authors. I fully enjoyed every single one of the stories included in this book.* Singing My Sister Down- This is a very sad story about an unusual tribal punishment, and my favourite story in this collection.* My Lord's Man - A story about love, acceptance and misjudgement.* Red Nose Day - An interesting twist on the typical clown story.* Sweet Pippit - A beautiful story about elephants and their love for their handler. This is my second favourite story in this collection.* House of the Many - A story about the fading of our childhood impressions.* Wooden Bride - An interesting story about living up to our word.* Earthly Uses - A twist on the concept of angels.* Perpetual Light - Set in a future world where the air is unbreathable.* Yowlinin - Monsters and outcasts of society meet.* Rite of Spring - Singing in the season.* The Point of Roses - This is my pick for third place in this collection. A boy with great powers influences others.Margo's stories are magnificent, engrossing and above all, thought-provoking. My top three stories in this collection are Singing My Sister Down, Sweet Pippit and The Point Of Roses. All three of these stories are worthy of your attention."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"The stories in this book are all beautiful and haunting. They are set in a variety of locations that may or may not be real, and they deftly combine everyday emotions with elements of the fantastic or surreal. These are the sort of stories you remember long after you have read them."},{"Title":"Black Juice","review":"Absolutely superb. Don't read the book copy (it might give too much away), in fact - don't even read these reviews. Just buy the book and dig in.

Kennedy, Jr.: A Life in the Spotlight","review":"I bought this book hoping to have a nice memory of a life extinguished in its prime. It wasn't long reading (I read the entire thing in under 2 hours) but it was brief, interesting reading. To my suprise, I discovered that this short book gives a tiny glimpse into the Kennedy family spanning back to John Jr.'s great-grandparents. I enjoyed the author's candid and blunt writing style. He certainly spared no feelings in writing this book, as you will see when reading about John Jr.'s mediocre accomplishments, Jackie's controlling maternal style, and the president's wanderings during marriage. The favoritism the family has enjoyed in the pursuit of different endeavors was especially riveting. (The interesting acquiring of the president's Pulitzer Prize, for example.) I would be untruthful, however, if I didn't admit that I did learn a lot from this book. If you don't want to devote days to a heavy biography on America's Royal Family, but are still interested in some behind the scenes escapades, then I would recommend it."},{"Title":"John F. Kennedy, Jr.: A Life in the Spotlight","review":"I absolutely loved this book. What is there NOT to love about JFK Jr. He is handsome, big-hearted, and seems as though he is a great guy...not because of his fame but because that is the man his mother raised him to be. I loved reading about his entire life and the pictures.....SMOKIN HOT!!! It leaves you wanting to know more about this fine specimen of manliness!!"},{"Title":"John F. Kennedy, Jr.: A Life in the Spotlight","review":"I read Prince Charming by Wendy Leigh and it is a fabulous beautiful book, a marvellous memorial to John. really worth getting. so don't waste your time with this book. Prince Charming tells the real story."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"This book is the perfect tool for learning how to buy vintage and how to wear it. Most importantly how to wear with modern pieces; think Winona Ryder, not Marcia Brady.The &quot;models&quot; are gorgeous working women who wear the clothes with style and pizzazz. The range of ages and shapes/sizes of the &quot;models&quot; is incredible and really drives home the point that classics become classics by being beyond fads or trends that limit their appeal to a moment in time.A treasure chest of buying information at the back, the book is worth it for the section alone (but the rest of the book is spectacular too)."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"This is the vintage clothing book I've been waiting for. So many of them are mere catalogs in B&amp;W showing dowdy clothes on dowdy models -- useful for figuring out prices and the age of the garment, but not much else. But with great photography and art direction and attractive real people, this book contains great ideas on how to actually incorporate vintage clothing in your wardrobe. One vintage article of clothing is shown being worn several different ways for each person, sometimes with other vintage items, sometimes with newer items. Hopefully this book will encourage others to appreciate what I've come to love about vintage clothing -- its versatility, its quality, its stylishness and its timelessness."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"This is the first book on vintage clothing that doesn't aim to help make you look like you're an extra in a period movie. (Not that there's anything really wrong with that, but...). This is for fashion buffs who want to incorporate vintage pieces successfully into their existing wardrobes and thereby create a truly individual style for themselves.I loved the way the book inspired me to re-examine the clothing I already own, and how vintage pieces -- classic pieces -- might add new life to my wardrobe. The key word here is &quot;classic&quot;, and this book goes a long way toward defining it.In addition to this book, I own several others on vintage clothing. Most of those books merely chronicle the various eras and styles of clothing, plus include price ranges for collectors. VINTAGE STYLE, on the other hand, shows how you can wear the clothes, not merely accumulate them.My only wish is that the authors had included a lot more on vintage accessories -- say, costume jewelry (charm bracelets); handbags; shoes; etc. But this was a fine step in the right direction, and I'd love to see more books like this! Hopefully, the authors are planning another edition!"},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"As an introduction, I am not a \\"fashion expert\\", or knowledgeable about vintage fashion to any depth. That said, I believe I have a good sense of style, and wanted to learn more. Almost every page of this book left me wishing for more; as I turned the pages I went from excitement [at seeing something new] to boredom [at another impracticable idea] to interested [there are many historical gems in this book] to unbelieving [at another picture/idea that looked completely wrong to me] to contented [sometimes short sections of the book just came together because the author has a very nice writing style].Most of the book is a list of 37 clothing styles (36 for women, one for men, with examples of business, casual and evening variations for each) and most of these did not live up to their potential. Each style usually takes 5 pages to explain, with lots of pictures. For a non-expert like me, there was not enough explanation on what made each style different and appealing. Most of the pictures, rather than explaining and amplifying the style, were \\"fashion shoots\\" showing the owners in their clothes, posing in various stylish ways - the emphasis was on the person, not the garment. I would have appreciated more controlled pictures of the clothing, and close-ups showing its advantages. Many times the author says It's about \\"The linings, the detailing, the tailoring. It's about workmanship. It's about the way it fits and the way it moves.\\" However, there is not one picture or one paragraph explaining any of these things for any of the 37 clothing styles!For some odd reason, the author is stuck on the decades also. As other reviewers noted, most of the book is 1950's and later. Many times you will read: \\"In what decade was it made? What difference does it make?...\\", yet attached to each picture is a decade. More frustrating, there is very little explanation why one picture is \\"50's\\" and the one next to it is \\"70's\\". Some of her ideas just seem crazy or outlandish, like wearing shorts &amp; pajamas in a conservative work environment. (You won't stand out as long as you wear your Chinese pajamas under a sport coat and match the colors in the Pucci shorts with your blouse!)I appreciated that real people are wearing these clothes, and not the latest supermodel. For me, the best part of the book was the end with little vignettes on classic styles, vintage finds, &amp; shopping. Again, most of the shopping section should be extra for anyone who reads the paper, shops at the mall, and has an idea of what garage sales and flea markets are all about (but for beginners there are a few additional bits of information in there).After reading 37 examples of how everything can be acceptable anywhere, as long as you are stylish, you should feel encouraged to go out, buy something different and try it on. To critique this book, there should be much better books out there, for both beginners and vintage experts; however, this is one of my first books so I just don't know which ones they are."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"There's nothing I hate more than a celebrity touting fashion book. Thankfully, Tiffany Dubin shows real people wearing vintage style in a flattering and accessible way. The clothes don't look like they've just been pulled from a moth-infested attic. They could have come straight from Barneys. Hard to believe they're both old and so up-to-date! I also appreciated the way new and old looks are worn together so that a woman can integrate vintage pieces into her contemporary wardrobe. Given that Dubin must be credited for infusing the vintage style movement with its current vitality and verve (when she headed the fashion department at Sothebys, she was the one who started the mass-movement to look cool in grandma's threads), it figures that she would be the one to write a how-to book for those who didn't make it to her standing-room-only auctions where the hippest New Yorkers learned how to mix Gucci with Rudi Gernreich."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"As an amateur collector, I found this book very interesting and helpful. Not only can collecting be a challenge, but so can incorporating vintage clothes in with your everyday wardrobe. Tiffany Dubin's sense of style is creative as well as wearable. She illustrates her ideas through colorful pictures and descriptions of real women in realistic settings. You feel like you're getting sincere, up-to-date advise from someone who knows vintage intstead of learning from someone designing for Kate Moss."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"This was an ambitious project, by all means: over two hundred four-color pages and a jacket blurb that proclaims the book \\"nothing short of a money-saving source guide and an inspirational blueprint for understanding how to wear vintage clothing with style\\". Alas, Vintage Style fails on both counts. While some of the photographs display lovely vintage pieces--a terrific off-white Dior ensemble from the 50's, for example--the majority of these vintage-ensembles-as-mainstream-choices would draw unwanted stares at best, and embarrassing comments, at worst.As for being a source guide, money-saving or otherwise, the book merely lists (on the final few pages) a handful of vintage dealers in each of the general regional areas of the United States, with the majority being in the New York and New England areas (surprise, surprise). The disclaimer states \\"A complete list would be impossible to compile\\". Apparently so: if you're a resident of The South, we're informed, there are only two vintage sellers of which the authors are aware: one in Miami and one in Atlanta. Well, that's news to us Southern girls! Furthermore, no price points are mentioned (these would help steer the vintage shopper to boutiques whose merchandise she could afford) and no information on the stores' areas of specialization (i.e. designers and eras represented) is given either.Although there are plenty of color photographs, the majority are strangely styled and badly out-of-focus. A puzzling eight-part treatise on hacking up a (seemingly) perfectly good black lace dress with a pair of scissors concludes with the wearer looking less Comme des Garcons than extremely silly. And there is a disappointing shortage of accessory shots: don't those New Yorkers like vintage jewelry and handbbags as much as the rest of the nation?Yes, you'll see some designer outfits shown on non-models in Vintage Style. But for about $37 less, you can flip through the society pages of W magazine and have a similar experience."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"When I ordered the book I was expecting a good share of the content to cover 1940s fashions (my favorite period). However, it mostly deals with what I call &quot;modern&quot; vintage (stuff I wore the first time around). It's a good book if that's your interest, but if its 1940s or earlier, move on."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"I was hoping that this book would provide a more complete tour of vintage design through the past century. I would have liked this book to have been a vintage clothing guide of each decade's popular designers, along with information on how to spot the unique style of each. There was some information given by decade, but it was somewhat incomplete for my needs. Also, I would have liked to have seen more information on shoes and purses, with detailed tips on how to spot quality pieces."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"This book is really aimed at vintage fashion neophytes. For any one with more than a passing knowledge of vintage fashion save your money. As an aesthitic experience the book is great, lots of pretty pictures. However, there is nothing really of interest in the book. As a test if you know who courreges is do not buy this book, there is nothing here you don't already know."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"As has been noted by the fashion world and in numerous fashion magazines, including Vogue and Harper's Baazar and even InStyle, vintage dressing is a definite craze as of late. You can see it epitomized on Hollywood stars like Chloe Sevigny and Winona Ryder, and even in more mainstream fashion such as the lady-like trend of 1940's style dressing brought about by Prada's winter collection. For those who embrace this craze, this book would be a good choice to guide you in making purchases that will stand the test of time. The book does a good job of explaining good buys versus the bad, trendy ones. I would have liked to see more pictures, but that is a personal issue. Overall, a pretty good guide to obtaining a vintage style."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"Timeless and Amazing!!!! Kid is a star and works with me at Tepper Galleries. Come visit. www.teppergalleries.com"},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"I was very disappointed in this book; I had hoped to find a nicely laid out book that presented lovely or interesting vintage pieces that regular people have worked into their wardrobes. I thought I'd see particularly fine examples of some classics and maybe some more unusual pieces. This is not the book for that. Some of the pieces are not even vintage (!!) but are rather meant to represent a 'classic' type of clothing. For example, one woman is shown wearing a no-sleeve turtleneck sweater which, we're told, is from the 90's but \\"could have come from the 50's.\\" Whaaaa? And while the authors are obviously shooting for sending the message that vintage pieces can be timeless and that well-crafted clothing works in any time, I think that message is already well-known to vintage clothing lovers who would presumably be interested in this book. I wanted to see people doing interesting things with 50's swing coats or perhaps showing how they wear classic 30's or 40's style without it looking costume-y. If you're looking for this, don't buy this book!Another thing I didn't like about the style is that the authors often sound snobbish, dropping names right and left without giving any background information on why these are famous names in the first place. Personally, I don't give a flip whether something is made by Pucci. If it looks good and is well-made, the label only adds to the expense."},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"A reviewer, A fashion novice in Chicago, November 2, 2000, Vintage Clothes Made Relevant Wow! I never really took the whole vintage thing seriously until I read through this book. What everyone has been saying about buying vintage has some basis in reality. Not only does vintage clothing deserve to be a part of the wardrobe of anyone who is serious about fashion, but also those (like me) who dabble. Who knew that a book about old clothes could be this compelling. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Vintage Style : Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes","review":"Received this as a gift and wasn't impressed. About 99% of the styles are tacky and tasteless. Many of the styles in the pics weren't even vintage and if they were it was really hard to tell.

The book has inspired me to look at second hand clothing and think more laterally how I can refresh outfits.For example I recently purchased a very good quality 1950s/60s petticoat/full slip and teamed this with a denim type long fitted jacket all for an amazing $8.00 (Aust) This book inspired me to think outside the square and be a little more 'out there'.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be inspired to try vintage fashion with a modern take and on a budget.
