It was difficult to put the book down. I felt inspired and enriched by the words and wisdom throughout this book. Finding the 'Peaceful Warrior' within. I felt the magic as I read through it, wanting more and more. I loved it.

Amazing read.Isabella Gentilin - Author of 'Whispers of an Angel'"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I first purchased and read \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives\\" by Dan Millman back in 1984. I still have that copy that I paid $8.95 for. Actually, I've read that copy a number of times, and most recently I read the newer book I purchased that also contains an interview with the author about the making of the film starring Nick Nolte. (Notice how prices have gone up, that edition cost $12.95) I bought that and read it along with \\"Wisdom of the Peaceful Warrior: A Companion to the Book That Changes Lives.\\" I enjoyed the first book each and every time I read it, as did I enjoy the companion book. They are both enjoyable and educational. They make you think.For many years, nearing 20, \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" has been in my top favorite books. I don't know if I really have one single favorite, but if I had to list the top 10 in no particular order, this book would be there. It's a story that just connects with me, like it has for many people. The lessons Millman learns from his mentor, Socrates, the eccentric old warrior working at the gas station, are lessons that are profound, yet simple. Millman's spiritual odyssey reflects a searching I've also had, and the conclusions and answers that unfold in this autobiographical novel resemble the answers I've found on my own quest. Maybe this is because Millman, through his books and audio programs, has been one of my spiritual teachers and this first book especially has had a profound impact on me as I've sought answers along my own journey.The book contains a simple story really. The young Millman, successful on many fronts, still has a sense that something is missing. Through Socrates and the young woman, Joy, we read about Millman's awakening if you will. Along the way, you have the chance to share Millman's laughter and his pain. And maybe, if you are paying attention to your own life, you'll see how Millman's moments of illumination shine light onto your own path as you question the larger meanings of life and purpose. You also might just find yourself incorporating the Way of the Peaceful Warrior into your own living, and be doing so, find yourself on a path toward living in the now and happiness.I'm a huge fan of all of Dan Millman's work. I highly recommend you read \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" as the starting point for all of his teachings. It's one of my favorite books, and I'm sure I'll read it a number of more times in the future too.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Simply put, this is an excellent book.

I have been studying Buddhist and Eastern philosphies for a while and I still had things to learn from this book. I see this book at an explanation of many Buddhist beliefs (such as 'no-mind' and 'live in the now'). I do think that this book is a great starting place for people that are interested in the buddhist way of life, but are having a hard time wrapping their mind around many of the Buddha's obscure concepts. I had to give it 4 stars as the editing is not up to parr. This may have been fixed in later editions, as I have a very old copy that I purchased from a used book store. The editing mistakes were so noticeable at some points that it interrupted the flow of the amazing story. Other than the errors, however, I was completely engrossed by the book.

The character of Socrates impacted my life in many overt and covert ways, all for the positive. I read the book over ten years ago and the residue of its impact still lingers.

I strongly believe that anyone can benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend of mine back in 2002. Since then, I have bought about 6 copies. Each time, I gave a copy to a friend that I thought needs a place to start from, a first step to start a journey into the spiritual world.This is a great introduction to an interesting journey into spirituality. This book got me started reading about spirituality. I recommend it to everyone. It is simple and easy to read. Once you start it, you won't be able to put it down easily. I also realized that I tend to re-read it every year.I am about to buy my 7th copy.Good luck"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I heard of this book from a friend and saw many positive reviews of it here, so I really wanted to like this book. I like the idea behind the concept of a 'peaceful warrior.' The book tells a story similar to Fight Club, where you're not real sure if Socrates is real or imaginary. The book offers some interesting concepts, but also defies logic and reasoning in several instances. For example, this guy can touch his hands to your temples and you blackout and go on a 'hallocinogenic trip.' When you awaken, he knows what you've seen and experienced while you were passed out. How? The guy can jump from the ground to the roof of a building. How? It's never truly explained and defies the laws of gravity and common sense.One story in the book that bothered me was towards the end that read 'A saintly woman was walking along the edge of a cliff. Several hundred feet below her, she saw a dead mother lion, surrounded by crying cubs. Without hesitation, she leaped off the cliff so that they would have something to eat.'This is logic? What do they eat next? Maybe mom lion wasn't really dead? Why not just feed them?Over all, if you enjoy self-help books that are written like a novel, such as the Celestine Prophecy, then you may like this book. If I wanted to read a fictional novel, I would've purchased one. I was looking for new age self-help and this book fell very short of that.Besides the fact that these events take place in the late 60's, so much of society behaves differently today then what is described in the book. Also, the author must have one heck of a memory to recall dreams and converations that happened 30 years prior to writing the book.Over all, it seems very fabricated. As a novel, it's fine. But for self-help, it doesn't offer much."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The way of the peaceful Warrior is a very good book. it has much practical wisdom for everyday living.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is one of the best books anyone could possibly own and pass on to a friend. Dan Millman provides clues to life's little crusade throughout this book without sounding too preachy or new age. Most people I've met are a little turned off about metaphysics but when they read this book they seemed to get it after all. It may be a fictional biography, but it can relate to anyone.

Start changing your life with this book and change the lives of others by passing it on."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The angst of youth, this story is loaded with it. The story tends to drag with the frustration and self doubt of the college student hero. Sometimes the inner demons are conquered, and sometimes not, but in either case, lessons are learned, and powerful concepts unveiled.I found the guru and his technics in this book quite refreshing. Tough love and critisism are applied with abandon. I sometimes grow weary of the care bear 'love is the only answer' message in some new age works, so I enjoyed reading something with a bit more of an edge to it.I love the idea of a spiritual warrior, and this book spoke directly to me on a better way to approach my thinking and living.Entertainment: 2 starsEnlightenment: 5 starsOverall: 5 stars"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I could write a glowing review, but it would come down to this...buy this book, read it, change your life, buy another copy for a friend...repeat until you see the desired result.

After the first time I read it, it did in fact help me to change my outlook on life. About two years after reading it the first time, I felt like I needed to do something to really change my life, and so for guidence, I re-read this book. The second time through, it depressed me. I listened to all the things Dan's mentor was telling him, and I started to believe that this was the only way to live correctly; that if you didn't life the life of a peaceful warrior, you were wasting your life. This was made worse by the fact that I had no mentor like Dan's. It later dawned on me that this book should be used as a guide, rather than a road map to happiness. I love this book, it inspired me during some of my darkest times, but I feel that it is important to keep in mind that this is not the only way to happiness. Read it in conjunction with other books. I reccoment Siddhartha and The Alchemist."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior is one of the most incredible books I have ever read. I've read it multiple times. And every time it reminds me of important things and helps me in my life. It chronicles the journey of a man struggling to find himself, something most people I know can relate to, not to mention myself. It tells of his discovery of what he was looking for, his purpose, it helps you to do so also. This book changes the way you think and affects your life in many ways, it teaches you about moral and purpose and the realities of life. Although it isn't one of the most extravagantly written books, Dan Millman does an incredible job of conveying his message through his medium. This book is truly a work of art. I would recommend Way of the Peaceful Warrior to anyone. Period. No matter who you are I believe you can find something for yourself in this book."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I am a big fan of Dan Millman's and I think this book is his best. The semi-fictional story - well told in my opinion - includes simple concepts that can help create a powerful paradigm shift. I think it is especially good for young people who need some guidance in life.For the people who think the story is simplistic or too geared for young people you may want to try the Evolution of a Warrior by Regan. Definitely for a more mature audience, the Evolution of a Warrior is another excellent work of this genre."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book a few months after my high school sweetheart killed himself and I just could not seem to get on with everyday life. It was exactly what I needed to get on with my grieving, and my living. I think that you have to be in a certain place in your life when you read it, I have passed it to friends that just read it for pure entertainment and they did not get as much out of it. The book is very direct, and simple, which is exactly what I needed to get on with my journey. I have read this book 5 or 6 times in the last 10 years, and it is always helpful. Make sure you read Sacred journey also!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"i read this book because i saw that it was apolo anto ohno's favorite book. i thought it would give me insight as to how this 19 year old became not only a skating star, but such a young guy with a not so young spiritual temperment. this book will make you a fan of dan milman, and certainly a fan of apolo.it' a quick, easy read for anyone, any age. a year ago i started on my own personal path as a peaceful warrior and this book made me realize i was and am on the right path. after reading this book it affirmed my decision to stop and smell the roses and enjoy life, ride a bike, smile and enjoy the few laps around the sun we get. i have a lot of friends in the internet/technology world who are going thru a lot of stress, doubt, worry these days. all they worked for is quickly spinning around and down the drain and there's little to show for it. i left many who would have cut their own mother's throat to achieve extreme internet wealth, starter palaces and perceived power. today they are lucky if they have conscience enough to keep a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich down. if you know of anyone headed off to college or kids in college, or maybe someone whose life is taking a turn for the worse buy this book for them. the book won't change their lives, but it will help them change, and enjoy their lives if they are open to doing so."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The one useful lesson of this book is that we should all live in the present moment, without fretting over the past or the future. Every other insight seems half-baked, in part because young Dan Millman seems unfamiliar with any spiritual tradition of the East or West.Challenged by his mentor to say where he is, for example, Millman does not know. To be fair, the mentor won't accept a conventional address. He wants to know where the universe is, and Millman doesn't have faith or experience enough to say \\"in the mind of God,\\" as one of the children in Thornton Wilder's play, \\"Our Town,\\" did. Stumped by questions like that and his mentor's puzzling answers to them, Millman falls for every New Age nostrum in the book. \\"Feel more and think less\\" becomes a key insight, even though it confuses innocence with primitivism and falsely implies that thought is always an obstacle to enlightenment (Thomas Aquinas could have disabused Millman and his mentor of that hilarious notion all by himself). Death to self loses most of its sacrificial character and becomes just another check off item on the list of things necessary for self-fulfillment through 'unreasonable happiness.' Meanwhile, Millman trips merrily along, wracked by doubt but winning gymnastics meets and boffing pretty groupies.Anyone looking for a better chronicle of the relationship between an old warrior and his young apprentice would do well to read Tom Brown Jr.'s book, 'The Tracker,' instead. That story comes from the same era but has more wisdom. Millman fans are advised to pass up \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" in favor of his later work in books like \\"The Inner Athlete.\\""},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book has been on my short list ever since I read Millman's The Journeys of Socrates last year, which I absolutely loved. I found that book to be a vivid, suspenseful, and captivating story that I definitely plan to read again.I was therefore quite surprised that Way of the Peaceful Warrior was extremely disappointing from almost the very first page. The writing is mediocre at best, and is sometimes even worse than that. The characters are two-dimensional, while Millman's descriptions of things, places, events, and even concepts central to the theme of the book are shallow and underdeveloped. Perhaps the worst aspect of the book is the absolutely wretched dialogue, which is always forced and unnatural, sometimes laughably so. It's just impossible to visualize people talking like the characters in this book and saying the things they say. At no point in the story did I ever feel even the slightest bit of suspense, awe, or wonder. There's almost no emotion in the book, and what little there is seems completely contrived. Millman admits at the end of the book that he wrote it in three weeks, and it really shows.I'm really amazed that so many people have rated this book so highly and that so many people say it changed their lives. This is not a deep, reflective, introspective book by any means. At best it is a second-rate self-help book. And this is coming from a person who was really looking forward to reading it. The reason I didn't give it just one star is that I did glean a few little nuggets of wisdom and insight here and there, but I could easily fit them on half a page of paper. It's not worth trudging through such a poorly written, boring, and uninspiring story just for that.I'm still at a complete loss to reconcile this train wreck of a book with The Journeys of Socrates. I supposed I can chalk it up to the fact that nearly three decades transpired between the books, and Millman must have learned how to write better during that time. I guess I'm just in the minority of readers who have very little positive to say about Way of the Peaceful Warrior. It's hard for me to imagine how this book has actually changed anyone's life in any major way. Obviously others enjoyed it immensely, though I honestly cannot fathom why"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is certainly not without its fine points of wisdom, mostly recycled, but you have to grind your way through layers and layers of cheese before you get to them. At the end, it won't leave a good taste in your mouth.It is hard to sympathize or relate to the woes of the main character who is a born world class champion without really trying, without having to sleep, rich enough to do and travel wherever he wants since his freshman year, doesn't have to study ever, can basically seduce and have any girl he ever wants on a whim and still is chosen among millions apparently by a Zen master of unlimited power to be trained into perfection. His trials and anguishes to \\"find himself\\"and his obsession with his happiness while giving zero concern to the welfare of the world at large are truly heartbreaking first-world problems.It doesn't help that the author is a mediocre writer at best. Take a pass on this one."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Like many others who have read this book, I was blessed to receive it from a good friend, who insisted I read it.Now, I had always thought myself as a spiritual person. I am Pagan, not Christian...so let's get that cleared up right away.I believe that due to my own Pagan/Wiccan lineage, that this book helped reaffirm my faith in the Creator, for I have never considered It to be of any \\"gender\\". This is purely a human intervention.As it is, when I read this book, it truly changed my life. I had an epiphany, in a trance state, right after I finished the book. Once I was through, I felt light as air. It was if I was floating off the ground for nearly a week. And for that week, I could not wipe the grin off my face, for just being grateful for being alive, as well as just being. The gift of Life itself on this Earth became so profound to me after this book, which was many, many years ago.Granted, now I'm just an old Crone again, but I will always treasure this book, and probably should re read it, just to get that \\"fix\\" again. Granted, it is not a permanent experience, that is up to you. But for me, even though much of it has worn off over the years, due to many hard times, heartaches, divorce, the death of my sister, my friends, and slowly watching the people I was closest to, slowly start to fade away out of my life, by death, or by \\"growing apart\\", still, if it wasn't for this book, I don't think I would even be here still today to talk about it.Trust me. Trust everyone who has read it, and has anything positive to say about it. Hell, just buy the damn thing. For I'm not a person who really cares whether or not you do. I'm just telling you, that if it could change my way of thinking, and thus, change my entire life, just by the realization that you're thoughts become your experiences that you react to in life, then it can certainly change yours.Read the book. Enough said."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Many people who read this book find themselves changed, even subtly, by the lessons within. I took it a step further. I am consciously applying these lessons and philosophies to my life.A little background.I'm 26, in the military, have an injured knee the doctors say will never recover fully and will hurt for the rest of my life, a failed marriage under my belt already, hate my job, find most of my coworkers intolerable, out of shape, diagnosed with anxiety, depression, insomnia.... the list goes on.I read this book two weeks ago.In that time, I have learned to be happy. I have learned to appreciate the world around me. Started getting along with my coworkers, mended old friendships that were crumbling, my knee is almost fully recovered after a year of chronic pain, my eating is better, I am sleeping better, waking up easier, and every day is a good day. Nothing AROUND me has changed. Only how I react to it. It's not always easy. Things still bother me. I still get angry, or sad. But now, it passes faster and I return to what has become my natural state. Happiness. Peace.This book can change your life if you let it. It tells you how, if you will listen. Some of the book is fictional. Dan Millman has never made any secrets about the fact that he embellished to make it a more interesting read, and to really get across how amazing Socrates was. This is OK.Because frankly, it doesn't matter whether it is all a complete historical autobiography or not. The LESSONS are real, and the teacher was real. I do not believe there is anyone on earth who cannot find some benefit from learning the way of the Peaceful Warrior.Read this book. Let it simmer in your thoughts. Let it guide you to the Way.

It's simple, straightforward with some basic wisdom.CONS:- Poor, infantile writing. Full of cliches. Predictable.- It's a shame that the author didn't write in the 3rd person. It would have been more effective, like Og Mandino's outstanding books. I had the same problem with \\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.\\" It's another book like this one. The author pretends he's the impulsive idiot and he meets some wise guy. It's a fine concept, but it's poorly executed here, just like in the \\"Monk\\" book.- This is fiction, although he tries to make it sound real, and I'm sure many of these things did indeed happen, but any make believe is fiction).

But when I saw the movie recently, I realized that the messages apply to all of us, perhaps in different ways. In any case, now that 20 years have passed since the book was written, many of the messages contained in it have been repeated elsewhere but the author has a genuine, non-guru-ish way of writing and explaining them that make them more real. For me, the most profound statement involved the difference between knowledge and wisdom-- with wisdom being found in taking action. How many of us have great ideas but seldom act on them? Guess we're not so wise. I have to admit, though, (and I think this is a first for me because I always prefer a book over a movie)-- I preferred the movie version. I think the director and writer beautifully take the essence of the book and find a way to make it cinematic without losing the meaning. They took key elements of plot and message and made them come more fresh and alive than in the book. So--read the book, but definitely rent or buy the movie!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This was a lovely, inspirational story.

Believe it! Dan Millman, a gymnastics student at the University of California, Berkeley, finds himself at a crucial point in his life, poised on the verge of manhood, and at the jumping off point of his own success. But somehow his life feels flat and empty. Without real meaning. That's when he meets Socrates at a gas station one day. The meeting is seemingly random, and Dan thinks that Socrates might not be playing with all of his marbles in the bag. He soon learns differently. &quot;When you are ready, a teacher will be presented to you.&quot; This is one of the first lessons that Dan learns from Socrates, and only one of many. His initial impression of Socrates is changed forever when he realizes that Socrates is the answer to all of the questions in Dans life...or rather, Dan finds out that he had all of the answers all along, just like Dorothy in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. I owned a total of 14 copies of this book since it was published, and found that I couldn't hold on to even one of them. They were all given to friends who I knew would benefit from the parables and life lessons that Dan learns. I met Dan Millman a few years later, and found that he wholeheartedly believes every word in that book, and that first book was the impetus for all of the following &quot;help&quot; books that he later wrote.

After I read it, it didn't take long before I started to enjoy every moment in life in a way I hadn't before. I didn't at once realize that it was my way of seing things that made me feel better. I thougt it was my new job or my wonderful girlfriend or our new house we'd just moved into...but it wasn't! Later it hit me that these kind of changings wasn't new to me. I'd been through bigger and more powerful things before without feeling any better. It was my way of SEING my life as an &quot;All Time Happening&quot; with no moment like the moment before. Sometimes I feel afraid of what is going to happen if I lose my way of &quot;seing&quot;, my &quot;strength&quot;, my way to guide myself through hard moments in my daily life, but for each time I get this worried it takes less time to get my personal &quot;strength&quot; back. If anyone would have told me 10 years ago that I, with all my heart and with love all around, should be leading projects and managing complex computer-networks I hadn't believed them...but my way of taking care of &quot;The everyday enlightments&quot; ...I don't know what to say...it really works, thats all! Sometimes I'd like to send my thanks to Soc, Mama Chia and Dan(the character) but I know that it is not important. What's important is to share this wonderful way of seeing to others, so they can start to live their life in their own way. I mean, this is not a school of how to live. It's a school of: HOW TO FIND YOUR OWN WAY OF TAKING CARE OF EVERY MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE, EVERYDAY! There isn't any &quot;The only way&quot;. There's a thousand of ways and you can choose any of them, as long as you choose it and live it with your heart. I love you all, and that's for sure..."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This was my husband Seth's favorite book. He died at 38, and I had such horrible pain when his parents asked me what to put on his tombstone. Nothing I could think of was adequate to express how much I loved him, how beautiful and brilliant he was, how passionate, and brave, how kind. No words could portray a man I remember as colors and sounds and passions. Then I remembered his favorite book. On his stone now, it says &quot;Peaceful Warrior.&quot; And it is perfect."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend as \\"a truly inspiring\\" story. The story lacks cohesion or continuity. As an example, the narrator is walking down the street, sees the \\"teaching character\\" (you could call him a guru or a spiritual leader if you want) do something \\"inexplicable\\". In order to get an explanation, the main character goes into the teacher's place of business and starts asking \\"How did you do that?\\" and then walks into the teacher's back office and sits down. The characters in the story react to this as if these actions are completely normal. This story takes place in Berkeley, CA, not exactly a place where walking into a stranger's back office is normal (or allowed).I have read half of the book so far. There are many instances of lucid dreaming or some sort of astral projection. As this is a \\"spiritual\\" book, the subject matter did not bother me. What did bother me was the lack of a set up for every single scene. Events happen with little or no explanation. The narration flits around emotions without any reason of why he went from happy to sad in the blink of an eye.This book basically reads like the ramblings of a narcotics addict. Some people may derive inspirational feelings from this. I got a headache and a large amount of disappointment."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I must admit, as I was reading this book, I radically changed my mind about what I wanted to write in this review. I went though a veritable roller-coaster of emotions; I hated it, I liked it, I loved it. By the end, I could almost guarantee that anyone reading this book will have a strong opinion on it.I know that this book finds it's way into the 'self-help' section of many bookstores, but I really hesitate to place it in that category, as it's not a how-to; the book doesn't explicitly state \\"do this and you will feel better\\", but rather it presents the reader with a narration of the author's life, after which it is up to the reader to decide what they want to take away from it.Dan's recount of his tales was really captivating. As I was reading it, I felt myself really associating with him and understanding the feelings he went through in his time with Socrates. At various points in the book, Millman recounts these short tales that almost read like fables. I would often stop and just try to extrapolate the morals behind these tales before going on to read what Millman had to say about them.Probably one of the most impressive things about this book is its emphasis on the value of hard work. Millman doesn't just experience a single event with Socrates: he embarks on a journey, a process that takes a great deal of time and effort to help transform him, to help him learn. At the beginning of the book, I had this great fear that the book would present Socrates as this 'silver bullet', this one magical fix for Dan's life, and so I was really pleased to see that that wasn't the case.Although I truly appreciate the message that Millman was trying to get across with his book, I have to admit that there were some things about it that put me off. First off, Millman's 'embellishments' in his story-telling were too much to take at times. While they may spice up the plot, I think it clouds some of the points the book is trying to get across. Reality is reality, fantasy is fantasy, and with a subject like this, getting the two confused can be dangerous.Another sticking point with me were some of the values that Socrates deemed unimportant and those he deemed invaluable. The care-free attitude that he and his friend Joseph embodied may work for them, but it forgets the responsibility that many people in this world have. A key example of this is parents: if their children make them unhappy, they can't just up and leave them. If they don't like their job, they can't just quit it if they don't have another one.At one point in the book, Socrates made a comment criticizing moderation, saying that it was only something for the bland, apologetic, and fence-sitters of the world. I feel Socrates is making a mistake here by confusing moderation with indecision. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong or harmful with being patient and making good, calculated decisions instead of foolish, impulsive ones.I do honestly believe this is a good work by Millman, and one that just about everyone reading it can get something out of. However, I would encourage people to take it with a grain of salt, and to really decide for themselves whether or not what they got out of the book applies to their own life."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Dan Millman's \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" is a wonderful adventure! It's a fun story, as the main character, \\"Dan\\", meets an enlightened teacher, Socrates, who shares insight on living life with ease, and free from the limiting thoughts of the mind. It's an engaging story line as Dan's world shifts from the ordinary to the extraordinary. I love how Dan Millman has created a novel that teaches with enlightening wisdom.As Dan Millman's character, Socrates, shares stories and jewels of wisdom that helped Dan find new meaning in his life, I have found that Ariel and Shya Kanes' books have done the same for me. Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment, How To Create a Magical Relationship and Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation are three books that teach a practical approach on how to live life in moment. It is such a revolutionary approach, instantaneous transformation - enlightenment can be experienced by all - EASILY and with consistency.If you find that you crave and search for well-being as Dan Millman's main character, the Kanes' books hold the keys that end the search."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A good introduction to a more satisfying life, Good story, well told and inspirational"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"for years now i have been searching for &quot;the answer&quot;. i know that sounds vague, but i dont know how to better describe it. i have read so many books in the search, and it had gotten me nowhere. until i bought this book. it isnt filled with abstract and impersonal ideas like so many other books i have read. this one struck a chord with me. i think it really does contain the secret to happiness.thats just my opinion though. dont take my word for it. read it and make your own judgements"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I found this book to be very interesting - at times quite fantastical. Its an inspirational book that left me wondering what to make of the story, and which aspects of it were fictional and which were fantasy.In the end, it emphasized some very important life lessons for a conscious spiritual path - lessons that are not unlike those offered in most books of this nature on the market today. The story is intriguing, but no deep revelations are offered up by this work. I would therefore prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars instead of the 4 that I have given to it. However, I believe that it is better than a 3-star rating although barely making it to 4 stars. Hence, my decision to rate it four stars.An earlier reviewer described this as Millman's best work. I hope not, because I am sufficiently motivated by this book to read some of his other books - I would not want them to be any less inspirational than this one."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read Apolo Ohno book, adn he said he had read this book and it really inspired him.

Some who read this book will read a story. Millman is writing beyond the story, and those who are so bothered after reading this book that they can't look at a tree the same way, were truly ready for its lesson. I lived with the notion that I understood far more than I ever wanted to at a young age, I always felt I got&quot;it&quot; the &quot;it&quot; that nobody else did.

I approached the book with mixed emotions, hoping to find something worthwhile and poignant, but at the same time skeptical of its &quot;New Age&quot; undertones. I was completely, totally, pleasantly surprised. Instead of rambling on for pages with pseudoscience I found a refreshingly upbeat and spiritual worldview that did not try to dethrone modern empirical thought. It did not speak of some ambiguous, omnipresent yet hidden God or Father or Babysitter, nor did it appeal exclusively to humanity's desire for something loftier than human existence. In fact, the only thing it really seemed to say, though the book expressed this in a wonderfully laid out parable, is that nothing is so real or so important as to last forever. &quot;Lighten up,&quot; is basically the moral of this story. And when compared to current popular works of philosophy/fiction such as the abhorrent Celestine Prophecy, which are rife with New Age psychobable and faulty logic, The Way of the Peaceful Warior is a pleasant change of pace. As an added bonus, the story, while a bit choppy at times, is actually quite good as fiction goes."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"THIS BOOK WAS INCREDIBLE!

And yet, even those with the most expansive reading lists rarely come upon a book that truly changes their lives. For me, at least, this book was one such gem among the millions. I sat down one Saturday afternoon, intending to read only the first chapter. I put the book down about four hours later in a state of wonder and awe, alive with the confidence that I could positively alter my life. What I found was that this book solidified a lot of what I had been thinking about for several years. After reading this, I felt like everything made perfect sense. I felt like I could gain the strength to meet the world on the level that I wanted to. And I still do. This book was an inspiration for me to begin to change my life in wonderful ways. Several months later, and after having read another of Mr. Millman's books, &quot;No Ordinary Moments,&quot; I have begun to bring myself out of my self-destructive habits. I have stopped biting my fingernails; I am no longer addicted to Coca-Cola or related products; I am more in touch with and more capable of expressing my emotions. Most important of all, however, is this: for the first time since about eight years ago, I am beginning to have a positive self-image. This may not sound like anything particularly wonderful, but this book and its author have the power to change lives, and the fact remains: my life IS changing. Regardless of who you are, I recommend reading this book. Even if it doesn't bring your world into perspective or make you effect change in your life, it will at least give you another interesting view of the world, one with which it is well worth your while to be familiar. Even if it doesn't change your outlook on life, it is a wonderful and uplifting story. For anyone on any spiritual journey, or anyone that wishes to realize the potential of their life, this is a worthwhile read. I cannot think of a book that I would recommend more highly"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior changed me. It transformed me into a being who will never trust the title of a book again. The degree pseudo-intellectualism and ridiculous insight within the pages of this book are only surpassed by the one-dimensionalness of the characters. I was forced by an employer to read this book and it only took a glance at the cover art and quick scan of the blurb to blow the top off of my lame-o-meter. The \\"sage\\" is a rude mystic who seems to hide every nugget of insight within a crusty coating of belittling insults. The progagonist is a somewhat dense, however sexually satisfied jock, who undergoes supernatural experiences vaguely reminiscent of peyote induced spirit quests. The entire time I read this story, I felt like I was listening to the ramblings of a person who has been brainwashed by a cult. If I were less opinionated, I would say that this book is not for me. Because I AM so opinionated, I'd say this book is not for anyone. If you haven't bought it, don't. If you have already purchased it, you could use it as a coaster."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The way of the peaceful warrior does an excellent job driving home how precious and short our time on earth is. It teaches to live less seriously but more intensely. For that Dan Millman deserves credit. On the other hand, it has plenty of falsehoods that really detract from the book's value, and some of them were downright dangerous. The mentor, Socrates, spends the book teaching Dan the peaceful warrior's way to live. Among other lessons, he drives home the point that life's goal is not gaining knowledge. Dan Millman then demonstrates his lack of knowledge in many of the things he writes. First, &quot;peaceful warrior&quot; is like &quot;sleeping insomniac&quot; or &quot;vegetarian shark.&quot; They don't go together. In one scene, Socrates is forced to subdue some attackers in self defense. Acting in self defense hardly makes one a warrior, and Socrates displays great proficiency with something similar to Aikido. Yet never does the author mention where, how, and why our peaceful warrior gained this proficiency. Second, Socrates uses tales of Ninja youths being taught to jump over a corn seedling as it grows until it reaches its full height, and the young ninja can do incredible feats. Corn was developed in the Americas, and I don't believe it found its way to Japan until after the Ninjas were largely gone. And a long daily regimen of jumping falls into the realm of plyometrics, exercise with little documented benefit and large documented risk of joint damage. Third, Dan is introduced to a strict vegetarian diet, with the exception of cheese. A quick look at any vegetarian literature shows that cheese's health benefit ranks equally with that of whole milk, ice cream, and bacon. Vegetarian with cheese is like Low fat diet and Dunkin Donuts. The book is worth reading once, and most of the lessons are valuable to anyone. But don't take it too seriously, especially any references to willful ignorance."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"It was good but it was to long the listen to the whole thing"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Reading the book word to word and then reviewing the promotional website, the authors confesses that none of the events in the book actually happened except the normal life events of going to college,mating,marrying,working etc. The book can be interesting at times but the mixing of philosophy, spirtituality and author's own life is ridiculous. The thoughts presented by the author have been clearly borrowed from Eastern culture and you see a \\"cocktail\\" version. Yet the world is full of different people and someone or the other will purchase this book and make their own judgements. To conclude, the book is fake concotion and not nearly original.

I read this book about 5 years ago and have never been the same. I experienced an awakening, as one might call it when they are being enlightened, while reading this book. This book opened doorways for me that i didn't know even existed. I was so interested in the subject that i finished the book in only a few sittings which at the time was fast for me b/c i was not reading much during that period in my life. I am now an avid reader and spiritualist and i can honestly accredit it to this book. Now would i have found my path from a different source had i not read The Way of the Peaceful Warrior? More than likely yes but for whatever reason this was the right story at the right time for me. For those of you who are already on \\"the path\\" i can't say whether or not this will change you but i do know it couldn't hurt to read it. Many copies of this book have gone through my hands and everyone i know who has read it has benefited from it's message. If you could use a little inspiration for life this could just do the trick and possibly make you a better person. Thank you Dan Millman!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Yes, I felt this book was both inspired and original. It obviously has its roots in the human potential movement of the 70's, but that's not exactly a bad thing. One does wonder however if there's not a little too much said about the enlightened experience, or if the author has really tasted the silence of the all pervasive reality, the one that is ever present, simple, yet extremely difficult to perceive.But this is a great read for martial artists who are still caught up in the ego drama of competition, of winning and losing, and violence. It's tender in the right places, rather than gory like a movie. Even Bruce Lee falls short of the true meaning of the martial artist's true calling. It is a path that leads to enlightenment, and the demons you encounter are inevitably your own!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book after advice from a friend who was at the time a brown-advanced belt in Karate. I was told to read it with an open mind not knowing what the book was about. I found it quite easy to get into but some bits were a bit laborious, never the less I carried on and finished the tale. There were times when reading this book that sparked emotions and feelings that I can only describe as not felt since I was a child. The end of the tale was utterly inspiring and I felt so different by the time I put it down, it deffinitly had an affect on my life and thinking and I would reccomend it be read by all. Take what you want from this book, I read it as a work of fiction and didn't expect to feel the way I did. I read the book in 1997 and want to read it again because I know that it changes my whole outlook on life."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I don't know if this book does indeed \`change lives' as it claims, but it does a good job of presenting a healthy philosophy of life. The story was a bit too \`goody goody' for my taste though. I much prefer Regan's novel, \`The Evolution of a Warrior'. Still, I highly recommend Millman's book as well."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I would add to the title &quot;A Book That Changes Lives&quot; - &quot;For People Who Wants and Ready For A Change...&quot;.

This is a wonderful book for people who are willing to open their minds for new and interesting concepts of life. You don't have to accept every idea that you will find here, but I'm sure that you will find a few ideas that you would like to adopt. The book is very simple to read also for people that their english is not their first language (like me). I think it is always better to read a book in his original language. I won't write anything farther than that because: &quot;The book speaks for itself&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A story of a young man, who has been blinded by the reality that has been pulled over his eyes like most of us, but he runs into an old man who awakens him and teaches him the ways of a peaceful warrior.

This book really should not even be offered by Amazon. This book is an infamous tool used by people who are into S&M to destroy their victims' free will. Reading this book is boring at best; but dangerous at worst. The protagonist IS a willing slave to Socrates...who uses physical abuse and mind control in order to destroy Dan's ability to think for himself. Perhaps Millman isn't aware that this is what happened to him. He should check himself in for some help. There are programs to help de-program victims of psychological torture."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I don't want to repeat other criticisms of this book, but only to add an additional perspective. I find it hard to fathom how a young man who went to UC Berkeley in the '60's can assert that he attained a high level of awareness during and slightly after that period without once mentioning, or showing he had any consciousness of, the great social forces and events that were occuring in that period: the Vietnam War and the anti-war movement, the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, Gay Liberation, the Free Speech Movement (at Berkeley itself), the Black Panthers, the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.--the list goes on and on."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is a very nice book that helps people to become better human beings, I just wish I could correctly follow the 'lessons' this book dibbies out. It's not that I don't have personal discipline, its just that the way the characters act in Dan's book is not condusive to modern living. I mean, I just don't have time to sit on a tire all day to think about how to be a humble person. I have to work 60 + hours a week to support myself in a very troubling economic climate, and when I try to live like Dan Millman would like me to live, it's just really hard being super-healthy, ultra-compassionate, intensely spiritual, super goal-oriented, etc., with all of the other duties I must perform every day. In 'Way of the Peaceful Warrior,' Mr. Millman introduces us to a strange character named 'Socrates', but this character is not the real Socrates from Greek times, but is as strange person who works at a gas station.Now, I sometimes exchange a few words with the people who work at the gas station when I go there, but they never seem to offer me too much advice beyond automotive products and snacks and debit cards and stuff. I mean, they are nice for the most part, and intelligent enough, but I just fear that the sort of people Dan Millman writes about in this book are not real sort of people, so it is not fair for Mr. Millman to put all these demands on us to live like Ghandi when we have problems like terrorist hijackings and a bearish economy to struggle through. I mean, I think I am a good person at heart, but c'mon Dan, what am I supposed to do? I only get about four hours of sleep a night as is. I think I should be reading 'How to Schedule three days in a row off of work in a year' instead of Dan's 'How to run around town looking for enlightenment when you don't need to worry about dealing with the pressures and realities of urban modern life.' Sorry Dan, but we all can't be authors with time to burn this sort of self-improvement stuff."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I'd like to start off my review by noting one thing about all the other reviews on this page.They are all written from the point of view of:1. I exist2. It was my choice to read this book.3. It is my choice to review it.4. I am deciding how I evaluate the information in this book....and on and on it goes.But what this book tells us, is that we don't exist, we don't control our actions, and the whole thing is a movie played by nothing, and watched by nobody. Therefore, reviewing this book, is contradicting what it teaches.There is one awareness in this world. Only one. And it is observing this movie being played. The individual people have no power over what they do, anymore than Frodo Baggins has power over what he does in The Lord of the Rings. Inside the story, he's controling his actions, but when you come out of the story, you see it's all prewritten, and none of the characters can change what happends. It's the same with what we would call \\"real life\\".99.9 percent of people who read this book, will think it's a great book because it's well written, and has an interesting story line, but 0.01 percent of people who read it, will come out of it realising that the Identity they thought they were is seperate from the Awareness that observes all.Dan Millman, as great a writer as he is, cannot do the impossible, and the impossible, is getting through to people that their character is not the awareness.As you are reading this review, i'd like you to catch yourself reading it from those four point I mentioned above. I can't get through to you, because you are listening from the point of view that 1. you exist, 2. it's your choice to read this review, 3. no matter what this review says, I still am who I am... and on and on.That's why the number of enlightned people in this world can be counted on 2 hands, because nobody takes on the possibility that they don't control their actions, and that they are not themselves.99.999% of humans have this brick wall around them, that all words pass through, on their way to them. The brick wall is made up of the same thoughts I mentioned above. Most people will never hear things, without knowing that no matter what they're being told, they exist, and they are who they are.So, Dan Millman did an amazing job, but for 99.9 percent of people it will not bring about spiritual enlightment.Thank you Dan Millman."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I had the delivery sent to a detention facility andbecause there are CD's included it was returned.

Sorry, but it had very little to offer other than a nice story in which to make a movie."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"For a book claiming that it \\"changes lives\\" it leaves a lot to be desired. But it is not a bad book per say. The ideas expressed in book are in general true, though highly exaggerated, it is written for a simple audience with 7th grade reading skills. The event in the book are forced and generally unbelievable and uninteresting.The \\"wisdom\\" taught seems to come out of nowhere. Don't expect an Aristotilian logical methodology here, the author doesn't feel like using reason to make his point, his magical characters just \\"know\\" somehow. And often contradict themselves; there is a point where the realization is made that happiness can only be achieved by simply being \\"happy\\" not doing anything or thriving, the passive state of happiness and enjoying the grass growing. If that is such a good way of living, why is Mr. Millman, the author of the book publishing books and holding lectures? Why not just sit on a hill and enjoy the beauty that is nature until starvation or death \\"reunites\\" him with the eternal cycle? I mean why wait?

Start living now."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The reason i bought this book was because i liked the element of 'living in the present' which was displayed in the film, so i wanted to dig deeper by reading the book. Reading through the book i enjoyed the easy-to-read and high detail explanation of the main character's journey. But as i went deeper into the book i just noticed that it was obviously 'New Age', now that is something most people won't argue about, and i don't hate some of the truths in it, but i don't like the overall of that 'religion'. So even though i like the author's storytelling and some of the philosophy (like the one of living in the present) i don't go into the 'new age' being a christian. I can read a story of metaphors, but when the author makes the story into an obvious religion which contradicts mine, i can't go further. Now to end this review, i was satisfied with the storytelling and detailing but not with the overall philosophy."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I bought this book for my sister-in-law and she loves it...once she's finished with it is my turn.It's my understanding (word of mouth)that this book is worth it's weight in gold!Need to read it (analize)to give a really good review!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"In 1966, Dan Millman was a jock/Gymnast, obnoxious, a stud and a playah. While unable to sleep he goes for a walk or jog and goes to an all-night Texaco service station where he meets an aging hippy he nicknames \\"Socrates\\". Socrates is an enigma inside a riddle. Socrates gets Dan's attention by some how getting on to the roof of the service station in a few seconds, so Dan bugs Socrates trying to find out his secrets. Slowly he learns to stop being such a douche and becomes a decent human being.Over a course of two years Dan learns all these new \\"secrets\\" to life, when they aren't really secrets at all. Socrates and a girl name Joy teach him lessons of life. After reading this book, you may begin to notice the small details in life.So Socrates teaches Dan all he can and sends him on his way to live. Dangets married, has a few careers a kid, and eventually his marriage fails, he fails and goes on a long hike in the Sierra Nevada. Where he runs into Socrates again. They talk and talk over a couple of days. Dan eventually ends-up back in Berkley for one last meeting with Socrates, in which Socrates disappears, raptures away or goes back to his mothership (that isn't discussed in the book, in the book he goes into the bathroom and in a flash he is gone). Dan eventually is divorced and marries Joyce aka Joy. Dan Millman wishes Socrates could have been there, but realizesSocrates is there, he is everywhere.I highly recommend this book. It is a quick easy read. Enlightening and amusing. Dan will totally annoy you. But Socrates will not! It has the possibility of changing your life, if you employ Socrates' hippy teachings."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I bought the book immediately after the seeing the movie.

The growth that occurs within the character is enchanting.A very enjoyable way to learn some very important lessons about balance and living in the NOW."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a great story, with great lessons. Nothing less. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is an AMAZING story that changes the life of all who read it. After seeing life with the eyes of Dan Millman you will never see life the same again. Reading this book is like looking into a pool of blue water. Every thing that life has been trying to tell you, if you look at it in the light, it is very clear. There is no way around this being a GREAT book. I would not go a day more not knowing what I have learned about MYSELF within this book. The Way of the Peaceful Warrior sets you on your own journey in finding your personal meaning in life. I highly recomend this to all who seek a higer purpose in life or all who just want to read a good story!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Millman, or at least his publishing company try to portray him as the intellectual equal of Socrates, or perhaps Plato. Sadly, all he does is re-hash \\"Bubblegum Zen\\" philosophy, advocate vegetarianism and equate gymnastics with some deep meditative process. Worse, he does it with little sense of writing style, numerous factual errors, and a creepy relationship between him and an underage girl named Joy.One would expect a warrior, even a peaceful one, to show qualities like courage, stoicism, honor, loyalty, and so forth. Millman's self-portrayal is a whining, self-pitying, individual who shows absolutely no loyalty to his first wife (the most likable character in the book) and daughter. Particularly saddening is that his daughter is little more than a footnote, the reader never gets to feel any parental emotion from Millman.Millman also is not so much an actor as something that is acted upon by outside forces. He has no apparent free will. His early ennui is caused by society, his enlightenment is caused by Socrates, his misery is caused by his wife, his happiness by Joy. He even blames her for leading him on about her age. I really don't understand how Millman could not have guessed that this girl for whom he was pining was not of age. He doesn't come across as dumb. His willingness to give in to every one of Socrates' demands too is a little bothersome, didn't the Heaven's Gate, Branch Davidian and Jonestown folks think their leaders were deeply enlightened? Think before you obey.The best thing about this book is that it is an easy read, and most philosophy books do read like bad VCR instructions. However, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, the Tao of Pooh and the Te of Piglet, are just as easy to read, a lot more fun, and have better messages. For that matter, Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten is also an easy to read book that changes lives.Some of you love this book, and that is really great, but please don't let this be an end to any search for enlightenment, after all there are five major world religions, dozens of minor ones, and dozens of schools of philosophy to explore. This book is a dip in a kiddy pool, let's try for the deep end."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"There are some tidbits of wisdom to be gained here, but I take issue with Millman's lack of Love or simple human Compassion in this story. Typically, in the mentor/student relationship there is plenty of room for an impatient sage shaking some sense into an egotistical student. The problem is that Socrates takes this to the extreme, constantly belittling his student through almost 180 pages, almost eroding his own credibility in the process. While we want to learn that Death is not necessarily a finality of our existance, I cannot understand the model of a mentor who purposely brings Death to his student as part of a lesson plan. It's too cynical of a philosophy for me to comprehend. After all, isn't Socrates trying to teach Millman how to LIVE? Maybe Humor, Paradox, and Change are the key elements of life for Socrates and Millman, but I have to believe that Love has to exist somewhere in the mix too. After all, isn't Millman seeking this too? Lastly, Millman abandons his progeny to take a fanciful journey around the world instead of taking care of his responsibilities. Millman dismisses his own child in favor of selfish pursuits. What kind of \\"Warrior\\" would do this? I was rather shocked."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I picked up this book because i had read that Phil Jackson had passed it on to one of his players in order to send a message. I wish i had never read that article about Phil, because i wasted 2 weeks try to get through that book. I am a very fast reader usually, but the horrible writing and the ridiculousness of the story just kept making me put the book down. I really wanted to throw the book away, but i kept searching and hoping for some great revelation, so i eventually finished it. How do i feel now? Like i wish i could get that portion of my life back. The message was hokey, the story telling was stupid, and the writing was garbage. Did i really need to read 200 pages to understand Dan's message of living in the moment and being happy? Nope. One paragraph would have been sufficient.Even if you have an IQ of 75 and are a remedial read at best,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A book that changes lives!? Inspirational, perhaps. (Though surely not as inspirational as the many true stories of people who have overcome exceptional setbacks such as cancer). But it escapes me how so many reviewers can assert that this book has been life altering since it offers little more than spiritual truisms? How many people read the book and do anything differently? Do they become vegetarians? Or gymnasts? Or do they hang around gas stations waiting to meet their mystical master? Far better for someone to actually take lessons in Tai chi or Aikido which provide practical means to put some of the tenets in Way of Peacful Warrior to work.Way of Warrior seems to be a compilation of various spiritual paths: a little Zen, a little Aikido, a little Castenada, a little _____ (fill in your favorite new age discipline). In the 1970s there was a popular book making the rounds called &quot;Be Here Now,&quot; which proffered the Eastern principle of living in the moment.If you want to read a book that might challenge your conceptions of how you approach the world, try Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.&quot; If you want a book to provide some practical advice on following a non-western spiritual journey, try William Reed's &quot;KI - A Path Anyone Can Travel&quot; which offers actual methods for breathing, meditating, healing, living.Parting shot -- Dan Millman should have taken more writing courses at UC Berkeley. Maybe then he would have avoided the juvenile, melodramatic style that he succombs to."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"While I enjoyed the book, there were aspects of it that just didn't allow it to leave the impact a lot of other people felt.I found the dialogue written far too poorly for my taste. People just do not talk like that. It was far too corny, and it really took me out of the story quite a bit, smiling at how absurd some of it was. I was also, surprisingly, turned off by the whole \\"magical\\" aspect of the book. Stories like this always seem to work best when you believe they could happen. With this one, I found myself openly thinking to myself (quite often), \\"I'm supposed to be buying into this?\\"I thought it was a decent story, and I can certainly tell it is something that could be very meaningful to some people.

However, I didn't find much inspiration in &quot;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.&quot; Dan's whole journey of self-discovery seemed incredibly selfish and isolating, almost the essence of a male model of success (not a model that all males would agree with, but a model based on stereotypically male values and power). I wonder if others have noticed this--if women in particular have felt alienated by the path he took and message he puts forth. Dan's first wife and daughter sure seemed to get pushed aside, and his union with Joy read like pure fantasy. I know they are really married, and I wish them all the happiness in the world, but to me Dan's story read like a cautionary tale to make sure people don't make life-long commitments until they have a better idea of their own identities.

I've kept it there since it was once recommended to me, but I never felt the inclination to read it until now. Upon facing life-changing choices about schools, career, residence, following spirit, and going with what life hands me...I finally decided to open this book. As it was when I was a kid and read the Tolkien Trilogy, reading the pages of this book transported me to an altered state while flying from Montana to California. My awareness and excitement were expanded. With this book I realized that I cannot make a wrong choice in whichever direction I take; I can use these two years of school training to also train my awareness as a female warrior of the human spirit. I can see the perspectives revealed in the book as applicable in my life and I look forward to how I will put them to work. The next book of Millman's that I may read will be the Mind Body-Inner Athlete book, but only after I allow the ideas from the Peaceful Warrior to unfold in my life in a new residence, school, and career path; in physical and mental healing, in running, being happy, and being OK with having/doing a regular job.

I found Socrates's teaching style to be very ineffective. he wasn't teaching Dan how to live as much as he was teaching him to follow orders. maybe Dan needed structure, very common in Red stage of development. at least Socrates touches upon what is to me the most effective and evolved method of learning - contemplation, when he says you need test it out and experience it for yourself (which unfortunately constitutes 1 paragraph in the whole book). But it is outweighed by his teaching METHOD through out the rest of the book... which has nothing to do with leading Dan to awareness, but instead has to do with essentially teaching, im right and your wrong; its my way not your way... this is not contemplative education this is regurative education and the authoritative fallacies he uses teaches submission to authority. Dan does not care so much in transcending limitation as he does pleasing his \\"mentor\\" Socrates. which is also reinforced by Socrates. the behavior in itself, is a behavior seen in red stage of development. (which is fine, because you have to through each stage of development, but has nothing to do with transcendence and connection to the absolute). However Socrates ridicules Dan calling him a jackass countless times, in actuality, reinforcing egoic identification (doesnt seem like skillful means, in fact there are little to no skillful means in this book). the case can be made that he is trying to trigger Dan, but Dan is no where at the stage of development to do shadow work like this. Socrates is most likely traumatizing him instead. Conclusion, for integrally informed people: it seems this book maybe good for red stage of development, but lacks for higher stages of development. for non integrally informed and integrally informed people: Teaching methods used here seem like regurative education methods, authoritative fallacies - submission to authority. Its probably good if you need a father to tell you what to do, and if so than this book is probably good for you. for those off put by the teaching method, keep in mind its the teaching method - not what is being taught that is the issue here. the majority of what is being taught is zen and aikido and to me is legit. unfortunately, its the teaching method that often influences ones relationship to what is being taught. this book is basically summed up in \\"im right, your wrong. im awesome you suck. live my way, not your way.\\" and it just so happens that his way incorporates a lot of zen... his method however is irringly similar to fundamentalism. a lot of socrates conditioning influence his teachings, and its almost an unfortunate way to be introduced into zen, unless your at red stage of development (in my book). if you want a good book and are at higher stage of development, i suggest you check out \\" Shambhala, the sacred path of the warrior\\" by chogyam trungpa rinpoche, which seems to be for post modern +. if your modern, you might be interested in the dalai lamas work, hes a genius. and he seems to targets modern +, and also might be interested in sakyong mipham rimpoche works such as turning the mind into an ally. if you want a good intro to zen, you might be interested in zen mind, beginners mind. my disclaier is consider it, and decide for yourself. holding frame works and maps lightly, who is that is experiencing it all?"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I really enjoyed this, some stages not sure if it was fiction or non fiction - good for the soul"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Book was in great shape and I received it in a timely manner.

The messages are clear. If you want something without a story, check out Live Like A Fruit Fly."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Feeling the burn in this, our time-starved, fragmented, info-overloaded world? You might do well to adopt the warrior's path, that of freedom from ego, release from attachments, and finding happiness in the service of others. It's easy to see why this book has been changing lives for nearly 30 years.Dan's break from training made for the most poignant part of the book for me. Sent away by Socrates, Dan lives 8 years of his life and wonders if he's just starting all over again. Who on the path to a better self hasn't felt that way? Learning the principles is one thing - living them is something else again. Daily practice takes the courage of a warrior.That said, I have to be honest: the poor writing kept me from truly getting the most out of the experience of reading this book. Obviously it hasn't hurt the book's success in getting its message out into the world, and for that I'm glad, but it did make for some rough going in spots. I couldn't help but wonder what might have been had the book NOT read like an endless parade of \\"And then this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened...\\"That the messages are as relevant as ever (if not more so) and this book's stature in field make it required reading for personal growth aficionados. But for lovers of the written word, it's a bit like eating your broccoli: great for you, but no picnic going down.Lastly - do check out the movie! While there are differences, I was very impressed with how director Victor Salva captured the spirit of the book with gorgeous and effective visual storytelling (there's a scene where Dan meets himself on a rooftop that I'm thinking of in particular)."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The book is a gift but I received it very quickly.

I've given it as gifts to those I love and everyone who has read it has told me the same thing. A must buy! However, as good as Peaceful Warrior is don't read Millman's other books, Sacred Journey or Socrates. As most reviews have stated, they are a disappointment. My opinion is that Millman had one good book in him, and that was Peaceful Warrior. His only other book that was okay, was No Ordinary Moments. If you really want to read a book by Millman after Peaceful Warrior read No Ordinary Moments, but that's it! Lastly, another really good book is University for Success.

By the way, have you wondered who Socrates is and whether he is real? From my point of view it seems very clear that most of what Socrates says in this book is a direct take off the teaching of Adi Da Samraj, a spiritual teacher that Dan Millman was a devotee of in the 1970's in California. Being a devotee of Adi Da Samraj, myself, and being very familiar with his teaching, it is obvious that this is so. If you go to www.adidam.org you can find out more about this teacher who is alive today and who offers a relationship with all who yearn for real heartbreaking freedom and happiness. You can look up the essay on Divine Ignorance for the correlation of where Socrates talks on page 28 \\"You are ignorant of where the universe is; nor do you know what anything is or how it came to be. It's a mystery.\\" Adi Da Samraj's book of wisdom teaching for children \\"What, Where, When, How, Why, and Who To Remember To Be Happy\\" is also the same consideration written for children."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I am on the path to reading all of Dan Millman's books.

From Dan Millman's book, I went on to Joseph Campbell to the Dalai Lama to any number of other thinkers and people who are merging Western thought with Eastern spirituality... and all of it began for me with this book. There are no accidents. I stumbled upon this book in a bookstore in Atlanta a few years ago. The cover had the blurb that it &quot;changes lives.&quot; I didn't expect that much.

If the reader allows him or herself to let go of &quot;Dan's&quot; personal struggles with his journey and realize that the massages being delivered are universal in their goal yet each individual's approach will and should vary drastically, this book offers an exceptional starting point in spiritual discovery and growth. We should also remimber that most if not all true mentors come from within and we shouldn't count on finding the mythical gas station guru to kick us in the pants an point us in the right direction.Despite any of my above criticism, I applaud this book, has it has been instrumental in assisting me in taking the next step in my own personal growth."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I got to know the character Socrates over a dozen years ago, when an oddball friend of mine lent me his copy of The Way of the Peaceful Warrior. At the time, I was a gung ho entrepreneur with no interest in spirituality. Socrates' teachings, such as \\"all your answers lie within,\\" \\"there are no accidents,\\" and, my favorite, \\"we all make our own sandwiches,\\" coincided with a series of cataclysmic events that completely uprooted my belief system.Once I realized that reality was nothing like I had been led to believe, I began studying various spiritual disciplines.

As it is based only loosely on real-life experiences, I found the authentic segments about Millman's inner emotional life to begin to move me, but was distracted and even annoyed by the plainly fictionalized passages and events, particularly the supernatural feats of Socrates. To feel that a wise mentor needs to be enhanced with magic powers is to gild the lily. The more I was touched by Millman's growth and his relationship with Socrates, the more I wanted to know the true story and the true Socrates. I was convinced that Millman had a profound learning experience, and I felt 'ripped off' by the fact that he didn't share that true experience, but instead offered only his often overdone, enhanced retelling.But for a young audience it may be a great antidote to the kind of materialism, ambition, and emotional armoring that society encourages, especially in men. And it is also a decent introduction to some eastern thought, retold in a language accessible to a youthful american readership.Marketed to a youth audience, I might give it 4 stars, but I think that complete honesty and authenticity are too important a part of growth, healing and spirituality to recommend this book over all the other possible titles in the genre."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I have read several \\"self-help\\" books, and the advice in almost all of them is to focus on what you want to get.

If you spend all of your time focusing on the home you \\"will have\\" in 10 years or that dream job/car or whatever it may be for you(and this is exactly what \\"The Secret\\" suggests you do) you will not be able to enjoy the moment you are in.

Would you set your whole life aside for a man the promises you a life time of happiness, before you even know who the man is? In this book a student named Dan, puts his college and carrier to a sudden stop when he meets a man named Socrates. He tells Dan that he knows the path to finding unreasonable happiness, and Dan is willing to find that path.Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a funny book, and very good book. It shows you while reading the book, how you can live your life and reach happiness on another level, then just laughing all day. It shows how you can in joy life, to the littlest detail. The best part in the book I would have to say is when Dan pushes past his mentally expectations and pushes his body to it's limits, breaking past his blocked mind from seeing, life to its fullest.This mind is the one thing that holds back yourself and the body from reaching great height. The constant thoughts that pass through your head, the talking that you do to yourself, and telling yourself that you can't do anything. It's like a poison that holds you down from accomplishing anything. The mind is a limitation to our body and our spirits. I think that this is the message that Dan Millman was trying to send to his readers, that when u move passed the mind, you can live life to its fullest.The book is a great book, one of the best I have read. It was hard for me to put it down, and thoughts were always racing through my head of what was going to happen next, and why something happened the way it did. I recommend this book to who ever would want to read it."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I first read \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" well over twenty years ago, but since I recently saw the movie based on the book, I decided to reread it. What Dan Millman has succeeded in doing so well is taking a core set of profound and eternal \\"truths,\\" many of which are inspired by Buddhist and zen thought, and popularizing them through an intriguing and enigmatic figure referred to throughout the story as \\"Socrates.\\" Now just who is Socrates in reality? Well, I believe that Socrates is probably a fictionalized composite of several people and inspirational writings that Dan Millman himself had the good fortune of encountering during a certain period of his youth. Perhaps some will see Socrates as an aspect of Millman's higher self, or perhaps as some type of dream guide, etc.. But it really doesn't matter after all. The important thing here is that I am quite certain that many people have read and enjoyed this book who might otherwise never pick up a book on zen or Buddhism or any of the other strains of eastern or so-called new-age thought. I had the privilege of meeting Dan Millman about a dozen years ago. He is a very unassuming and down-to-earth man. I believe this is a classic tale that will endure the test of time long after most of the \\"new-age\\" literature has gone by the wayside. At any rate, if you have the slightest interest in this book but have never read it, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. If you read it some time ago, but only once, read it again. It's definitely worth another go-around. For what it's worth, do not be dissuaded from seeing the movie (\\"Peaceful Warrior\\" starring Nick Nolte as \\"Socrates\\") because of the negative reviews by some film critics. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it captured the essence of the book exceedingly well."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"It was the summer of 1991, and I found myself in the depths of despair. I turned to a small self-help bookstore for help, and soon came across Dan Millman's Way of the Peaceful Warrior. It was a book that touched me intimately and deeply, and empowered me to take a giant step in my own spiritual growth. Now, I run a wellness center and am a self-help author myself, sharing, much like Dan does, my own story of the spiritual triumph in The Spirit of Joy. I am always grateful for Dan's book, and refer back to it with fondness, as it helped opened doors that I had left closed in my life for far too long."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I have always loved this book.

I have met the Kanes too - they are amazing and inspiring people who help people discover how to live in the Now."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"So here's my experience with the book: I first purchased this book when I was 15. And to tell you the truth I don't recall why. And I read it in one sitting. I came away from the reading with a sense of &quot;Wow, that's really amazing. That was a really cool book.&quot; However I did NOT feel that the book lived up to it's subtitle &quot;The Book that Changes Lives&quot; In fact I thought it was a practice in pretension to label it as Millman did. And I put the book away and forgot about it...(dramatic pause)... or so I thought (BUM BUM BUM). You see it wasn't until I was 17 or so that I began to realize that the book had made a grand impact on my life. I realized that I was seeing the world in a completely different way... that I was learning to &quot;let things go&quot; to have fewer expectations from life and enjoying more what life was giving me. And through practice (which probably will continue for the rest of my life, these changes have continued and refined themselves in the years following this revelation. Of course a portion of these changes are due to me simply maturing and evolving as a person from age 15 to present. The book however set me on the right path for who I am and who I am to become as time goes on. My path may be differnt than yours- and I think that's the point and the reason that the reviews on this site are either very high or very low. For some this book resonates on a deep level and for others they see only the words. This is not to put value judgements on &quot;getting it&quot; or &quot;not getting it&quot;. This bok is only one of the paths that leads to wherever it is that we are all headed as humanity. Each of us, (if i may be allowed a new age moment), is a person &quot;becoming&quot; and at different rates. It is not a question of is this book is right or wrong, it is a question of whether this book is right or wrong for whom. In this case that &quot;whom&quot; is you... and there is only one way to find out and that is to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is not new material. I wouldn't say it is groundbreaking or that it changed my life. Probably because I am already acquainted with the principles of Buddhism and Eastern thinking. So I didn't find anything new here that would give me a \\"wow\\" factor like all the other reviews claim. What I did find is that it presents the ideology in a down-to-earth, real-life format, thus making it easy for one to understand how to apply the principles to one's own life. The character of Socrates, the teacher, is lovable and so well done that you really feel he's there with you. The storyline is well put together. Parts of it were taken from the author's own life and some were created, but they are seamlessly intertwined. The story flows and the book is a quick read. Millman also incorporates Plato's allegory of the cave and some zen koans within the plot to help enlighten you on some of the points that are presented. I already knew about Plato's allegory and some of the zen koans from before, they are classics, so they were not new to me but I did enjoy seeing how they were applied to the main storyline.And now for the criticism. There were two things I didn't like about this book.1. How little time or explanation Millman incorporates about his failed marriage and daughter. It just seems like a hiccup in his life. And that is why I believe Zen can only take you so far. I believe there is more to life than just letting everything go. What about forming relationships? What about atoning for your actions? If you hurt someone, it is not enough for you to realize it and let it go, you have to take action. At least seek forgiveness, let the person know you made a mistake and that you are sorry. Zen just seems to put you in a bubble and the truth is, we all are not solitary monks. We constantly interact with people, which brings me to point #2.2. The author tries to breeze through the subject of altruism by making a couple of statements here and there. Apparently, learning to be a happy person by not wanting anything makes you care for others. I didn't buy it. The author doesn't really explain or give examples as to how achieving enlightenment will make you care for others. As a matter of fact, he even relates an anecdote in which he got upset when a homeless man asked him for money. He justifies his reaction buy just saying that all one has to do is just let it go. What about realizing that the anger was a result of the guilt of not giving the man any money? Again, the problem with Zen. It's great for learning how to be happy if you live in a bubble, but it doesn't give you guidelines on how your relationship to others should be. It only focuses on the self. That's kinda selfish when you think about it. There has to be more to life than just attaining your own enlightenment. What about putting that enlightenment into action by helping others and being a compassionate person?Overall, this is a good quick read. It might be beneficial for unenlightened souls. But for those who are already on the path, it's nothing to rave about."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I cannot give any book that gives useful life messages less than five stars, because I don't want to discourage anyone from reading it, however, the story in this book can drag at times. Although, the messages that it contains are necessary for the journey of the soul and it is definitely on my list of must reads. What I personally got out of the book is the importance of living in the NOW, not the past or future. What am I doing with myself right now? If you ask yourself this question often, you will find yourself being more productive. There are plenty of wonderful and inspiring passages in this book that will change your life, for example, &quot;There are no accidents, everything has a purpose.&quot; Another key message from the warrior may be: Don't ever think you have learned enough - or life will throw you some hard lessons. Just when you think the character understands something, he gets thrown a hardball, similar to the course of life. At times you feel sorry for him, but he can be so cocky! Learning to be humble is one of life's greatest lessons as well."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"For my independent book project I read the book Way of the Peaceful Warrior, by DanMillman. Set in Berkeley California, a young college student, Dan Millman, struggles to find thepart of himself that has always been missing. One night while out walking from his dorm, Dancomes across a gas station and a strange man that is soon to turn his life upside down. This man,known as Socrates, shows Dan a side of existence that only few people had ever seen. Tobecome a warrior like Socrates and have the mind to not allow the regular struggles of life tocontrol a single part of you. Socrates takes Dan in and tries to create a warrior from a young starathlete with the ignorance of every other human on this earth. Through his teachings Dan comesacross an elusive women named Joy. This spiritual journey shows Dan a side of life never seen byhis own eyes before, and guides him to his final conflict that hopefully will help him reach hisdestination he has always yearned for. The missing piece of the puzzle that is Dan Millman.This book shows life in a way you may have never thought of before. It shows the manysteps it takes to become, \\"a warrior.\\" The biggest strength of this book is the way these steps areportrayed. In most cases it is Socrates showing the ignorant Dan the differences between theirlives. Socrates shows Dan how a warrior looks at several simple aspects of life unlike the normalhuman. In one section, Socrates shows Dan the difference between the brain and the mind. Danquestions the positive uses for the mind and the great minds in history. Socrates shows him thatthere aren't any great minds, that there are only great brains. \\"Mind is one of those slippery termslike love. The proper definition relates to your level of consciousness.\\" Socrates states andcontinues to explain how the brain has abstract processes of dealing with information called, \\"theintellect.\\" He adds, \\"Nowhere have I mentioned mind. The brain and mind are not the same.The brain is real; the mind isn't.\\" He later explains how the mind is all the random uncontrolledthoughts that cloud your brain, and how the mind is a useless tool. This way of separating thesetwo simples words allows the reader to think about what the book is saying, and to figure out ifthere is truth to what the book says.Another strength of this book, is obviously the way it makes you think about the steps itshows. The difference between the mind and brain is not something most think about in theirregular lives. But as I read each word I found truth to what Socrates was saying. You read thisbook and try to realize the hidden messages being put across. The message between the mind andbrain is to not let your brain be attacked by random useless thoughts. In other words, to not letyour, \`mind', get in the way of your brain. People think millions of useless thoughts each day.Without these thoughts a persons brain would be clear and their emotions would be easier tocontrol. Dan tries to explain to Socrates that he will control his \`mind' and change himself in theprocess. \\"That is one of your biggest illusions. You've been willing to change clothes, hairstyles,women, apartment, and jobs. You are willing to change anything, except yourself.\\" Socratesstates. This again enables the reader to reflect on their life and brain. And to put themselves inthe shoes of the main character Dan.This book allows you to relate to the main character. The main character is a young manwho has been set to see the world the way most have. He is ignorant when it comes to seeing theother side of the picture. Readers can relate to him because they share a lot of the same qualitiesand ignorance. As Socrates teaches Dan about the mind, he also teaches the reader. As I readthis book I found myself thinking the same questions as Dan asked in the book. It made merealize how little most humans know and how unwelcome they are to change.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It allowed me to relate to the main character, reflect onmy life, and try to change myself in the process of reading it. I was able to see the parts of my lifethat had not been even fathomed before. Through Dan's journey I was able to see the part ofmyself that I had been missing. This book is not a challenging book and allows for every readerto have their own interpretation of it. It is sad for me to say but this book definitely affected mylife and made me see the parts of myself that were in need of change. I recommend this book foranyone struggling to find them self like most humans are, or anyone in general who would like toread something that causes them to live through the motions of the main character. This bookcreates a world similar to ours where, though he is not real, there is a \`Socrates' in each in everyperson's life. I recommend it to anyone, and later in life I will read it again to see my growth andthe things in my life I have left to change.By,ClaytonMaderia"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Dan Millman's book, The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, is an amazing journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. It was a very fluid read and an eye-opening experience. The author unveils that the way to Happiness is by being present along the journey. Every step of the journey is important. There are no ordinary moments. There is in actuality no hierarchy, just the illusion based on our preference. So our college graduation is not intrinsically better than the last day of vacation or garbage recycling day or even this very moment. It all matters, because \\"the Essence of Aliveness matters; the details do not.\\"Beneath all circumstances, thoughts & emotions lies \\"the innate perfection of one's life unfolding. That is the secret of unreasonable happiness.\\"Another book I love that delves into the magic available in each moment as it unfolds is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment. Authors Ariel and Shaya Kane explain that if you trade in your preferences for the willingness to be in each moment as it actually is, you will be rewarded with extraordinary well-being. Since reading these works I have had many examples of \\"unreasonable happiness\\" in my own life.A recent 6+ hour wait in an airport in Costa Rica, which ended with a cancelled flight and an unexpected overnight stay, became a delightful adventure and an opportunity to set aside my preferences and have well-being. One had only to look at the faces of other passengers to see that this was not the common response to the situation. But as I have begun to engage in each moment, without prejudice, my life has opened up to unexpected sources of actual joy & well-being."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and it changed my life.This is a well written, easily read book of personal growth. Initially I set out reading the book as a story and soon found that I became a part of it, living and feeling the story as it unfolded. I now own a well thumbed paper back copy.Dan, the author and world class athlete tells his own story of spiritual growth as he meets the challenges of life helped by the sometimes obtuse council of his mentor. It's a book which once you pick it up, even on the third or fourth read you just don't want to put it down and each time you read it new gems of wisdom will become apparent in the writing. We each have our own vision and purpose in life, just remember - &quot;there are no ordinary moments&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I enjoyed reading Dan Millman's book very much because through a fun and engaging character he exposes the reader to universal teachings. I found myself turning the pages to learn more and also found myself in many of them. I learned that one can train how to be unreasonably happy and is the ultimate goal of the spiritual warrior who discovers its true nature. I found reading this book a very simple way of accessing my inner peace and finding humor in my life as well. Millman opened my eyes to what a miracle life is and his book has found a permanent place on my bookshelf.In a similar way, Ariel and Shya Kane's book How To Create a Magical Relationship has eye opening, enlightening stories. By way of their transformation principles they give us a new perspective on relationships, including the one we have with ourselves. The Kanes have a very practical approach that can be used in everyday situations, in which life gets light, fun and magical. I highly recommend them. Their books are pearls of wisdom."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I enjoyed going on the journey with Dan Millman in \\"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\".It opened my eyes and reminded me of a possibility that exists for us all.After \\"accidentally\\" meeting his enlightened teacher, Socrates, at an all night gas station, Dan embarks on an amazing voyage that leads to his discovery of a gentle yet profound state of being where there are no ordinary moments.Dan had been an unsatisfied striver, doer, competitor ( world class athelete) and complainer before his world was shaken up by this extraordinary man.In most cultures, we humans are conditioned to strive for the future, have regrets about the past & for the most part, blame circumstances outside ourselves for what is happening in our lives. Getting caught up with this \\"way of being\\" has become a lifestyle that's robbing us of the magic, the intimacy and the intensity of the current, perfect, moment of now - and, as Dan found out, the place where satisfaction truly lives.\\"How to Create a magical Relationship\\", by Ariel and Shya Kane, is another book that gently nudged me into exploring the magical realm of living in the present moment. It's a series of short stories where people's lives instantaneously transform while speaking with the Kanes. I got so much value after reading these two books!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is truly inspiring, mind-opening and will change the way you look at life forever. It shows you the great possibilities that are in store for every human being. In this respect I find this book extremely powerful and helpful.There is one thing, however, that I find to be disturbing. The story is based on fiction as well as fantasy. This fact wouldn't be bad by itself, however, the reader gets the impression that this book is a sincere autobiography - which it is not. Thus, while appreciating the fantastic story, we should not take the story itself for real. We may, however, learn from the lessons it contains."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior is the entertaining and inspirational story of one man's quest for spiritual truth. The man, Dan Millman, while in college encounters a sage of sorts at a gas station. They strike up a conversation and the next thing you know Dan has been taken under this man's wing as his student. Dan calls the teacher Socrates and from the point of their first encounter Dan's life would never be the same.During the book Socrates imparts many wise lessons to Dan. Some of these lessons are; be present in the here and now, avoid unhealthy attachment to things, recognize the potential of the mind to mislead, and realize the utmost importance of paradox, humor and change in life. These lessons are very similar to Eastern wisdom, namely Buddhism. If you are a follower of any of the Eastern disciplines these admonishments won't come as a surprise but they are great reminders for all of us.This book isn't written that well but it's great for other reasons. One of the main ones is that it's not just a boring guidebook teaching you how to achieve \\"enlightenment\\". It's an entertaining blend of biography and fiction that keeps you interested in the outcome. Also, it does a great job of covering a wide area that can really alter someone's life for the better once they start implementing the advices contained within the book.There is talk that a movie is coming out based on this book with Nick Nolte playing the role of the teacher Socrates. It's hard to imagine a movie portraying the deep wisdom found in this book but the jury will have to be out till we are able to watch for ourselves. Nevertheless, pick this book up and prepare to be motivated and desired to live in a more meaningful and peaceful way."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Based on the comments of another reviewer, I read both Millman's book and the Evolution of a Warrior by Christopher Regan. While I agree with the other reviewer that Regan's book is more powerful in some respects (IMO), I believe Millman's novel is also a must read for anyone trying to follow the way of a warrior. Millman's novel is especially well suited for a younger readers (like early teens). The Evolution of a Warrior, with its sex and seduction scenes, is better suited for a more mature audience."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is a wonderful way to look at yourself and where you are at in life. Dan Millman did a marvelous job telling a story that are compelling and mesmerizing, and every minute reading it is every minute closer to self-discovery and enlightenment. Teens should really read this book because; I myself a teen know what teen goes through. Even with all my success and achievement I still was unhappy like Dan in this book, through simple ways of looking at various things this book have change the way I lead a more peaceful and fulfilling life. It is fit to call this book \\" The book that changes lives\\""},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I had heard of this book for years and never got around to reading it. Finally, I did. I thought it was fantastic. I think many people will get too tied into some of the suggestions made by Socrates. It is important to remember this is a book of fiction. It illustrates certain points, but is unreal. It is not meant in anyway meant to be taken litterally. It is a story of inspiration. In it's plot it has many twists and turns, and I found that while reading it I was always trying to figure out who exactly Socrates was and where the book was going. As the book states, &quot;Stay in the present. You can do nothing to change the past, and the future will never come exactly as you hoped.&quot; This is the message of the book. Simple, Yes, easy, not usually. Incidently I did read an interview with Dan Millman and Socrates was a real person, but he was not superhuman. His greatness in the book is only meant as a parable. It is a great story, and there are lessons that seem so obvious it is easy to gloss over them..The great paradox is that we &quot;know&quot; many things, without &quot;understanding&quot; If you tell someone who has never driven a car, they may know how to drive. But not until they experience &quot;driving&quot; will they fully understand it. It is through action that we really understand. The book is wonderful. enjoy!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. It's a super fast read, and it makes the stress in your shoulders 100 pounds lighter. I read this book over and over again in high school (six yrs ago) and it validated the questions I was asking about who I was. (yes, I was, and still am, a flower child born 30 yrs too late).Dan's mentor Socrates takes an egocentric athlete and changes him into a soul searcher. What he gives to Dan, any reader can get too. This book talks about physical reality. It does not spend lots of time on ideas like reincarnation. ie. you do not have to be a &quot;new ager&quot; to enjoy this. Nor does it advocate drug use like the more classically sixties Casteneda books. Although there are similarities between Don Juan and Socrates.I have recommended this book to many people and all except one giant sceptic (and future heroine adict) loved it.If you are an old hippy who somehow missed this, or anyone looking for alternative philosophies written in the west with ideas more traditionally eastern, READ THIS!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book two times and loaned it to a friend (but forgot which one) obviously to someone that I thought would appreciate it's contents. The message Dan is sending can be found in many books. This is just his way of sharing his adventure, which I have found to be very helpful. I am here to buy the book again. I want it in my personel library."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The writing is a bit sloppy, Millman dabbles in misogyny(toothpaste Susie!?), and we once again run into the problem(also posed by Castaneda and Redfield) of presenting fiction as philosophical half-truth(or is it the other way around?).That said, this is a good book which made me feel a bit less alone in my feelings about man's potential for growth within the confines of American society. Millman does well to suggest the possibility of living in a state of &quot;no-mind,&quot; though he falters when assuming that this is achievable only through athletics(he was a gymnast. Hmmm....).I can honestly say that I've experienced much the same phenomenon when writing or reading, or throwing the occasional jump shot. Nitpicking? Of course(somebody had to give this sucker less than 10 stars, for God's sake). Overall, I'd recommend it, though deeper thinkers may become bored very quickly."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I bought this title for my kindle. I can't comment yet, on the entire work as I'm only half-way through.What I can comment on is, without doubt, the most POORLY edited book that I have ever read. Almost every page there is a typo that makes me stop and re-read the sentence to work out what was supposed to be written. This doesn't completely ruin the book but becomes kind of annoying that we pay for a book that wouldn't make it past a middle school english teacher's red pen!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"One of those books that I think of more as a living entity, whispering secrets in my ear about how to live a transcendental life right here on Earth.The book has equal merit when viewed either as a work of fiction, or as a biographical sketch. I believe that the mystical Socrates in the book is in fact Dan's higher self, urging him to reach farther and deeper than his &quot;stated&quot; abilities lead him to believe.The book should not be taken literally. I believe its main purpose is to hint at an existence beyond the mere mechanistic. I also get a sense of parallel universes with the girl Joy who initially represents the more enlightened/advanced student in his class-of-one, and later becomes part of his life - while being the same person in some multi-dimensional sense, she is temporally not the same person at all !Some very good pointers about breathing techniques and diet in this book. Other than that, I believe the whole book is metaphorical. A very good read if you're in the &quot;whats the meaning of life?&quot; stage. It won't give any answers, but it helps you ask the right questions. -:)"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is great but only for what it is!It is a stepping-stone book into heaving spiritual teachings out there. However it is a great first step.I recommend this as excellent inspiration for those people who are struggling with their mundane existences and know there is something more out there but can't put there finger on it.As stated it should be considered as introductory, and inspirational, reading and on that basis is a must-read for the person looking to break out of his or her current paradigm."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is for reveiwer (rattemause) who ranted that he/she did not and could not find the time to try some of recommendation in this book?

It is a reprint of the original edition. \\"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency\\" which is a lecture Tesla presented at the Institution Of Electrical Engineers, London. Included with this lecture is an appendix on the \\"Transmission of Electric Energy Without Wires\\" by Nikola Tesla. If you want to understand how Tesla thought & worked; this book will allow you to gain real insight into his mind. The future he envisioned can largely be seen in our everyday lives. But this was over a hundred years ago!Nikola Tesla is a craftsman with an intimate relationship of his work and materials. He innately grasps the nature of electricity. Dubbed the \\"Electric Magician\\" by the public, he amazed even engineers & scientists of his day. Henry Ford & Thomas Edison did their best to see that Tesla was forgotten. Neither the Ford Foundation nor the Smithsonian can silence history. Ford & Edison were great entrepreneurs. Tesla was a true genius and humanitarian! This book stands as a testament to his brilliance."},{"Title":"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency","review":"Nikola Tesla was one of the most fascinating and gifted scientists and inventors from the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. He had made numerous contributions to our understanding of electromagnetic interactions, and there is hardly an electrical appliance that is used today that is not based in one way or another on one of his inventions. To many people's dismay he had never been awarded the Nobel Prize, but his reputation has only increased over the years and today it eclipses many others scientists that had been deemed extraordinary in their time. As a recognition of the value of his achievements the modern physical unit for the magnetic field is called Tesla. He was also a very mysterious and colorful character, and in recent years several movies and novels featured a fictionalized portrayal of his life.This short book is a transcript of a lecture that Tesla gave to the London society of electrical engineers on a topic of experiments with alternate currents of high potential and high frequency. The lecture is preceded with a short biographical sketch of Tesla, and it's an interesting read in its own right. It should give an incentive to the reader to read a full biography of Tesla's life. The lecture itself is delivered in very crisp and readable English, and it doesn't require any mathematical background. However, the lecture will probably be of interest primarily to people with a background in engineering or a physical science, as it deals with things like coils, high currents, vacuum tubes and other such marvelous contraption that are unfortunately bound to put most people to sleep. It also doesn't help that this edition of the lecture omits all of the illustrations, and thus makes it very hard to follow even if you are an expert in electrical circuitry and experiments. I would give this book four stars because of the clarity of presentation and the value it has for the history of science, but otherwise it is not the most interesting book out there."},{"Title":"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency","review":"The main thing I got out of this book is that Tesla is probably smarter than Einstein. Like a lot smarter. Like Tesla:Einstein::Einstein:me. Not being a genius myself may disqualify me from evaluating these people but I feel like he's on another level from the ordinary, run of the mill geniuses. Reading his writing is really different from reading Einstein or Feynman- it seems like their concerns are very local compared to Tesla's.Tesla impressed me with his consideration of \\"the problem of increasing human energy.\\" He is genuinely and deeply concerned with increasing the energy of the human race and describes how all of his research fits into modifying various parts of this equation. For example he talks about increasing human mass (such as by ending world hunger) and describes various inventions of his that would do this. This guy had worked out a whole scheme of large scale improvements that would change the world in every way. His vision was astounding and at least 1 century ahead of its time. Apparently all of his work is coming from this perspective of advancing our race and he views himself as intimately connected with all humans, implying that he felt no need to propagate his own genes as long as the human race continued to grow because he viewed our united success as more satisfying than that of his own genes. This perspective is so different from my own that I can barely grasp this idea and it's one of the few things that I've read that made me really feel the gap between my mind and another's. I view the advancement of humanity as correlated to the advancement of my genes but not preferable to or a replacement for my own kids being awesome. I feel really lucky that someone as smart as Tesla feels benevolently towards humanity because we are all still benefiting from his consideration.I did not learn any science from reading this document. I asked my physicist friends about some of the wilder things that he wrote and they did not understand it. It may be that this version doesn't have the proper diagrams. In any case I wouldn't recommend reading this particular document if you want to learn science. Its main value is sort of a qualitative view of Tesla's mind and vision."},{"Title":"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency","review":"This book is simply a collection of Tesla's lectures. It is extremely long. I'm sure things would be different if Tesla was still here to give these lectures in person. It is not a fast read.It does allow elaboration of some of Tesla's ideas, but I felt it was an injustice that this edition didn't attempt to clarify some of Tesla's ideas to make them more easily understandable.Too many publishers are simply reprinting his notes without really contributing to a better understanding of his ideas and principles.

If American arms weren't so welcoming to individuals of mixed heritage, they were even less welcoming to a foreigner. Caucasian machinists refused to work along side brown-skinned workers. In addition to this difficulty, Jan spoke very little English, as Dutch was his first language.Jan was not one to give up and soon he was apprenticing under a shoe-maker. The shoe maker saw Jan's drive and skill, so he encouraged Jan to move to Lynn, Massachusetts. Once in Lynn, Jan experienced even more resistance based upon his skin color. But he was not one to be discouraged. There were 170 shoe factories in Lynn, and he knew his skill on the McKay machine would open doors and it did.Jan wasn't happy just to sew shoes all day. His mind was always working and after a time he started formulating a machine that could connect the upper part of the shoe to the inner part of the sole. This was a process that many had tried and failed to automate.The desire to put his ideas to work and actually create a prototype lit a fire in Jan's mind. He did create a viable machine against great odds and resistance. He had to make some compromises along the way. The company that wanted to use his invention did not have the money to invest in making machines from the prototype. Then George Brown of Wheeler Wilson Sewing Company offered to provide the money under the condition that Jan sell them his patent. In return Jan received a large block of stock in the company that would make the \\"lasting machine\\".Before Jan Matzeliger's machine, few could afford shoes. Jan's machine changed this for everyone. With the advent of the lasting machine, the shoe industry boomed and the price of shoes dropped. Workers had been afraid that the invention would take their jobs away. Instead it brought more work to milling towns & thus many more job opportunities for those already employed in the industry.Jan died of tuberculosis at 37. It was caused by poor eating habits (he spent almost all his money on making his machine) and hunching over at machines in the factory.This a wonderful book about a man who worked for his dream in spite of great obstacles. He would not let anyone tell him he couldn't achieve his goals for any reason. The opinions and attitudes of others had no power over his actions, confidence, and self-worth. If he thought he could do something, he found a way to make it happen.This is a great historical book, but it is even better as a model for young men and women the world over who want to accomplish goals that others say they cannot. It shows that, if you have the drive and skill to back up your dreams and educate yourself in every way you are able, you can make your dreams happen no matter what others around you think or say.Every elementary age student should have the chance to hear and be inspired by Jan's story."},{"Title":"Shoes for Everyone: A Story about Jan Matzeliger (Creative Minds Biography)","review":"The story is well written and informative.

But she doesn't know the upheaval her decision to go looking will bring.This is the first book in a new series by Johnson, and Linette, or Carrie St. John, as she is now known is at its heart. When Mark Kinkaid, a PI specializing in adoption searches, comes looking to tell her about her sister, she is astounded. She's not adopted! Her parents would surely have mentioned it if she were. Fortunately in the chaos that results, Mark proves to be a strong shoulder to lean on. As an adoptive parent and a PI he knows these situations can be disruptive and emotionally wrenching. But it's too bad he finds his client's sister so darned attractive.Once again Johnson takes a difficult situation and, by making it about families and love, works it into a compelling read."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Lost... But Not Forgotten (Harlequin Superromance No 1332)","review":"OPEN SECRET by Janice Kay JohnsonApril 2, 2006Amazon rating 3/5\\"In this first in a trilogy, Suzanne Chauvin seeks two siblings she has not seen since she was six years old. When their parents died in an accident, Suzanne was sent to live with an aunt and uncle. But Miles and Jeanne Fulton sent Linette and Lucien Chauvin (six months and three years old at the time, respectively) to live in foster homes. Suzanne always vowed to find them, feeling responsible for her siblings despite her young age. After searching for three years on her own, she hires ex-cop Mark Kincaid, who makes a living searching for missing people. He locates Carrie St John, who was Linette Chauvin twenty-five years before.Carrie was raised by a wealthy couple in the Seattle area, who never told her she was adopted. All her life she was frustrated, wondering why she had such a hard time pleasing her parents. When Mark seeks her out so that she can be reunited with her long lost sister Suzanne, Carrie is devastated. Most of the book focuses on Carrie's coming to terms with a family that she never knew existed. She is angry with her adoptive parents, who lied to her, while the St. Johns are upset that Carrie knows the truth, because like many in their situation, they fear losing her to her biological family. Mark in the meantime has his own baggage to deal with. He has a five-year old adopted son Michael who yearns for a real mother (Mark's wife Emily died a few years before, during a high-risk pregnancy).\\" - Complete review at BookLoons - M.

But Not Forgotten (Harlequin Superromance No 1332)","review":"Lets just be clear about that. This is a story about a spoilt, selfish heroine named Carrie who finds out, as an adult, that she was adopted and the fallout from this revelation. That's it in a nutshell.Carrie St John - adopted? The idea would be preposterous, except..... Carrie has never truly felt as if she belonged. Now she has a sister who wants to meet her and a brother no one can find."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Lost... But Not Forgotten (Harlequin Superromance No 1332)","review":"Open Secret is a sweet read. Mark Kinkaid is a private investigator hired by a woman to track down the two siblings that she lost as a young child. Mark specializes in reuniting adopted children with their biological families and is Suzanne's last hope.Mark finds Suzanne's sister Linette, now known as Carrie St. John. Carrie knew nothing of her adoption before Mark stepped in. Our heroine is given a lot to handle early on in the book. Most of the book is spent on the drama of Carrie's adoptive family, how Carrie feels and is dealing with the new discovery and her new sister. Very little time is actually spent on the development of the Mark and Carrie's relationship. I could have easily handled the way that the author decided to handle this except for the ending. It felt a little too rushed. In the last 10 pages the entire conflict and relationship is resolved and ushered into an entire new level.Overall, Open Secret is a sweet, intriguing read that will pass away an afternoon."},{"Title":"Louis Althusser (Transitions (Palgrave Macmillan (Firm)).)","review":"This is undoubtedly the best book on Althusser in English to date. Others, such as Gregory Elliott's book, might be more comprehensive (but be sure to get the recent edition of Elliott's book, which corrects some errors of interpretation made in the first edition regarding Althusser's 1970s position) but this book by Montag (and, in fact, all of Montag's books) really gets at the crux of what Althusser's theories of reading and ideology are about. Especially useful to those working in literary analysis - there is also considerable discussion of Macherey in here, and there are Althusserian readings of Conrad, Defoe, and Althusser's own 'autobiography' in here.You used to be able to download a sample of the main chapter from Palgrave Macmillan's website, so have a look for that, but there is more here than just that chapter.I would also strongly recommend Montag's books on Swift (The Unthinkable Swift), Spinoza (Bodies, Masses, Power), and the various edited volumes he has been involved with, especially the collection of Macherey's writings (In a Materialist Way). Literary studies students might also find the essay on Frankenstein in the edition edited by Johanna Smith very useful, and students of Foucault will be interested in a paper by Montag in Yale French Studies no. 88."},{"Title":"Swell Holiday","review":"Great book for a holiday gift!

But if you can ignore that, then it provides for a definitive education in our understanding of the nucleus.

Tools of the trade are covered somewhat but I could have used much more information. Coloring wood was extensively explained and I learned a lot about the different types of stains and methods of using them. Many of the hints concerned how to repair damaged furniture and the mistakes made in refinishing.I was glad to see how many of these wood finishers used WATCO oil, a favorite finishing method of mine, passed down from my mother.I appreciated the several hints about how to keep paint out of the lip of the can and for preventing &quot;skin&quot; from forming on the surface of stored paint. I also plan to try a suggested method of getting a &quot;dent&quot; out of a piece of furniture (caused by careless movers) and to try using Vaseline to remove a white water ring.I found it helpful to read the section on using gloss finish and why specks sometimes appear on the furniture surface.

He's seen a lot during those years, including a horrific massacre of civilians. When chance places a fortune in rubies in his hands, he's more than ready to make drastic changes. Back to England he goes, the England of a world just prior to the American Civil War, looking for a better way to spend his life. He finds it in two places. First, in a revolutionary business idea sparked by an encounter with a railway official; and second, in a runaway young woman. He marries the woman, factory heiress Henrietta Rawlinson (who's swiftly disinherited by her infuriated father), and he turns the idea into a hauling firm that deliberately fits itself into all the gaps the railway system cannot fill.That's the bare outline. What makes this novel remarkable, though, isn't its plot. It's the characters, and the way author Delderfield lets them grow naturally out of the time and place in which he sets them. Adam Swann is in many ways a man ahead of that time, disgusted by what he's seen in war and determined to make his way in the world without committing outrages against basic human decency. In fact, he's determined to make a difference for the better while succeeding as a businessman. Henrietta, blessed with her enterpreneur father's sharp mind and quick wits for commerce, grows from a willful, uneducated and thoroughly spoiled girl into a worthy and even challenging partner for Adam in the course of the book's 800-some pages. Nothing seems forced, and none of the details of Victorian England ring false, in all of those pages. Some of the best reading comes from secondary characters who weave in and out of the main story, because each is well drawn and interesting - no matter how brief the appearance.A tour-de-force, all in all. One of the best \\"family sagas\\" around, still, nearly 40 years after its publication."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"I can think of few better authors to take along on a long plane ride than Delderfield. God Is an Englishman is the first of a trilogy that runs a little out of gas by the end of the third book, but not in the first.

Alot of his works are out of print, although you can find them at liabraries, or Amazon's auction site -- or bookfinder.com"},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"God Is an Englishman is the first book in this wonderful saga about the Swann family. Adam Swann, a 31-year-old cavalryman in the service of Queen Victoria's army, decides to break off with his family's military tradition and gives up his soldierly life in lieu of starting anew in England as a businessman. The road ahead of him will not be easy, as old sentiments still prevail where people making a living in a new, industrial England are looked down on and someone like Adam, giving up his army career is thought foolish. Adam Swann persists in his desire to be his own boss and not spent his life serving somebody else, even if it's the Crown of England. In his struggles to become a respectable and successful owner of a horse-carriage business, he has a few supporters, including his young wife, Henrietta and, surprisingly, his own father. The readers follow Adam and his personal and business lives for nine years. These are very tumultuous years for England as well. It is the 19th century, the country changes from an agricultural one into an industrial empire, with railroads ruling the transportation, mills, mines and factories replacing the farms and Adam Swann takes on a daring project of using horses as his road to success.I thoroughly enjoyed God Is an Englishman, so much so that even before I finished it, I went and got part two (Theirs Was the Kingdom). It's not an easy read by any means, but very captivating and really a requirement for anyone who wants to read more about one of the most important periods in England's history. Some might say that it's reminiscent of Dickens's books but I should say that probably only in the time set. Through Delderfield's book I got a hopeful outlook, not a grim one. True, it's still England where poverty is on the rise, where child exploitation flourishes but it's also England where one doesn't have to belong to royalty in order to become well-off, successful and if they're persistent enough, respected. \`Common' people now have a chance to have careers and to be truly in charge of their lives. I must say that I liked this approach and I just was riveted by Adam Swann and by the whole process of him starting from a scratch and, despite unexpected failures and \`bumps \`, holding on to what he believed and never losing sight of what Adam deemed as success.That's one great part of God Is an Englishman. Another one is the multitude of characters, bad, good and just average, but they all change, they all grow and, as a reader, you really have your pick in which ones are going to be your favorites. Mine was Henrietta, Adam's wife. I think she grew the most throughout the novel. She changed so much but still somehow retained her youthful innocence despite some occurrences that would turn many into bitter, prematurely old women. Henrietta and Adam's marriage is not an easy one, some would even say it's doomed from the beginning, but yet again, Delderfield just serves us this happy story, with both parties fulfilling their dreams, among the turmoil of their times. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a \`happily-ever-after Cinderella' story but an uplifting one nonetheless, despite the many problems that could endanger both Adam's and Henrietta's happiness.I say that if you're a \`saga junkie', if you are even remotely interested in the history of England and want to meet people, who in the end you feel are your friends or at least next door neighbors, God Is an Englishman and you will be a perfect match."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"MY WIFE KEPT TELLING ME WHAT A GOOD &quot;READ&quot; THIS BOOK IS.I FINALLY FOUND ALL 3 SWANN SAGA BOOKS AT A USED SALE &amp; I HAVENT LOOKED BACK.THIS AUTHOR HAS THE KNACK TO RELATE TO THE READER EVERY BIT OF WHAT ADAM 'N HETTY WERE EXPERIENCING IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND.I HAVE BEEN IN WHEELED TRANSPORTATION 40 YEARS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS WALKING STEP FOR STEP WITH ADAM SWANN FROM THE TIME HE FOUND THE RUBY NECKLACE TO THE 1ST MAXIE 10 TRK ORDER.I LAUGHED N CRIED THRU OUT EACH VOLUME.I AM NOW IN A SEARCH MODE FOR ANY N ALL OF DELDERFIELD BOOKS I HAVENT READ.I'D LIKE TO SEE A FAN CLUB...."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"This book is a must read for any Anglophile.

I have always been fascinated by tales of the Industrial Revolution when English entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators changed life from an a rural/agricultural system to a modern industrial society in a matter of generations.After a military career, Adam Swann returns to England in 1858 with an intense ambition to build his fortune in the fast changing and extremely competitive world of Victorian commerce. Swann soon meets his soul-mate, Henrietta, the high-spirited daughter of a local mill owner and they set out to build a family business under the Swann name. Along the way they share challenges, setbacks and eventually an immense fortune.As now, the secret of Swann's success is building an efficient and competitive business that is ahead of its time and is essential to the success of others. Swann sees that while railways are a fundamental part of the game-changing industrial revolution, they cannot always provide door to door delivery. He sets up an extensive and complex country-wide network of horse drawn transportation to take materials and goods between the railhead and factories up and down the country, sometimes on appalling roads and gradients.Henrietta, as well as being a wife and mother to an ever increasing brood of small Swanns, is the financial wizard who helps Adam to succeed. While the business is essentially a family one, much of its success is due to finding the right staff in the right place and giving them every incentive to perform and develop the business.This is a fascinating and outstanding novel about exciting times in economic and social development throughout Victorian England. The next novels in the series - -Theirs Was the Kingdom (Swann Family Saga)andGive Us This Day (God Is an Englishman)- - bring the younger Swanns into the business and they face the next challenges as the face of road freight transport changes from horse drawn to motorised delivery.The Swann family saga is only one of several important English family sagas written by Delderfield, including The Horseman Riding By and To Serve Them All Our Days, both of which became popular BBC mini-series.This is a beloved novel by one of my favourite authors. I first read this book (the first in the Swann family saga trilogy) in the UK the early 1970's when it was first published. I read it again with continued enjoyment over 30 years later and was delighted to see it featured recently as a Kindle Daily Deal so I can now keep a copy with me at all times."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"I read this series back in high school, about 40 years ago and loved them then. thank you for offering them in kindle form.

Characters were entertaining and realistic for that period. Setting is in England."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"This is the first volume of an epic saga about a British entrepreneur who realizes that there is money to be made in horse drawn distribution in the middle of the 19th century despite the growth of the railway system. The story of how Adam Swan builds that business is fascinating and presented in elaborate detail. At the same time, the book deals with romantic topics but in a way that seems very old fashioned and censored. Lots of odd, symbolic language that somewhat detracts from the overall commercial theme of the book. Those parts make the book a little embarrassing for an old fashioned male reader to be caught with; somewhat like reading part of a Har___ novel from a bygone era. At times the book's treatment of women is patronizing although arguably it does show women in unusual, for the 1860s, management positions. For me, I wish the author had stuck to the story of the development of the enterprise and left the romantic parts to other authors. Mind all of it is very clean, nothing in this book that anyone could object to."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"God is an Englishman is a wonderful book.

I even tried to find if this family ever existed. It is the Swann Family Saga and tells how Adam returns from the military to become a Tradesman in England despite his family's background in the military. He marries an eighteen year old and their story is exciting in itself. There were times of detailed descriptions of the Swann-wheels territories that I became a bit bored, but suddenly the book would weave a personal troubled story into the plot and I would once again become entangled in the Swann family life. Passion, yes. Anger, yes. Death, yes. Infidelity, wait and see. It is all there and I am so glad I accidentally found it while searching the Amazon listings for my Kindle."},{"Title":"God Is an Englishman","review":"My grandfather was a lace designer trained at his craft as an indentured apprentice in Nottingham. This was the same time Adam Swann came home from his military service and began his carting business. The character development is beyond the pale; few author's achieve this skill. I felt as if I could see how my own grandfather might have endured his training and then entered into the industry. A word of caution: you are drawn into the Swann saga from the first few pages.

I strongly recommend this well written book to anyone needing to learn stats."},{"Title":"Elements of Statistical Reasoning","review":"I thought this was an outstanding intro to basic stats - it does a great job presenting the intuition behind most of the important basic concepts in stats, and I also loved the articulate and flowing style of the text. Very light on math, too, so a great text for those less quantitatively inclined souls out there who would still like to get a solid grasp of basic stats.One great addition to the book would be a list of websites that have interactive stats demos, which I think are a great tool to help better understanding and to develop intuition. (One such site is explorelearning.com, which has pretty decent demos on several of the main concepts, but in general you can google [the concept you're looking for]+demo to get more demos (some better than others) on specific concepts). On second thought, this may be not a very realistic suggestion considering how often new websites pop up and old ones go dead, but I thought I'd throw it out there anyway."},{"Title":"Elements of Statistical Reasoning","review":"This is by far the best introductory text to statistics for students in the behavioral sciences I have come across.The conceptual layout makes this textbook especially engaging.

This is important, for without this understanding one will likely misapply statistics and/or misread statistics.In short, here one finds not only an introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics for behavioral scientists, but also a text that will give the reader a firm grounding in the logic behind statistics."},{"Title":"Elements of Statistical Reasoning","review":"This was an awesome deal on this book and it was exactly what I needed for the class, so I could not be happier.

Hesseltine writes a very complete, very interesting history of American Third Parties. He traces the causes for many of them failing while pointing out the reasons while some of them, a few, make it into power. Most of the time it seems that labor and the farmers are trying to join together to fight for a common cause yet they seem to fail most of the time. The Know-Nothing Party, the Anti-Masonic Party the Free Soil Party, the Equal Rights party, the Populist party, the Granger movement, the Greenback movement, the Whig party, the Bull Moose movement, the Progressives and other parties.

This book is more a photographic essay than a decorating guide for the average shore dweller or the lavish beach houses currently in vogue; but the suggestions can easily be applied to porches, studios, lofts or small outbuildings one knows not quite what to do with. Children will enjoy the nature craft aspect of the projects, and adults will appreciate the help with making the most of spartan waterfront living.

The chapter on woods helped me identify the various types of wood more easily when I'm antiquing, and helped me connect specific woods with eras and styles. Lots of practical information in a succinct format that's easy to grasp. What really sets this book apart is the large number of color photographs and illustrations.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in collecting with more confidence."},{"Title":"Antiques 101: A Crash Course in Everything Antique","review":"I bought this book hoping to learn how to tell the difference between different styles of furniture. I have to report mixed results toward that goal.This book does an EXCELLENT job of describing the history of the different periods of antiques. I have no doubt now as to where the terms \\"Regency, French Empire, Queen Anne or Rococo\\" come from or what the driving forces were that brought about the changes in each style.But the descriptions of each use many of the same terms. For example, Cabriolet legs are mentioned in several different areas. But not what would define what sets each type apart. Don't get me wrong, there are pictures of each style of furniture, but I would have liked to see some side-by-side comparisons how how to tell the difference between a Queen Anne versus a Centennial table.As another example, when describing the Art Deco period, there are pages describing the World's Fairs of 1933 & 1939 as well as about the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building. Very interesting reading, but I would have appreciated more on how to define Art Deco items versus Retro.In porcelain, the author describes German, French and British porcelain. Where it was made, famous potters, etc. But not how to tell the difference between them.All in all, a very enjoyable book to read. And I did learn quite a bit from it.

When Pepper's husband, Edmond Waverly Windbrook III--a very sick and disturbed man--beats Pepper almost to death, Micah and Juanita seek the ultimate payback: the demise of Edmond. This is just a small intro to the world of Betty B. Byers' erotic thriller, &quot;The Big Payback,&quot; a novel that is fast paced and full of intriguing characters that will keep your interests piqued.What I enjoyed the most about &quot;The Big Payback&quot; is its smooth pacing. Byers has a tight style that enables her to tell readers exactly what they need to know and it made for a fast and smooth read. Characters are well drawn out, and I would dare anyone to find a character as despicable and mentally twisted as Edmond. I found myself wanting to get in on the payback and do some damage. Aside from the round characters, quick pacing and the multitude of plot twists that make the story compelling, I did have one major drawback. Throughout the story, sections of the story were &quot;block quoted&quot; and slowed my reading. These sections were meant to provide--I think--in depth analysis on a character's motivation, or to go into a flashback, etc. In the end, these sections were slow reading, and they felt like information that I wanted embedded into the story and not bracketed off from the story.Overall, &quot;The Big Payback&quot; is a novel that I would definitely recommend, and I plan to check out Byers' previous work and take note of any future novels.Shon Bacon"},{"Title":"The Big Payback","review":"Ms. Byers has a winner here, I can't wait for the movie version.

The care and craft that went into this beauty is evident in every card. You can see the love the developers have not only for Tarot, but for the city of Prague. I am not often a fan of \\"collage\\" decks, but this one is done brilliantly, often incorporating many styles of art and architecture.I am particularly fond of The Moon, which is the card I tend to immediately gravitate toward upon my new deck purchase. The mood from this card captivated me from the start, so much so that my girlfriend ordered a print of it for me.The accompanying book is a treasure as well. Owning many books on the tarot, I found that Ms. Mahony captured the true essence of tarot. This book could stand alone and be used by tarot lovers, novice or experienced.I noticed two negative reviews complaining about the same problem with the cardstock flaking. I own two decks and my girlfriend had two of her own when I met her. This has not happened on any of them.This is a perfect deck IMO - the only two Rider-Waite decks which come close are the Golden and the Baroque Bohemian Cat (also published by the same authors)."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"A lot of collage Tarot decks look jumbled together, with little concern for composition or visual harmony. Not so the Tarot of Prague. This lovely collage Tarot was clearly created by artists with a high degree of skill. The use of imagery from Prague is clever, but understated: this is no limited-use &quot;theme deck.&quot;Not only is Tarot of Prague beautiful, but also meaningful. The book provides helpful, detailed analysis of the author's perspective on the cards.

Splurge for the set so you get the book as well.Highly recommend - makes a great gift!"},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"Of the five tarot decks I own, the Tarot of Prague set is by far my favorite. As the title suggests, each card is a collage of images taken from the city of Prague. The meaning of each card is clearly conveyed through the photographs, and the distinct coloring of each card is simply breathtaking. Also, because it is a standard 78 card deck that follows the Rider Waite numbering system, this deck is ideal for beginners and advanced tarot readers alike.The matte finish on the cards (unlike most other tarot decks, which have a glossy finish) and their manageable size (they're slightly larger than the Rider Waite cards) makes this deck incredibly easy to shuffle and use.The only fault I can find with the deck is the packaging -- the cards come in a cardboard holder which resembles the binding of a book. The deck is held in place with two sets of golden ribbons, but, because there is nothing holding the deck in place on the top and bottom, it is very easy for the cards to slide out. Regardless, the packaging is beautiful, and there is a helpful quickguide attached to the binding which is quite useful if you're new to tarot reading and don't feel like lugging the book around.As for the book, it is clear, concise, and well-written. The authors include historical information about Prague and occasionally include photographs of the original images that were modified for the deck. Although only two spreads are offered (the classic Celtic Cross spread and their own Prague &quot;Threshold&quot; spread), the short guide to tarot readings is informative and helpful. All in all, it is a perfect book to complement a perfect deck.As for the price, my jaw nearly dropped when I saw how cheap Amazon is offering this set for. I paid about twice that amount, and, if I had to, I'd probably pay over $100 for this set. It is surely worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"This is a very beautiful deck, the images are very beautiful, and although I like them very much I am not sure if I will be using them for giving readings. The cards are regular size, but the coating on the deck is a bit weak, when I shuffled the deck after a few times, I accidentally bent one, this has never happened to me with one of my other decks that have a stronger coating.Again I do like the art, and it is a nice deck, but as far as giving readings with them, for some reason it does not grab me. Some of the images are very dull, and the cards are beautiful but they do not flow well with each other, and it seams like you are using a few different decks instead on one deck.The box that holds the kit is nice, but again be careful how you open the box when you get it, I wrapped mine trying to get the wrap of. In the box you get a nice book, which was well written, and a smaller box that holds the deck. The Box is like has a ribbon, because it is not a traditional box, but one similar to a binder, you place the deck within and tie the golden ribbon to keep it closed. It is a good idea and keeps you deck within as long as it is laying flat, but it is not a good box to carry around with you, because the cards easily slide out. (I gotta give the creators credit for an original idea though.)I would recommend it as a collectable, and for those who have knowledge with the RW Tarot, but as an actual reading deck, well it just did not do it for me."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"Most of the Tarot decks that are published in the world today are seriously lacking in any depth and understanding of the Tarot itself.The Tarot of Prague, fortunately, belongs in the other category - those of decks that have meaning and worth. And I would be willing to take a bet that it is one of those decks which will probably go down in history as one of the more Remarkable Tarot decks.I bet you that when this one goes one day out of print (I hope it won't though), that people will be bidding for it at a very high price on e-bay.The designers of this deck knew their Tarot.

I have heard much about this deck, and I thought that I would give it a try. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected.I am not best pleased with the card stock. As I shuffled the cards, I was coated in little pieces of broken white-card... flaking from the bottoms of the cards. I was also very dissappointed with the dry-looking imagery. Prague is a beautiful city, and having lived in it for numerous years, I felt that the deck did not do it any justice (pardon the tarot pun!) at all.My advice to anyone considering purchasing this deck? Don't. Ofcourse, it is all a matter of personal taste. [...] I for one wish I had spent my money on something else.Best Wishes,Cassandra"},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"My first encounter with tarot, back in high school, was limited to the few decks then on the market. But here we are 15 years later and there are hundreds of new decks. I have only been working with tarot for about a year now, but I take great delight in the beauty of the artwork of some of these modern creations. As an artist myself, I pour over the images, to explore composition and line, color and harmony. There are decks I love just for the art, but the prizes of my collection are those which are sumptuous and also wise. Tarot of Prague is one of these. Delicious, inspiring, satisfying.Whenever I read the cards at a coffee shop, if I am using the Tarot of Prague, someone comes over and says, \\"May I see?\\" I ask them to think of a question and draw a card. Rather than interpreting the card for them, I let the Prague do the talking. And every time, my coffee shop acquaintences find that the card has told them something they needed to know. Wise deck indeed.Do I love it for the art or for the wisdom? Can't have one without the other."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"This deck is so well designed, and has such an in-depth understanding of both Tarot principles and of Prague, that I actually ordered my first copy direct from the publisher in Prague many months ago and had to pay in Pounds Sterling. It's such a great deck that I've done something rare here -- I've ordered back-up copies for myself.The first edition has unique packaging and the decks are numbered 1-3500. The book is WORTH GETTING -- it gives you fascinating insight about Prague and the cards. The cards have a flat finish that gives them a unique feel."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"This is one of those tarot sets that offers something new every time one picks it up. I have the first edition set which comprises the deck of cards and the companion book, attractively boxed. The book, titled The Tarot of Prague, was written by Karen Mahony, an expatriate Irishwoman living (where else) in Prague, Czech Republic, where she has a small publishing company with her companion, Russian expat Alex Ukolov. The book satisfies all of the usual complaints about tarot companion books: it gives thumbnail as well as detailed interpretations of each card; it goes into detail about how the deck and book were produced; and it provides a wealth of information about both tarot and the city of Prague.The deck is done as photocollage, and utilizes every form of art available in Prague: sculpture, painting, mosaic, plasterwork, etc. There is so much detail in each card that a magnifying glass is at times necessary to view the cards to their best advantage. Unlike many tarot decks, which exhibit a dreary sameness from card to card, the Tarot of Prague is a visual feast; every card surprises and delights. You get the feeling that there are stories behind the cards that the creators have kept to themselves, and chuckle over every now and then.The deck is based on the classic images of the Rider-Waite Tarot, but with the vision that Mahony and Ukolov bring to it based on their obvious love of Prague. A person who is familiar with Rider-Waite symbology and interpretations will be quite at home with the Tarot of Prague. The deck at nearly five inches is a little large for my hands, but this is a nitpick. The cardstock is high quality and finished in a matte varnish: no plastic feel here. Very Old World. The backs of the cards are sepia-toned and not reversible, although it takes a very close examination to be able to tell this.As of this writing, the first edition of the deck is very nearly sold out, and a second printing is being manufactured. I have heard that it will be more conventionally packaged in a flapped box, but that changes to the cards are being made to distinguish it from the first edition. That means I'll have to buy a copy of the second printing, so I can compare it with the stunning original!"},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"I waited a long time before I bought this deck. I spent my childhood in the Czech republic, an hour's train ride from Prague, and my heart still knows this city well. I was afraid this deck would not do justice to my memories. Now, having owned and used these cards for close to a year, I wish I had ordered them sooner. This is the one deck I was always searching for, through many years and deck after deck, and all the numerous others I own now pale in comparison.Anyone who knows Prague also knows that she is a city of many layers and a rich and unique history. These cards capture her essence perfectly. Each card is a story that can easily be taken singly, in a one-card reading, or, just as easily, woven together with the others in the greater context of a multi-card spread. The deck is based on the structure of the Rider Waite but is deffinitely not just a simple clone. The images, while generally following in Waite's footsteps, are rich in their own symbolism and allow for new insights. I myself have used this deck exclusively since I got it and it has never failed me. On the contrary, the more I use it, the more depth I see in it.I love the paper the cards are printed on: comfortable and easy in the hand, the cards aren't as glossy as the more commercially spawned decks but have a subtle and unique sheen to them. I also love the images themselves: layer upon layer, seamlessly brought together, minors just as rich as the majors. On some cards, the colours are subtle and ethereal and easy to meditate on. On others they are so vibrant that the images seem to be kinetic. These cards deffinitely have their own soul and personality. They are what Prague is: real, earthy, gilded, magical, and hard to pin down.The accompanying book is excellent. It offers wise and thoughtful interpretations of each card, clearly demonstrating the author's familiarity with the tarot. And again, while grounded in the Waite tradition, the interpretations move beyond Waite to apply to this current age we live in. Further, the book not only gives numerous anecdotes about the city, but also enough background information about the actual place portrayed in each image to allow even those unfamiliar with Prague to feel at home. I've shown these cards to many people, none of whom know Prague as I do, yet they were all just as taken by it as I was. Truly, this deck is more than an art deck. Yes, it is pleasure to look at. But it is also a pleasure to read with and a very worthy tribute to one of the great cities of the world."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"Well, I thought the Dali deck was the end-all-be-all.As a tarot pro, I have just about 100 decks, many of which are rare and discontinued, limited editions, numbered and limited editions.

Finally, a tarot that focuses on Eastern European culture. I have always had a fascination with Prague and would love to visit the true Heart of Europe. Until I can do so, there is this great set of cards to take me there. One can almost hear Mozart playing at the concert house.I have to say this is one of the best presentations for the tarot ever! The box is beautiful, the cardstock is heavier than most, and the accompaning book is done like a long lost magical sourcebook! Surely a collectors item as well as an important addition to the entire history of the tarot.I have seen other collage decks and liked them, Cosmic tribe and the Tarot de Paris. I really love this one! It uses images that are found within the city and fit into the very essence of the tarot system. The Wheel of Fortune contains images from the clock tower that is a symbol of the city itself. I almost need a magnifying glass to see the detailing here.There are no modern New Age themes used at all here. Technology is absent altogether. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I feel Prague is timeless! The meanings of the cards themselves have a very \\"old world\\" feel to them. Many seeming like postcards from the city itself.All of the traditional symbols that one would expect from a great Tarot are here. The standard Rider-Waite system is employed. There is a definite \\"Bohemian\\" accent here. This would be the deck one would expect to see in a Gypsy wagon or Alchemist house. I am very proud to have this deck in my personal possession. Luck as well, for each set is numbered in an addition of 3000."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"\\"We designed the Tarot of Prague to be a vibrant expression of the city. The images are collaged from thousands of original photographs of the streets and houses, the murals and statues, manuscripts and drawings, and even from the games that make up Prague's rich visual treasury.\\" - From the BookletIn some ways, I'm working my way backwards when it comes to the richly produced art of baba studio. To my knowledge, I own every deck and book created by Karen Mahony and Alex Ukolov, having reviewed most of them. However, it wasn't until now that I began to work with The Tarot of Prague, baba studio's signature deck that is so beloved in the Tarot community. (In fact, this deck was recently used in an episode of the TV show Ghost Whisperer!)I don't have the Tarot of Prague kit, just the small box with the L(ittle) W(hite) B(ook), so that's what I'll be reviewing. The Tarot of Prague follows the Rider Waite Smith system, although the Majors aren't numbered, and there's an extra Majors card: Prudence. The upper left hand of the cards depict the number or letter (in the case of Aces and the Courts), with a golden Cup, Sword, Wand, or 5-pointed Star (Pentacle) in the lower right hand corner. Matte-finished cards measure approximately 5\\"x 3\\", with card backings depicting an intricate assemblage of graphite hued scrollwork, birds, candelabras, and humans representing the four elements. At first glance, the backings appear reversible, but upon closer inspection, they are not. However, if you're not looking too closely, you probably won't notice during the shuffling process.The 32-page LWB gives a brief overview of Tarot history, as well as learning and reading the cards. Also provided is a good overview of the general meanings of the numbers and Court Cards (e.g. Pages often indicate exploration, study, enthusiasm, risk-taking beginnings, news, and messages, while the number two often deals with issues of union, balance, decisions, and dealing with emotional forces.) A few spreads are shared, including the Celtic Cross and a specially created 5-card Prague \\"Threshold\\" spread. Upright keywords are given for all the cards, but the Majors are given more attention with a brief explanation. Karen gives a great overview of each of the suits/elements, including the positive and negative sides of each expression.Aesthetically speaking, The Tarot of Prague didn't appeal to me at first. In fact, I still have mixed feelings about the mish-mashed media used for the cards, especially some of the cartoon-like images paired with gorgeous photography. If it were a photo-only collaged deck, like the Tarot de Paris, I think I'd appreciate it more.Because of this initial lack of resonance, I had my doubts about how The Tarot of Prague would read for me. However, I'm happy to please that I just did a 3-card Body, Emotions, Spirit spread and it was quite clear, surprising, and accurate! I had just finished walking over a mile on the treadmill, and was feeling energetic, centered, and clear-minded. I drew the 4 of Cups, 3 of Cups, and Ace of Cups for my spread, and, admittedly, the 4 of Cups in the Body position threw me. I had expected a \\"fiery\\" card to represent the fat-burning engine that had just been stoked (LOL)--a card like The Sun or the Ace of Wands. What in the world was the card of \\"boredom\\" doing in that position?! So I went to the LWB, and to my surprise, it mentioned \\"withdrawal from excesses\\" as one of the possible meanings. How uncanny! You see, I had began a (mostly) low-fat diet back in August, and have lost over 30 pounds so far. One of the things I noticed is that food preference seems to be a habit of sorts, because I no longer craved high-fat foods; in fact, they didn't even appeal to me! So my body was, indeed, on a \\"withdrawal\\" from excess fat--in a good way!The 3 of Cups reflected the emotional \\"high\\" I had felt towards the end of my workout (hello endorphins!), as well as my desire to make it to the 2007 Readers Studio in NYC in April. In my spiritual practice, I had been (trying) to work on cultivating compassion and such, so the Ace of Cups in the Spirit position spoke several meaningful messages to me.So while I didn't immediately connect with the images of the Tarot of Prague, it is proving to be a unique, incisive, accurate deck. Incidentally, the same thing happened with baba studio's Victorian Romantic Tarot; I ABHORRED the artwork (originally) and now it is one of my favorite personal decks for my Card-a-Day readings and journaling. Honestly, there's just something special about Team Karen and Alex!If you're enamored with The Magic City, fans of baba studio, or enjoy (seamlessly) collaged decks, you'll likely enjoy The Tarot of Prague. I don't think it's the best deck for beginners (try baba studio's Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot or The Victorian Romantic Tarot if you're just starting out), but it's a wonderful addition for deck collectors and Tarot readers.(To see 10 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this set.

I had high expectations.....could this tarot truly capture the elusive soul and heart of such a mysterious, haunted, uncanny, quaint, supernatural and fairytale city?Much to my eternal happiness this Tarot does all that and more! To get the full awe-inspiring affect, one must hold these cards in your hands, play with them, caress them and let them ensnare your imagination and soul.There is no modern anything in these cards and images. It's all very Olde World, quaint, strange and mystical. Stautes with life breathed into them by the creators, engravings that seem to come from very old tomes of magic sumptiously, vibrantly and gently coloured, wonderful quirky faces and characters of all stripes and ghouls from an old Cezch bohemian 32-card playing deck, these pop up all over the deck, at times the main focus, at others as odd little hidden curiosities it's a joy to find lurking in a corner.Each card has many layers for as much or as lttle interpertation as you want. The many varied, but all outstandingly beautiful and striking art and styles are very well put together and chosen to compliment one another and really bring each card to life and salient meaning.The book is really the absolute best companion book for a deck I've ever come across, and I have read a lot of them! It's large and well-packed with everything and then some that makes these extraordinary cards sing their wisdom. The author obviously knows her Tarot, and lets us in on her knowledge. The parts pertaining to the deck are just wonderfully eye-opening. She includes many fascinating and fantastical tidbits on the art and architecture and how it adds singular and notable meaning to each card. I've never had a book bring alive a deck and their images quite like this book. There is also added essays called \\"More About\\" and informs you on the stories and fables concerning things in a card. For example Ther Hermit stands in Golden Lane, a very narrow and mysterious, uncanny street with quite the history. Her \\"More about\\" essay tells all about the history any fables connected to it. What fun! The section on getting to know the cards and spreads are superb.For readings, this Tarot has no equal. I am continually astounded and awed by how the cards speak and sing to me with their images and wisdom. I get such in-depth insights, ideas and uncanny intuition from my time spent with the deck. Speaking of intuition if you're looking for a completely intuitive deck, look no further.The cards themselves in the 1st edition are unlike any other deck I've come across (I have almost 500 in my collection). A very sumptious, luxurious heft and feel to them, semi-matte. The backs are a evovative sepia brown. They're the perfect size as well.The art, streets, history, magic, occult, alchemy, fantastic and fantastical enchantments and phantoms of the truly grand city of Prague are captured in this deck and book. You will most certainly not be disapponted.This 1st edition set is almost sold out, there are a few copies still available (as of this review date) for the normal asking price at the publisher's site. I cannot comment on the 2nd edition as I don't have it, but I do know the cardstock is different and they are larger. Also the 2nd edition does not come with a book, once the 1st edition sets are gone, that's it."},{"Title":"The Tarot of Prague Kit: A Tarot Deck and Book Based on the Art and Architecture of the \\"Magic City\\"","review":"I gave this tarot set as a gift to a friend, and she and I have both been enjoying giving each other readings with it.

Fadala's been writing these for decades now, and this one is the most up-to-date. Now (at the end of 2010) it could use a little revision (a few new powders, primers, etc., on the market), but there's no reason you'd need any other book to start.It's also a pretty fun read, and it's broken down very well by subject matter into pretty succinct chapters. Easy to pick up and find what you need. Good for just killing a few minutes or a lazy winter weekend - if you know someone just getting into muzzleloading, this would make a great gift.

I have every edition of this book and will continue to buy new ones because Sam always adds new information about the latest aspects of the sport.

Auden, is one of the best books on the origins of World War II to appear in a long time. A necessary corrective to the overly politics and military strategy-centered analysis of popular writers like Overy, Paul Hehn gives an exceedingly expansive and thorough analysis of the economic interests of the classes and their governments in various countries and how these steered mankind into the most destructive war the world has ever seen.Of course the main question in these books that interests the common reader is the one of blame: how could WWII and the temporary dominance of fascism have been prevented, and why did this not happen? Hehn's economic and statistical analysis gives some strong answers to these questions, without obviously making us forget that we are speaking from hindsight, and that the way to hell is paved with good intentions.The German drive for expansionism is shown to have been inevitable, given that Hitler had decided to rearm. Since Germany had a permanent shortage of foodstuffs and raw materials as the result of its strong rearmament programme, and due to Versailles sanctions it also lacked the necessary gold and foreign currency to pay for importing it, it had to look abroad for the necessary materials. On the one hand, this was done by annexing Austria and the Czechs, which provided Germany with necessary boosts in reserves and materials during periods of crisis to allow the rearmament to continue a bit longer, and on the other hand, Germany pursued a program of using subsidized trade to make the various Eastern European states dependent on Germany, forcing them into political vassalage from which they could not escape. The failure of Polish attempts to appease the Germans and the Allies as well consequently led to the invasion of that country by Germany in 1939, with Hitler fully believing that British guarantees would once again be broken.On the British side, the strong interests in Germany of the British upper class and British finance capital consistently kept the government from exercising a strong anti-German policy, which in turn sabotaged every French attempt at creating a strong alliance in the east to ward off German expansionism. The betrayal of the Czechs by British diplomacy was later followed by betraying Romania and Yugoslavia to the Nazis, all done in the name of protecting British trading interests in Germany as well as to prevent France, the USSR, and the US from gaining a foothold on the continent at the expense of British power. The short-sightedness and treasonous self-interest of the British upper class and of British capital is remarkable, and probably, aside from their German counterparts, the main reason all attempts to restrain Hitler's ambitions failed entirely.Then of course there is the consideration of Germany's own industrial capital, and their interests. Hehn shows very well how the NSDAP was consistently sponsored and financed by German industrial interests, in particular the large companies of IG Farben and Krupp, which had everything to gain from a programme of increased rearmaments and subsequent war. IG Farben's needs for raw materials such as copper and chrome led it to pressure the Nazi government into further expansionism in Eastern Europe, in order to obtain the valuable stores of raw materials there, particularly in Yugoslavia. The German banks were also highly culpable, collaborating in every criminal Nazi undertaking in order to quickly obtain the benefits of plunder of foreign nations, such as taking over the strong banking establishments of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Of course Hitler's 'Lebensraum' ideals played a significant role on their own, but this was not a new concept, and in many ways the German policy of this time was (as AJP Taylor has stressed) a continuation of Wilhelmian imperialist ideals, now made even more criminal by the racist and genocidal elements contained in them.Paul Hehn has done a masterful job showing how the fusion of various states' economic interests, in reality the interests of their ruling classes, and their political power play led to a nightmarish descent into war and genocide from which none could escape. He goes into much detail about the neocolonial interests in Eastern Europe of the various Great Powers, but also shows how these nations themselves responded to this and what their own socio-economic structures were, such as those of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Overall, the French and the Americans seem to come off as least shameful and treasonous from Hehn's analysis (though each had plenty of cowardly and damaging actions on record), whereas the British, with their inclinations towards Germany in the hope of profit and defeating communism, come off particularly poorly.The main downside of the book is that it is far too long, and highly repetitive after a while. In the introduction, Hehn gratefully notes the Continuum Press representative's statement of \\"the longer the book is, the better\\"; but as a reader, I doubt whether that was a good estimation. If the book had been reduced in size by at least one-third, nothing in content would have been lost, and it would have been a lot more pleasant to read. Furthermore, it must be noted that the book expects from the reader a very high prior level of knowledge of the 1930s, as well as a sizable understanding of the economics of international trade, as many names and concepts are used throughout without explanation. A small index of people in the back is some help, but not nearly enough if one hasn't read some histories of this period already (which I fortunately had). Aside from these remarks though, the book is a must-read, and an essential corrective to the overly Nazism-centered histories of WWII."},{"Title":"A Low, Dishonest Decade: The Great Powers, Eastern Europe, and the Economic Origins of World War II, 1930-1941","review":"July 12, 2003A Low Dishonest DecadeBy: Paul N. HehnA Low Dishonest Decade is an account of German economic and financial policy and its design upon the diplomatic and political relations that inexorably leads to World War II.In reading this book, it is assumed the reader has a fairly sophisticated knowledge of pre-war German trade policy, economics, finance, natural resources and the foreign policy positions of both Europe and the United States. Written in chronological format with business style statistics, the author outlines German Third Reich foreign policy actions in direct historical context to the economic and natural resource issues of the pre-war period. And unlike some written accounts of the Third Reich that chronicle revisionist history and unsubstantiated arguments, A Low Dishonest Decade combines economics, strategy and historical events into a very readable documentary. The reader is continually reminded of the precarious financial and natural resource situation facing Germany and this almost desperate and imperative situation advancing Germany's strategic aims prior to the outbreak of military aggression in 1939. Also included is a survey of European countries, diplomatic agreements and the crucial decisions by leaders in world commodity markets as proactive and reactive agents to the realties facing Germany and its future. Along the 405 pages are photos from the Getty archives of important policy leaders, a boundary line map of Hungary from the Library of Congress, and a glossary of key names and diplomatic agreements, the later of which appears to be missing.Although the primary focus of this book is on markets, economics and finance also included in the typeface is a limited strategy of the German military forces and the political \\"Mein Kampf\\" Liebenstraum ideology affecting this transitional period of economic initiative to offensive warfare.Sean Marche"},{"Title":"A Low, Dishonest Decade: The Great Powers, Eastern Europe, and the Economic Origins of World War II, 1930-1941","review":"In this detailed and challenging book, Paul Hehn, Professor Emeritus of the State University of New York at Brockport, examines the origins of World War Two. He also studies the origins of the earlier World War.He shows that World War One had its root causes in capitalism. He cites the Daily Telegraph, which said on 19 August 1914, \\"This war provides our businessmen with such an opportunity as has never come their way before ... There is no reason why we should not permanently seize for this country a large proportion of Germany's export trade.\\"As for World War Two, he points out, \\"Neville Chamberlain undoubtedly wished the Germans to move east into the Soviet Union.\\" \\"Undoubtedly British and French navet&eacute; and appeasement of Hitler could be explained by the unspoken hope and expectation that he would ultimately turn east and attack the Soviet Union and destroy Communism.\\"Hehn writes of the \\"upper class hatred of the Soviet Union on the part of Chamberlain and his friends. This same hatred led them to place class survival over the interests of the country which in the end led to the debacle of World War II. Chamberlain and his friends in the government desired to give Hitler at Munich a \`free hand in the east' - and probably before Munich - well into the opening months of 1939 and beyond, even after it became apparent that Hitler's aggressive policy and ambitions placed Great Britain and France in mortal danger.\\" The Non-Aggression Pact thwarted this British state scheme - no wonder they hate the Pact so much!Hehn sums up that capitalism was to blame for both World Wars: \\"If one considers that World War I also occurred as a quarrel within capitalism with the United States coming in later as in World War II, the first Great War having caused an estimated 35 million casualties and the Second World War about 55 million, totalling 90 million, then capitalism may be credited with generating one of the greatest slaughters in history.

Fans of Chronicles of Narnia or Harry Potter will be sure to like this book, which spins a delightful tale. The author transports us into their mystical world with ease, and it is a book that you will not want to put down.Thousands of years ago a bridge between a side realm called Souda and Earth opened, enabling the two to mix. Dragons attempted to bring peace to mankind but mankind resisted. Eventually, the dragons returned to Souda but a Black Dragon, Dakku, who sought power over Earth, waged war against all dragons who opposed him. Four dragons who lost their lives in the battle now must find humans in which they can co-exist, awaiting the moment when they are all united to stop Dakku from gaining mastry over both realms.The prophecy maintains the one who bears the sign of the Calla Lilly will be the chosen one to unite the dragons. Now, they must go in search of a young girl named Cassia, who bears that sign. Danger and magic abound in this tale of Cassia and her mystical legacy. Sara Price's characters and descriptions are very vivid, reminiscent of The Tenth Kingdom.The conclusion is a teaser of more to come. Sara Price has created truly magical characters. I would recommend this booK!"},{"Title":"Georgina","review":"By the time she wrote Georgina, Ms Darcy seemed to have a firmer understanding of narrative structure. She was slipping more information into the intereaction of the characters rather than long paragraphs of exposition.This novel had an unusual hero for it's time (or indeed since). He is the illegitimate son of an Earl, who had been raised with the Earl's own children and given the task of running the Earl's estates. After his father died he did not get along with the new heir so he was set on finding a new post. Instead he chanced to meet an Irish heiress, marry her and go journeying on the continent.When the novel opens, the heiress is dead (within a year of their marriage) and her estate has passed to the widower's hands adding the reputation of fortune hunter to his own significant social disabilities. He is expected at any moment to arrive and claim his estate. Meanwhile the relation who had been in charge of the estate in the absense of its owners, has let things get very much out of hand. The Bailiff has the accounts in a muddle, the Butler has been in the Madeira and Arabella, who should have removed herself and her son months ago, has complicated the matter by inviting a young cousin, who was by way of being an heiress herself, to visit in the hopes that she would make a match with her son Brandon.Georgina, who was sent to Ireland in disgrace because she would not marry a suitor approved by her tartar of a grandmother, is a headstrong miss with decided ideas about honor and family feeling. She is quite determined to support her cousins against this interloper. But when the interloper does appear to have some finer qualities she finds herself championing him against the prejudices of the neighborhood worthies instead.Unfortunately the heroine is 18 and her social sense is not yet developed. Her attempts at bringing Mr. Shannon into the County society are more well meaning than successful.This book still bears reading. The Regency era is more than wallpaper to the story. The characters are interesting. And if I spent a certain amount of time wanting to shake Georgina, it has to do with the 30 years that have passed since I last read this book, rather than any lack of skill on the author's part. I have the same reaction to most of my friends' children at that age."},{"Title":"Georgina","review":"Georgina is a Regency in the Heyer tradition although, unusually for this genre, mostly set in Ireland.Georgina, after rejecting a suitable offer of marriage from Mr Smallwood, goes to visit some Irish relatives to get away from her overbearing grandmother and weak mother. The Irish family, the Quinlevans, have to leave their home as it has passed to Mr Shannon, husband of their relative Nuala who died in somewhat suspicious circumstances. Georgina hasn't escaped matrimonial plans by going to Ireland as Mrs Quinlevan is hoping that Georgina will make a match with her son, Brandon.Mr Shannon makes his appearance and all the plans go awry - he is ostracised by the neighbours and yet over time Brandon and Georgina find themselves liking him and trying to work on his behalf to make him socially acceptable. We learn that Mr Shannon didn't particularly like his wife Nuala and their marriage only lasted two years before her death. Georgina finds herself in company with Mr Shannon and wanting to spend more time with him against all the advice of her relatives. She is courted by some of the important people and yet can't bring herself to fully become part of their social circle which requires that she ignore Mr Shannon.The ending is no great surprise, the only difference being that we are offered hints of a mystery - why did Mr Shannon marry Nuala? why doesn't he grieve her death? did she die mysteriously? - that aren't really answered. I never understood why he fell in love with Georgina, or she with him, and why his previously appalling track record with his wife didn't seem to have any influence on her decision.Setting, language and tone of the book were generally good, although Georgina persuading a relative to take her off to Ireland without her family knowing seemed remarkably unlikely, and the book was a reasonable read, but it's not as good as a Georgette Heyer novel. Still, worth getting hold of if you like this genre of book."},{"Title":"Georgina","review":"I liked the characters in this book very much and the story was interesting enough to keep me reading.

This book expresses with a beautiful economy of words what really matters in piano playing. Mrs. Onishi shows that she knows a lot about technique, but her main focus is to get to the meaning which lies hidden behind the 'dead' black dots on the paper. She does so with reverence to her teachers, who were all more or less students of Tobias Matthay. Her book pays tribute to Matthay's ideas, without getting too much into a repetition of what he has been writing. Particularly important are the few chapters about teaching in the end of the book.

Things are so clearly explained that I hear a difference in my playing right away. This book is worth much more than it's price. Love it."},{"Title":"Pianism SIGNED","review":"This book is a reference book about playing the piano. It would be foolish for an amateur pianist to use this book as a substitute for piano lessons. Reading about technique and mechanics is one thing; actually having an excellent piano teacher supervising and learning from them is quite another. The material covered in this book reviews what I learned years ago from a combination of undergrad and graduate level piano professors, and a \\"history of the piano\\" course covered the mechanics of the instrument. The book doesn't touch what I've picked up along the way since then, and I've picked up a lot. To me, this book was boring. But I'm certain to some aspiring pianists the author is a fountain of knowledge.There is so much material covered in this book, and other books like it published about playing the piano, that I would think for a student looking to improve, it is overwhelming to read in its entirety. The book covers hand positions, wrist positions, arm positions, posture, and all the different touches and rotations and how they all relate to each other and the mechanics of the keyboard, and incorporating all of it into aspiring pianists' playing. Oh, and don't forget the pedaling, and don't forget those dynamics, etc., etc. It makes me tired just thinking about it. And I never get tired of playing the piano or teaching, but this book wears me out. Taking quality lessons from a highly qualified teacher who uses a cumulative approach would probably be better and easier for a student than trying to learn from this book about playing.Ms. Onishi certainly knows her way around a piano and her subject matter - no disputing that. And the book can be helpful when researching a particular topic - for example, searching for an exercise or two, or maybe clarifying a specific touch, or a pedaling idea, and then attempting to implement her directions. It's nice to get someone else's take on creating sounds, etc. But again, a live, qualified expert instructor would be better for most aspiring students. A book is no substitute for an excellent, live teacher. Most amateur pianists tend to exaggerate teachers' instructions - and that also includes this particular author's instructions - and that can result in practicing incorrectly which can lead to problems and bad habits that are difficult to break. Some readers will never be certain if they're playing correctly and achieving what they want if they're using just this book as a substitute piano teacher.Some of the above reviewers strike me as if they've never had quality piano instruction and need a book to fill in the blanks and answer some questions. The problem with reading all the advice given in this book is that there's plenty of room for misinterpretation by an amateur pianist. Book or no book, I strongly recommend finding an excellent instructor and learning to play with quality supervision. Then after a student truly knows what they're doing, they can reread this book and think \\"Oh, so that's what she means.\\""},{"Title":"The complete Edgar Cayce readings","review":"There are hundreds of books generated by the phenomenal psychic abilities of Edgar Cayce.

My suggestion is read insight, determine where and when you want to visit and then seek out up to date information on hotels, etc. from another source."},{"Title":"Insight Guide Chile","review":"Quality handbook that includes nice historical depth, perspective and quality images. The review of the Pinochet regime, however, unfortunately comes off as stock socialist perspective.

My children ask me to read it every Christmas time when I pull it out of storage. It is a touching and heart warming story about a special bear that Santa makes himself and grows to love. At the end, Santa does a very selfless deed that gets me crying every time! I recommend this story because it keeps the younger ones' interest as well as send a positive message."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"My daughters' favorite Christmas story.

Actually, I have ordered a bear for all 3 kids so they don't fight over who will sleep with hime. The stories are great and the bears are adorable little 'beanie baby' size stuffed animals."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"This book is magical for kids - I just bought a second one to make sure both of my sons have this book when they are grown and have their own children. The story is about Peef - a bear that Santa makes by hand. Peef is Santa's right-hand \\"bear\\", but really longs to be given as a gift to a boy or girl, but he just can't bring himself to tell Santa. Santa figures it out and decides to give him to a child on Christmas Eve. Great lesson about love. Definitely buy the stuffed Peef they sell with the books and then place it in bed with your child Christmas Eve. After the kids have read the book several times leading up to Christmas, and then wake up to Peef on Christmas morning, they feel so special. They believe Santa decided they were the one who was special enough to receive his special bear."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"I am so looking forward to reading this to my kids!

I'm very glad that I did. It is a delightful story and I hope that it will become a tradition to read this to him many, many times before Christmas Eve. As a bonus, I purchased Peef the 9\\" Bear also, for Santa to put under the tree. I thought after hearing the story so much, my son would be happy to see that sweet bear under his tree.

By the time I reached the last two pages, I was not sure I could finish the story! I was quite teary eyed! I continued to read it to other childrne throughout the evening. We had the bear to hold during the story. Guess what, when you push his belly, he does go PEEF!This is a must read! You will get in the holiday spirit! Read it to others, and I promise you they will say Thank You!"},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"This book is cute. Adorable, if you will. I am a 15-year-old boy who just used the words &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;adorable&quot;. That's right. I have strayed from the stereotype of a teenager being &quot;too cool&quot; to think anything's cute. Tom Hegg's tale found a way into my heart. Right from the beginning, you can tell the story's going to be good. With the ryhming lines, colorful illustrations, and warm mood, you can't help but read on. In a nutshell, Santa calls upon his elves to aquire different fabrics, with which Santa makes an adorable (there's that word again!) teddy bear. Peef, the Christmas Bear loved dooing oddjobs around the workshop for the Big Guy, but being among these toys made him long for a child to hold him. Watch your entire family's faces light up as you read this beautiful story to them during December (or even Christmas Eve!). This book has the special kind of magic which makes it last through the generations, so that your grandchildren's grandchildren will feel the same joy that you felt when you read it for the first time. Don't miss out on this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"I came across this book during a shopping expedition earlier this month.

He's asked all of his elves to pick out their favorite fabric and bring it to him. Just what is Santa doing? Why he's making a multi-colored Christmas Bear, that when the final stitch is completed and with a push from Santa's finger, the bear speaks his own name...Peef.Peef is an important bear. He is Santa's chief assistant and dearly loves Santa. But what Peef really wants is to belong to and bring happiness to a special child. That doesn't seem to be Peef's fate until one Christmas Eve when Santa is one toy short. Peef's dream is realized as he is left behind to bring one special child great happiness.This is a wonderful Christmas story! It wraps up the gift of love, sacrifice and the sense of belonging all in one little bear. The illustrations are spectacular and will draw children and adults alike into the story.Armchair Interviews says: This book, first introduced in 1995, is sure to become a classic and treasured by all children everywhere who dream of loving that special bear."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"No matter how many times I have read this book I can't get through it without getting all choked-up.

Although other similar purchases were soon cast aside, Peef has remained her fast friend for an entire year! This Thanksgiving, all her other stuffed animals got their own table and gave a birthday party for the bear loved for so much of a child's lifetime.Perhaps this explains why the book has such a hold on us. It is one of the few children's books that still brings a mist to the eyes when read. The style , tone, and pace of the book are all excellent. My one wish? I do wish the publisher would produce a version where the child to whom Peef goes is a girl rather than a boy. I read it to my daughter and her friends that way sometimes...As in the story, this Peef has made a child very happy. I like to think that he is too."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"I first heard Peef when we were reading books to a Sunday school class....lets just say that Peef now has a special place in my heart... even time I think of that cuddly little bear yearning for a child's love I get teary.... A christmas must have."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"This book has to be the most heartwrenching, beautifully warm story I have read about Christmas. I can hardly get to the last page without getting teary eyed. It's a very sweet story about the love Santa has for a little bear and all the children of the world. I just love it and would recommend it for anyone for their children for fantastic christmastime reading. It really is a treasure."},{"Title":"Peef the Christmas Bear (Peef the Bear)","review":"My daughter received both the book and the bear as a baby gift, from my aunt who owns a store that sells only teddy bears! That alone says something about the special story of Peef, who loves Santa too much to ask to be given away to a little girl or boy, and Santa, who loves Peef enough to know without being told. This is my favorite children's book, and one of my daughter's favorites, too. The little Peef teddy bear, however, is absolutely her favorite, and has been since she was 9 months old. He is a perfect size for little hands to hold, and is much loved and well-traveled. A copy of the book and the bear is my usual choice for a baby gift, and I am ordering another bear to keep as a \\"spare\\"--I am terrified my daughter's bear is going to be lost, and we will never sleep again."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"I've read almost all macro textbooks since my undergraduate and postgraduate studies some ten years ago. Farmer's is the BEST in my view. The most important achievement of this book is that it bridges the gap between the static macroeconomics taught at the undergraduate level and the dynamic macroeconomics taught at the postgraduate level. I myself found it rather difficult to jump from one level to the next when I first began my postgraduate study. If I had the opportunity to learn from Farmer's, I would have found it much easier to pick up advanced macro. There are many other nice features in this book as well. I like the introductory chapters on the use and interpretation of macro data. As a practicing researcher now, I find them extremely helpful. As I read through this book, I don't have the usual feeling that the subject matters are far away from the real world. The flow of topics is also pedagogically sound, starting from classical theories, then to &quot;modern&quot; theories, and finally ending at dynamic macro. The exposition is clear, and the whole text is extremely well-written and highly readable. Farmer has the ability to keep the readers' attention, and stay focus on the important ideas. This is a terrific piece! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE ON THE COMPARATIVE METHOD: FOR STUDENTS, CRAFTSMEN, AND AMATEURS","review":"Amazingly thorough review of architecture through the ages.

The fact is that the DRAWINGS, PHOTOS/PICTURES in this book are very important and necessary to make the the book complete as an architectural reference and resource. Not only that, but the description on the Amazon website did not indicate that the DRAWINGS and PHOTOS/PICTURES would be missing.

He personally reads this abridgement of This Present Darkness in such a way that holds the listener's attention throughout the entire story. I bought this as a replacement for the cassette version that I'd had for about 10 years before it went bad as a result of being listened to many, many times while driving.I also highly recommend the sequel,Piercing the Darkness.

Peretti has done a wonderful job at creating a ficticious book with a gripping plot and great characters, while painting a picture of spiritual warfare that is so true.

I don't see how any Christian who sincerely reads this book could be inactive with their prayer life afterwards. Certainly, this book and its story line are all fiction. However, the possibilities presented and the practical principles developed within these pages, are perfectly inline with Scripture. Peretti places an emphasis on prayer and the fact that spiritual war is going on all around us. I have seen many Bible students become transformed and motivated after reading this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the first Christian book I had ever read.

This book was written with not the general audience in line but the bible thumping reader in mind. In the first chapters alone you could tell this. I bought these by quiclky skimming a review of the The Calling by David Mack {Big mistake not to happen again} where a particular reviewer said this book was much better. Luckliy I bought this and another FP novel used. When I recived them they both had bible study group info stamped in them. I still tried them anyway.

He really sheds new light on spiritual warfare. Draws one into the story while making one realize the possible severe consequences of &quot;playing around&quot; with the occult.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I felt that Peretti made a masterpiece when he wrote this book.

Working in books for years, I have not talked to a person who did not benefit from this book and enjoy it in the process. It is eye-opening, convicting, edge of your seat excitement, AND it is well written. Do not miss this masterpiece!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I won't bother giving a plot synopsis as other reviewers have. What I do want to say is that I have read this book a half a dozen times already, and I love it every time. The writing, in my opinion, is not particularly exceptional, but the story is so engaging that it makes the reader, this reader anyway, overlook that. The writing isn't bad, by any means, just not notably fantastic.The descriptions of the angels and the demons are vivid and add another level of suspense and excitement to the story. The characters all have their own personalities and I felt I got to know them as the book progressed. There is enough corruption and darkness to keep the intrigue and suspense flying, so the pages fly too.I have loaned my copy of this book to many people, and I will continue to recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've always wanted to read this book, but never got around to it for one reason or another. This classic debut novel by Frank Peretti does what C.S Lewis' \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" did for a previous generation: It brings spiritual warfare to the forefront. The book is about the spiritual battle for the soul of the town of Ashton. Rev. Hank Busche and local newspaper editor Marshall Hogan separately uncover a plot by the town bigwigs to bring New Age consciousness and demon worship to the masses.But alternating between scenes involving protagonists and antagonists are scenes where angels and demons duke it out for the soul of the city. There are breathtaking battles throughout the novel. There are also spunky characters like Bernice and sinister characters like Professor Langstrat and Rev. Oliver Young, and Chief Al Brummel.But some of the storyline borders on the cartoonish. Are we to believe that demons attack engine carburetors so that cars break down?On the other hand, the book does a great of showing how the angels of God rely heavily on \\"prayer cover,\\" that is, the degree of their effectivess is impacted by the power and consistency of our prayers. I loved reading about how Rev. Busche was feared by the demon world because he was always praying.I really wanted to give this book 4 stars instead of five because the cosmic conflicts with demons and angels often reminded me of Ninja turtle battle scenes. The book occasionally lacks the realism of C.S Lewis' aforementioned masterpiece. But the story line is amazing, and after this novel, scores of popular books on spiritual warfare came out. Jerry Jenkins also cites this book as a key influence on many of the later Christian fiction classics that were released, including the Left Behind series.Because of the book's unique historical importance, I decided to give it 5 stars (with reservations). I should also say that \\"The Oath\\" is still my favorite Peretti novel."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Review by Jill WilliamsonBernice Krueger, reporter for the Ashton Chronicle, finds herself in jail after being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She came to Ashton to investigate the supposed suicide of her sister. Now, she and her boss, Marshall Hogan, start investigating some strange occurrences in town.Hank Busche is a small town pastor who is trying to keep his argumentative congregation from falling apart. Little does he know, there are dark forces in town that are set on seeing him fail. As demons characters carry out their assignments, Marshall and Hank become more determined to discover the truth. But can two men fight a host of demons they cannot see? And why is the host of heaven standing around and watching? Aren't they going to do anything to stop this evil plot from taking over the town?Wow. This book has changed the way I think of angels and demons. There are many references in the Bible that lead me to believe there is a spiritual war going on around us that we can't see. But never have I read anything to give me such a clear picture of how that might look. In Daniel 10, Daniel has a vision of an angel coming to speak to him. The angel says in verses 12-14, \\"Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.\\"This has always amazed me. That God told this angel to come and talk to Daniel, but the angel got held up fighting some demon over in Persia. In the Bible, angels are sometimes referred to as princes. I believe this angel was talking about how he was fighting with the prince of the Persian kingdom, who was a fallen angel, or demon, since he was resisting one of the host of heaven. It's this idea that Peretti builds his story around. The idea that there are angels and demons waging war around us in a dimension that we cannot see. They can see us, but we can't see them. And in Peretti's story, the demons want to rule Ashton and the angels are there to make sure God's plan prevails.This Present Darkness is an awesome story. Marshall, Bernice, and Hank slowly stumble onto the truth and have to work together to save Ashton. I love how Peretti showed the angels as mighty warriors interacting with one another. I also loved how Peretti showed the power of prayer. I kept rooting for the characters to pray, already! This book was thrilling, scary, amazing, and brilliant. I can't say enough wonderful things about it. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life, if not over and over again."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I highly recommend this book.

Very well done."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Ever have that feeling that somebody is watching you? That you are not completely alone?

Bought in on my kindle so I'll have it handy."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"With THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, Frank Peretti broke onto the scene by graphically tearing back the veil between our world and the spirit world. Descending upon the small town of Ashton, angels, demons, and strongmen engage in vivid spiritual battle and we, the reader, are able to see it all unfold. Ever wonder what exactly a guardian angel might do? Here's one possible scenario.While Peretti's theology on the subject may not be perfect (many of his ideas are pure speculation, but that's why it's &quot;fiction&quot;), he does most definitely give us a bold reason as to why prayer is so vital. Why prayer does, in fact, move mountains and can turn the tide in unseen spiritual battles that are taking place around us (as happens in the book of Daniel). For that reason alone, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS is worth reading.To be fair, this is not Peretti's best written book. THE OATH and THE VISITATION are both more sound, from a literary perspective (real character development, for example, isn't the best here). But before the LEFT BEHIND series, no other Christian novels were as widely read as this and its sequel. It is a true Christian fiction classic and a real page-turner that will have you burning the midnight oil. FOUR 1/2 STARS."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In the last 40+ years I have only read 3 books more than once. This is one of them and I have read it 3 times. There were a few years in between each read, but every time, I enjoy it as much as the first. If you ever question \\"Are there really angels on our side, is there a God, how does Satan and his demons get to us, are our bad habits encouraged by Satan, etc\\" this book will answer those questions and give you a mental picture of what they look like and what they are doing. Written as a story, it is captivating and awe inspiring. I'm a believer so I didn't need this book to convince me of anything, but, it left me with a feeling that angels really do stay right by my side and they and God are fighting for me every minute to help me stay away from the wrong path and keep me alive and well. The angels are the warriors fighting the Enemy every step of the way and your prayers give them strength. Keep praying and read this book. Or like me...read it more than once!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful book! Frank Peretti writes in a style that is engaging and suspensful. He weaves together a plot involving both a human struggle of philosophical and political agendas, and the spiritual battle occuring at the same time between the spiritual forces of good (Angels) and evil (Demons).It is this weaving of the plot between everyday issues and spiritual long term agendas that is the most compelling reason to read this book. The spiritual battles come to life in such a vivid way, that you may never view your life in the same way again! The images of how the spiritual battles are waged between God's Angels and the principalities of darkness, and how people are used for purposes beyond thier personal agendas, are presented in a manner which turns the perception of current events into something perhaps more than they appear to be.The book starts a bit slow, seemingly the day in the life of a small town, but once the plotlines start coming together you won't be able to put it down. The main characters are developed well, and are presented as real people who could be our neighbors. It is fiction all the way, so don't expect an academic thesis on the supernatural and Biblical themes of spiritual realms, simply enjoy the story and the message.I have given copies of this book to dozens of people and have not had anyone, Christian or Athiest, not enjoy the story. I highly recommend this book, as well as it's sequel: \\"Piercing The Darkness\\"."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Have you ever known that you are supposed to do something, but you can't seem to motivate yourself? Have you felt like the whole world is against you? Have you ever felt like what you were doing just wasn't what you wanted? If you answered yes, then you should definitely give &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; a try. This book gives a possible reason as to why we have these feelings.Frank Peretti gives us a tale of a small college town that has a war going on in it. It's not a war with guns and bombs, but a spiritual war. There are demons all over the town, making people turn away from God. The demons plan to take the entire town and rid the town of the angels that have come to help. It is a wonderful tale of good versus evil. It is very gripping and as my title tells, &quot;Frighteningly realistic&quot;. I'm sure everyone has felt like they should be doing something, but there is something that is holding you back. This book gives a very unique idea as to why that happens. Read it and you might look at things a little differently. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book (And it's follow up) more than once when I was an older teenager. It is written very well and I am about to purchase it for my kindle so that my eldest son can read it, after I do another reading of it myself. Yes, I want to read it again myself!If you like Christian fnatasy that also has a strong basis for teaching you that sacraficing for God is not actually...a sacrafice..it's freedom, you'll find this book right up your alley! Just as Jesus died on the cross (Sacraficed himself), so does this book put readers in the shoes of intense characters and tramatic experiences where they lay it all down for what they believe in. Some lay it down for God, some lay it down for other things.Make no mistakes, these characters are not all goody two shoes. They learn their lessons the hard way..just as we do. It can be a rough ride doing what you believe, stepping up your faith, and willing to give it all for God. This book does not hold back the mortal costs, but neither does it leave out the immortal gains (and losses) for these costs. This book brings you right into the horror of what many don't even realize is out there. Not only evil as defined by the word 'Satan and devil', but the evils humanity itself can and will do."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoyed the book but as a Christian who cares about the bible, I was shocked by the theology of this book. It has almost nothing to do with the bible, yet people seem to take it seriously.I strongly caution Christians (espcially new ones) when reading this book. I also encourage non-Christians to lean what real theologians believe"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Very entertaining writing. Very bad source for determining a biblical understanding of spiritual warfare. Case in point, the role of the Holy Spirit is non-existant in the book and yet without the Holy Spirit in our lives we have no &quot;teacher, comforter, counsellor or guide&quot;. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are absent as well, which requires the ability of the believer or assistance of ministering spirits to accomplish God's work. Stick to scripture for proper understanding of how God works and the Christian response to Him"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Interesting that people are saying his characters are &quot;predictable.&quot; A sure sign of bad writing is &quot;unpredictable&quot; characters, which means, more likely than not, a weak plot and underdevelopment. I don't understand why people didn't just stop reading the book if it was below their literary caliber. What literary caliber that is I don't know, as the plot progressed so well and smoothly, with perspectives from so many different characters, not once losing the reader, that I'd call that some first-class writing. What I love about this book was the way it held me in suspense until I finished it all! You know it'll be a happy ending, but how that will come about keeps you riveted. Undoubtedly, it's dangerous to take the book as a Biblical parallel. It's a fictional work and uses convenient Biblical truths for illustration. But insightful-reminded me of the Screwtape Letters"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This work of fiction by Frank Peretti draws a picture of the underlying spiritual powers at war in this world. He draws his inspiration from the Biblical passage Ephesians 6:12, \\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\\" The general plot line focuses on two main characters, a pastor and a newspaperman, who live in the small town of Ashton, where corruption and deception are threatening to creep in and turn the people to new-age occultism. The plot gripped my attention, and the characters were well developed. Clever twists in the story also kept me reading.Further, the book is a good encouragement to prayer, an often underutilized aspect of Christian life. The colorful portrayals of angels and demons is primarily speculation, but mostly harmless. I would recommend reading \\"This Present Darkness,\\" but one should make sure to keep the Biblical perspective on angels and demons in focus."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think Peretti is the Stephen King of religious suspense fiction. This is one of his best, perhaps THE best. Very, very gripping and memorable. I would recommend it to adults but especially to teens as well. This story really shows the power of God.

It really brings home the concept of angels protecting us as we go about our daily business. I could not put it down!! Make sure you have time to read it BEFORE you start...cuz it will keep you engaged. LOVED IT!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book from cover to cover ...hanging on every word. It was truly a revelation. I realize that some critics will want to debate the theology involved but that is quite ludicrous and pointless. It is difficult to find a 100% consensus in ANY church wherein everyone agrees with everyone else and the pastor theologically. What is most important is that Christians are in agreement about who, what Christ IS. This book is fiction obviously ...but biblically based and an extremely good read. No ...it is a GREAT read. In fact ...I'm going to read it again. But first I'll have to buy it again. I wanted everyone to read it so I loaned mine to several people. Well ...you know how that goes ...I haven't seen it since it was last loaned out. But the main thing is that I also purchased the audio narration which is very very well done by Mr Perreti himself ...some sound effects ...only his voice but again ...very well done. I have to give this one 5 stars ...if I could give it more than 5 out of 5 I would.If you haven't read it ...and are on the fence then I said JUST DO IT~~~~You'll be soooo glad that you did.I highly highly recommend it.Other recommendations for books dealing with spiritual warfare:You've ALSO just GOT to read his other book \\"This Present Darkness\\"This Present DarknessThe following book \\"GIFTED HANDS\\" is also a good read (not great but GOOD). The main thing is that it is a very inspiring story. I gave this book to my son on his birthday and told him that I also got him the DVD but he had to read the book first before he could watch the movie. My son (19 at the time NEVER reads) but he read this book cover to cover in one evening, said he enjoyed it a lot and was ready to watch the movie.Gifted Hands, Kids Edition: The Ben Carson Story (ZonderKidz Biography)Unfortunately there are very very few books out like Frank Perettis.It was largely because of \\"PIERCING THE DARKNESS and \\"THIS PRESENT DARKNESS\\" that I bought the book below, GUARDIAN ANGEL: 15 Year Old Sex Slave thinking that it might be of a similar type. I guess I ignored the fact that they say THIS book is NOT fiction but rather a true story as told by the author who was involved. So I didn't get all the behind the scenes angels and demons dialogues and struggles ...but yet I could see that there was a LOT going on behind the scenes in the battle for this young girls body and soul. This author, John Pryor is no Frank Peretti but ...I don't think he tries to be ...the story is so powerful that he doesn't need to be.Guardian Angel: True Story of 15 Year old Sex Slave Freed by an AngelAnother book that I'm going to recommend is \\"PREPARE FOR WAR\\" by Rebecca Brown MD. Now THIS was the very first book that I read which dealt with angels, demons, etc. It was pretty compelling too. The difference is that whereas Frank Peretti wrote fiction and ever pretended it was anything more and John Pryor wrote a true story and never tried to make it out to be anything more ...I suspect that Rebecca Brown is somewhere in the middle ...yet purports this entire story to be \\"TRUE\\". Now THAT ...is a stretch. Perhaps she took literary and creative license a bit too far in order to enhance the story. Many author's will do that ...but as a reader I demand honesty. If it's \\"based\\" upon a true story but largely fiction just SAY SO! If it IS a true story but you had to embellish or create a bit to make it a bit more readable and fill in the gaps then SAY SO! (At least Mr Pryor sticks to his mission in saying he would NOT embellish or create but just \\"tell the story\\" ...and he does it well and with style.) Having said that ...and making this comparison ...I will say that Prepare for War is a good read and it WILL make you think differently about spiritual things. ..But I treated it largely like spiritual fiction rather than a \\"true story\\".Prepare For WarI'm still waiting for one of both of Mr Peretti's books to be made into a major motion picture."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could not put this book down once I started it.

Wow!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"First heard of this book and how it changed people's ways of thinking on how the spiritual realm worked. Since it came from the '80's, I was hesitant. Checked it out anyway, and I was thinking one thing, since people couldn't take gritty Christian writing before Ted Dekker came about: how was this not controversial in its day? It probably was and I don't know about it.A mystery starts when a journalist takes a photo of something she should not have seen. That no one should have seen. With that one photo, two people are on a race against time to uncover what turns out to be an immense conspiracy to bring down Christianity and raise New Age in triumph. However, I was completely taken off-guard with how gritty the book was: a demon-possesed kid coming into church and starts spewing cusswords at a preacher's wife; said preacher finds degrading graffiti all over the front of his house; angels getting beaten up savagely by demons; a man with a past of heavy drugs; women claiming to be raped; demonic rituals and demons listening with anti-human glee; and more. This contrasted with some rather light humor was also surprising, as well as inspiring, and it got me thinkign about how closely the spiritual realm is connected to ours. I kept wondering how Frank could have conceived such a grand-scale conspiracy story from one little incident, yet I couldn't stop reading it all the way through and enjoying it all."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm only about half way through the book, but I'm enjoying it so far.There are definitely elements of \\"Christian cheese\\" that make me roll my eyes (i.e. demons are camping out in the University - brainwashing young minds!)

There aren't enough words to impress upon you how much I encourage you to read this book and also &quot;Piercing The Darkness&quot; which is very much like this one including the same powerful Spiritual Warfare Angels such as Tal. Mr. Peretti's other books are fine but not on the level of enthusiasm as these two. HEY MR.

He brought the christian unseen world into a context that is understandable and enjoyable. As one other reviewer sia,d most xian literature is dreadfully dull and unredable. This, and Jim Walker's books are very readable. Some of the pheology is stretched, but I think it's done so to give the story life. I do wish some angels had been killed, and are demons ugly? Also, some of the demons asked who Tal was. They all knew each other! That whole temper tamtrem that was put in there could have been eliminated. I don't believe that newagers are trying to take over the world like he says, but it does make for a good read. If you haven't read the book do so!

It is an account of spiritual warfare and the constant strugle between good and evil. Any one who could read this book, and spend more time trying to be philisophical is a fool, and will probubly not enjoy the book any way. It shows how there are only two kingdoms in the world, Gods and the devils. Man is not, and will not ever be in control of it's own destiney. You either side with darkness or light, there is no inbetween. I loved it and find that it is still his best work ever. The purpose of the book is not to be the best liturary work ever written, but to show the inherent reality of spiritual warfare. It will enlighten and thrill any one who reads it with a pure heart and mind. The charachters are not shallow and develop into strong mature charachters. What I think some people have a problem with is that the charachters find christ and change from the inside out. They do not evolve from excperiance and loss, only through the changing power of God. He shows the truth in a dying world through a fasinating and action pact fictional novel, that has more truth to it then most things socety holds as true. With that said I leave you with one finall thought...&quot;For the saints of God, and for the lamb!&quot;"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The most helpful thing to remember when reading Frank Perreti's spiritual warfare novels, is that they are not meant as allegories.

The plot is certainly relevant. However, the characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on, and the story is told rather clumsily. I understand that he's written much else since this novel first saw publication, so perhaps he's improved.

I dont know how this person can give it one star and bad ratings, he/she appears to be a know it all, but i have one thing to say to this person, read it again and OPEN YOUR HEART!!! if you dont its no wonder you disliked the book. Search your feelings, take a day and relax all of this &quot;theology&quot; stuff whatever it is. Wake up and take a look at your self, This is the best book in the entire world and prpobably the best writer. Please read Eight Cousins by Louisa May Alcott, Thanks for the best book ever Mr. Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was an excellent book which I read several years ago, and continue to re-read. While I question the use of prayer to give energy to angels, the rest of it is very close to the reality of spiritual warfare. I know this from personal experience. This book serves not only to entertain, but to inform and awaken people to the unseen realities of this world. Prayer is powerful and works!The reader from U of DE need to re-read his Bible. The demons that the disciples could not cast out were because they were using the names of Peter and Paul, not Jesus the Christ. Faithful Christians find all things are possible through prayer in the name of Jesus.Regarding the non-christian religions, Christians KNOW there is only one way - Jesus. Bear in mind, it is God, the judge, who knows what is in each heart. All true Christians love (tolerate)the sinner, BUT it is sinful, and un-loving, to accept the sinful behavior. When your child is making a mistake, you still love him/her as you attempt to correct their behavior. As to fortune telling, witchcraft, New Age and other &quot;alternative religions&quot; being demonic that is the fact. Anyone who does not confess that Jesus Christ is their Saviour is on the wrong track, no matter how kind or well-intentioned. You may not like it, but denying you have a flat tire will not get it fixed.Enough theology; this is an entertaining and informative book on what we are really facing everyday, and I encourage everyone to read it, and more importantly the Bible."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The premise of this book was ridiculous, even if you're religious.

Demons began to fall out of the sky like meteors, spinning, smoking, dissolving.&#65533; This quote is typical of This Present Darkness. Frank Peretti writes this book to give it&#65533;s readers a better understanding of spiritual warfare. He incorporates complex characters and descriptive diction to make this book come alive.This book takes place in the typical small college town of Ashton. However, when a skeptical reporter and a prayerful pastor compare notes, they suddenly find themselves fighting a hideous New Age plot to subjugate the townspeople, and eventually the entire human race.Ashton is just another small town. It&#65533;s population nearly doubles when college is in session. Peretti does a very good job at describing this town and areas around it. This helps in understanding the plot.The usage of foreshadowing in this book heightens suspense and makes for a great climax. It keeps your attention throughout the book. A Bible verse on the back of the book contains the novel&#65533;s conflict: &#65533;For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world&#65533;&#65533; &#65533; Ephesians 6:12 (NLT). This narrative brilliantly reveals the truth of the spiritual realm through interesting, fast-paced action.The characters that Peretti uses in this book bring it to life. Powerful angels and evil demons fiercely battle over human souls. The main human protagonists, Hank Busche and Marshall Hogan, strongly pursue truth in their quest to save Ashton. And thinking that no one can stop him, the main human antagonist, Alexander Kaseph, tries to take over the town for his satanic mission. Kaseph is a formidable opponent to Busche and Hogan. Said about Kaseph: &#65533;This guy is a perfect cross between the ultimate guru and Adolph Hitler, and he makes Al Capone look like a boy scout.&#65533;The language Peretti uses adds to the intenseness of the story. &#65533;A low gurgling growl came from deep in his throat as his nostrils belched forth yellow vapor&#65533; gives a better description of the main supernatural antagonist.This book is good for anyone who likes a thrilling novel, or anyone who is interested in spiritual warfare. It ties in a Biblical view of the supernatural with a fast-paced narrative to compete with that of John Gresham and Stephen King."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Present Darkness has placed itself on the top of my list!

Frank Peretti chose to write about angels and demons and I root for him all the way. Now, every once and a while I'll think whether some angelic Captain is pointing his troops toward some nearby town or if I have a specific angel of my own. I know this book is one heck of a lot of speculation but that doesn't bother me one bit. I like to take a walk on the wild side and that is what Peretti allows me to do with this book. This book might be shorter than the second book, but this one is by far better in my mind. Peretti saves his best plot and best characters for this book. But I can't say that I didn't enjoy the second book!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books.

Frank Perettis detailed view on the spiritual assaults that occur everywhere in this book will make your bones shudder. Never has prayer been so effective nor so important in everyday matters, mentally and physically. If this movie would go into motion picture production using the book as a direct baseline, using several of the computer/technological advances for the heavenly and dark forces, the movie would be stunningly extravagant! I strongly encourage anyone, Christ followers or non-believers, to read this novel, if you think you can handle it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This outstanding novel is an excellent personification of spiritual warfare, slowly building suspense up to its explosive conclusion.As a former small town reporter myself, I can appreciate the details of the life the characters lead. They were very accurate.This book also vividly describes the nature of angels and demons, but take it with a grain of salt, as it is fiction.The conclusion is mind blowing, and this was one of the few books I've read where I was so excited I had trouble reading.Check it out!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Though I've grown out of my \\"dramatic battles of angels and demons\\" phase, I still think this is a good book for the young-adult set. Though Peretti's moral focus is not as strong as that of CS Lewis' timeless classic \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" Peretti does have an ethical framework that prevents his flashy storytelling from turning into dangerous sensationalism. For example, Pastor Hank (the book's protagonist) is a loving husband and father, the head of a functional family, whose sermons focus on topics such as marital fidelity rather than fire and brimstone. Evil is seen not only in witchcraft, but in child abuse and drug addiction. Pastor Hank's flock has no political agenda. They use prayer and church debate, not violence and partisanship, to bring about the final victory. If you're looking for some hard-core moral instruction, go with Lewis. Otherwise, this book is harmless fun for those whose spirituality includes some dramatic flare."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love Frank Peretti books. Super quick read and I ordered the next book for follow up. Piercing the Darkness."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This author takes one into the mindset of evil demons and their hidden activities. It takes some hubris to pretend to understand the powers of darkness but Peretti gives it a good go."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"FROM PAGE ONE, this was a captivating and engaging book. it is realistic, written as in &#34; real time &#34; and easy to follow. For fans of FRANK PERETTI, it is a DO - NOT - MISS!!! . I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN ONCE I STARTED!! this book will remain one of my all time faves and really makes you think, and believe, in angels and demons. the book revolves around the struggle to captivate a town by the demons and the war the the angels wage to free it forever from the Devil's grasp. NO matter what you beleive, Frank Perretti strikes a nerve in us all, and you will forever be changed by this simple story and the characters in it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While reading this book I recognized myself and everyone else in the church to the person. Even though this is Christian fiction, it hits to the nearest thing any words can define of who and what we as Christians are fighting against everyday. This is happening to some degree in every city, country and town in the world today, just as it was happening in those fictional towns and cities when this story was written. After reading this book I was desperate to find the sequal to it. Frank Peretti is the best Christian fiction/fact writer in todays annuals of literary genius. He can tie a story of fictional happenings into a story so close to the truth of the attack by the enemy that is going on in every church of today regardless of it's religous or Spiritual denomination. i am looking for his next book. I have also read The Monster, The Happening and The Oath. If you haven't read them yet. you need to. You will get a glimps into just how great a genius Frank Peretti is as a wirter in todays literary world."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I don't read much non-fiction, but I really enjoy Frank Peretti's writing style.

Someone suggested I might like Frank Peretti and so I picked it up when I came across it in the bookstore. I hadn't read anything like it before and what I liked was the way he showed the angels working as the human's prayed and needed help. It was like you were getting two adventures in one almost.The I think the book fairly reflects what's going on today as people of new age beliefs get into our education system and other places, Christian ideas are shut out while doors are open to everything else. Secular society is a mix of everything and people get to pick and choose. But in some places you don't get the choice of Christianity unless you're already Christian.I do like the way the Characters operated. Pastor Hank is a good pastor and has a helpful wife, clear lines of good versus evil are drawn and the angels were great and had distinctive personalities. Is it horror? I don't know. I would consider it occult/fantasy."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I first started reading this book I was about to dismiss it as being anti-religious. Continued reading proved it to be one of the most well written pieces of christian fiction I have ever read. The villain is truly an 'anti-christ' and has drawn a veil over the eyes of almost an entire town. It is a very compelling book that has to be read to be believed. I might add, it is well worth the read even if it is almost 700 pages in length. Perretti is an amazing author. I rate him at the top of my list with Terri Blackstock and Jamie Turner."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book opened my eyes to the reality of spiritual warfare and brought Jesus' warnings about such warfare into sharp focus. This is absolutely my favorite book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I began reading this book, I felt like I couldn't put it down because it was so interesting. I feel that this book is full of suspense and will probably keep the reader interested in what's going on in the lives of the people in the book. This book doesn't seem to be the type of book for the faint of heart, but for those who like a good book that's full of suspense."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I marvel and am in awe at how God opened up this man's imagination so that he might personify evil within a realm that we can understand. Reading this book allowed me to see demons, spiritual wickedness in high places, principalities, and rulers of the darkness with their personal names. Anger was called Anger, a spirit being! Confusion was called, &quot;Confusion! &quot; He took what has been written to us biblically in spiritual terms and translated it so that we could see into the heavenlies a depiction of how spiritual warfare may be taking place! If you are a Christian, this book can raise your awareness and can help you to recognize these unclean spirits and stand prepared in prayer to rage war. Let God be praised! Let His enemies be scattered!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"An awesome combination of a high-profile newspaperman and a humble pastor who unite to fight the forces of evil in a fast action-packed drama."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is simply amazing, Peretti is definatly the master of Christian Fiction. In this book he weaves together the Supernatural and the Natrual in a way that will make keep you up late into the night. With edge-of-your-seat action, and plotting that makes John Grisham look like a baby, this novel grips you from the very beginning. Yet it offers more than excitement, it is a book that will litarely change the way you look at the world Riveting, Suspensful, Fiction at it's best. Peretti is the man!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was an eye opener to me. I always knew and believed in the spirit realm, and that it effects our everyday life, but untill someone put this into a novel, I Could not relate the degree. Some of the things in this book arent 100% biblical, however the spirit of the book rings true. Christians need to start realizing why things are taking a turn for the worse and get on their knees and do something about it. It sure kicked me in the pants."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Present Darkness is a ok book in my oppinion. Though it was hard to follow, it had a well thought out plot and had intresting characters and a cool conflict. Overall this book is worth reading and I would suggest it to someone who likes a medium action and intresting, mysterious read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a great book if you believe that Buddhists, holistic healers and pretty much anyone other than fundamentalist Christians are in fact Satan and are trying to take over the world. I won't deny Peretti's ability to write and develop page turning suspense, but this is a book you might want to just skip over if you have an IQ of over 70. Books like this are pretty much the most acceptable form of hate speech. So keep that in mind if you find yourself intrigued by the interesting title are dark cover art."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The good news is that this is an entertaining, competently written mystery-thriller. The bad news is everything else. An underground group of \\"New Agers\\" is plotting to take over a small town, and eventually the world. As far as I'm aware, there is no New Age \\"conspiracy\\" trying this sort of thing, and if there were it wouldn't be coordinated by anthropomorphic demons from the Christian hell. And if its practitioners engaged in human sacrifice (unlikely), they wouldn't be in business for long. Well and good; read this as a fantasy if you like, but how many people will take this seriously because they bought it in a Christian bookstore?I don't believe there's a racist element in this novel, as some reviewers have said. The blackness of the demons is most likely part of the same tradition that includes B-movie westerns wherein the bad dudes wear the black hats. There are, however, other types of intolerance here: of nature religions, Eastern faiths, certain modes of meditation, etc. I'm no New Ager, but Peretti seems particularly antagonistic toward them. (In fairness, I should state that the author doesn't use the term \\"New Age\\"; it appears in the blurb on the cover of the paperback. It's clear, though, that the phrase suits his purposes here.) There's something disturbingly medieval in all this, exemplified not only by the angels and demons fighting it out in the air around us, but also by the idea that a specific brand of Christianity is the Only Way. It's difficult to tell whether Peretti believes in what he's writing, or if he simply knows a lucrative market when he sees it. He certainly knows a gullible one, and he appears for all the world to be exploiting the paranoia and fears of nave churchgoers. Not to mention - and this could be serious - implying that we aren't responsible for our bad actions; they're attributable to nothing more than demons working through us. Somebody somewhere just needs to be praying, that's all.One can imagine the response from the Christian community if someone decided to publish a novel taking something of an opposite approach, that is, presenting New Agers as minding their own business (usually the case) and Christians as intolerant bigots trying to run everyone else out of town (gee, ya think there might be some historical examples of that?): accusations of libel and persecution, no doubt. (BL, Tucker, GA)"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Skimming this book was the most I could endure (unfortunately a \\"zero-stars\\" rating was not one of the options), and I can think of no better way to express my sentiments than to quote Bruce Bawer, the author of the excellent, eye-opening, and thought-provoking book *Stealing Jesus: how fundamentalism betrays Christianity*:\\"It cannot be stressed too strongly...that [*This Present Darkness*] is intended not as a fantasy but as a picture of the way the world actually is. It's a world in which the immensely human Jesus who preached and lived a gospel of love is replaced entirely by a fantasy Jesus who stands at the head of an army of beings with names like Triskal and Krioni who seem to have been dropped in from some Norse myth.\\"\\"As far as one can tell, all the humans in this book are white, as is the most prominent angel, who is tall, blond, Nordic, and handsome; the demons, however, are invariably described as black and hideously ugly. (Peretti mentions their blackness repeatedly.)\\"\\"Summed up neatly [in this book] is the way legalistic Christians...feel about the changes they're living through. Their modest knowledge of history enables them to believe that the past was simple, virtuous, and changeless; their undereducation makes it easy for them to be confused and daunted by what they see happening around them.\\"Bawer also quotes the theologian Mark A. Noll on this point: \\"[This book] shows an evangelical community unwilling to sift the wheat from the chaff in the wisdom of the world, unprepared to countenance the complexity of mixed motives in human action, and uninterested in focusing seriously on the natural forces that influence human behavior.\\"Bawer continues: \\"Peretti makes it clear throughout who the enemies are: ...churches that preach the oneness of humanity and universities that fill your children's heads with ideas that challenge the things you've taught them.\\"\\"Peretti does a very fine job of exploiting his audience's resentments, fears, and prejudices - their sense of intimidation by higher education, their desire for a \\"tougher\\" God with black-and-white answers, and their wish to believe that evil is *out there* and that they are the saints of God.\\"One scene in particular \\"is very effectively designed to reflect legalistic notions of family and church relationships out of control. In the legalistic view, the husband should be the unquestioned leader of his home, and the pastor the unquestioned leader of his flock.\\"The wife of the town's fundamentalist pastor is \\"in good legalistic fashion, consistently meek and supportive of her husband...\\"In a nutshell: \\"The plot of *This Present Darkness* is the stuff of paranoiac fantasy.\\""},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I actually found this to be a nice entertaining book. However, in the years following my first reading of it, I have been surprised how many Christians don't seem to realize that it's fantasy, not reality.It's a cool story, on the level with Star Wars, but it's far from a \\"Christian\\" book. There is no Biblical basis for much of anything in the book--no reason to believe that demons cause our emotions, or that demons specialize in certain emotions (eg, demons of fear, depression, etc), or that our prayers give angels strength, or much of anything else in the realm that Peretti has created.So while Peretti writes some pretty good sci-fi, I give only one star because his books seem to have the effect (whether intentional or not) of turning people away from real scriptural study and making them think they have experienced a revolutionary spiritual experience by reading a fictional book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm a Wiccan, yet I generally don't have a problem with reading Peretti's work. I basically take it in stride like when I'm reading Charles Williams or C.S. Lewis. To be honest, I found this book quite entertaining, and quite thrilling. Unfortunantly, Peretti's ideaology (not theology) is rampant with bigotry and paranoia, with a hatred for individuals like me that seems to burn like that of Hitler towards the jews.However, I still found the book entertaining.Oh, and for all of you Christian reviewers, I read this book, and I STILL practice Wicca. Literature isn't THAT effective, folks."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Peretti writes well. He is a good fiction author. However, his theology is far from Biblical. Show me from the Bible evidence for:* Spirits responsible for particular sins. Our own sinful natures are bad enough, we do not need blame it on powerful spirits resisted only by prayer. Where is human accountability?* Angels powering up on our prayers. What a way to minimise the role of prayer as we talk with God!* God's lack of sovereignty over issues. Turns out that all the bad problems in the world were because the saints neglected to pray hard enough.* Becoming a Christian as an end to ridding yourself of demons, as opposed to ridding yourself from the penalty of sin.On top of that, I really disliked his heavy handed approach to condemning the New Age movement. I agree that it's wrong, unbiblical and sinful. But as a fully organised movement seeking to control the world? Please! It was just as heavy handed as Peretti's Monster was against science. I found it incredibly unrealistic and an unfair portrayal of New Age mysticism. What about all the other beliefs opposing Christianity? Why is this the scapegoat?Despite Peretti's engaging writing, these frequently occurring errors and the heavy handed approach made it very hard to appreciate the story line and writing style."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book welcomes one to the future: where New Age religious thought takes over the Evangelical American Church. It is a prophetic tome (as opposed to a tomb) and it forewarns of the binding of astral planes. It realizes that extra-terrestrial beings are not an unrealistic eschatological expectation for those who understand the development of universal consciousness. It uses biting dake-bonoistic sarcasm and cultural epithets to expose the synthesis of genetic development and racial awareness. The era of Maytreya began on 11 August 1999. This was a time (due to behind the scenes work at NASA) when the possibility of planetary colonization took great steps toward popular acceptance. The fusion hasn't occurred completely as of yet but the steps are being taken. Technology is being embraced more and more. With Ted K's demise the enemies of progress have taken a fatal blow. 'Welcome to the future' is the thought that has come to some people's mind. Finis Dake & Bono both exhibit a close proximity throughout the fantastical plot. It's a future where one doesn't have to worry about silly political correctness. Perhaps some people don't get this. The satire is deadly serious in the text. Don't believe the hype.

While this book certainly is not a theology text, nor is it meant to be, it is entertaining and engaging.

Ditto for his next book, Piercing the Darkness, but not for Peretti's following books. I read Prophet twice, so I did like it, but not enough for a third read. And the other Peretti books I didn't like at all. However, the first two books I cannot praise highly enough because they are what inspired me to write my first--and so far only--novel, Shadows, which I published as an ebook on Amazon (search on Jarpey if you are interested) because it was too long for traditional publishers to take a chance on. I mentioned Peretti in my preface. I am very grateful to him.Friends of mine who loved the first two Peretti books loved what I loved in them: the behind-the-scenes action of what was going on in the spiritual realm, showing how angelic and demonic forces influenced the characters' thoughts. Of course, this wouldn't have been interesting if the characters weren't real and interesting, but they were. The plotting was great, the action moved smoothly along, and there were no slow spots at all. Marvelous entertainment that inspired me, and my friends, to PRAY MORE. That's a book with a good influence! Bravo, Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My fault.

Read This Present Darkness first time in 1991 when it was given to me my an aunt. Ever since, I have read every book he's written since that time, (except the children's books, although I do have 2 of them). I've read \\"This Present Darkness\\" 6 times over the past 20 years. My aunt asked for her the book back, so I had to buy my own copy here at Amazon. I got the 1986 printing my aunt let me borrow! I have purchased Peretti's latest title \\"Illusion\\" on Kindle and hardcover and currently reading it.This Present Darkness is about the spiritual warfare that is raging in the spirit realm. The object of this warfare is control over a small town, whose inhabitants are oblivious to what is happening around them and unaware that their prayers and spiritual belief is what will determine the outcome. In their reality, they see the principles of Christianity as being old school, with the pastor of a small church not being in touch with the changing times. The politicians have an agenda to rid the church and the town of this kind of thinking and teaching. To the rescue, comes the newspaper man, who has issues and doubts about his own spirituality and whether or not God even exists for him. As far has he's concerned, he's chasing a story, not trying to be a part of it. As he comes to terms with his spirituality, he becomes a threat to the demons in the spirit realm that are at war with the angels of God. The demons don't play fair and they show that by attacking the family of the newspaper man, and anyone that is a threat to them. Thank God for the old spinster that is a strong prayer warrior for God. If the people of the town would just start praying and strengthening themselves in the spirit, they subsequently will strengthen the angels in their battle with the demons of Satan, and save the town before it's too late. The strongman is on the way, and he has orders to take the town. Will he succeed at winning this small town for his master, Satan? Will the newspaper man be able to get to the bottom of what's really going before it's too late?"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is that it is used, and just a little beat up.

Incredible this was Peretti's first published adult novel.This set the standard for spiritual thrillers involving the thin layer that exists between the natural and the supernatural worlds. The latter being where angels and demons battle for our souls.Interesting how the New Age movement was behind the novel's protagonist and here we are now 20+ years later and universalism and \\"anything goes as far as God is concerned\\" are rampant.The novel starts slow as we meet the key characters, both natural and supernatural, but bounds along at great pace in the last third as the conflict escalates.Great how Peretti demonstrates the power of prayer and how it stimulates activity in the supernatural.

It is full of action, and it is very fast paced. Peretti writes in a way that I can picture being there (sort of like 3-D). He brings to light what so few people talk about- demons. Demons are here and they are attached to people, and the way he writes it makes perfect sense. Not only does he talk about demons, but he also talks about angels and the power of prayer. Praying matters and it does make a huge difference in people's lives. Shedding light on the need to pray was very prevalent in this book, and it makes you think and analyze your own prayer life. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read this book in the late 1980's.

He also knows how to make a point. I feel that spiritual warfare is overlooked by many Christians. The reader must remember that this is one man's impression of what might be going on.

It is unbelievably gripping, and once you start it the pages keep turning. Although it is fiction, many of the messages and principles are very real.

This was one of the first novels I read, and I really enjoyed it.This book chronicles the small college town of Ashton, and its struggling pastor Hank Busche, and local journalist Marshall Hogan. Unseen by them is the whole cool part of the story: Tal, Captain of Hosts of the Armies of God is leading a defense of the town from an attempted take-over by head demon Rafar, and his cohorts.The plot is more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.Many people disagree with the theology of this book: humans having direct impact on the angel-demon wars by rebuking the demons by name...names, by the way, such as Lust, Fear, and Hate. It does bring the spiritual warfare side a little closer, and make you want to prayer more, but not too many people believe in this kind of conflict. But the Bible does tell us that our struggle is against the powers of darkness in the heavenly realms.It's a great action-read, and is also full of spiritual insight and teaching."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've read a lot of Frank Peretti's books.

It kept my attention the whole time. I felt like I was watching a movie.

It is an awesome reminder that we have victory through Christ's Blood and becasue of that we can overcome the evil in this world. The books plot is not super strong, but it's the vivid reminders of spiritual warfare that makes this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book presents spiritual warfare in a digestible format. If you are struggling to understand spiritual warfare then this is a must read. If you lack prayer power and can't find the fervency to pray, this book will give you a reason to pray 24/7.

Peretti is a book I never wanted to put down. Everytime night I would read as much as I could before I had to go to bed. It has really helped me in my relationship with God. After reading this book, it is like my eyes spiritually were opened. You will never think of Angles and Demons in the same way.In the small town of Ashton everything seems to be going wrong, at least for the ones that know that something is going horriblely wrong. There are only two churches in Ashton, Ashton Community Church whoes head pastor is Henry L. Busche, and Ashton United Christian Church whoes head pastor was Oliver Young. Pastor Busche was quite new to Ashton the former pastor was run out of town, and it seemed that that was about to happen to Busche to. For he was being accused of kicking a man out of the church for commiting adulatry. Half the church was upset enought to get ride of Busche but the other half and one extra, which allowed him to stay, were either not bothered by it or not bothered enough. While that is going on Marshall Hogan, head man of the Ashton Clarion (a local newspaper) was discovering some pretty deep and dark secrets. The deeper he goes the more and more curious he gets. Everything seems to be connecting to Professor Langstrat, who teaches at the local College. She has private meetings with people, and the strange thing is they are mainly people in high power. Pastor Young is one of them. Some of the Christians have noticed that his sermons are not right and fufilling to what they need, so they go over to Pastor Busche's church. They can tell that the pressence of the Lord is there. Although Pastor Busche and Mr. Hogan find themselfs in some pretty deep trouble they keep pushing on and never giving up hope that God will perval.During the book you will be in constent wonder of what is about to happen and once the book it over you will be satisfide and in a more realization of the spirtual world that is upon us, always here and will never leave we just need to open our eyes and see the truth.I would recomend this book to anyone, but especially if you are struggling in your walk with God."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I would like to commend Peretti for his outstanding accomplishments in this book. Every page kept me on the edge of my seat. His characters were unpredictable, and, unlike many authors, he did not spend much time describing every detail of their appearance. The plot was faultless and interesting. I also believe he did a fantastic job with the demons and angels. The best part of the story, I believe, was the last page where Tal, a commanding angel, waits to hear the most frequently used phrase in the book: \\"Let's pray...\\"."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel will change how you think about God, demons, and angels.

There are some things about the book that seem a bit dated now, but at the time I'm sure Frank Peretti was breaking new ground in a lot of ways.This book was written at a time when the big enemy to the church seemed to be the occult, and it exercising influence in American daily life, and surreptitiously leading Christians astray; hence the main themes of the book.What this book did, that was unique in its time, was give a full-on view of the spiritual warfare that happens all around us as we fight the \\"good fight\\".I found the human characters engaging with a lot of depth. They seemed, for the most part, totally unaware of the battles raging all around them.It was very easy to root for the angelic characters, and I enjoyed seeing how Mr. Peretti described their militaristic tactics to win battles.The demonic characters were a despicable bunch, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever; as one would expect. But, they also had tactics of their own, and somehow expected victory against God's host.This book reminded me of how temporal and fleeting this life of the flesh really is. We must empower the ministering spirits that have been put in charge over us by praying and speaking words of authority in Christ.I would encourage anyone, Christian or not, to read this book.If you are looking for excellent Christian Fiction for young people, please try Vicki Silver Mysteries: \\"The Stolen Gem\\" and \\"Cruise Control\\" by Alissa Wood.Vicki Silver: The Stolen GemVicki Silver Mysteries: Cruise Control"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the very last page.

The story is written in excellent form.

Sometimes we need to be reminded that there is more than what we see with our eyes. Its well written and once you start reading you won't be able to put it down! Just don't substitute this for the sound teachings of the Bible. Some have taken it to extremes."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"With this book, Peretti has shown himself to be one of the very few authors able to write a satisfying Christian thriller. Breaking into the fascinating realm of the supernatural, Peretti gives us a breathless view of the daily war waged between angels and demons.Where this novel fails is in its stereotypical view of angels and demons. While most Christians believe demons are fallen angels who have teamed up with Satan, Peretti makes the angels seem almost human while the demons seem more like dark, dirty renditions of the slimy green ghost in the hotel in &quot;GhostBusters&quot;. And the demons seem woefully inferior to the angels.Still, those moments are few, and Peretti's deft writing (which does get a little bogged down in the middle) keeps the action moving and doesn't allow such low-points to have much affect on the flow of the story. Highly recommended if for no other reason than as a prelude for the second book which is even better."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book really makes you ask yourself what is going on around you that you cannot see. It presents spiritual warfare as being so real that you almost think that you should be able to see the hideous bat-like creatures known as demons or the majestic, handsome angels. It is so vivid that you almost think that you should be smelling the thick stench of sulfur or even seeing a cloud of sufurous smoke. In my opinion, this book presents probably the most realistic sounding representation of spiritual warfare you could get. It is impossible to know for sure, but this book makes a very reasonable guess at the unknown.This book, as well as its sequel, \\"Piercing the Darkness\\", are extremely well written. They are intriguing and quickly pull you into the plot. They move along at a fast pace, but you can easily keep up with what is happening. Again, they are very realistic, so you don't find yourself scoffing at how ridiculous it sounds.This book is great as a stand-alone book, but it is made even better by its follow-up book, \\"Piercing the Darkness\\". I was not aware they they went together, and ended up reading them out of order, but even then they wee both great. Even so, they probably would have been a little better if I had have read \\"This Present Darkness\\" first.Overall, I highly recommend this book, as well as \\"Piercing the Darkness\\". They are both definite \\"page-turners\\" and well worth reading.These are the only two Peretti books with this style of describing spiritual warfare, but Peretti's other books are good also. For more good Peretti reading, I also recommend \\"The Oath\\" and \\"The Visitation\\". Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Present Darkness is a Christian thriller. The story is about the town of Ashton, which is being taken over by a strange New Age cult. Pastor Hank Busche and newspaper reporter Marshall Hogan are trying to figure out the mystery, which grows in horror with every new discovery. Waiting in the wings are angels and demons, praying and working for their side to win the souls of Ashton and much more.This book scared the crap out of me. Some moments in the book made me whimper and scream out loud. Peretti is a terrific writer. I just hung on every page."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Of the Christian novels I have read, this is easily the best. The followup, &quot;Piercing the Darkness,&quot; is a disappointing sequel, and the famous &quot;Left Behind&quot; series left me cold before I had finished the first installment, being sadly predictable and written in such a superficial style that it seemed to have been solely aimed at a junior high school reading level. Peretti's style, however, is more advanced and draws in the more experienced readers among us as well as those younger.We humans are bound by our five physical senses. Beyond that, we have little idea what may be happening among the principalities and powers of the air. Scripture gives us a few glimpses, and long religious tradition has fleshed out some ideas, of what is going on between the powers of darkness and the powers of light. In this novel Peretti does a credible and intriguing job of putting names and personalities to the various characters and forces involved in the spiritual warfare around us and within us, and the story ultimately is unforgettable.My only quibbles with this excellent work are that the answers to these issues are a little too pat, the solutions to the problems a bit too neat. I am fully willing to admit that this may be my own lack of spiritual perception regarding the invisible realm, but it just smacks sometimes of being a bit too easy and convenient, as if the book too often allows its built-in deus ex machina to intrude on the action. Still, the book is well worth four stars and worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I realize it's fiction. But I think Peretti, through his writing, is giving us a great deal of insight into the spirit world. His angels. His demons. His humans!It's important to me that there's more to gain here than just a good read. If entertainment is all there is to it, there are thousands of well writen secular novels already. But Peretti's novel is edifying and affirming to me as a Christian, a Christian that believes there's more out there than just the sweet by-and-by.The Bible itself shows us that angels are among us. And Peretti shows us how and what they're doing."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Present Darkness by Frank E. Peretti is about a small town called Ashton being taken over by unseen evil powers. Marshall Hogan, a main character runs the newspaper, The Clarion. He and his reporter, Bernice Krueger get themselves in a bigger mess than they anticipated. Along the way Hogan finds himself losing his daughter, Sandy and his wife, Kate. Bernice also takes her beatings, working late nights and weekends. Both of them trying to figure out what is going on in their town. Hank Busche is the local pastor and also is on their side trying to save people from evil spirits.On the other side working for Rafar, the evil Prince of Babylon, is Professor Langstrat, she teaches at the local college. Langstrat places control over young minds to do her will. Also, the local police chief along with many other big names in town are working for her. Half the town is battling against this evil presence while the other half is working with it making this a thriller.I thought it began slowly, and picked up the pace toward the end when the spiritual warfare began. The plot of good versus evil had great twists that I did not expect. The book was interesting and not as predictable as I thought it would be. It certainly opened up my eyes to the spiritual realm around me."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm very picky when it comes to what I like to read. I love spiritual warfare. Angels and humans vs. demons. This definitely fit the bill."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I know that it is 2012 and I am reviewing a book that was written in 1986 but this is a Christian \\"classic\\" that is worth mentioning to a new generation of people. I read this book years ago but and then decided recently to pick it up again and reread it. Since my memory is not great it was pretty much as if I was reading it for the first time. And boy was impressed! (Or re-impressed?)Summary:This Present Darkness by Frank Peretti is about the physical and spiritual conflict taking place in the little town of Ashton. In a physical sense, at least on the surface, it is a fairly normal town that has its normal problems. But then some weird things start to happen. A suicide, people leaving, weird new people coming, and so on. A pastor, newspaper editor, and newspaper reporter all get involved in trying to solve the mystery of what is going on. In the spiritual realm, the demons have a big plan to take over the town through a new-age cult and the angels must figure out a way to protect the Christians while also battling the demons from taking over the town.Impression of Book:My initial impression of this book is that it is well written book that explores an often unmentioned aspect of the Christian life: spiritual warfare. As other reviews of this book have mentioned, there are parts of the story that are speculation of how spiritual matters work so I would warn people against developing a theology of angels and demons based on this book. However, this is a fiction book and therefore should be considered just that... fiction. The main point of this book is to get people to pray, which is very Biblical.As for the story itself, I found it to be very engaging and entertaining. It was funny to read about a world pre-cell phone, mp3 player, computer, and email. But the \\"age\\" of the book did not distract from the story any more than a book set in the 19th century might. It was overall an excellent book. Peretti has a tendency to start slow and build to the action once the characters are more developed so the beginning is a little slow. But it quickly picks up and is well worth the read.What This Book Taught Me:The biggest thing that This Present Darkness taught me was the importance of prayer in the Christian life. I don't think prayer works quite like how the book makes it, but the overall importance (and often neglect of prayer) for Christians should not be missed. When I finished this book I found myself praying more and praying more earnestly.Conclusion:If you are a Christian I highly recommend this book. As I mentioned, the theology may not be 100% since some of the topics Peretti writes about is speculation, but that should not prevent a person from reading it. The main point of the book - to prayer - is illustrated through a powerful story and will no doubt challenge any reader. 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read this book multiple times. I love it. I cant wait to read the next one. As far as Im concerned it has been the best book i have read in my life. i love the way that Peretti describes th battle betweem angels and demons. it may not be an accurate account of actual spiritual warfare but i found that it was very creative. as one o those people who pray often i would like o think that my prayers are as benficial in spiritual warfare as they are to the angels in this book.As far as people being ridded o their demons and immidiately accepting o god i have seen this with my very eyes. thy are thankful and have hd their eyes opened to god. its nice to actually read something good now tht people are becoming unimaginitive and creating stories that just mimic others."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. The loss of sleep was very well worth it. A very griping story that keeps you wanting to find out more. I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"At the outset, I'll tell you that I've become a Peretti fan. I've read The Visitation, The Oath, as well as the sequal to this book - Piercing The Darkness. In this book, as well as it's sequel, Peretti takes the reader in-and-out of both the seen and unseen worlds. I especially enjoy the way he weaves the real, but suttle, agendas of God-hating Leftists and &quot;I'm a god too!&quot; New Agers into his story.The reason I gave a rating of 4-stars instead of 5 is the fact that I found myself wanting to skip-over much of the unseen world content so that I could continue the story of the seen world. I realize that this defeats the purpose of Peretti's intent in having the reader experience both sides, however, I did find it aggrevating at times that so much space was given to the gropings and carryings-on of imps and demons. I would rather have only known that the demons were there behind the scenes, without all the intricate details. Another reader may see this differently, however.All in all though, this book is indeed worthy of your reading time."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Peretti's storytelling skills carry the day for this book, and it's a good thing because his writing skills are average. His characters are too predictable - what some people call &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;two dimensional&quot; - while the jargon and cliches that permeate the conversations grow old quickly. Overall, this was a fairly good novel, but not one that encourages a second reading."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Because this is one of Frank Peretti's first books the story is good, but very simple. I'd read this book years ago, but as i re-read (listened to audio) I realized that it is good but basic. Characters are not developed well, and must seemed to me they were in the story just to move it along. However, the book is entertaining and a good one to read when you have a block of time to become immersed in a book that you read just to be reading and relaxing.The strength of this story is that, while I am not sure whether is is strictly Biblical, we are reminded that we do not live in a world where all that is real can be seen. Peretti allows us to use our imagination while we get an idea of the spiritual battles that are taking place on behalf of the believer."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Peretti uses fiction to illustrate spiritual realities. He does so effectively in establishing his plot, characters, and setting. In the margin in one place in the book I wrote, &quot;What is taught has consequences.&quot; Truth liberates. This book shows how a lack of knowledge on spiritual matters can have adverse consequences.Prayer's power is demonstrated through the story line. He addresses the fallacy of what Hindus call &quot;karma,&quot; that a person can earn brownie points as opposed to the reality of accepting the Jesus and what He did.This book shows two worlds operating simultaneously. The physical world everyone sees is governed by the invisible spiritual world. Prayer taps into that unseen dimension for direct results in the material realm. By reading this book you see the interaction take place."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"With it already being said: this book is a great door to realizing the spiritual battles that take place in our every day lives. I was disgusted to see the one bad review of this book. That person obviously has no grasp on the bible at all. If you believe that Wiccans and New Agers are not evil, well think again. That just goes to show you how fooled you really are. You're blinded by deceit so terribly that you can't even recognize the faults in your own beliefs. I am still in the process of reading this book and I must say that as much as it seems to be like fantasy, that fantasy is truly a reality. Take it or leave it this book shows us what's really going on in our lives every single day. If you have read this book and don't like it, I dare you to attempt at critizing this book with any truth of your own. How blind you are if you do not believe in the message this book is portraying. Read your bible!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The town of Ashton is where the main character, Hank Busch lives. The book is about the townspeople as well as Hank encountering all sorts of conflicts and struggles of life and dealing with them.

Read the book - you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"THIS PRESENT DARKNESS is the story of something sinister in the town of Ashton, and two men who are concerned enough to find out more about it. This book is an account of what happens on two levels, the physical and the spiritual, the battles that take place in both realms, and the dependence each realm has on the other.Frank Peretti weaves an intricate web of characters, intrigue, and tension in this spiritual thriller. I was reminded of John Grisham's THE FIRM in terms of the numerous characters, the sheer number of problems and situations that arise, the insidious nature of the enemies, and the severe tension in this book. This book was packed with action, nevertheless information necessary to solve the ever-widening puzzle was doled out very slowly and only as necessary; there were many twists and turns of plot, and the spiritual aspect of the book was downright intriguing.Through all, Peretti manages to convey to the reader the vast importance of the spiritual realm beyond the scope of the book. Entertaining, yes. Eye-opening, even more so."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After reading the book and reading the other reviews, I found it quit commical that people take reading so seriously. Yes, it was trilling, Yes, it isn't writing on the same plane as Charles Dickens, and Yes, it falls short of conforming to exact biblical specifications that everyone thinks it should have. So what. The book was obviuosly written to entertain not to alter the state of the universe. So just relax,enjoy, and you'll make it through......and maybe even learn something."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There are very few books I read every year but this, Piercing the Darkness and Prophet by Peretti are some of them especially when I feel my prayer life is waning.

As I read I realized how thin the sheet between this world and the spiritual world truly is. I'd always had faith in God but until this book never realized how protected we are, how powerful prayer is and how essential it is for the survival of all angels which protect us. I'd always felt alone in my struggles even though I always prayed. Now I know I was never alone. That we all have angels to watch over us. That they will never leave or forsake us any more than the Lord himslef would ever do. Peretti teaches us all that awareness and knowledge are power. Power to fight and overcome any obstacle through faith and prayer. Since reading this book my friend has gone home to Heaven. He changed my life by sharing the &quot;power of prayer&quot; with me. I hope that you too will give this writer the opportunity to show you how wonderful and amazing God and his angelic companions are. &quot;Thank you Mr. Peretti and Thank you my angels!!!&quot;"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really liked this book alot.

I knew of Peretti and wanted to get a good fiction to read so I purchased this. It's an older book (no cell phone and typewriters vs computers if you could imagine ;) but a good book is a good book and it was as many reviewers have referred to a page turner. As other s have commented it's not a theology book, it is fiction but there are some realistic aspects to it.

Christians know the value of prayer but this book will only enhance that in your mind. Great reading....."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There is no doubt that this book contains a degree of excitement, especially if one reads it as primarily a book about the &quot;spiritual warfare&quot; of angels and demons, of praying Christians and the forces of evil in the guise of New Agers. But (and this is a big BUT) the book is largely negative and paranoid to the MAX. One has to first buy into the questionable idea that there is such a thing as a &quot;New Age&quot; consipracy to take over a town, a college, a corporation....the WORLD! (Yeah, right.) Then one has to buy into the idea that folks interested in this deviant form of spirituality are not only misguided and mislead but thoroughly evil as well. (Has anyone out there met any &quot;evil&quot; practitioners of Buddhist meditation?) In addition, the good characters are all too good, lacking real-life human frailties. The bad guys are all too bad, evil and rotten to the core despite their New Age spirituality. In short, this novel may capture one's attention because of its action, may merit praise in its emphasis on the merits of Christian prayer, BUT it is FATALLY FLAWED because of its incessant and UNREALISTIC PARANOIA. This is fiction, but not of a noteworthy or enduring sort. It is more akin to writing intended to undergird a predetermined ideological portrait of the world rather than a serious work that explores perennial questions of human existence. It is the fundamentalist Christian version of pulp fiction. And thank the God of the universe that there are serious Christian alternatives to fundamentalist pulp fiction."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"from the minute i picked this book up i didnt put it down, be prepared to spend the day in this novel -"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is amazing. I have owned for 13 years and have read it over and over. I read it when the world feels overwhelming."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel is quite entertaining, although it presents such a good versus evil plotline that the characters are clearly on one side or the other. It seems as if the novel represents something Stephen King might write if he were a fundamentalist Christian, which might explain why I kept comparing it to THE STAND as I read it. While I quite enjoyed reading this book (it was difficult to put it down!), I think that \\"Satan\\" and \\"demons\\" would more likely influence humanity as portrayed in CS Lewis' THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS. That is to say, that the free will of humans would be more emphasized and that demons would tempt people more than possess them. I also found myself recalling Christ's words to \\"lover thy enemies\\" and wondering how this fit in with the angels slashing demons to shreds with swords. If the angels cannot love their enemies, how can we mere mortals hope to? While these criticisms may give the impression I don't like the story, I do. I just have some reservations, that's all."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Never has a book opened my eyes to the realities of the spiritual realm around us!

When someone rights a novel they know that the beginning and the middle also will be difficult to get through because it will not exactly be 100% entertaining. When I started to read this book my dad told me about how much he wouldn give to be able to read this book for the first time again. I was reading through it and the story was interesting and compelling. The transition between angel and human and demon is so captivating that I could not put it down.

There is nothing like a book about spiritual warfare to snap you to attention! When i read this book , it made me realize how real evil is. It's incredible to me how one man's perspective can change another. My soul stirred when i read this, it gave me a wake up call on whose side i was working for. The characters in these books have so much to lose and even more they've lost, and yet, by the strenght of God they keep pushing. It's not only a testament to the power or prayer, but to the strength of endurance. I will say though, when i went to bed after reading that, i slept with my light on."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"An interesting concept, of which until Peretti has never been written of, to my knowledge. Many a Christian has wondered of the spiritual activity that takes place daily in heaven and earth, and whether this is a true interpretation of the events taking place in the spirit world or not, it does present itself to be very entertaining reading. Peretti's first novel, if I'm not mistaken, and by my judgement, his finest. I have read this book several times, and after each time I walk away with something I never received from it before, while still maintaining a degree of freshness, so as not to become a stale story. More than anything, I must confess that this novel makes the reader think - and I understand that that is a tired cliche at best, but I must strongly contest that it is in fact the case here. Prepare to be stimulated."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Peretti relies heavily on standard &quot;thriller&quot; techniques not to be confused with theology. I am especially botherd by his portrayal of mainline Christians as the tool of the devil. I don't think this is healthy at all for the church or the gospel. The only thing I find more disturbing than Peretti's theology is the evangelical church's response to it. Some say it is a &quot;revelation from God.&quot; It must be a new revelation because I don't see Peretti's world portrayed in the bible.I am also dumbfounded that people consider this the best book ever written. For me, it's not even close to Dickens, Hemmingway, Bronte, Fitzgerald and other writers of that caliber.Peretti has reminded us of the power of story. A well told story can be more powerful than centuries of systematic theology and biblical studies."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book helped me realize that demons are names subject to the name of Jesus! It has helped me understand just who I am in Christ and the benefits of being born again. Anyone who contradicts or do not beleive that Mr. Peretti is not a child God must not be. And for those who feel that the Third Person of the Godhead was omitted from this book really could not understand the bible. There is no way Mr. Peretti could have written this book without the help of the Holy Spirit leading and guide and showing him things he needed to know in order to give such vivid insight into the spirit realm. I was never really a book reader but now I am since there are Christian books like this one. This book was so informative that my Pastor is thinking of making it mandatory to the congregation to read it before becoming a member at our church.

Great book - you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As Christians we all fight spiritual battles, this book has really opened my eyes to spiritual warfare.

Put your faith in Jesus Christ first and then trust him."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book certainly has an interesting perspective on spiritual warfare. It takes the words of the Bible and makes them extremely literal, in my take. The characters in the book are average, nothing super memorable about the characters. The strongest characters were Hank and Marshal, other than these characters, the others were a little underdeveloped and one dimensional. They came off somewhat weak as well, as the angels and demons had so much control over everything that happened. I believe the angels and demons had to much control. Every wrong thing that happened was because of the Demons and every good thing was from the angels. I believe this sort of perspective of spiritual warfare takes away from the problem of human sin. Hank mentioned at one pointed in the book that a certain character had to become saved not because of their sins, but because this was the only way of stopping the evil caused by the Demons. Meaning if you don't want bad things to happen to you or have a demon take total control over you, you had become saved. Not because of your own personal sin. Though the book did redeem its self near the end in sharing the whole Gospel truth. Also the use of Jesus name I felt was abused. The book sometimes seem to make Jesus just into a magic word that only cast demons away. Jesus name is more, I wanted to know more about the person of Jesus Christ, who was, and who he is. Not simple a word you shout to cast of evil spirits. I also believe the Holy Spirit should had more control over the believers life, I don't believe angels have that much direct control over someones life. There are several other things as well which I will not mention here. But overall the book is good at showing the power of praying and the importance of being in spiritual community, the importance of the Church."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Im 15 and love to read. I thought this book was a great read. It makes me think angels are really with me. It even gave me goosebumps. I like how he made there be personal demons attached to people. It made everything much more personal and intresting. Loved this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read this book, as well as many of Peretti's other books (Piercing the Darkness, Prophet, The Oath). Of them all, this one is the grand-daddy that &quot;started it all.&quot; (I will eventually review the others also.)The thrust of the book is Spiritual Warfare, including both &quot;the big picture,&quot; and how it affects individual people, and the power of prayer. The reader can see and listen to the people, demons, and angels, while the people in the story cannot see the spiritual battle going on around them, though it influences them and vice versa. In a nutshell, it brings home Eph. 6:12 (&quot;We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but... against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;)I would definitely NOT treat it as a textbook for spiritual warface, as this IS a fiction book, so some liberties are taken. But it is a good reminder that we don't see everything going on around us, and we need to be on our toes--after we've been down on our knees.I would also not recommend the book to young readers as some parts may be scary, or the concept too overwhelming. But junior highers and up would be fine, though I'd be sure to talk with them before, during, and after they've read the book about &quot;the reality&quot; of spiritual warfare, and that it's not just a fictional concept.As a side note, the second book, &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; dwells much more on the spiritual side. So much so that the angels and demons take on more of the &quot;main character&quot; roles than in this first one."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank Peretti had to just state that this book was fiction but the potentials of this being real life are just an eyesight away. It's like he saw into the Spirit realm and just came back to tell about it. I have told so many people about this book and they have been so blessed by it. Of course, they had to buy their own or I bought it for them. My book doesn't leave my sight. :-) Please make a movie out of it. I'll be the first ticket buyer. Thanks Mr. Peretti for the blessed opportunity to read this.

Wow! I heard somewhere that these books are being made into a motion picture...Is this true? If the proper special effects are used, then this could be a very good tool to win souls for the kingdom!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read. It does not get too preachy, which can turn off some readers, but it also reminds believers about the power of prayer. The book as a whole is amazing, with its tale of the ever-present battle of good vs. evil. It is the last 20 pages or so that really caught my breath. These last few pages are extremely powerful. I read this book for the first time a few years ago, and I can vividly recall reading the ending a thousand times, each time being captivated by Peretti's great story-telling techniques. A simply fabulous book. I recommend anyone and everyone to read this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Well, I absolutely loved this book, and its sequel, \\"Piercing the Darkness.\\" What can I say? If you want an accurate drawing of just what the driving force behind the New Age movement and all of its different practices are, this is the book for you. Peretti shows the link between this world and the other, illustrating just what goes on all around us, usually without our even realizing it! I would have to say that Peretti always spins a great tale with an excellent world view. \\"This Present Darkness\\" only proves my point. I couldn't put this book down until the end, and you won't want to either!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After a friend lent me this book, I stayed up til 4 AM finishing it while on spring break. After my parents reprimanded me, I gave my Mom the book and she stayed up til 5 AM trying to finish it. It really is an action-packed thriller. I found the story interesting, and thought the portrayal of spiritual warfare was a great theme.Unfortunately, on several points it seemed a bit too simplistic. I tend to shy away from &quot;evil conspiracy&quot; plots, and this definately had that, though it used the excuse of a demonic backing. I still don't buy it. Demons could conceivably be trying to mastermind world control, but I can't see them using a human organization to do it.While I wouldn't want to detract from the power of prayer, I don't think angels are fairies that get stronger if you clap your hands. I think it more likely that God sends the angels as the response to prayer. The doling out of energy by &quot;prayer cover&quot; seemed purely ficticious.I found the actual battles a let down. I know the good guys have to win, but they win almost way too easily. People casting out demons left and right...what happened to the ones who wouldn't come out in the name of Jesus that the disciples ran into? And these are supposed to be big bad demons? It almost made the bad guys look impotent, which I doubt was the point of the story. [Yes, I know good triumphs over evil. But, that doesn't mean evil capitulates instantly.]Probably the touchiest part was the portrayal of the evil characters. Of course the demons are evil; they are ugly and stink. But, the people are another matter. Basically, anyone who started getting involved in fortune telling, meditation, hypnosis, or lighting candles and wearing black got &quot;hooked&quot; by evil demons. (stereotypical involvement in the occult.) The personal responsibility was downplayed. These ills could be instantly cured through prayer and casting out demons. Now, I believe prayer can accomplish these things, but seldom as instantaneaously as is routine throughout the story. I found the portrayal a bit simplistic. Evil people have much more depth to them than is revealed in this book. I mean, people can be pretty corrupt w/o the help of demons, too. And, in spite of the meddling of demons, I think few real people are actually as corrupt as some of the characters that surface here. The characterization becomes black and white, like a fairy tale [with the exception of the reporters - they have strengths and weaknesses]. I would hate to classify this book as a fairy tale, because I think the author didn't mean it that way. I think, however, that he set his sights too high when it comes to such an involved theme as good, evil and spiritual warfare. This story is only the beginning. So much more could be written exploring in greater depth ideas that here are just part of a story.The story was great, captivating, and anything you could wish a story to be. My criticisms are merely instances when I felt that the story was a less-than-accurate, over-simplified version of the truth. I encourage others to read this book and judge for themselves. It would be worth your while."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The awesome thing about this book is that it captures Christianity at it's core, aside from Peretti's brilliant style of writing.Just by the opening paragraphs, you can tell he is a well educated writer.One of the most facinating things about this book, is that no matter how long ago it was written, it can never go out of style. It captures Christ's commission in a nut shell, being, to destroy the works of the devil, and set the captives free.Portrays true Christianity, to a world so anti-christian, yet open to the &quot;Un-Christian&quot; &quot;Non-religious&quot; teachings such as satansim, new age, witchcraft and etc., where Christianity is viewed as religion, when in actuality has nothing to do with religion but on the contrary is true relationship with Jesus Christ.In essence, this book might be a shocker to those who to their great misfortune and error have reduced Christianity to a mere &quot;old-tradition&quot; or religion, because it shows the power of God in action, and shows how christians can literally &quot;Kick some Devil Butt&quot;."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an amazing book. Sure you could point to some flaws here and there, but I still unequivocally recommend it. Frank Peretti's books have sold extremely well, and after reading some of them myself I can see why. This is still, in my opinion, the best one I've read by him so far (I haven't gotten to a few of his new ones yet - I am going to do so as soon as I can, especially considering how good his previous ones were!).There are a few minor theological problems, but there are quite a few good points to the theology too. Sure, one could argue that he focuses too much on the demonic or sometimes gives them too much power, but one could just as easily argue the exact opposite for a lot of other books in Christianity. He does emphasize quite a few things that do need to be be emphasized, like the power and need for prayer and spiritual discernment, the reality of the demonic, spiritual warfare, etc.Although you could point out some technical flaws in the writing, this book is still a real \\"page-turner.\\" I should warn you, don't start this at night, or you will be up really late, because it is that hard to put down! I have re-read it at least once or twice and it was still good.I can't recommend this classic book enough. If you haven't read it, I strongly recommend that you do so."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Wow. That pretty much describes this tense thriller by my favorite author, Frank Peretti. It actually surprised me that this book was written in 1986 - it's not dated at all, and the things that the characters deal with are still very current. This book isn't for sissys - it's at times downright scary (especially for Christians like me who believe that it's all real.) This book is a page-turner - I couldn't put it down. Its fantastic and frighteningly realistic at the same time. I absolutely loved it, both as an enjoyable read and a frightening way of looking at posession, exorcism, and sin."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Present Darkness takes place in the small town of Ashton, where trouble from the occult is brewing. Marshal, a newspaper editor is having questions about faith, his daughter, and her teacher. Hank, a young pastor, is on the verge of being fired and being replaced by a secular person. The demons of Ashton are stirring. Tal, the leader of the angels during the fall of Babylon, has come to the angelic forces of Ashton. The prayer cover has nearly vanished, and the anels are losing power. Hank has had trouble with demon-possessed people, and Marshal was physically assaulted by a demon. ... A truly spiritual book, full of mystery, adventure, and amazing truths."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Absolutely the most awesome book I have ever read!!! Just read it for yourself."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I found this book hard to put down. The concept of spritual warfare is a difficult one for most of us, and this work provides a unique perspective, a story about 'real-life' in middle-America, and how Satan works to destroy all things good. I found it a real encouragement to my prayer life. A must read!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Hi,I've only read the first 20 reviews or so so I don't know if this angle has been presented yet, but here it is.Obviously, this is a wonderful decpiction of Spiritual Warfare! As a matter of fact I like this book better than the Left Behind books I'm still slogging through. (exactly how many are there?)The other angle I'd like to present is of gangstalking. The methods used by the demonic forces and their human adherents to run people out of town, destroy reputations and eventually kill people who aren't on board with them are very typical of gangstalking or multistalking.This form of harassment goes on at all levels of our society to dispose of people certain groups do not want around...pay special attention as to how the people who worship the demons use the leaders of the town to accomplish their objectives! Cops, judges, banks, and local businesses are brought on board and bought and sold to be of use to the sinister cabal. This is happening in real life, folks!The intimidation and terrorization tactics used by the human side of this group are very very typical of what a targetted individual of gangstalking goes through. The stalkers attack the targets career, then they attack their reputation, then they turn their friends on them, then the family, and finally they will destroy the target if nothing else works.I believe the real life counterparts to the terrorists of Ashton are satanists as well who are using this form of stalking as a means to an end to destroy the remnant of faithful people here on this Earth since the hour is late and the Antichrist is coming back.I do not know if Mr. Peretti knew about this sinister stalking when he wrote the book but his familiarity with their methods is beyond what any coincedence could muster. I have yet to read the sequel but I hope it continues to expose the tactics of the harassers.It is heartening to see the number of young readers as well! If they can see how gangs of greedy people come together to destroy anyone in their way maybe they will not be so unsympathetic and frightened when presented with it in real life. Maybe we will finally find some allies in the gangstalking community that aren't targets themselves!There is another book that is coming out just now about gangstalking. It's \\"1996\\" by Gloria Naylor. This woman had a spat with a bigoted neighbor who had govt contacts and she is still targetted to this day 9 years later! It is available from her publisher.This Present Darkeness is the real stuff! The only problem I have is with the rather childish depiction of the demonic forces...I think that the dark forces are our \\"worthy opponents\\" and some of these demons seem cartoonish in nature. The best part of the book is the simultaneous effects in the heavenlies to the prayers of the saints and the sinners. It was a great encouragement to see that a little prayer can effect much more than we'll ever know. God Bless."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank Peretti's work is a good example of what we Christians accuse the New Age movement of being. It is a book that is mostly derived from experience and not Scripture. Most of the spiritual warfare themes are those that were developed by well meaning Christians who had had experiences, and do not necessarily reflect the teachings of the Bible. Frank has gone out of his way to defend himself by saying that he meant the stories to be symbolic, but one cannot help but wonder if this was true when Frank wrote the story. The whole idea that angels actually gain some sort of empowerment from our prayers is pure theological hogwash. The idea that we need to pray and pray and pray and pray and pray or the angels will lose their power and the devil will get us is spiritually unhealthy at best, and almost downright demonic itself at its worst. Satan would love for Christians to become fixated on the devil and occultism, believe that they need to pray every second or the devil will get em, and see a demon under every rock. It is the classic strategy that says &quot;If you can't get them to go off the path on one side, push them until they go off the path on the other&quot;. This is not the best Christian book ever written. It might be good if you are practicing the occult, and need to have a fire lit under your tush, but basically it is an unbalanced pseudo-christian story that is full of culturally acceptable christendom, but perhaps not much true Christianity."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book was incredible. It really puts things in perspective. So often we lose sight of the little things in life that can lead us astray. This book helps to remind us all of how we should act and how others should preceive us as Christians. Thank you for selling this book and at a reasonable price. I borrowed this book from my boyfriends mother and had to buy a copy for myself to share with others. I hope many more people will find this book as inspiring as I did."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"i swear, when i read the whole Left Behind series, i thought that was good. but then i read this, & it totally blows my mind away! i love angels, & the way that they are described in this book is so awesome. i mean, when they draw their swords, it makes music. & when they fly it makes streaks of bright white light. & they're tall & handsome. & they wear white tunics with golden sandals. i just have a very beautiful picture in my head. i can only imagine what they are like in person, expecially what God & Jesus look like. i will probly break down & cry because they are just so beautiful! but, newayz, lol, this book is awesome. you should read it. it gets off to a slow start at first, but then you REALLY get into it. it's a must read!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After I read this book, I met several people who were very enthusiastic about it. They absolutely loved it! All exclaimed that this was a fabulous portrayal of spiritual warfare and the power of prayer. It was a great insight into the unseen conflict between the agents of God (angels and &quot;prayer warriors&quot;) and between Satan and his minions. Having read the book, I could certainly agree that it portrayed spiritual warfare and the struggle between the angelic and the demonic. However, when I asked these readers about the overarching theme of the New Age Conspiracy which defines the book, they were at a loss. These readers loved the action, the positive portrayal of the power of prayer and the triumph of the good; however, they missed the supposed great evil that motivated the wicked characters portrayed in the book. They missed the fact that all of this was written as a warning cry against something that has come to be known as the New Age movement. I see that many reviewers of this book in other places have also lost sight of this fact. Peretti's book is without doubt an action-filled account of the battle between spirtual good and evil. However, what is the nature of the evil portrayed? The evil lies in a deviant spirituality that uses meditation, that uses the guise of psychological methods, that is influenced by Eastern religious ideas and practices, etc. This is the evil. Really? The angels of God have come to this small town to fight against the insidious influence of some akin to Yoga, deep breathing exercises conducted to the chanting of Hindu mantras, and Tai Chi? This dubious battle gives the book an overwhelming feeling of unreality. The bad guys in this book--- the city officials, the &quot;liberal&quot; minister, the Psychology professor--- are unrealistically evil. One may claim that the meditative practices that flow from Hinduism and Buddhism and theologically in error and should not be followed by Christians. But to portray them as evil, as demonic? Do many people really believe such things? Or are pettiness, intolerance, and ignorance of the wider world suddenly now positive traits for Christians? One larger point to the success of this book is how little fundamentalist and conservative evangelical Protestant Americans know and want to know about the larger Christian world."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is not only one of the best Christian books ever, it is one of the best novels, Christian or secular that I ever read. It gives insight into the power of prayer and spiritual warfare. Peretti has carefully crafted this message into his story-line and colorful cast of characters. I found this novel as well as it's sequel \\"Piercing the Darkness\\" so captivating that I tore through each one in a matter of hours! This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who likes suspenseful novels. Although this novel is complete by itself, I highly recommend it together with the sequel."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think that Mr. Peretti has hit the nail on the head with all his books. that we are truely in spiritual battle at all times . Things are not allways what they seem with the natural eye. I would recomend this book to everyone to read or lisen to like I do.. LeiLani"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have wanted an unabridged version of This Present Darkness on cassette for years and I finally got one. However, I tried to listen to it on vacation and I found I could only listen for maybe an hour at a time and then I would have to take a break to keep from getting sleepy. For a long drive the radio dramas for The Left Behind Series or any of the Focus On the Family Radio dramas would have served the higher purpose of keeping me from highway hypnosis. For shorter trips these tapes would have been fine and after the narrator settles in, he did some great voices. Peretti threw in some great lines that made me laugh both when I have read the book and when I listened to the tapes."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Christian Fiction was not a major niche prior to 1987, when Peretti released this novel. Because of this novel, that has changed. This book opened the eyes of many to the potential of Christian fiction, with non-fiction authors like Chuck Colson, Dave Hunt, Bob Larson, Paul Meyer, the late Larry Burkett, and the very successful Tim LaHaye entering the fray.The premise of the book is to show the spiritual warfare that influences what happens on earth. The main characters are Pastor Bush and newsman Marshall Hogan. It follows their battles in keeping a new age group from taking over the town.People have said Peretti is a cross between Steven King and C. S. Lewis. He does a good job of making his points on the importance and role of prayer, as well as what goes on behind the scenes. He also entertains while doing it. Some may debate his theology, but his skill as a storyteller is undebatable."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've met a whole lot of people who've read this book, including people who were upset by it. It might be a good thing if this book creeps you out. Peretti provides an AMAZING look at the spiritual warfare that goes on all around us, every day. It's only by pretending this warfare doesn't exist that we get chumped out by the enemy. Reading this book is like drawing back a curtain; afterward, you probably won't see the random, mundane events of your own life in the same way again. Peretti's storytelling is captivating and rich -- as well as true to life. I've bought other books of his since reading this one, and I look forward into digging into the sequel."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"GREAT BOOK WOULD RECOMEND ANYONE TO READ IT.

A local pastor and a newly arrived, and troubled, newspaper editor slowly become aware of some evil forces working to take over a small college town.

For example, I often wondered what was meant by the angel speaking of the Prince of Persia resisting him for 21 days in the book of Daniel 10:13.

The producers attempted to compensate for this bush league performance by augmenting it via silly vocal effects. A better choice might have been to spend the money they paid for the music and vocal effects to get a really good professional voice actor instead. Due to their poor production choices this audio book sounds like the audio version of a comic book were it done as a high school drama department project. Reader, just so you get the picture, it was SO bad that I started heckling at about the mid-point of the second CD and didn't stop until the audio book was (mercifully) over. This is a pity given the weight and importance of the material being presented. These CDs will definitely NOT get a second listen!Deficiencies aside, if you don't have the time to sit and read the written version, the audio will serve as a (barely) passable substitute. However it doesn't truly capture how good the original printed work is!In closing, please don't let this honest review of the compromised audio book discourage you from avoiding this important material. \\"This Present Darkness\\" is a watershed work of fiction that sensitized this reviewer and his church to the spiritual war that ever surrounds us and the role that the Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve play in it. Whether it is listened to or read this is material that every Christian would do well to experience at least once and think about often."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I don't give five stars very often, but this book deserves it! Without a doubt, it's the best Christian fiction I've ever read. The plot is clever and the characters are well-developed. The writing style is excellent. Peretti's unique style sparkles, but never gets in the way of the story.Not everyone will agree with Peretti's interpretation of spiritual warfare (it IS fiction, after all), but his portrayal of the behind-the-scenes battle between angels and demons and their interaction with humans comes across as very believable. Whether you totally agree with Peretti's speculations or not, I believe the Lord has really used him to focus attention on the Bible's often-neglected teaching about spiritual warfare -- sometimes we Christians forget we're in a battle!An epic adventure that entertains as well as edifies and encourages (a little alliteration, there), This Present Darkness is a must read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank Peretti has a great grasp on what demons really are, and if you get nothing else from this book, you will GET the fact that demons are all around us, every day, in everything we do. Their subtle and complicated manipulations are handled deftly by Peretti as he intertwines a townful of characters to a nice and neat conclusion. You probably won't see your everyday situations in the same way, and the real value of the book is if it helps you make the right choices in those everyday situations."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved the story and the way it was told.

As a Christian I wondered if there was something out there I could feel comfortable reading, when I came across this novel in my church library.It deals with the struggle between good and evil. I saw where someone lessened this struggle by insisting what was portrayed as evil simply is not, but as a Christian familiar with God's Word I assure you it is forbidden in the Bible and is in fact evil. The story may take a bit to get into, but once you do it is action packed, full of suspense! I simply did not want the story to end! This story also is carried on in Piercing The Darkness, which I highly recommend! I actually enjoyed the second novel the most.Anyway, if you are looking for Christianity's answer to Stephen King, look no more! Good writing, good story, all from the view of a Christian writer. And I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was told about this book by a friend who insisted that it was a &quot;must read&quot; as she felt the story line mirrored much of my own life in unbelievable ways. As I read the book, I was able to relate personally to most of the story line. For an individual who often questions the &quot;whys&quot; of the world, the spiritual warfare depicted in this book helps one to realize that the battles in life are not of flesh and blood but rather of the darkness present that looms around us. While some of the battles between the evil spirits were at time a little slow moving, it did not take away from the story in any way, it just made me want to read faster to get to the next suspenseful scene. Another great book by Frank Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was wonderful. I haven't read much Christian fiction at all...actually, the only Christian fiction that I have read is the Left Behind series. I always assumed that it would be cheesy...among other things.

Although the story is fictitious, it brings home the starkreality of what believers face and encounter in everyday life.The scene is set in an American town called Ashton. Seemingly insignificant to most people, but to the strongman and his demons, there were great plans for this town.Yes, this is a book about Spiritual Warfare, angels and demons and good triumphing over evil.Enter the good guys:Hank Busche, a 26 year old Pastor of the Ashton Community Church.Marshall Hogan, editor of the local newspaper, the Ashton Clario; and last but not least, Tal, Captain of the angelic warriors, planning to thwart the assignment of the strongman and his demons.This book brings mome the importance of prayer cover, the reality of a common enemy and his schemes and deceptions, and the need of &quot;having done all to stand&quot;.By the same token, the vivid imagery and fight scenes described may be a little &quot;over the top&quot;.On the whole it is good reading and once you start, you'll find it difficult to put down."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank Peretti's THIS PRESENT DARKNESS transcends the normal realm of 'good verses evil' by blasting headlong into the Angelic Conflict. The reader is taken on a spiritual journey that is a virtual tug of war between Angelic warriors and demonic forces with a tiny American hamlet and its' citizens as the rope.Though Peretti does take some liberties with dispensational reality, the book flows nicely and story will keep you flipping pages long past your bedtime. Peretti displays his literary power in enticing the reader to press on with alacrity to see what happens next, only to be propelled further still into the abyss. There exists as well, much to be said for Peretti's ability to introduce seemingly mundane and miniscule segments of information only to have them later on, blast back into the story with enormity.Peretti did seem to have some slight lapses in research. Some things just weren't too logical, such as covertly searching real estate company records to determine property ownership when the logical source would have been the County Deed Records that are available to the public without the need for undercover work. However, such discrepancies do little to detract from the overall story.This is considered a classic novel of Christian fiction for good reason. This one is worth reading on many levels. The story is far from ordinary, flows nicely and entices the reader on to the very end."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book last year in 8th grade. Okay, I didn't just read it. I practically devoured it. I'm reading it again in 9th grade in my spare time because it is just that good. It has always been hard for me to get into a story, get interested in the beginning, but Peretti did an amazing job of capturing my attention from the very first page.My mother read this book in the 80's [in her Bible college days] and bought the 3 book set for me in 2003. I couldn't get enough. This Present Darkness is fantastic in every aspect; the characters are believable and well developed, the plot is planned perfectly, the setting fits the characters and the whole scenario wonderfully.Great book for young adults, Christian or not."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Ok, I admit that this is the first book by Frank Peretti that I have read.

From all the reviews I have read about this book, I knew it would be a great read. I was right. This book defines true Christian Story telling.

I loved the book, with its descriptions of spiritual warfare and the power of a prayerful believer. Anyone who is searching for the Truth of Jesus Christ or interested in His Power would be interested in seeing how this book portrays spiritual warfare. Anyone interested in Christian fiction novels would enjoy This Present Darkness.Peretti's story shows the power of prayer. Whatever you go through in life, you should go through it with prayer. Prayer keeps us connected with God, our Creator, who knows us best. I'll be stepping up my prayer life after reading this novel.This Present Darkness was a nominal novel. The story was always kept understandable. I loved the book and am glad I read it. Frank Peretti's This Present Darkness showed me the power of a praying believer. Go ahead, splurge, read This Present Darkness."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I wish I had read this book when I became a Born-Again Christian.

The book is a must have, it helps to understand the need for prayer in our Christian walk with God and to claim the Victory we have in JESUS when he died on the cross."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book, Peretti's first adult effort, constitutes a pioneering effort of Christian literature. Here Peretti delves into spiritual matters, both Christian fundamentalism and Eastern mysticism. He reaches down into our inner-most fears and touches us on a deep, almost primal level. He exposes those \\"things that go bump in the night\\". Peretti reveals a world within our world, one filled with powerful, malevolant creatures bent on world domination and the pure, righteous beings that oppose them. Both sides use humans and the human spirits as catalysts to achieve their ends. This book is about the most basic struggle between good and evil, as presented in the Bible: demons vs angels. It presents how fundamental Judeo-Christian morals and ethics help defend against spiritual darkness. And it expands upon the Bible to give a possible scenario on how these spiritual battles may be fought.Much of what Peretti has written about in this book is his own interpretation of how fundamental Christian Biblical teachings fit into this spiritual war. No matter what your faith, this book should get you thinking about how the world works. Are angels real? Are demons real? Can or does this kind of struggle exist right under our \\"work-a-day\\", oblivious noses? Peretti takes us on a journey to show us the spiritual battle that may be taking place everyday in America, with the fate of our very souls in the balance of the outcome. This book literally began the fantasy Christian genre, where everyday life is presented as a battle for dominion between good and evil spirits. Many books by various authors followed this one, with the \\"Left Behind\\" series being the most popular to date. I think fantasy and fiction fans alike will enjoy this book, especially if they keep an open mind about the possibility of this being truly how life is out there. Christian peoples of all denominations should enjoy and be encouraged by this book. The only drawback to it is the poor character development; often characters appear to be almost wooden or cardboard cut outs, often either really good, really bad, or really clueless, with little of the true complexity of mankind in place. But this problem is soon corrected in Peretti's subsequent offerings, such as the sequel, Piercing the Darkness. I highly recommend these books to any and all takers."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In 1986 when this book was first published, I was just graduating high school.

There are realms of life in co-existence with the 3-dimensional lives we know, and those realms have far greater impact on and importance to our 3 dimensions than most people realize. For a further, more authoritative explanation, 2 Kings 6 provides an excellent example of what I think Peretti is trying to illuminate. It's a sobering wake-up call to know that evil is real and has every human being on earth as its voracious agenda. It's a comforting concept and reality to know that God dispatches far more help than we ever ask for or imagine to empower us to be victorious over evil in all its forms with all its voices and masks."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"This Present Darkness\\" gives a vital \\"where the rubber meets the road\\" grip of the reality of spiritual warfare and the incredible power of prayer. A \\"must read\\" for pre-teens and teens getting slammed with the pressures to compromise moral standards and pressures to embrace the New Age philosophies. Not only does it expose the deceit of evil, but lays out an example of how it can be combated through prayer - yes, even at age 12! I first read this book about 20 years ago, and it seems more relevant today (after re-reading it with my son), than it did the first time I read it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is definitely one of my favorite books. It goes in depth to the spiritual battles that are always taking place around. If you don't think prayer has much of an impact, think again! God has given authority through Him to fight the principalities and darkness of this world! This book will open your eyes to reality of evil in the world and the POWER OF PRAYER! I would recommend this book to anyone. A page-turner you simply cannot put down!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Couldn't put it down. Frank has such a way with words that you can actually see the spiritual warfare happening around you. Thanks"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Present Darkness is an incredible book! The plot is gripping and thought provoking! The book is about the spiritual warfare that occurred in a small town when demons sought control of the town by influencing and inhabiting humans. The town's only chance of surviving was through the help of 2 newspaper employees, the prayers of a young pastor's small congregation, and the mighty warrior angels.I liked how Mr. Peretti illustrated the extreme good that can come from prayer. In the book, prayer strengthened many of the angels. I was also intrigued by the significant role that demons and angels play in this world. It had never occurred to me that demons have so much power and influence over the thoughts and actions of humans. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a deep and intriguing book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book has been pulling readers through it's pages for over 2 decades. It hasn't lost any of that pull. THe battle rages between good and evil - angels and demons. The outcome hanges by a thread. Wonderfully written with intimate character development. A wonderul spin on fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Unlike the Left Behind series, which were dragged on book after book... both of Peretti's darkness series grabbed my interest. This Christian author went beyond the usual 'Christian writing guidelines' and actually grabbed my attention with a real story. Both stories and characters were believable and likable. He took a biblical subject, and shaped it into something we can understand. Although many would rate these books as cartoon-ish, I actually like the idea of spiritual forces fighting on my behalf. It also helps to look beyond the mean person to something greater, with it's talons dug upon his/her head. :)"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I didn't like the sound effects. It took away from the the story. I've read This Present Darkness and Loved It...but not the audiobook."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Some have described Peretti's writing as a cross between C.S. Lewis and Stephen King. Maybe so, but he's not nearly as good a writer as either of them. I can't recommend wasting time with this as the fiction was poor quality. Instead, read Lewis's \\"Screwtape Letters\\"The Screwtape Letters: How a Senior Devil Instructs a Junior Devil in the Art of Temptationfor a much better-written story detailing below-the-surface spiritual warfare."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Before reading this book,I had no idea of what really happens in the spiritual world. I really woke up after this! Now, I'm the leader of youth at my church, and 9 friends of mine have read the book! I really would like to congratulate Mr Peretti! I've read all his books, already!God certanly blessed him writing these books and I wish He continuos blessing!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book will really open your eyes to the warfare that goes on daily in the spiritual world.

The first chapter or two is a little slow, but after that get ready for your socks to get blown off! Peretti gives vivid details of how real live angels and demons use their spiritual forces against each other. This book will definitely bring you closer to God and will make you more aware of the battles of spiritual warfare. A great book for missionaries and ministry students!!! Get it now!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book really makes you think. It not only shows how dramatic and how real spiritual warfare is, it strongly shows the importance of prayer. I don't know for sure if that's really how it works with demons and angels, but I don't have any better ideas. I am a Christian and I encourage other Christians to read it as well because it has really changed my view of prayer for the better. Plus it's also just a really entertaining and thilling book. Read it!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"ATTENTION PRAYER WARRIORS: This book is a must if you want to get a &quot;view&quot; of what you are praying for and about and approach the Throne of God with a new BOLDNESS. This book was not written to contain Theology, it was written to encourage the Spirit Led Christain to get a glimpse of what we are fighting against, the &quot;Rulers of this World&quot;...Hence, the Title. After reading this novel, my eyes were &quot;OPENED&quot; and helped me understand spiritual warfare and allowed me to live a life of TOTAL VICTORY."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In this book, Frank really makes clear the need for and rewards of prayer. This Present Darkness was so good, I NEVER wanted to put it down!!!It get's really deep into spiritual warfare and how God uses all evil for good some way or another! This reporter moves from New York and buys a small paper. He starts learning and hearing about some strange stuff, and he just gets more and more involved and gets several threats and warnings to stay out and leave it alone. The plot unfolds and he gets deeper and deeper until he can't get out. As the plot unfolds, everyone realizes that their town is under extremely heavy Satanic attack! Marshal Hogan, the reporter, and Hank Busche, a pastor of a small church, get suited up for the biggest flesh and spiritual battle of their lives! I VERY HIGHLY recommend this book to any and EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was really great. The battle between good and evil and the power of prayer were really brought out. It pointed out the evil subtlety of Satan and his demons. I encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is classic Christian reading, though it might appeal to secular audiences as well because of the fast-paced movie-like action. The Bible doesn't say much about the warfare between angels and demons, but Mr. Peretti takes what there is and turns it into an incredible reading experience. This Present Darkness is the Lord of the Rings for Christian fiction."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank Peretti keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat with his twist and turns of events.

It is not a religion but a systemthat is at work and this book will come alive as youcome in contact with it and with the reality of thespiritual condition of our nation.

Reading it again twenty years later as an adult, I find I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did when I read it for the first time at age twelve. What I believed as a teenager and what I experienced as an adult, gave me two different perspectives about this book. Both times I've enjoyed it for various reasons: the action, suspense, battle scenes, three dimensional characters, detailed writing, an imaginative plot, and the underlying message of the power of prayer which I firmly believe in. Reading it for the second time, now as an open-minded Christian adult with a different way of thinking than when I was a teenager with preconceived ideas about the world, I find the author's views and opinions a little narrow-minded and prejudiced. As a reader I'm all for detailed world-building so as to really be able to engross myself in a book, but in This Present Darkness I often found the lengthy descriptions tedious and mind-numbing. I read this book in fits and starts and had to constantly put it down to read something else before picking it up again to continue where I had left off. Overall the idea behind the story is an inspirational and feel-good one and I really enjoyed the fictional part of the story. However, a lot of readers (including myself) might find the author's viewpoint outdated, stifling and biased, but as far as fiction and fantasy goes I genuinely think this was a worthwhile read. I don't think I'll be reading Piercing the Darkness, but I'd definitely like to read more of the author's other works."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I ran into this book many years ago and being a very Holy GHost, spiritual person it would seem to me to be the type of book that a Christian person like me; you would turn tale and run.

This book lets you feel like you are into this world, because it is a fiction trying to break the news of the things that will truly be happening."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a great story about good and evil and gives the reader the understanding of how these two forces are very real and things are happening that you don't see in this world.

I wanted to buy the unabridged version, but instead, clicked on the wrong one. My fault entirely.The story is riveting and is even better with the voice changes and background music. I have always been a Peretti fan. I wish I had the unabridged version, but this one is awesome too.

This book made me sleep better at night."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"An excellent book through and through. I had never read a Christian Science Fiction before. I was so pleasantly suprised at the depth and intuitiveness of this book. He keeps you glued to each page and you honestly can't put it down. God has blessed Peretti with such a gift. It talks about Spiritual Warefare on our everyday lives. I believe that this is how it truely happens. I have read everything that Peretti has written to date and if you read this book you will be hooked as well. I can't say enough about his talent. All I know is that most books I get bored with. Not with any of his. You must try it!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Now I want to here it on tape in full. I loved the book and am looking forward to its dramatic reading."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book. The intrigue (obviously) is in having a window into the spirit realm. However, I had a problem with the angels having &quot;races&quot;. Correct me if I'm wrong, but angels are spirits, right? Spirits don't have any ethnicity, do they? I couldn't help but feel drawn into thoughts of stereotypes that one shouldn't have to entertain when reading a Christian novel. Aside from that, I really enjoyed this book. Worth the price."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am in the study of Revalations and what is going on in the book seems like what will take place in the battle of Armeggedon.

I have to thank Mr. Peretti for being a vessel of the holy spirit, as I read this book I could fell the hairs in my neck standing for I have also felt the attacks of daemons on my soul, I also cheered for the heavenly host. Taken this for what it really is; a fiction work full of wonderuos entretianment.

His works draw you in and really focus on prayer. Although many might think this novel focusses on angels fighting demons, the underlying principle is prayer. When reading this book look deeper than the fighting."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"First let me tell you that I would not even give this book a one star but it is required so I gave the lowest rating allowed. Each person is out looking for what will lead them to a better life. While looking over the book I found a message of hate and lack of tolerance. This book is a book written from the heart of one who seems to have the very termoil in his heart and wants to have the rest of the world pulled in. New Age religion is not so new, being as they clump Druids and Wiccans and the like into one group. When we go on the defensive then we teach hate which is not a value I wish to instill in my children. Each to their own and share what you like, listen if you will. But this is more of a fire and brimstone kind of approach and nothing I want anything to do with!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book shows a complete and utter ignorance of the spiritual realm. Worse still, it targets another religon, and makes it out to be evil, and the cause of all the said towns problems. Religious intolerance is the ONLY evil in this book! And I am so grateful to God that the spirit realm is none of the tripe, that this book purports. Nothing is more harmful than ignorance, except for the fear it creates. Surely the burning of innocent people at the stake, in the dark ages, by the church, should have taught us all, that religious ignorance, superstition and fear of the spiritual, only causes pain, suffering, religious wars and death! And then tell me where the real evil lies."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoied the Christian Theme of this book but it was a waste of my time. I did not appreciate the length of this book. The author spent most of his time adding MORE Characters rather than leading to the climax. I do not feel that this book streinghtened my beliefs. I am afraid that i now will judge this author's book negatively just beacuse this book was so poorly written."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all!

It's still quite entertaining. Obviously right-wing Chritians (as exemplified in the book) are a soft-target, but it's still relatively entertaining. I guess people get rabid about the Christian stuff, but if extremists want to be the muppets who buy anything by another 'christian' then let them waste their money - just get it out of the library (anyone know what a library is???) and have a giggle."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Ashton could be any town, anywhere, but this is where angels and demons battle for the destiny of men.

It is the first book that I have read that dealt with spiritual warfare. I looked for references to this warfare in the Bible and found that there is a solid Biblical base for this story. Mr. Peretti takes the reality of spiritual warfare and comes up with a gripping story from it. It in an entertaining book and one that I always find hard to put down, even after all the times that I have reread it. Mr. Peretti is a very gifted writer. He makes the story so real that it is hard to NOT come up with the images from his work. I love this book immensely and have no problem recommending it to anyone. Even if they are not Christian or if they do not think that spiritual warfare is real. This one is a keeper for anyone's library."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Hypes Christianity with an overly-metaphorical 'spiritual' war that can only be resolved through intense prayer. Characters were stereotypical (the good priest; the 'ignores his family' working man; the 'young, good-looking' female reporter; etc.), and women earned their existence by being attractive, good wives, or witches. Treated all non-Christian religions (e.g., Muslim faith; anything new-age; etc.) as demonic. Writing was cliche-ish with overly dramatic swirls. I was hoping for a religious allegory or critique a la C.S. Lewis or James Morrow, but Peretti falls short."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have to hand it to Frank Peretti, he is a good storyteller, and the person reading this book will not be bored. Unfortunately, it is terrible theology, and the author is so paranoid and bitter toward New Agers and mainline Protestants, that this book deserves a place in hate literature alongside the &quot;Turner Diaries.&quot; I am afraid that some unstable person will read Peretti's books and firebomb a New Age bookstore. New Agers may be irrational and on the wrong path, but I cannot believe they are as &quot;demon possessed&quot; as Peretti thinks they are. It really scares me that so many reviewers here said they believe everything they read by Peretti."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is to literature what McDonald's is to haute cuisine; it goes a long way in showing how fundamentalists are blazing new paths in the 'dumbing-down' phenomena so prevalent in our culture. Was it written for 6th graders? Its cream-puff triteness and juvenile character development makes one wonder how it could have come from the same planet once graced by Sophocles and Dostoevsky. Even its theology is questionable. For Peretti, human evil seems not to be something inherent in human nature but rather a residual product of some cosmic spiritual struggle looming invisibly over everyone's heads. It amazes me how fundamentalists are so ignorant of the theological and cosmological implications of the biblical narratives they so militantly claim to be taken literally (e.g., the fall of man into sin.)"},{"Title":"Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology Single Volume (Book with CD-ROM)","review":"Although the Devita text is a good resource, it has important drawbacks. In every edition, including the latest one, too much information has been out of date even at the first day of publication. Several other major oncology texts somehow manage to avoid this problem much better. Also, since the text comes out every two years, information in the current edition is already at least 3 years old or older. Beyond this, the index is detailed but it still is hard to find specific information, i.e., the book is clumsily organized. Finally, the CD version has the worst search program that I have ever used. You can enter information with any degree of specificity and the search will retrieve (at best) a list of chapters and major chapter sections in which to look. You then have to read through miles of text to find the information that you wanted. Searchability is one of the main reasons for buying a CD and I consider the Devita CD virtually worthless."},{"Title":"Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology Single Volume (Book with CD-ROM)","review":"Devita is recognized as the established text-book on medical oncology.Its strengths are 1. the excellent introduction to the science of oncology 2. the comprehensive reviews of each tumour type (inevitably dated as is almost every text-book) 3. a sufficient coverage of all modalities of treatment to allow the medical oncologist to appreciate the contribution of surgery, and radiation therapy 4. a number of useful discussions of common clinical scenarios.Its weakness is twofold: 1. if you are looking for a clear recommendation or approach to a problem you will often be better served elsewhere 2. the writing is hard going with a strong tendency to turgid US academic prose.So who should read it? Any medical oncology fellow should read this or one of the similar books cover to cover. For consultants it is a useful starting point to review a condition not often seen, or provide a background to the field.

Thank you."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Wow, I have been empowered with this book and also challenged for the better! I loved Marianne's concepts. I am a changed woman and I owe it all to Marianne Williamson. It has awoken me to the woman within me and has bought me out of my shell more. I love the way she is in touch with God inside of herself and how she shares her personal experience with the reader. I congratulate her on an inspiring book and have passed my copy onto my Son's girlfriend who is absolutely enjoying it. This is definitely a book I will be keeping to re read and keep on reminding myself of my self worth, I believe every man should read this book and be inspired themselves. Thank you Marianne Williamson and keep up the good work you are truly a God's Gift to us all!"},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"This book is excellent. It helped me see that my value is not in what the world, or what our male-dominated society, thinks is important. If we are all thinking like men, what kind of society is that? Maybe one where all differences are settled by war? There is a balance that should be attained, for the world to operate in harmony. This also allows you to be the best you.It is well put in one quote from the book, \\"Until we know our own power, we will constantly seek it in others, particularly in men, and power sought that way never saves us; it destroys us.\\" This book teaches us to know our own power. It will help you find your light, your peace, your power, your smile."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I'm not typically a reader, but this book was recommended to me. I actually read the whole thing which is unusual for me. I would rte it as just ok. It is a boring read. It is kinda a self help book. To help women understand themselves better. Overall I just found it OK. Others may think it is great."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"This book reminds you of your greatness as a woman. Reminding you that it is okay to do well and be the best you can be and the goddess you were born to be! This is a spiritual journey into our self-realization as woman. A book not just for women but also for men who wish to acknowledge their feminine powers of intuition, passion, healing, nurturing. The author's insight is insightful and encircling and she has an extraordinary was to actualize the women's roles in family, society, relationship and just the being. This is a book nobody should miss and one you purchase two for. To keep one and to pass the other to a friend."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I highly recommend this book for any woman who is graduating college, getting married, having children, dealing with divorce, coping with aging parents or feeling completely overthe edge. It's is a feel good book that makes a woman feel completely understood and worthy. It reminds us who we truly are and how much value we contribute. When everyone or everything around you leads you to feel spent and worthless, this is the book to read. It's the book to treasure and refer to whenver life gets out of control. I've given it to my best friends and they love it."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"So often, whether we realize it or not, what is feminine is seen as weaker than what is masculine. Many women have fallen for this definition. A Woman's Worth explains how through thousands of years this was accomplished. This book illustrates how important it is for women to honor other women and how to get in touch with the best that is within you. I have the book on tape and think it's easier to follow with the author reading it. I've given it as a gift to several women and I'd had male friends suggest it would be an excellent gift to give to men as well. Not a hoaky self-book, a true spiritual journey if you're ready for it."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"The heart of a woman lies, according to Marianne, in the secret interior of the heart. She talks a lot about the body and mind, and how they come together to form the feelings we have had about each other, and as human beings, to our sexual spirits and ideals.Her diverse iconography of language in this wonderfully written book divests to us the true beauty of a woman. Naked, powerful, unfathomable. With her distinct breath, a woman reveals her instinct as a Goddess and as a spiritual animal, capable of both honoring the goddess and loving her sensibility.The religion she refers to (in the book as in A Return to Love) is a mainly Judeo-Christian one, one also bound to be a fatigue to most readers interested in the spirit. I say this with clarity, because I came from the religion she talks about, and it is a very sad religion, because it takes away women's power over their bodies, and ultimately, truth. I think she uses words like God and King and Heaven to illustrate her point of view, and not name any one point or place or whatever. It's her choice of words that may throw some people off, but in the end, you will see an immaculate dialogue forming between the characters in her mythical tale and her worldview of the reality of how little woman's bodily nature has been revered, and how decimated she has become, because of this.I hope you will read this book! It's a wonderful work about women who are searching for answers on how to live fully, openly gracious, and more considerate of those around them. If you like this please buy her other treatise on love, \\"A Return to Love\\"."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"While there is a bit of &quot;Daddy did this to you...&quot; mentality, there isn't too much of it, and isn't exclusive to it. &amp; at least it's not another book that totally blames our &quot;mothers&quot; or &quot;our parents&quot; for everything.Very well written - simple and clear. Not any extra, long-winded, unneeded explanations or words.I'm highly suggesting it to (actually giving it to) a few of my girl friends and will probably continue to do so.Second best book I have read in a long time. Right up there with &quot;Mister God, This is Anna&quot; written by: Fynn."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I don't mean to sound corny but this book, and Ms. Williamson's &quot;Return to Love&quot; changed my life. I gave both of these books to my mother and my sister for Christmas. I have suggested them to many other firends, and the gal that referred me to these wonderful books, we quote Marianne Williamson all the time--she has truly become a staple in our lives. I believe that God has given Ms.Williamson an extraordinary gift. That's what this book is, someone that can truly speak from God. Thank you Marianne, for sharing your gift with us!"},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Having had unfortunate bad luck and experience with intimacy and relationships in my lifetime, I turned to this book as an attempt for me to learn to &quot;understand women&quot;. So I went ahead and bought the audio tapes. While this book was very poetic, I felt it was &quot;missing&quot; something: a common ground where men and women can come together and share their experiences. Unfortunately, in this book (and in practically all her later books), Marianne bought into the notion that &quot;men are from mars and women are from venus&quot;. She is relentless with stereotyping the sexes, and what's worse, she puts men down openly in this book.If you want to read something which does justice to both men and women, I recommend the following two books: &quot;The Future of Love&quot; by Daphne Rose Kingma, and &quot;The Nature of the Psyche&quot; by Jane Roberts and Seth.If you are a male reader, please don't get this book. And if you are a female reader, I would think twice before taking Marianne's words as gospel. It would do you best to reconsider your attitudes and beliefs toward men, women, and relationships, and to look for a common ground which would benefit everyone."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I expected this to be more of a religious-type book: \\"THE Bible says....\\" It was nothing like that!!! One of my pleasant surprises was that the author is pro-choice!There was also a humorous reference to any female matriarch needing a king-size bed for family gatherings! It simply flows along and you feel like jumping for joy that you're female.It also dwells extensively on women and their relationships to men. I felt alternately chastised and understood!I'm requiring both my girls, ages 21 and 16 to read it!"},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Please share this book with the women you love. It is courageously written, and leaves the reader feeling significant and understood."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Marianne Williamson puts forth in this beautiful book, what we all know. Deep down in the bottom of our soul, we know that we're here for a purpose. We know that God created us and that for centuries we have been silenced, denigrated and devalued. Yes, we know we are powerful, but many of us have forgotten.Read this book and remember. And then buy one for your sister, your best friend, your mother and your daughter."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I just LOVED this book. I am a firm believer that books should be borrowed from a library first and that's what I did with this book. Occasionally, I decide at some point during reading a book that I must own it. This is one of those books. By far my favorite book by Williamson. It liberates women and inspires them. Beautifully written, easy to read, emotional and strong. I bought this book so I could go back and underline the passages that resonated with me the most. I would recommend this book to just about any female (or a liberated male!)"},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"This book was the silliest, most trite book I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I am an open-minded, spiritual woman who usually goes for these kinds of touchy-feely, feel-good books. But this one was corny, shallow, and filled with metaphors that were so ridiculous that I felt embarassed for the author. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"There were some points that Ms. Williamson brought up that I had already discovered in life on my own and there were others that I knew existed but have to accept. Basically, this book is about common sense. I would have enjoyed the book better had it not been for some profanity that could have easily been avoided. This book is not one of my best readings but it is an interesting book to pass time. I would recommend this book to others with reservation."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"A good-hearted book - unfortunately it was so poorly argued, trite and repetitive, that it did a disservice both to its subject and feelings. Women need a balance between the mind and the heart, and this kind of gushing nonsense does not help us to change ourselves, or the world. If you want a good, intelligent and heart-felt feminine take on the world, read Clarissa Pinkola Estes's Women Who Run With the Wolves."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"She quotes, \\"And when we try to speak it, were liable to be told, there you go complaining--again.\\" The entire first chapter is ranting and complaining! She makes no effort to acknowledge the woman overseas that are suffering far worse than any American women.She talks about being enchanted, we all are light workers and when we accept our male and feminine side we shine light in our own personal ways. The way I heal and shine light unto others is in my own personal way and not her imposed way. Again she assumes based of her own opinion.The entire book, she rambles and never makes one strong point.She also tells you to go pray under the statue of Mary, what an imposer!She claims our intuitive strengths and healing is not respected now and that is false. Thousands of men and women call up healers, life coaches, accupuncture, counseling, and intuitive counselors for guidance with respect. No one can tell you you're worth and she tries to. Your values, standards and beliefs are what you establish to worth yourself, not Merriam Williamson imposing her ideals.She contradicts herself in the book.Here is one; She claims that it is unfair women are not taken as serious or have the same opportunities in the order, structure area of society.Near the end of the book she complains again that women are oppressed by force of order and structure. She complains we dont get enough initiation in areas of order and structure then complains that we are oppressed with it.Many women are currently thriving in prestigious careers with order and structure and shine their light while being leaders of inspiration. She would realize that if she got out of her head and faced reality and did not only look to what she wanted to see. Some women heal with Truth and Justice. Not all are balls of soft tissue for their Chosen careers and they still can heal, nurture and access their intuition.Many women like or wish to have structure and order in their life. Divine ordering your thoughts are instilled by most Priestesses. We can Discipline our emotions and succeed in prestigious careers and thrive.The book is a bunch of Imposing ideals and opinions and makes no points. She rambles her thoughts.I consider her an insult to a woman's worth and an insult to impose her ideal of worth upon all female kind. She makes no effort to have empathy for the women all around the world now and talks about her pity too much. I don't care to worship any statue! I will honor my own spirit!My opinion, in a nutshell and ill spare you pity and sob stories:Accept your- self, have courage to lead, discipline your emotions, develop empathy for men and women and shine your light. Connect to your Divine Spirit self for inspiration. You CAN be heard and not be considered a complainer. Who you choose to give nurture, love and compassion to is based off your values, standards and beliefs and your way of shining light is not going to be the same as another, while being just as important.We can be non emotional objective intelligent Leaders and be healers. We can be both.\\"\\"A person's worth is contingent upon who he is, not upon what he does, or how much he has.

Yet, knowing that Marianne Williamson touts &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; as the source of her spiritual guidance, how does she justify &quot;a woman's worth&quot; and prayer to a &quot;goddess&quot; when the Course specifically states that we are not bodies, and that the sole source of our illusion of a world is the idea of separation? Did she even read the Course? &quot;A Return to Love&quot; was incredibly inconsistent with Course teachings. She does NOT paraphrase accurately.

It is written almost as notes to herself that are being shared with others. Unlike my favorite book by her, \\"Everyday Grace\\" which was about hope, forgiveness and miracles, there is no real overriding message to this book.Marianne Williamson is a good writer, so the book is still an enjoyable read and she does make some good points, such as:- We are responsible for how we see ourselves- The truth is there when the mind is ready to receive it- Children remind us of what's important- The biggest limit to our having is our small reachBut by and large, the book seems to be mainly venting about the way she believes men treat women in our culture (i.e. as the weaker sex and as sexual objects.) She is particulary upset by the way older women are treated, noting, \\"Your youth is the measure of your worth, and your age is the measure of your worthlessness.\\"If you're interested in Marianne's work, I would recommend some of her other books, like \\"Everyday Grace\\" or \\"A Return to Love\\" or even her most recent book, \\"The Age of Miracles.\\""},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I have never read anything from Marianne Williamson, and this book actually draws the reader in and makes them feel exclusive.

This book is not just for women, it is for us all."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I love this book. I wish the woman who panned it would give it a read. I agree that some of the author's other books are ... narrowly focused. This book, however, is not. It made me feel better about being a woman. It helped me apprecate the differences between women and men. It has helped me heal after being hurt in relationship. It has made me feel better about my &quot;imperfect&quot; body. It makes me feel beautiful and powerful and valuable - in a word - WORTHY of a wonderful life. It also points out to me that having a wonderful life is my responsibility.

I devoured the book. So as I often do when visiting my local book store, I searched for more of her wonderful expressions of love in book form. \\"A Woman's Worth\\" nearly jumped off the shelf and into my hands. I knew it was meant to be.Marianne draws on her own experiences as a woman and her story cuts across race, gender, religion and class to make a statement about the undeniably distinct value of womanhood. This book makes no bones about the fact that women are worthy of love, respect, desire, joy, happiness, faith and a life filled with purpose. However, as worthy as we are, it is up to each of us to demand the same with \\"loving kid-gloves\\" and not force. Realize our history, be present for today and know our desires for our future - and fully accept the gift of our individual glory as a woman.If you are searching for a read that will empower you as a woman, give you pause for spiritual growth and encourage you to step up to the plate, then I highly recommend \\"A Woman's Worth\\".

Whether I knew those women or not, they carved out the path of my existence. Their tears are the oceans I swim in and they set me afloat. I have read two other of Marianne Williamson's books, but those don't even compare to the simple, bold, in your face message of the value of your worth as a woman. I wish Marianne had a twin brother to write A Man's Worth, but she does graciously pay tribute to Sam Keen's Fire in the Belly on the very first page. See, always a woman to think of others and nurture the universe! Mostly, Madame Williamsons' book just made me feel so worthy of the gift of me. I am accountable to and of myself and it is my obligation to share the best of myself. So many juicy quotes, so many rich, alive, statements.

I highly recommend this book particularly if you or a friend has hit a rocky patch in life. I was down so low when I read this book, I wasn't sure where I could turn for help.

If we ever doubted the feminine beauty, Marianne Williamson passionately weaves a modern mystical tale reminding us of Her necessity.In countless ways she gives testimony to the love and goodness all women can provide the world. It is the feminine in all of us that brings the finer subtleties to life fulfilling what Nature craves. It is the responsibility of men and women alike to balance our masculine communities, our masculine governments, our masculine ways. It is through our own gracefulness that we attune ourselves to the highest good.Throughout her passionate commentary of her own life and the lives' of women, Marianne teaches how to embrace all that is feminine. From chapters Glorious Queens and Slavegirls to The Castle Walls, her personal, intuitive insights move all of us to cultivate that which is pure in our being. In order to develop the Goddess within, appreciation is given to the necessity of pain in our lives while the importance of forgiveness, patience, and understanding is encouraged. At any stage in our personal development journey all can benefit from Marianne's conversational and uplifting prose.Finally, this is the book that will take you to higher plains in your development."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"4 years ago I came across a copy of this book, and spent a joyful afternoon reading her words and contemplating my own worth.

I crave hearing about what is good about women. She has a great talent for writing a \\"call-to-arms\\" and digs deep into some shared experiences.Then at some point I realized her ideas about women were limiting to me. Her vision of women is very typical and even stereotypical. It assumes all women are good nurturers, heterosexual and looking for a long term relationship. To some extent it implies women are forced into competitive or leadership roles they don't actually enjoy.These are some quotes that alerted me:\\"Most of us want a masculine man, but there's no way to have one unless we become a feminine woman\\"\\"Our burgeoning sexuality didn't just freak out Daddy, who was attracted and repelled at the same time. It freaked out Mommy too, who was jealous, and our teachers who had similar projections.\\"\\"A woman is meant to hold the heart of the world within her hands. She must cater to it and minister to it and kiss it when it cries... we are meant to prepare the food, the spiritual food of love and compassion. We are meant to care for the children, not just our own, but every child. When we do not recognize our cosmic function, our own hearts break and so does the heart of the world\\"there are many other quotes that had me perk up my ears.It's confusing to have these things uttered by someone who is pro-woman in some ways.

A book for both women and men to acknowledge their feminine powers of compassion, healing, nurturing and intuition. A wonderful call to women to actualize their roles in relationships, family, society and on earth. Marianne's insight is profound and encompassing. I will definitely share this book with other women who I encounter. I have been so moved and filled by her ideas about women's worth that I intend to share those ideas with as many other Filipina women I speak to at conferences and workshops.This book may at first be hard to digest but as you expand your awareness to a Universal level then the meanings all begin to make sense. Detractors may view this book as anti-men, but this is not the case when you read the book and understand it. On the contrary, she does speak of a balance between both masculine and feminine and a balance between the contributions of men and women within societies that flourished. Read pages 15 to 16 fully and digest the words before you make your own assessment of her meaning. Her book is not anti-men but rather anti-male domination which also means anti-imbalance.Find out what all of us raving reviewers are talking about. for yourself.

Pick this book up and pass it along to those you love...."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I don't mean to sound corny, but this book and Ms. Williamson's &quot;Return to Love&quot; changed my life. I gave both of these books to my mother and sister for Christmas. One of my best friends turned me on to the works of Marianne Williamson--I have also the same for other friends. Feeling good about yourself, and doing good for others is priceless! It does not matter, where you are from, your age, your height, your weight. There is nothing that a woman cannot do. Marianne just helps you to realize it."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Men who desire more meaningful discussion, men who want to have a greater flexibility and power with the woman in their lives owe it to themselves to read this book in earnest. I am studying in with profit, and it has added depth, and a greater breadth and scope to my interactions with the woman. Come on guys, let's elevate our consciousness to the point where we can intuit, and feel, where we can allow for vulnerability and sensitive expression. We can still do this and maintain a hero/power status."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Marianne has brought to the surface what has laid dormant for some time. Somehow we knew what needed to be said, but thought no one would listen. Our mothers knew so well about suppressing one's own desire to achieve greatness, only to be silenced by tradition and ignorance. But through an enlightened voice and many more voices, we hear and see the potential that was denied in the past. Behold, a new day is dawning."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I have read this book over and over and listen to the tapes constantly. It is the most enlightening book that I think a woman can read. It is written for all ages, religions, and backgrounds. I have given away over 30 copies to friends and family. I would suggest this to any woman who searches for the true meaning of femininity."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Marianne Williamson is my hero!

I have a poster-sizedmount from the cover to remind me when I wake every morning."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Marrianne Williamson's work is both real and honest. Rather than couch things in a concepts that are alien or extremely religious, she talks to you about the realities of existing. Of how things will not always be easy, about how you will lose your way, and honestly how to see people clearly. Growth is messy, it's not neat, maturity is not easy, nor is spirtiuality delicate work, but with assistance from a tape like this you can see yourself clearly and how to bridge yourself from concept to human to spiritual being."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"I happened upon a quote from this book in another book I was reading, then the same quote was repeated in a class I took. The quote alone drew me in so much that I had to seek this book out! After reading Ms. Williamson's inspiring words cover to cover, I have now suggested this book as a MUST READ for any woman who is on a path of self discovery. I found that not only was each chapter a page-turner, but also most of the sentences could stand alone as an inspirational quote in and of themselves! I have seldom had the pleasure of reading a book by an author with such a gift for the written word. Thank you Marianne Williamson...you changed my life!"},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"This book offers great insight to mindfulness about being a woman, but need a revision to be more appropriate for today... 2012.

Part of my permanent collection. This is not a self help or feel good book. It helps open your eyes and mind to what is most important in your life, and get to the core of your being. If you cannot read between the lines of what the writer is saying, you will find this book vague and superficial. If that is the case, put it away for a year and come back to it. When the student is ready, the teacher arrives."},{"Title":"A Woman's Worth","review":"Marianne Williamson has written some wonderful stuff ... this isn't her best work. It is okay in the beginning, gets your attention and makes some good points -- but as you progress through the book, you realize she is saying the same thing over and over -- and it gets boring. And it seems so negative. There are some good 'nuggets' here and there throughout that are thought provoking, but by mid-way through I just wanted to put the book down and be done with it. I will wait a bit, then try to give it a re-read to see if I have the same reaction."},{"Title":"Who Paid the Piper?: The CIA and the Cultural Cold War","review":"This splendid book examines the US Central Intelligence Agency's role waging a cultural and propaganda war against socialist ideas in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. The CIA created, funded and ran the Congress for Cultural Freedom, while both bodies always claimed that the CCF was quite independent.From the start of the US state's not-so-altruistic Marshall Plan, it gave $200 million a year to support the CIA's various activities, including assassinations, coups, strike-breaking, election-rigging, and setting up supposedly independent magazines (like Encounter), festivals and organisations..The CIA worked closely, as it still does today, with the Foreign Office and MI6. The Foreign Office's secret Information Research Department supported the 'left-wing' Labour journal Tribune and distributed its material internationally.The US state backed moves towards a federal Europe and the EEC, rightly seeing the EEC as a capitalist bulwark against socialism. So the European Movement was \\"funded almost entirely by the CIA through a dummy front called the American Committee for a United Europe\\".Saunders concludes, \\"the same people who read Dante and went to Yale and were educated in civic virtue recruited Nazis, manipulated the outcome of democratic elections, gave LSD to unwitting subjects, opened the mail of thousands of American citizens, overthrew governments, supported dictatorships, plotted assassinations, and engineered the Bay of Pigs disaster. \`In the name of what?' asked one critic. \`Not civic virtue, but empire.'\\""},{"Title":"Who Paid the Piper?: The CIA and the Cultural Cold War","review":"In the West, during the Cold War, the freedom of expression of writers &amp; artists was vaunted as democracy's most cherished possession.

The type is so small I can barely read it, but I discovered that I used it more because it was so handy. It is easily carried when I travel and is always kept nearby even at home.This is a serious resource. It contains information on everything. Outlines and backgrounds of the books of the Bible, Biblical cities and countries, Biblical characters, animals, trees and plants, some customs of the time (though very little compared to books written specifically for that purpose), and much more.The sad thing is, you can probably find it for $2.00 at a used book store, when the reality is that it is worth infinitely more than many of the higher priced modern books. If you can't afford an extensive library, you can learn a whole lot by using this book in your Bible study.

The books edited by Collum Coats I find to be more readable...this is not light and fluffy stuff... Enjoy! I did!"},{"Title":"Living Energies : An Exposition of Concepts Related to the Theories of Viktor Schauberger","review":"This book started it all! Callum Coats basically brought to &quot;light&quot; the resurgence of interest in Viktor Schauberger's theories. This is truly a brilliant work. Water as a carrier of vital energy information, trees as bio-condensers of energy between the deep earth and the sun, how self-cleansing rivers nourish the landscape, how the future of the earth depends on the replanting of natural forests, revolutionary agricultural implements, free energy heater-coolers, jet engines and gravity defying machines invented by Schauberger in the 30's and 40's, home power generators...it's pretty much all here. It was a hard book for me to put down once I started reading, and I go back to it continually for reference. This book pretty much sums up Schauberger's work, which Coats then compartmentalized and expanded in the &quot;Eco-Technology&quot; series with four other books. I would highly advise getting this book, first, and reading it thoroughly, before moving on to the series, as it is a fascinating preface into discovering who Viktor Schauberger WAS, and learning just how far-reaching his theories were, and aplicable to us, today."},{"Title":"Living Energies : An Exposition of Concepts Related to the Theories of Viktor Schauberger","review":"Viktor Schauberger came from a long line of Austrian foresters, whose family motto was Fidus in Silvus Silentibus: \\"Faith in the Silent Forests.\\" It's almost as if the trees & rivers were in his blood. His profound power of observation permitted him to see what others overlooked, and to draw conclusions that were both practical and utterly unique. (His method of observation is highly reminiscent of Goethe's way of science.) Schauberger eschewed a university education because he knew it would deaden his mind, and he had learned enough in school already to find deep disagreement with a number of sacrosanct theories. He is probably best known (for those few who know of him) for his profound observations of water as a living being - most particularly the natural vortical inner motion of rivers, and their need to meander and maintain low temperatures; and the natural formation of springs. He also deeply understood the nature and needs of trees - which, in essence, create water, and have a tremendous effect on weather systems.Because Schauberger's observations, discoveries and inventions were so unique and outside the strictures of establishment science, he had to create his own terminology. In this way he was very much like the old alchemists who necessarily coined new words for their discoveries. And too, his view of the elements was unlike any other. For example, with the exception of oxygen and hydrogen, he termed all the other elements \\"carbones.\\" In fact his whole vision, with all of its extraordinary explication, is alchemical - not the least because it includes Spirit. His many inventions were based on natural transformations and energies: his dictum was \\"Comprehend and copy nature!\\"Most of his many inventions flew in the face of conventional science and technology, and because of his highly individualistic science he was unable to explain their workings in comprehensible terms. As a result he was much maligned by the status quo, which greatly served to increase his fundamental disdain for scientific ignorance and arrogance. His writings were full of vituperations against orthodox science. In this way he reminds me of the profoundly inventive and insightful alchemist-physician, Paracelsus, whose scathing invective against the universities of his time is legendary.Read this book and learn about a truly unique genius, whose life was fraught with treachery and great adversity. You'll find it very exciting."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis Applications","review":"This book has just recently been published but you would never know it from the content. It's very introductory material with little content that isn't already on the web for free. In fact the coverage on the web is probably better that what the author has provided. Simple descriptions of indicators that have been around forever like RSI, moving averages, trendlines etc. You get the idea. It's hard to understand why Luca felt it necessary to cover this stuff. Much better books were written 20 years ago. It's simply a shallow attempt to get some bucks from those that buy a book by the author's name or title. Waht amazes me even more is that the publisher somehow thinks this book should be listed at $65. What a joke.

There are eight lectures given by T. S. Eliot (1888-1965) in 1926, &quot;On the Metaphysical Poetry of the Seventeenth Century with Special Reference to Donne, Crawshaw and Cowley.&quot; Then there are three lectures, &quot;The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry,&quot; given at The Johns Hopkins University in 1933. There is an Author's Preface which is more like a note of the author to himself, on &quot;the intention of the author to rewrite these lectures as a book.&quot; (p. 41). That book &quot;is intended as one volume of a trilogy under the general title of \`The Disintegration of the intellect' &quot; (p. 41).This book is edited and introduced by Ronald Schuchard, who has provided information about the circumstances in which the lectures were written and given, additions and corrections noted on the manuscript, literary context, translations of quotations, corrections of mistranslations (some of which were noted on the manuscript), notes on similar themes in other works by T. S. Eliot, and in Appendix I, a French translation of the lecture on pages 93-117 published as &quot;Deux Attitudes Mystiques: Dante and Donne&quot; in 1927. (pp. 309-318).Dante ? A great poet, is mainly of interest in this book as a philosophical poet, as recognized in the book THREE PHILOSOPHICAL POETS by George Santayana, which T. S. Eliot &quot;had read and mastered at Harvard, a book that had stimulated his theory and that was to become a central document in his Clark lectures.&quot; (p. 2). T. S. Eliot also accepted as a definition of metaphysical the conventional identification of poets and critics familiar with the great anthology, METAPHYSICAL LYRICS AND POEMS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY by Herbert Grierson. In addition, an example of great poetry, Sappho's \`Ode to Anactoria' (c. 600 B.C.) is printed in full in a note where it is mentioned by T. S. Eliot as &quot;a real advance, a development, in human consciousness; it sets down, within its verse, the unity of an experience which had previously only existed unconsciously; in recording the physical concomitants of an emotion it modifies the emotion.&quot; (p. 51).The first lecture attempts to establish the function of poetry, but students of Freud's &quot;Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot; will be interested in how often the quotations on the fly by T. S. Eliot have been modified by his memory to apply specifically to him. On page 52, he substituted necessity in place of nervousness for the reason two characters, &quot;not from good will, Marched along shoulder to shoulder&quot; in THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK by Lewis Carroll. On page 53, &quot;When Shakespeare says \`Man must abide'&quot; he is quoting from KING LEAR, v. ii. 9-11 which says &quot;Men must endure.&quot; On page 56 the same line is compared with some lines from PURGATORIO by Dante, after asserting, &quot;If you recall my tentative division of the three types of philosophical poetry, you will see at once that Dante is the great exemplar not only for the type which forms the theme of these lectures, but of every type.&quot; (p. 56). The translation of the Italian in the notes does not attempt to inform readers of what the few Italian words misremembered in the text might have indicated in a Freudian analysis.There is an Index to Editorial Material on pages 335-343, following the Index to the Lectures on pages 327-334. Items not included in the indices include the lists of lectures given in Appendix II and Appendix III, indicative of a range of scholarship at the highest intellectual level, mentioning a 1992-3 series on \`Three Models of Truthfulness: Thucydides, Diderot, Nietzsche.' (p. 322). People who find that exciting might also discover that they missed \`Irony and Solidarity' by Richard Rorty in 1986-7. How close is this book to real philosophy? The historical approach to its subject matter includes: &quot;Not only a diversion of inquiry; it is rather as if, at certain times, the constitution of the human mind altered to adapt itself to new categories of truth, and new elements of thought.&quot; (p. 79). &quot;But dissolution so frequently begins within, that I think that the Jesuits had a great deal to do with it: their fine distinctions and discussions of conduct and casuistry tend in the direction of a certain self-consciousness which had not been conspicuous in the world before. I am here more concerned with defining clearly the difference in point of view, a true Copernican revolution which occurred centuries before Kant was born, a difference which marks the real abyss between the classic scholastic philosophy and all philosophy since.&quot; (p. 80). Nietzsche shows up as the author of a motto in a work &quot;which TSE told Hesse he would have published in translation in the \`Criterion' had it been shorter (L1 [THE LETTERS OF T. S. ELIOT] 510).&quot; (p. 81, n. 38). &quot;Mankind suddenly retires inside its several skulls, until you hear Nietzsche - pretty well tormented in his cranial lodging - declaring that \`nothing is inside, nothing is outside'.&quot; (pp. 80-81).The combination of poetry and philosophy in these lectures is leading to consideration of a minor poet. &quot;Jules Laforgue was a young man who died at the age of twenty-seven in the year 1877. . . . His poetry, and even his prose, is immature, rough and sentimental. . . . He had an innate craving for order: that is, that every feeling should have its intellectual equivalent, its philosophical justification, and that every idea should have its emotional equivalent, its sentimental justification. The only world in which he could have satisfied himself, therefore, was a world such as Dante's.&quot; (p. 212). Similar information is given at the beginning of the final lecture on pages 281-282. As an example for poets in our time: &quot;One positive contribution towards poetry is all that one can hope to make; beyond that it does not matter whether one is Shakespeare or Jules Laforgue; whether one is \`original' or \`derivative'.&quot; (p. 289)."},{"Title":"Effective Horsemanship","review":"This book is the best I have read for a comprehensive text on training and riding.

It gave me a foundation. My teachers over the last 25 years have really only just guided my application of Noel Jackson's written word. Now it is a perfect refresher whenever I wish to &quot;brush-up&quot;.I really could not manage a horsey career without it!!"},{"Title":"Qs-9000 Registration and Implementation (Quality and Reliability)","review":"An excellent book that provides a simple hands on approach togetting certified quick, easy and cheap. Look like that the authoractually went through the registartion process himself. Well written, straightforward and sensible."},{"Title":"The sale begins when the customer says \\"no\\" (A Hillman/MacFadden Book)","review":"In this book, Leterman discloses what he believes the secrets to selling are. The book is wonderfully formatted and breaks down the different aspects of selling into nice, easily digestible chapters. Incorporating interesting and entertaining anecdotes, he manages to keep the reader focused and learning through his experiences as an insurance salesman.Selling, truly is an art, as he describes it. He also points out how selling can be as basic as selling yourself as a friend - it doesn't have to be a product.All in all, I enjoyed this book. It has a lot that one could learn from it and I only rate it a medium because at certain points it lags in detail."},{"Title":"Unforced Error: A Rep and Melissa Pennyworth Mystery","review":"The fun of this book is the main characters of Rep and Melissa and the itinerary references. The weakness is and that, at times, the literary references occasionally seem forced and get in the way of the story, and the complete implausibility of the plot. But it's worth a look if you're in the mood for something light that will test your memory of literature."},{"Title":"Unforced Error: A Rep and Melissa Pennyworth Mystery","review":"Intellectual property lawyer Rep Pennyworth figures he'll do just about anything to bring in a big-bucks client. He'll even spend a weekend as a civil war reenactor while he tries to decide whether the publisher really can trademark the idea of a faux civil war unit. He can't figure out how the publisher could make any money at it, but that isn't the lawyer's job and a hundred thousand bucks is real money. But when an editor ends up killed and Rep's friend Peter is the lead suspect, Rep realizes he's going to have to do more than dry lawyering--he'll have to figure out what really happened before Peter is sent to prison.The dead man isn't exactly a saint--he had an affair with Peter's wife, for one thing--which gives Rep and his wife Melissa a cast of suspects. But the police like to follow the obvious, especially when Peter's civil war cavalry sabre tests positive for the dead man's DNA. Plenty of library research into civil war battles and Vichy France politics, as well as a scad of literary illusions add depth to the story as Melissa tries to decide which philosopher to use to advise her friend--finally to decide on Travis McGee (of John D. MacDonald fame) and Rep finally agrees to play Nick and Nora (of The Thin Man fame) with Melissa.Author Michael Bowen dishes up plenty of plenty of literary illusions for fans of mystery and literature, a clever opening scene involving a potential affair and reality T.V. and some interesting looks into civil war reenacting. I thought that the final revelation into the badguy's ultimate plot was a bit over the top, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the adventure, the witty dialogue, or the way nerdy librarians, book editors, and intellectual property lawyers become action heros."},{"Title":"Unforced Error: A Rep and Melissa Pennyworth Mystery","review":"Michael Bowen is a &quot;writer's writer.&quot; With smart, stylish prose he weaves together various aspects of modern pop-culture, from Reality TV to romance novels to Civil War battle reenactments. His characters are likeable, their conversations are lively, and when a gunshot rings out in the Kansas City library, you know you're in for a wild, bookish ride. It's all-hell-breaks-loose in the Heartland, over-the-top fun."},{"Title":"Unforced Error: A Rep and Melissa Pennyworth Mystery","review":"The tone of this novel and the author's attitude toward murder and mystery fiction, is immediately encapsulated in the prologue. \\"First degree murder is punishable by death in Missouri, even if the victim is an editor of romance novels.\\" Reppert G. Penneworth, top copyright lawyer and his wife Melissa go off to Kansas City to explore the possibility of groundbreaking legal stuff, something most lawyers aspire to. He's dropped almost immediately into a puzzling murder case involving Civil War re-enactors, a publisher, a philandering editor, a huffy romance novelist, and a raft of other engaging characters. The books is replete with literary allusions, clever dialogue and one of the smartest amateur detectives to grace the pages of mystery fiction in a long time. Now, writing new copyright law may sound a bit dull, but be assured, it isn't, not in the deft hands of this author.This is a very well-written novel, moves with great pace, avoids pitfalls of deficient logic and rockets to a teriffic ending."},{"Title":"Unforced Error: A Rep and Melissa Pennyworth Mystery","review":"Both good & bad guys didn't behave with much sense & the literary allusions were a bit forced. So I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really liked this book. I tried reading &quot;Little Women&quot; and I couldn't get into it. &quot;Little Men&quot; was different.

However, there are twelve boys and two girls. The author takes you through six months of the year with the children. People will laugh at their antics and in the same token will be touched by the love and respect with which they treat each other. Each child has his or her obsticals to overcome and each has their own good points. The author makes you feel as if you are in the school with them the entire time. The reader will be drawn into their world and wish he or she were really there. This is an overall great book and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"The magic of youth is captured here in all its transitory and fleeting beauty and turmoil. An idyllic home in the country side is the setting for this classic that you have to read if you're between the ages of 8 and 14."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"When a self-assured young tomboy grows up in a male-dominated society during the 1800s, she then makes up for it by becoming a cheery but eccentric &quot;Mother Goose&quot; running a broading school for young male heirs. There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes, there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a proper lady of the Victorian era."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Mostly I got this book because I never owned it and do own Little Women and Jo's Boys.I want my daughter to have the trilogy.I thought it was terrible.A mere series of goody-goody character sketches with very little holding it all together. If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy! They were a great pair.I did not care about these boys much and even had trouble distinguishing them from one another.Jo's Boys was much better--at least a novel, so read Little Men only to fill in the blanks."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men is the funniest of all the three books. I like this book, but not as much as the Jo's Boys or Little Women. Little Men begins with 'Nat as the 1st ch. If you have seen the movie and think it is great, wait till you read the book. The novel is much more sophisticated and very touching. The movie basically concentrates on Nat and Dan, but the novel is about every single boy and girl. If you've seen the movie and didnt like it, guess what, try the novel! My fav't characters are everybody. Old Chirper(Nat), Dan, Demi, Daisy, Tommy, Franz, Commodore(Emil), Nan, Princess(Bess), little Ted, Rob, Jack..too many people. If you like the story of boys and girls, this is one of the books to read. If this is the Alcott's 1st book you've read, TRY ALL! ALCOTT IS THE BEST! My fav't part is the LITTLE COOKSTOVE(iron). Its so neat, and how Daisy, Nat, Demi, Dan, Emil, Tommy, and dont forget our Teddy, and Rob, standing up for each others."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This book is a follow up on the wonderful book (that I love) Little women. Little women was a enchanting book about the March girls and a friendly neighbor named Laurie. Jo March gets married to Mr. Bhaer and in Little Women and now they have a place called Plumfield, which they inheirited. With Plumfield they make it sort of like an orphanage and takes boys from the street, teaching them and loving them. I would recommend this book, if you read the first one.

This novel is simple with its man against himself conflict, yet sweet, and a reminder of the trials and tribulations of growing up. You have no choice but to feel compassion for the boys and girls of Jo's house, and the innocent that they maintain throughout the book. After having read three books by the above authour, I am eagerly about to devour another as Alcott continually supplies the reader with innovative, and intriguing emotions, faces, and experiences."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This book is amazing.

I had to read it for a class project and this book was a snooze. Now I know everyone who did enjoy this book is probably wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my head, but I wanted to give my opinion. I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book. The book had really no plot, it rambled on and it felt like a huge run on sentence. There was a few good parts and when I started to get excited and then it made me want to throw it across the room."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I love this book. It is a wonderful story and will hopefully be told for many years to come.

It was fun to laugh at the life at Plumfield, and such a joy to learn simple morals and life truths as we read together.

Now I still get the same joy reading them as I did then."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"It is truly a shame that the highest number of stars you can rate a book is five, because I would give this book a million stars if I could.It is truly one of the two best books I have ever read. (The other off course is Little Women).Little men is a book that can make you both laugh and cry. The morals inside are more useful than any of the ten commandments. Louisa May Alcott has definetly done it again.Without giving away everything, these are some of the reasons why you will enjoy the book:1) You see Jo grow up. She is no longer the wild child who's impetuous and androgynous character often lead her to trouble. She inherits maternal qualities that you never expected Jo to have.2) You will get more insight on the professor. Although I truly wanted Teddy and Jo to get together, this book made me think otherwise. Professor Bhaer, with Jo's help, makes a delightful father to the boys. He is the one you will get most of the life morals from.3) The boys in Plumfield are definetly the key figures in the book. They create both the mischievious and melancholy stories. As I said, 'you'll laugh and cry'. Reading about these boys will make everyone reflect on their own lives.4) Teddy grows up too. If you enjoyed the young scandulous Teddy, you'll enjoy the new one even more. In little men, Teddy (like Jo) has grown into a real mature father.There are plenty more exciting things in the book. It is truly a classic masterpiece recommended to anyone who needs a lift in their spirit."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"While Little Men is not up to the literary achievement of Little Women, it is a wonderful tale for kids. It is JUST perfect for reading chapter by chapter to kids as part of an evening family night. It is as jolly as a house full of rambunctious boys could be.Jo Bhaer, nee March, has boys of her own now and boys to spare. She and the Professor take in students based on charity and kindness. Some boys are neglected, some are badly brought up, all need love, laughter and a caring environment. Plumfield is all that and more.The jolly goings-on make you wish you could have gone to school and lived at Plumfield. The book is prevented from being saccharine by the all-too-familiar themes of neglected kids, growing pains and the sad and much too early death of a favorite character from Little Women.There is lots of fun, and lots to discuss in this sequel to Alcott's marvelous Little Women. Lest you think boys won't like Alcott, I know more than one man who loves Little Women even as an adult."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men is (for those who do not know) a sequel to Little Women. Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school. The book will warm your heart right from the begining and you will read on not stopping even a moment. : )"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Please note, this is and has always been, one of my favorite stories. I am not reviewing the story Little Men, but the way it was published by IndiePublish. I would give the story 5 stars, but this presentation only two.On the bright side, the cloth binding appears very well done and should last quite a while.Unfortunately, the publisher chose to reformat all the paragraphs in the text so that like this review all margins are left justified and a blank line separates the paragraphs. If it were done well, it might have worked ok, but it was done very clumsily with the completion of a sentence often being separated from the rest of the paragraph. (I have a suspicion that the reformatting of an original text was done by using a Find-Replace function of a word processor and not checked by an editor.) This makes for some awkward readings, and probably not something I would want to put into the hands of a child.Also the text was not proofed for typos or other simple errors in punctuation, and there are some places where I could not tell what the original sentence was intended to say. Again, I expect that the only proofing done on this version was by a spellchecker and a lot of simple mistakes entered into the publication.I wish to repeat, that I love this story and have since I was a boy, and would recommend the story to any child, but would not recomment this particular volume."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really loved this book! I got so caught up in the lives of Nan, Daisy, Nat, Dan, Demi and all the other wonderful characters in this book. I found myself wishing that Plumfield existed, such a wonderful school.

I highly recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men was a very well written book. It had many fun adventures, great characters, great dialog, and all in all it was an awesome book.I loved the way the author wrote the little children's voices just right!! It just made me have to stop and laugh!When you read this book it is not like reading, it is like watching a movie!! That is how well written this book really is!! You could even see the house and the rooms!! I know what every room looks like and how to get there!I could see the boy's foot when he hurt it and I could see his face when the doctor had to fix it.I love this book!! It is not a girly book like I thought it would be. In fact it is quite a boy book!! A boy or a girl could read this book and really enjoy it!!I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up.By Seth Courtney Age 13 Grade 7"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"&quot;Little Men&quot; was one of my childhood favorites (I found &quot;Little Women&quot; too sad), and I was pleased to find on rereading it that it's almost as much fun for me now as it was when I was ten. Loosely plotted, it's a good bedtime book, because each chapter or couple of chapters presents a complete vignette. After all, you don't always want to be reading a book that keeps you up till all hours! Life at Plumfield is almost idyllic, with just enough conflict to keep things moving along. When I was a child, I longed for a museum like theirs, and a miniature cast-iron stove, and all kinds of things--the book was wonderful for my imagination. N.B.: I tried reading it to my boys, and even though it's about boys, they were bored, so it may be a girl book."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is the continuation of Little Women, and Jo's Boys will be the cont. of this book. Little Men is a book about the boys and girls of all ages, and if you thought little women was much about women, READ THIS BOOK. The boys are all different ages.

These young men and women will be so different, yet so together and close!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This sequel to \\"Little Women\\" continues the heart warming saga of the March family girls. It follows events in their lives as married women, and the lives of their children. This book seems to be more popular with boy readers than \\"Little Women\\", which often appeals to girls between the ages of 11-15 (depending on their individual reading level). Perhaps this is linked to the fact that there are more main characters who are boys in \\"Little Men\\". The innocent quality of romance and adventure in this plot, as well as the emphasis on morality and family relationships, make this a good gift for those concerned about the types of literature their children are reading. Adults buying this for children should note that the moral aspects of the story generally reinforce 19th century Protestant Christian values (its your choice whether that impacts your purchase or not!).This is another book that has continued to be my favorite 20 years after reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really liked this book because it was really exciting and fun all at the same time!

But Little Men, was written exceptionally well!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Though I read Little Women many times as a girl and just again recently, I hadn't ever read Little Men. I recnetly purchased the book so I could find out what happens to the March family. The story begins slowly (even for 19th century literature) and I found myself wondering if Louisa May Alcott actually wrote it-the style seemed so different. However, as I became more involved in the book Alcott's old charm comes through. I enjoyed a thouroughly delightful tale. Little Men continues with the story of Plumfield and introduces all of Jo's boys. It is a must read for any Alcott fan!!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I loved Little Women and this book just confirms what a wonderful writer she was. Lots of hidden truths and wisdoms."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"The power of Louisa May Alcott's twisting, turning, diving and jumping plot comes from her use of vivid detail and her understanding of what really makes a good story. Her characters carry a reality with them that makes each scene come alive.

That is, I read every one of her novels every year. Her books are definatly age oriented-you'll hate them if you're over 11 yrs. old.

Hehe, well, in my opinion anyway. If you liked Little Women, you should read Little Men. If you thought that Little Women was too girly or feminine, read Little Men. There's not too much femininism (if that is a word) in this book, and it's good to boot, hehe."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Who else would have liked to see the \\"hoyden\\" (read: assertive girl) Nan punch that simpering, girly-girly little twit Bess right in her lisping mouth?"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Little Men, is an average book. The whole story is about all these little orphans. There was Nat, Demi, Tommy, Dan, Franz, Emil, Ted, and little Rob. There was more but the girls are all stupid.

She would recommend it to anyone, and if I don't read it before hand that after I have children of my own she will give me the book and tell me to read it.She wished she had read it many years ago when I was younger because the examples of how to help little boys to become young men where amazing."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Mention the name Louisa May Alcott, and most people will instantly think of \\"Little Women.\\" But in my mind, the less often discussed \\"Little Men\\" is just as great, if not better.The story picks up shortly after the conclusion of \\"Little Women,\\" with Jo and Frederick Bhaer running a school at Plumfield. Along with their own little Rob and Teddy, they are busy raising the neglected children of rich folks alongside the orphans they have taken in.While the boys exist in a virtual haven for good ol' fashioned fun upon the farmlike Plumfield, Mother and Father Bhaer still manage to teach them moral life lessons along with their classroom exercises.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \\"Jo's Boys,\\" which takes place ten years after \\"Little Men\\" and concludes the boys' stories."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I really enjoyed this book. i don't like to re-read books because i know what will happen, but i did re-read Little Men.

Sometimes the style of it is annoying and at times the characters unrealistic, and I find myself longing for the more natural tone of Little Women.

The philosophy is to provide lots of love, understanding, forgiveness, slack and carefully chosen incentives and guidance while encouraging friendships among youngsters who will balance one another out if they spend time together. You'll recognize lots of Marmee's loving approach in Jo's more rough and tumble perspective. It's a nice combination.For those who loved the child-centered world of Little Women, you'll be entranced by what Jo does to educate and raise her own boys, her nephew and niece, a troublesome neighbor girl, male boarders and some unfortunate orphans.Much of the novel focuses on the character development of two poor orphans, Nat and Dan, who find Jo's Plumfield (which she inherited near the end of Little Women) to be an unfamiliar paradise of a home and school that requires some adjusting to.Although the title is Little Men, there's plenty of focus on Daisy, twin sister to Demi, Nan, an independent girl with lots of energy, and Bess, Amy and Laurie's daughter. There are pretend balls, teas, and dramatic performances that echo those in Little Women.But the male slant that is subdued in Little Women bursts forth in Little Men as the book recounts pranks, brawls, collections of disgusting items, pillow fights, taming a colt and doing heavy chores.Like Little Women, the chapters are really short stories involving the same characters as they progress from month to month.If you haven't read Little Women, by all means start there. An important part of the fun of Little Men is finding out what happened next to Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I have read Little Men a dozen times over and each time I either find something new...or just love the parts I already read! It is excellent, with great morals, and true-to-life characters."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"There is not that much to say about this brilliantly crafted book, for it is almost too good to describe. I decided to give this book four stars because in some cases she didn't write as enthusiaticly as in her other books. Don't get me wrong though, as a book, it deserves ten stars! As a Louisa May book, only four (out of five that is!) I cannot write to you, reader, too much about the sumery because every chapter was a new scrape or story. But don't worry, everything is connected. Jo March from Little Women now is married and has two boys of her own, plus a few orphans and sons of busy fathers. In Plumfield, boys are every where, including the musical Nat, book worm Demi Brooke, indestructable Tommy, Dan, adorable Teddy, and deticated Rob! But don't forget the three girls: timid Daisy Brooke, Giddy-Gaddy Nan, and the loveable Bess. All share scrapes and adventures that will leave you scandalized. Jo and her husband have a lot in store for them! Plus, a hint of romance at the end. Look for the sequal, Jo's Boys!

Sincerly, A grateful reader."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I loved Little Men ! I didn't care for Little Women, but Little Men is a book I hope to read to my kids. I read it after seeing the video. The book is a lot more detailed and interesting. I just think it is the greatest and can't wait to read Jo's Boys! P.S. I am not 1, but I don't want to share my age"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I read Little Men; the sequel to the classic tale of Little Women. Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Men, Little Women, Country Cousins, Eight Cousins or the Aunt Hill, and Jo's Boys was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where she did all her writing. As she got older she suffered the loss of her two sisters, both at a young age. In her books she basis her characters on herself and on people she knew, including her three sisters, her mother, and her father. Overall, she had a happy life of writing, though she never got married. Little Men was first published in 1871 by the Nelson Doubleday, Inc. This book is about life at Plumfield; the school Jo Bhaer and her husband Fritz founded. Their school allows boys (and some select girls) from all locks of life into it. Because of this reason it has become well known by many people for its kindness to all. The Bhaers show great love to every child who comes through, including boys from the street, Jo's own nieces and nephews, and her own children. They treat each boy the same and give them their own jobs to do around the farm. In turn, each child learns responsibility, respect, patients, and love at Plumfield, unlike any other school.Plumfield has many residents, but only some are characters in this book Jo Bhaer was the hero in Little Women, who ends up marries the German professor, Fritz Bhaer. She is lively as ever caring for the boys and girls of Plumfield including her own sons Teddy and Rob. Mrs. Bhaer is a gentle, caring woman who loves each child as her own. In turn the boys and girls teach her that not all lessons are learned in the classroom, in fact some are learned and she doesn't even realize it. Fritz Bhaer is a kind German professor who has a very heavy accent. He teaches the children all the regular subjects like math, science, arithmetic, and history. Father Bhaer also teaches lessons on growing crops and cultivating them, taking care of animals, and helps each child on their mishaps. For all these reasons, the boys and girls love Father Bhaer, and help him in any way they can.Nathaniel (Nat) Blake, one of the boys taken off the street and given a second chance at Plumfield. In the beginning he is a weak and sickly boy who is sent to Plumfield by Mr. Laurie, a dear friend of Jo's. When he gets their he does not now how to read or write. Gradually, kindness and determination help Nat to get stronger, less sickly, become a great reader, and an unusually good writer.Tommy Bangs, one of the boys who goes to Plumfield. He is the biggest troublemaker there, but has a kind heart so everyone can't help but love him. Overtime, he becomes less troublesome, and helps out more than anyone expected. Daisy and Demi, Jo's sister's kids also go to Plumfiled. They are very kind to each other and to everyone else. Daisy loves to play with dolls and cook for the residents of the school. Demi is a very smart boy, who listened to every one of his grandfather's stories, as a small boy. He learned a lot of his knowledge from those stories. He does have a downfall though. He loves to read, but he reads action books when he should be reading and studying for school. Father Bhaer breaks this habit quite easily when he finds out.On the street Nat met many people, including a sluggish boy Dan who was nice to him. Dan ends up coming to the school also. He is not the best boy to make friends with, because he makes a lot of trouble. As the book goes on Dan gets cured from these bad ways by Father Bhaer and becomes a very nice, gentle boy. The second female resident of Plumfield is named Nan. She is nothing like Daisy or like most girls. Nan will take dares from anyone and do them, no matter how dangerous they may be! Daisy would love another girl who would play dolls and cook with her. By the end of the book, Daisy persuades Nan to play dolls with her. Nan agrees. After they play dolls Nan starts to be more girlish, but in the end she still does dangerous things.Little Men takes place in the late 1800s in Concord, Massachusetts. At this time slavery was still in the south. The children of Plumfield had all been sent there to board, for one reason or another. Nat and Dan were sent there because they were on the streets. Nan's mother had just died and her father couldn't afford to take proper care of her anymore. Tommy's parents did not want to deal with his pranks. Daisy and Demi wanted to go to the school where their aunt and uncle taught. A boy named Jack Ford was sent there because it was cheap, and there were other reasons for the boys that come later in the book.Little Men starts out when Mr. Laurie (one of Jo's old friends) sees Nat on the streets and sends him to Plumfield, the school run by Jo and Fritz Baher. When the door to Plumfield is answered by Asia the house maid, Nat can't help but stare at all the boys playing on the staircase, floor, and sliding down the banisters. One boy slides down the banister and lands hard on his rear. Nat rushes over to make sure he is all right. The boy says he's fine and introduces himself as Tommy Bangs. Then Mrs. Jo appears. She asks to see Nat by himself. They go into a side room and Mrs. Jo then tells Nat she will be happy to have him at their school.Nat rests the first day and night he is there. The next day is Monday, the first day of school. Fritz Bhaer teaches the boys at school and he treats Nat with special care since Nat can't read or write. Nat does fine his first day. He then knows that he must work hard to please his new family, and he will do it willingly in between chores and play. All the boys were taught but Daisy would not be permitted. As a result, she was not allowed to play football, or other games the boys played. Mrs. Jo felt sorry for the little girl, so, her and Mr. Laurie go and buy a whole kitchen set for her. She adores it, and will cook anything for anyone. The boys get jealous and eventually allow her to play with them, if she cooks special treats for them. Daisy agrees, and once again Plumfield was at peace.In the middle of the book, Nat's \\"dear friend\\" Dan comes for a visit. Nat pleads with Mrs. Bhaer that Dan can stay. She isn't quite sure she trusts Dan, but she agrees that he can stay. Dan ends up bringing trouble to the school by fighting the other boys, smoking tobacco, (which was strictly prohibited by the school), and setting the Plumfield on fire by not putting out his cigarette. Dan is sent to live with another boarding school for bad children like him. Meanwhile, since Dan was sent away, they have an extra bed to spare. Mrs. Jo meets a man in town whose wife has just died and doesn't want to take care of his daughter named Nan anymore. She comes to Plumfield and she fits right in with the boys better than Daisy. Daisy is heartbroken that there is finally another girl at the school, but doesn't want to play dolls and cook. She pleads and pleads with Nan and finally Nan plays with her. Nan finds out that dolls and cooking aren't that bad and she decides to do it with Daisy more often.Nan and Daisy were cooking one day and they had an idea to have a ball. They invited Nat, Tommy, and Demi. The boys agreed to come if there would be food, and of course there would be. The boys get to the ball and everyone starts dancing. Then they sit down to have tea and pastries. When they all sat down Daisy realized that the pastries were missing! Tommy had hidden them and would not tell where he had hidden them. Nan and Daisy became furious, and ran to get Mrs. Jo. When they told her what happened she did not punish the boys. Instead, she, and the girls would not talk to the boys until they said they were sorry. They finally apologized and the girls forgave them. The night after Mrs. Jo had just came back from town and saw a straw hat and a hand sticking out from a hay bale. She gently pushed the hay aside and saw that it was Dan! He had come back! She awoke him softly and he said, \\"Mother Bhaer, I have come home.\\" Those words touched her heart and carried him into Plumfield where he made a full recovery of his broken foot and tiredness.Towards the end of the book, the children of Plumfield go huckleberry picking. Mrs. Jo doesn't want five-year-old Rob to go but Nan pleads that she'll take care of him. Mrs. Jo gives in. All the children are picking berries peacefully, until Nan and Rob say they are going to a secret spot. They go into the woods and loose their way back. Nan starts to panic, for night is coming soon, and Rob starts to cry because he is scared. Thankfully, they are found before a bear found them. Little Bess, Jo's niece comes for a visit and is treated like a little princess by all the boys. There was some peace between them all. While she is there, they put on an end of school year play. This year it is Cinderella. All the children dress up like the characters in the book and put on a magnificent play. Everyone claps and awards flowers to Mrs. Jo. They finish off the book by having a gigantic feast.In the beginning of the book Father Bhaer tells each boy he is a crop that is growing in his garden. At the end of the year, if they are all good and whole Father did a good job furnishing them. As in all plants, the boys had weeds growing that tried to stop the way, and some of them did for a time. Nat told a lie, Jack stole Tommy's money, Tommy hid Daisy's pastries, and Demi read the wrong books at the wrong time. In the end, though there were some weeds, Father Bhaer had a very successful cultivation, and looked forward to new plants next year."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is an amazing book that I think everyone should read!if only we were this kind and thoughtful to the people in this life!!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This is such a fun book to read.

I got all the companion ones to this one, plus several other similar ones.I won't review the actual \\"book\\", because it should be extremely well-known, as one of the most beloved American authors did her usual great job.My review is of the Kindle version of this and the other similar items. Although \\"print books\\" these days have many errors in proofreading, punctuation, spelling, etc., the Kindle versions of ALL of these books is DEPLORABLE. Missing words, misspelled words, terrible punctuation, missing paragraph indicators--the list goes on and on. The wretched result is a product which is virtually unreadable unless you are already familiar with the book and know what it is SUPPOSED to say.I have seen some of the same issues creeping into Kindle books that are brand new on the market as well. I don't want to get free books, or cheap books if they are unreadable, and I don't want to purchase new books for a Kindle (for a price higher than I can buy that book at Costco) that are so badly reproduced.That said, enjoy the story (if you can figure out what it is SUPPOSED to say)."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I am 76 years old and reading is a passion. Since the Kindle I have enjoyed numerous books for free. i grew up on Little Women. Have loved that story in print and in movies for as long as I can remember. June Allyson will always be Jo in my mind and heart. It dawned on me as i was looking through titles that I do not remember Little Men. In fact, for one who grew up reading, and loving it, i do not remember ever reading Little Men. So since it cost me nothing, i decided to download it and give it a try. I was transported back in time to a kinder, gentler, era where characters became family once again and stories became new and at the same time familiar. I still don't know if I ever read Little Men growing up but I lost myself in it at this age. Louisa Mae Alcott lived again in my heart and in my head.

Although fiction, it describes life in the 19th century quite well. It talks about poorhouses, running away from home (or boarding school in this case), sacrifices made for friendship, the sorrow of death (in a kind way), homemade fun, etc. It's also wildly funny in places; the chapter \\"In the Willow\\" is my favorite because of the witty things the children say. In some ways, I liked it better than \\"Little Women\\" because the cultural references were easier to undertand."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"an awesome read for any lover of classics.

But, in a way that is refreshing.I still think that the sacrifice of the toys was slightly funny and I'm still very much impressed by the unique parenting/leadership skills of the now adult Jo and her husband.Without giving away the entire plot, I'll say that it's about a school they run out of their house and it doesn't have a nice neat plotline.Now may I add: This version is amazing, the discussion questions in the back enhanced my reading immensely and I got so much more from the story then I would have. Also the illustartions are lovely. This book (compared to other's from it's era) is very revolutionary, and full of love for all humanity, even if their are: ethnical differences, age differences, wealth differences, and gender differences"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"Well, this book always will remain among my favorites, one that touches me and makes me feel. I think that when I was little, I saw a cartoon series about it. At that time, I didnt know that it was based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott. The success of this stories is the wide ranges of characters shown in this book, the spirit, moral conduct, inner strength, and most of all, the splash of fun and careless boyish pranks. THe setting is great, and I like to see how the old characters are developed, as well as the new. Strangely, my favorite character out of all the interesting ones was Dan, Jo's favorite firebrand. I liked how behind his rough nature and blazing dark eyes, and careless attitude, there is gentlenes, courage, and inner strength which Jo gradually brings out of him. And needless to say, Dan is a black sheep that Jo continues to cling on to. Yet, I liked the others as well, including rascal TOmmy, music loving Nat (especially how loyal Dan is to him), tomboy Nan, thoughtful Demi, little and big Teddy, (and Amy, who I am one of those rare people that wanted her to get with Laurie,) and adorable little Bess. All these heartwarming characters create a fire in the story which really warms me up. I've read Jo's Boys, and I like Little Men better because I can feel the spirit of things. Jo's Boys made me feel depressed. SO, this is a great book and surprizingly, the tone was very different from LIttle Women (which I liked greatly) and I just think that the firebrand is the most dashing character in it. He kind of reminds me of Laurie, except in a different, stronger way. Jo's Boys made me sad that all was to an end."},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"This book is very heartwarming, and, at times, funny. The characters seem real, and Louisa May Alcott portrayed the girls, Nan and Daisy, very realistically-one a tomboy, one a \\"girl\\".

This is an excellent book...get it!"},{"Title":"Little Men","review":"I read this book 14 years ago and I can still remember how I felt while I was reading it.

I read all of these books as a child, and the additional Alcott books as well.To satisfy a reading challenge, I have decided to reread some of these old favorites.Little Menwas delightful, highlighting the wonderfully compassionate nature of Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, whom she met in Little Women. At the end of that book, Jo's Great-aunt March, the cranky old woman who seemed too demanding at times has left her house (Plumfield) to Jo. Now Jo and Fritz (Professor Bhaer) have opened a school for boys. Most of the boys appear to be troubled or challenged in some way. The story tells us various antics and behaviors exhibited by the boys, and displays how Jo and Fritz deal with these issues.After reading the biographyLouisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women (John MacRae Books), I could see the parallels between LMA's father's ideals and their methods in dealing with the recalcitrant boys.The book was colorfully illustrated in the edition I reread, and was reminiscent of the book I read as a child.While I would always recommend any Alcott book, I must admit thatLittle Mendid not resonate with me the wayLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)did.

Among all the other places we experienced, Ngong Hills and the Kukuyu village at the base were indeed memorable! After reading Richard Dawkins recommendation and reading about his childhood at the base of Ngong Hills I felt compelled to pick up this book. I am so happy that I did. I have never read anything as honest and straightforward as these accounts as seen through the eyes of a Kukuyu family over generations. I absolutely could not put it down. I don't think you have to have experienced it first hand to appreciate the sensibility, the mindset, the innocence and common sense, the rare and precious understanding of life and all of it's hidden mysteries. This book blew me away. Finally, someone who got it and was able to put it in writing! The author rarely makes her presence felt but for the occasional flurry of poetic descriptions. Sometimes a bit noticable which I think may be more the style of the times. Very forgivable. Above all she brings the superstitions, the charm, the naivety, the brutality of nature and the high level of ethics and morality out and clearly illustrates the horrible impact of invading armies, merchants, the outright theft of natural resources brought about by European and earlier Middle Eastern cultures. At times I laughed and at other times I was shocked and near tears. All in all it is a very successful account of a time and place where few accounts exist. Among the most charming and interesting books I've ever read. It also contains the message that we can all continue to learn from as you watch a beautifully complex culture gradually slip into disillusionment and corruption as traditions are abandoned for money and a chance to survive in a new world order that has been thrust upon them."},{"Title":"Red strangers,: A novel","review":"Although Elspeth Huxley wrote this as if it were a story, well it IS a story, its greatest value is in the description of the life of this particular Kenyan tribal group - the Kikuyu - before, during and after the arrival of Europeans. It allows us a look today at what must have been. Huxley, whose works are classics, grew up in Africa. Perhaps the eyes of this English child could reach beyond the nearly inevitable cultural taint to see in the manner of the African children she knew.This is not a typical novel in the twenty-first century sense of plot and drama; rather it chronicles \\"how things were\\" in a somewhat rambling manner. Individuals in the book do have widely differing characteristics, apparently according to the way Huxley perceived they would have developed in their own society. I particularly noticed that Huxley presents aspects of tribal customs without comment or judgment. Some of those will likely be offensive to socially-aware modern readers. To me, the value of the way she writes is precisely that she sees the whole picture through their (tribal) eyes. I was also struck by the sense she gives of how powerless these people must have felt as Europeans simply \\"took over\\" most parts of their lives by virtue of their superior weaponry."},{"Title":"Red strangers,: A novel","review":"'Red Strangers' is a beautifully written book following the lives of four generations of an african tribal family. The rich, descriptive language portrays the traditional ways of life so perfectly that you become completely immersed in them with the characters. In fact the description is so engrossing you fully understand the alienation and confusion the tribes felt when the red strangers from europe came and turned their worlds upside down. I really felt the anguish and upset the africans felt when told to stop living the life and traditions they had lived for generations, to change them for european ideals of what was correct and proper. I also felt the disappointment and anger at the elders when they say their children embrace aspects of the european life and leave their heritage behind. This story is epic in it's scope and one you start reading you will find it very hard to put down, as you will want to find out what happens next. This is one of those rare books that will stay with you for a long time after reading and leaves you better for having read it. Highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Red strangers,: A novel","review":"The book Red Strangers is about a savannah tribe and the people in it. It focuses on one family in particular in which there are two boys, (this is where the names get mixed up) the older son is Muthengi, and the younger on is Matu. Muthengi is a warrior, where as Matu was sick as a boy, and he never really fully recovered. This book demonstrates the concept of ethnocentism, because the white people judge the tribes way of life by their own standards and don't even give the tribes people a chance. The tribesmen spend alot of time slaughtering goats, and going on journeys."},{"Title":"Red strangers,: A novel","review":"This book was really confusing and I do not recommend it for young adults."},{"Title":"The Viscount (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Excellent -- Here is a sassy female besting her fears.Lady Lily Bradshaw, a widow with a son to protect, finds herself in Bedlam.

My only complain is the quality of the paper which is very low, like mass-market paperback it resembles newspaper in texture and smell. There is a section of the book that reproduces some of his engravings in black and white, which is but a shadow of Blake's grandiose visual imagery.If you want to sample some of this authors work on a budget, to see if you like it, then this book may be for you. But for Blake lovers there are better volumes, of complete works, some of them illustrated in color. That's what I will be purchasing next."},{"Title":"The Portable William Blake","review":"The best of William Blake (and then some!), taken off the shelf, dusted off and propped up for the rest of eternity to consider. From the aphorisms of &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; (required reading) to the later prophetic books, it's Blake in all of his...Blakeness. And let's give a hand to Kazin for his fantastic Introduction to one of the heavy-hitters of the Western tradition."},{"Title":"The Portable William Blake","review":"Alfred Kazin in his introduction to this work stresses the loneliness of Blake in his own world and time. Blake was one of the very few great masters as visual and as literary artist. But he was largely neglected in his own time and his works went largely unsold. Despite this loneliness and rejection he forged a vision of the world. As literary artist Blake was a supreme master of the Poetry of Childhood. His 'Songs of Innocence and Experience' are far greater works than his longer Poems of Prophecy. Blake did not understand this , any more than he understood that he lacked any real gift as Dramatic Artist and was primarily a romantic lyric poet. As Kazin points out Blake had little interest in History and little in the process of character transformation through experience. His characters are Abstract Qualities like the Accuser Satan the guilt- causing Urizen. Blake mixes the archaic Biblical scenes with scenes of modern life. He seems to live in a 'now' of his own creation. Blake's relation to marriage and sexuality were an important part of his work. Sin was bound up with hiddenness and forbiddeness. Kazin claims that Blake's marriage was not as ideal as made out in legend.This Anthology contains the major literary works of Blake, and the excellent introduction by Kazin. I recommend focusing on the 'good parts' and avoiding insofar as possible the mythologizing abstractions of much of Blake's Prophetic and Dramatic poetry."},{"Title":"The Portable William Blake","review":"Francis Bacon, David Hume, Bishop Berkeley, John Locke, Edmund Burke; just a few of British philososphers. Some, like Burke and to some extant Hume are very tiresome and repulsive if one were to view them in a Nietzschean light. Other philosophers like Bertrand Russell, I loathe. Adam Smith and Thomas Carlyle: the former a crafty swindler who discovered clever ways to exploit the massess and cheat an honest man, the latter an insipid moron who boasted to the world that he was an atheist liberal who supported slavery.British philososphy is not very exciting with such hum drum guys like the Locke who have a tiresome system of rationalizing every aspect of existence and smug bitter atheist[..]like Russell. It seems that British philosophy is dryer than dust.Until one discoveres Blake...William Blake (1757 - 1827), at once the purest philosopher, the most facinating figure, the greatest painter and most perfect poets ever set forth from Britain. Blake almost in the immense impressivness of his art and poetry to not be British, yet he is. Really the only true poet in the English language, the only true philosopher from Britain, for all true philosophers are poets and all true poets, philosophers. Blake is truly a noble soulI read The Marriage of Heaven and Hell about a month ago. I am certain that it is one of those rare pieces of art that appears in literature; a beautiful work of art that appears so before its time (we seem only to begin to catch up to Blake in English) so before its time like the novels of Dostoevsky, especially Notes from Underground, lyrically Dostoevsky at his best, but my great Russian Brother is not the subject of this.William Blake is the perfect embodiment of the Dionysian in art and literature. His works, such as the illustrations of Milton and especially Dante are the most beautiful paintings by an British hand. Particularly in the case of his illustration of the gates of Hell. This perfect haunting beauty is my ideal. Haunting in its depth of artistry, haunting in its appearence with Vergil looking at Dante in an ominous and yet celebratory way. One simply does not know. The mystery is half of Blake's magnificence and perfection.Blake understands that many questions are left unanswered and that is my stand. I agree with him and Nietzsche when he is against the neo-classical ideal of rational explanations of every aspect of existence. I loathe many philosophers. Silence all who dare to cheapen our beautiful illusions."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"If you're a huge Jennifer Crusie fan, like I am, this book will probably be a big disappointment. If you haven't read her books before, and just want a quick beach read, I suspect this novel will also be a letdown. With its mish-mash, confusing suspense plot, meandering narrative, and bland or unlikeable supporting characters, there's not much to get excited about in *Don't Look Down.*The hero and heroine are intriguing, and they also have chemistry, but their love story is disjointed, full of fits and starts, and ultimately unsatisfying, despite two well-written love scenes. In fact, the wasted potential of the romance is probably what disappointed me most of all. Jennifer Crusie is perhaps the best contemporary romance writer out there-- maybe behind Susan Elizabeth Phillips-- so I couldn't shake the feeling that this book could have been wonderful if she'd simply written her typical romance with a dash of suspense.Some positives: the writing is seamless; I really couldn't tell who wrote what most of the time. And there are some some witty moments, like the Wonder Woman party. You can tell the authors had fun but unfortunately, that fun didn't translate for me into a good read."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This book is a valiant attempt at merging genres: Mystery/Action and Contemporary Romance Novels. There have been successful novels that mix these genres, but this book is not one of them.Reading this book was a little bit like watching two people waltzing when both are trying to lead. One of the genres should have taken precedence and been allowed to control the pace and timing. Instead, both genres speed along at full throttle and the result is a cacophony of brilliant action scenes, zippy dialogue, sexy love scenes and cumbersome plot devices, each drowning the others out until none of the very excellent writing here can be appreciated. This is a shame, as Bob Mayer, well known for his military novels, holds his own with Crusie. This is no small feat as Crusie is a master of dialogue and character development. Both authors have created a strong common voice, but they have too much to say. This book could have been fantastic if it had a discernable story arc, appropriate pacing, and if the authors or editors had been willing to cut one third of the events this book contains. Instead it sags under it's own weight, and fails to be the credit it ought to be to both authors."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I was a bit put off by some of the reviews I'd read but I have to say, this is a great book and I'm glad I ignored them and read it. This one is not a traditional romance. In fact, it breaks several romance rules which is just wonderful. I have to admit that I was wary about Mayer, I mean, an ex green beret writing romance? Would Crusie's voice get lost?Their voices work excellently together. I needn't have worried, Crusie's trademark humor and great dialog is here. She writes Lucy's perspective and Mayer writes JT's perspective. It's pretty darned seamless I have to say. JT is very likeable but he's a guy and clearly written by one, which is refreshing in a romance because we don't often get that perspective and many men who write romance try to do it with a woman's voice, which makes it awkward, IMO.JT is a dude, totally. He's special forces and all of the scenes with weapons and any kind of tactical stuff is very technical and accurate. I know some people were put off by that, I on the other hand, dug it and feel like if you're going to put stuff like that in your book it should be accurate. It made JT even more sexy god help me, LOL. Mayer's expertise shows in that aspect and I thought it worked well. There were way more action scenes than you'd normally see in a romance, but again as I said, I think the book broke rules that needed to be broken so good for them.The sex/chemistry was really well done. But they're adults with responsibilities and that's handled well too. JT and Lucy as a couple was believable and not forced.Crusie's Lucy is the kind of heroine I wish we saw more of. She's strong and smart and self sufficient but not written so overly \\"plucky\\" that you hate her and think she's a dumabass for not accepting help from the hero. When she gets mad it's for a reason and a believable one. When she does stuff you don't wrinkle your nose in disgust.A few nits to pick because I'm that way - I am a big fan of lots of secondary characters but by the end of the book I had to pause several times to figure out who was what and why. It got to be overwhelming.There was a bit of a problem with me and the \\"reason\\" for the caper. Without spoiling, I'll just say it was a bit thin.The bad guys? Well, a few of them I thought were \\"too\\" bad when they start out as sort of affable jerks. It's a big jump from affable jerk to multi murderer I think. There'd better be a good reason and in this case, I saw none.Daisy, Lucy's sister - the only reason I was able to get past her behavior is because Crusie makes it clear it's an abberation and she starts to straighten out. But when you write a kid into a book and a parent is messed up, it's bound to raise hackles. It raised mine. But again, in the end, Crusie pulled it off but I still didn't like Daisy.In any case, brava/o to Crusie and Mayer for taking a chance and making it work. Oh and for breaking rules. Cause most rules are made to be broken, especially in romance."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Ryan's ReviewI have read about.. hmn.. 6 of jennifer crusie's books and when i did read them, I read them back to back, devouring those suckers. If there is one thing i love in a book, it is witty banter. I fell in love with the clueless males in her books and loved the wit of her female characters. There was always something to make me laugh. So when I saw this book at my favorite used book store, I snatched it up thinking: bring on the funny/sexy romance.Aaaand I got cute thriller. I mean, don't get me wrong, Lucy was pretty cool. I did not love J.T. I liked him ok, but I did not fall in love with him like all of Crusie's other leading men. Since I am a fan of some thrillers, I was still able to enjoy the book. But only because there was a little romance. I never learned what J.T. stood for and all of the characters in the book had a bad attitude with the exception of a few. I loved Pepper, Lucy's neice. she was freaking adorable, but really spoiled. Her mother.... was a weak and semi unlikable character, but since she kind of had a reason, i guess it was ok.The character of Conner kind of confused me. I mean.. 12 years ago he loved Lucy but cheated. But during all the time after he had been like a big brother to Lucy's sister. alright. and now he acts like he really wants Lucy back and like he really loves her, apologizing. She says that he was a totally different person from 12 years ago. now he seems cold. We never get an explanation as to his change of personality. And at the end, he says he does not want Lucy. I mean why were you even chasing her then, getting jealous. crazy Australian military man.I still want to know J.T. Wilder's name.There was no where near as much witty banter in this book. It was not as funny as the others, but it was ok. :) If i had gone into the book, knowing it was going to be so different from all her others, I believe I would have enjoyed it more. I should have counted on it since it was coauthored. I will be more prepared next time. And I still love her books and am a big fan. I loved the little alligators all over the inside of the dust cover. just throwing that out there. they are so adorable (sorry. I love alligators.) that's all folks. :)"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"She never should have trusted Connor Nash. It's not like she didn't know he was a schemer and a liar and a cheat. After all, she was married to him, once upon a time. Then again, Connor Nash isn't the reason Lucy Armstrong took this job. When he'd called her up and offered her big money to direct the last four days of shooting on a feature film, Lucy's answer wasn't just 'no,' it was 'hell, no.' Then her sister Daisy, who just happens to be the script supervisor on the movie, had called and begged Lucy - and just to top things off, Lucy's niece Pepper got on the phone and actually cried. So of course, Lucy said yes. She had to keep reminding herself that Daisy and Pepper were the reason she agreed to this farce. But still, she should have realized that Connor was up to something.This was supposed to be a cake walk for Captain J.T. Wilder. Who wouldn't jump at the chance to be some actor's stunt double for four days. J.T. figured he'd do a little work, make some money, maybe get laid by some actress. Easy-peasy. Especially considering his full-time job is in the U.S. Army Special Forces. It only takes one look around the movie set though and J.T. is reassessing his decision. It's like a giant anthill that someone has just kicked over. What's more, he's pretty sure something else is going on here, he just isn't sure what.What with the script that doesn't make sense, the slapstick comedian trying too hard to be an action hero and the film crew that has all too clearly lost interest in making this movie, Lucy does not have any spare time for a grim, monosyllabic Green Beret. On the other hand, J.T.'s very presence on the set is an obvious irritant to Connor, which means she's all for having him stay. J.T. came for easy money and easier starlets, but he's finding himself irresistibly pulled to the director, she of the more than passing resemblance to Wonder Woman. If he could just figure out who is trying to kill this movie - literally - maybe he could be a hero to Lucy.It's been pretty well established in earlier reviews that I love Jennifer Crusie. What's not to love? Her books are funny, romantic, well plotted and extremely well-written. That being said, I wasn't sure what to expect from a book where she was a co-author, but I shouldn't have worried. This was a great read - J.T. and Lucy were strong, independent people and I loved seeing them come together. Don't Look Down had all of the best attributes of a Jennifer Crusie novel - I laughed out loud several times - and the action/suspense scenes were fabulous. As icing on the cake, I learned a little something about film-making, and quite a bit about Wonder Woman, to boot. Don't Look Down was a blast!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This is a great book, I loved it. Even bought a second to send to my sister because I didn't want to lose my copy.

The writing was overworked and self-conscious, and lacked any real humor. I guess this author combination just didn't work. I couldn't get attached to any of the characters, even the \\"spunky kid\\" who was clearly thrown in there to give a little life to a soulless character list. After about 100 pages, I asked myself why I was bothering continuing a book that I found so completely uninteresting--and promptly put it down."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"My daughter-in-love gave me the second book by these two authors and I loved the feisty, intelligent heroine, the good looking (of course) good guy and the assorted nutty characters and family members. So I went online to see if they'd written anything else and I found their first collaboration, \\"Don't Look Down.\\" Another totally delightful book. The humor, the lead characters, the assorted nutty characters, really terrific. This one dealt with a dog food producer brought to a movie site to do four days of action scenes. Scenes that originally weren't in the movie.As the hours slip by you'll be mesmerized by the good, the bad and the questionable as they slog their way through the movie with many other highlights thrown in along with a red herring or two.I plan to get any other books these two write together, because they are a dynamite team. My daughter-in-love (an ex-daughter-in-law) agrees with me. Not only do we get to enjoy the books, but we get to talk about them, too."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm a big Jennifer Crusie fan. I have never read a book by Bob Mayer. I must say, that I was kind of disappointed by \\"Don't Look Down\\". The story has the usual Jennifer Crusie style, but the writing did not. I was confused 30% of the time because what followed did not make sense. In the end, I'm not even sure if some of the good guy is a bad guy or not. Some scenes did not make sense either. I would recommend reading her older books if you're looking for something a lot more funny, exciting and racy. My favorite is \\"Drive Me Crazy\\"."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Jennifer Crusie novels are not the appropriate place for the technical specifications of a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. I loved all the Crusie novels before this one because the dialogue is so witty it made me laugh out loud. Not this book. There's one cute line from the child in the story and that's it. I can't believe Bob Mayer messed up Crusie's writing this much. It was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I just read a bunch of reviews and was surprised by the negative ones. First of all, this is a collaboration not a typical Crusie or typical Doherty.It is fiction, not reality, so the timelines shouldn't be such an issue, nor the plot for that matter. Of course it needs to be somewhat believeable as far as characters staying true to themselves - which they do. People are complaining that the hero slept with someone other than the hero is interesting to me. In Crusie's Fast Women, the heroine slept with the hero's best friend/business partner/cousin before she hooked up with the hero. And I loved it because that was what would have happened to those characters under those conditions. Did Crusie lose readers for that? Are those the same readers that don't appreciate the hero in Don't Look Down sleeping with the actress first?I am a fan of both Crusie and Mayer. Their collaboration hit the high point of both of their talents as far as I'm concerned. I read Don't Look Down in two sittings and immediately started looking for their next book.This is the first effort by this team. As they grow together, I expect it will only get better. But the first effort was more than good enough.Entertainment is subjective. It's natural that the book wouldn't appeal to everyone. Even loyal fans who want to see their author stay the same and not branch out into something new and different."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Complaining that Don't Look Down is not a typical Crusie novel is like saying that a triple rich mocha chocolate raspberry mousse with whipped cream and a cherry on top is not a Hersheys bar. Those who have grown comfortable with the formulaic girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy back and lives happily ever after of the standard romance novel will perhaps have difficulty comprehending this delightful blend of witty romance and suspenseful action adventure.Lucy, the heroine, is a competent, take charge, look out for everyone else kind of woman who is suddenly faced with a situation in which she can't protect the ones she loves. Is it an unrealistic situation? Sure, but this is fiction, meant to entertain. It is not a factual recitation of what happened last week to your neighbor down the street. JT is a refreshing change from the cliched hero who walks onto page one with his only flaw being that he doesn't immediately understand he is in love with the heroine. He, too, is a take charge kind of guy; he just wants to get the job done and go home. Instead he finds himself drawn into the lives and troubles of other people, and falling in love.The secondary characters are finely drawn, from the heartbreakingly precocious Pepper, trying to be the grownup her mother is not, to the charmingly misbehaved LeFavre who, for all his recklessness, is the definition of loyalty and backs up our hero when needed.Crusie and Mayer are to be congratulated for this well-written, highly entertaining blend of genres and voices. Nothing wrong with Hersheys bars, I love those too, but I'll eagerly await the next Crusie/Mayer creation. And don't forget the cherry on top."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I am a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie books. I've read almost all of them, and really enjoyed them, albeit some more than others. But compared to her other books, this was awful. It was choppy. It didn't flow at all. About 3 chapters from the end they throw in a character's name that they had never previously discussed. Several times I even found grammar errors in the writing. My advise to Ms. Crusie: please ditch Bob Mayer and continue to write solo. My advise to the readers: read some of her other books. They are awesome (esp. Bet Me, Fast Women, Welcome to Temptation)!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Holy cow--I trusted this author and bought a HARDBACK book--me-- who doesn't even buy trade paperbacks because of the higher costand was I tricked! Jennifer Cruise is a great author and having read all of her books, at least one is always at the ready to read at the end of that rotten day for a happy ending. I don't know who THIS GUY is she felt she needed to write with, but he brings little to the party, but, I suspect, a higher cover price. Any of her books are a much better choice than this foolish story that perpetuates the worst stereotypes about \\"romance\\" books. One of the most annoying components was the deluge of characters introduced solely by dialogue in thefirst 50 or so pages. That meant I had to constantly flip back and forth through the pages to see who was saying what to whom! Grrr! Buy three of her earlier paperbacks for what you spend on this hardback and have a much better time. This book is a mess!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm not a fan of romance in general, but I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie. She's a brilliant writer. What induced her to participate in this project? There are holes in this plot big enough to drive a truck through? Where shall I start? Let's see...Pepper is supposed to be five years old, but her vocabulary and general demeanor usually seem quite a bit older. Early in the book, she talks about alligators, how they're dangerous, how they should be avoided. She then decides to take a walk in the swamp looking for a \\"mole.\\" I don't think so. Connor Nash seems startled and even hurt at Lucy's frrequent rejections. It's then revealed that he doesn't care about her at all. Then why ask her there? They needed a director, but they didn't need her. And if Connor is so egocentric, what of the frequently stated claim that he cares for and takes care of Daisy? And why does he do so? Is he Pepper's father? This fact is never revealed. A number of the actors are revealed near the end to be in on the plot. This makes no sense at all. They're legitimate actors, even stars. Their career opportunities (and earning potential) are obviously larger without getting involved in crime. And the plot itself...all this effort to justify a helicopter flight in order to rendezvous with a bad guy. Why not just rendezvous with the bad guy? In addition to the plot problems, the characters are poorly developed and the dialogue, while adequate, does not come up to the level of Crusie's former books. Bottom line--dump Bob Mayer. You're better without him."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie. She has written some wonderful, engaging books. This isn't one of them. I read the whole book and now wish I hadn't wasted my time. I had to read the first chapter twice just to figure out who all of the characters were. Anyway, between the weak character development (which is one of Crusie's strengths) and the macho military jargon to the Wonder Woman plot line, the whole thing was simply awful. I will not give up on Crusie, she's too wonderful, but this was awful."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I personally think both Jennifer Crusie and Bob Mayer are excellent writers. You could easily tell when Jenny was writing a scene and when Bob wrote one. I liked the differences in their individual writing styles.It wasn't the writing, but the plot and story line that I just couldn't get into and I could really have cared less about the characters. The only one I really liked was Pepper. Everything happens within four days and it just seemed so rushed to me it was hard to follow.I didn't get into the Lucy and J.T. relationship either. The fact that he sleeps with one woman one day and turns around and sleeps with Lucy two days later made me think J.T. was a creep. I'm not sure this was supposed to be a romance, though. If not, it succeeded."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Yup, just like the Special Forces hero in the book, I can also use those cute little \\"secret\\" euphemisms. Most of us can. That's one of the many problems in this novel. It is assumed we are all ignorant of Military terminology and procedures so we are treated to long lessons in how to handle a gun, run an effective search, survive in a bar, wear a uniform, sleep in the open, etc., etc. Of course, in this book, only Special Forces can handle such vital challenges. CIA agents are described as smarmy and stupid, SEALS are brave but completely brain dead when they are not in the water, former military personnel are mercenaries. Heaven only knows how any of us have survived without our own Special Forces officer to cover our respective sixes. Evidently, you have never watched a war documentary, you have never read a spy thriller, you have never been in the military, you don't know anyone in the military, we don't ALL have a family member or friend who has been to Iraq, or is still in Iraq. We are all just big dumb civilians who trip over our feet and land in the nearest quagmire (needing to be rescued). I'd say \`bite me', but that would be rude.If the condescending tone of Special Forces conceit doesn't offend you, the characters should. Our hero's brain goes effectively south the moment he sees a firm set of silicon implants. We are treated to this attractive personality trait often, and in his thoughts he thinks this is \`manly'. He knows how to \`sprinkle the infield' (buy drinks for all the drunks in a bar), but not how to order room service at a Westin Hotel. Our Heroine, Lucy, is so charmed by his aboriginal mindset she crawls into his bed without invitation or encouragement, proudly hunting him down in the dark. After a wild night of sexual bliss in the swamp, she is certain he will commit to her forever, even though he is twice divorced (I can't imagine why) and she is fully aware that just a couple of nights before he found the same sexual bliss with a blond bimbo who also crawled into his bed without invitation. In short, Lucy is missing a few rounds in her logic magazine. She is not alone. Everyone in this book is physically perfect, and emotionally or intellectually stupid, with the exception of the five-year-old girl, Pepper, and the alligator, Moot. When a child and a lizard have to carry the burden of interest and believability, you know the storyline is in serious trouble.I'd go into the plot here, but I really never found it, it was all over the map, and more contrivances were added or deleted during each chapter. The kid wanders around putting herself in danger then pretending to be Wonder Woman, then getting kidnapped and pulling the \`Ransom of Red Chief' clich&eacute;. The sister turns to drugs to keep herself calm, then stops (with apparently no side-effects), gives Lucy advice on love (go back to the ex-husband, no wait, go seduce the Special Forces guy). The ex-husband constantly changes his feelings for Lucy (possessive love one minute, apathy the next), his character transforms from mercenary to terrorist to crook to mental case. The villains morph from being thugs to IRA ex-patriots to Russians to Terrorists to Mercenaries to Common Crooks. Unfortunately, as silly as all this sounds, it wasn't, it was just annoying.I buy Jennifer Crusie novels automatically, she is usually fabulous with her plots, characters, wit, and empathy. You can always identify with at least one of her slightly flawed but wonderful characters, you always like the hero and heroine, you get laugh lines that require wrinkle cream to get rid of, her love scenes are so hot and passionate you need a cold shower. Your biggest worry is that you'll lend one of her books to someone and never get it back, so you buy extra copies. None of that is going to happen here.Like me, you absolutely have to buy \\"Don't Look Down\\", it's a Jennifer Crusie novel after all (it says so, right on the label). Copy that. We're only civilians after all, what do we know?"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I would like to give this book a \\"One Star,\\" a \\"Five Star,\\" and an \\"Other Star\\" rating.\\"One Star\\" is for the steamy scene where the woman says \\"No\\" and the man (whose point of view we are hearing (surprise, surprise!)) provides a macho-\\"father knows best\\" rationalization for his failure to stop. You've reassured us that \\"no means no,\\" Dr. Crusie, so why didn't you make him stop? You're our role model! If you couldn't convince Mr. Mayer that \\"no means no,\\" what hope is there for the rest of us?\\"Five stars\\" because, on its own merit, _Don't Look Down_ is one of the best books I've read this year. It was funny, fascinating, intriguing and an excellent read!\\"Other Star\\" because of the grief I feel for the loss of the book Jennifer Crusie would have written if she hadn't been collaborating. Recently, I was too ill to read. Of the few books on tape/CD that could hold my attention, make me laugh, and block out the pain, the best were written by Jennifer Crusie in her own voice, i.e., prior to _Don't Look Down_.I hope someone will tell Jennifer Crusie this for people like me: you do more than entertain us, Dr. Crusie, you help us get through the day and make us believe we can be whole again. You make our marriages stronger. Sometimes when the demands of a sick wife seem to be wearing my husband down, I borrow a line from one of your books and we laugh... So please don't stop! If you want his point of view, invite Mr. Mayer to your writer's group. We need to hear your undiluted voice--your powerfully healing, powerfully female voice!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"When I saw Crusie's name as the author of this book, I was expecing a light, witty, romantic novel, in keeping with previous books by her that I'd read. This is more of an action/suspense novel (perhaps why she cowrote it with someone else), which I found satisfying; however, the emphasis frequently veers off the romance angle, so those for whom this is a primary interest may find themselves disappointed.There were certainly humorous moments in the book, and in the main, the plot and characterizations were well done; but they seemed somewhat disjointed from time to time, and I found myself having to reread parts of the novel just to stay on track.Bottom line: This is a good read, even though it may not be exactly what the reader is expecting."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"It was harder than I expected to get past those first sixty pages. And I'd been all set to give DON'T LOOK DOWN three stars, but then something changed for me. Enough that I found myself flipping through the pages, rather amused by the storyline, and engaged with the characters to the point that I wanted to know what happened next. I hadn't expected this turn of events, and I found myself increasing my rating to a solid 3.5 stars.Another aspect that helped me enjoy this read was a behind-the-scenes look at the movie business. I love movies, probably a bit too much, to the point that I consume movies the way writers consume words and electronic pages on a computer screen. Like the rest of the book, the behind-the-scenes look was all in good fun, but even that brief glimpse was enough to peak my curiosity and keep the pages turning in front of me.Sure, the movie experience may have been a bit outlandish, and the characters may have been a bit larger than life for me at times, but I found myself thoroughly immersed in the worlds of Lucy Armstrong, J.T. Wilder, and Pepper. Good beach reads are notorious for somewhat zany plotlines and off-the-wall characters, and this book was no different. And for me, that certainly added to my enjoyment. Because the bottom-line was I needed to be in the right frame of mind to finish this story, and once I was, I jumped out of the helicopter and onto the movie set with the ease of an experienced paratrooper.Robert DownsAuthor of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I really love this writing duo, so far I've read all that i could find. Humor, adventure and romance, who can beat it?"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"A little play on words, but sooo true!!I was a little biased going in, although I am not sure it was in one direction or the other. I had high expectations, but also expected to be disappointed (as things are always too good to be true) turns out I was right, about the high expectations. There are VERY few books I am not overly critical of, and even fewer I have challenges putting down. This is one of the books I will put on my shelf with a huge smile. It was all I wanted, sexy, smart, fun and real. JT Wilder, and the Amazonian Lucy Armstrong are a perfect fit, Pepper the niece and her apples adds an awesome curiosity and giggle to the mix of action, mystery and romance.At moments I was laughing aloud and when it was over I was left satisfied and believing in the happy ending. Deep and powerful enough to keep me addicted but not so bogged down I felt like I was in the swamp with Moot (you have to read the book).Looking forward to the next and all the others.Loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This book started off poorly with the strange description of what was going on with the movie set. The plot of the book seemed to be contrived, trying way to hard and not always making sense. It read like it was written by two people, not always melding well. It read as though a bunch of situations occuring that didn't always make sense. It would have benefitted if the characters were developed more and the plot simplified to something more basic and believable."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This one's tough- I love Crusie's books and liked Agnes and the Hitman and loved Wild Ride (her other collaborations) but this one kind of missed its mark. It was hard to get into, but once I was in it I did enjoy reading it and definitely wanted to keep going and find out what happened. And, like all Crusie books, it was funny and entertaining.Unfortunately, this collaboration really didn't work for me. You know the great majority of readers are women who like Crusie's romance novels, yet this book is really bogged down with too-detailed military items. The male lead clearly lives and breathes military; no matter what the situation is he graphically describes his surroundings with assessments that even go so far as to locate a \\"kill zone.\\" I don't think much of the target audience is going to care about all the details about guns and equipment, and it kind of kills the mood. The male lead sleeping with someone else didn't really bother me given the circumstances, but like someone else pointed out it doesn't make sense that he was so obsessed with his job and then completely forgot all his training around a pretty woman who wasn't even the female lead.The plot is a little confusing and I don't think it ever really wraps up. I wouldn't call them loose ends, but there are a good amount of people in the story that you kind of wonder about in the end. Most importantly, to quote another reviewer \\"who was the bad guy?\\" I guess I'm not the only one who was confused. Lots of people double crossing each other, lying, etc, and you can't tell what really happened in the end. There are a lot of little inconsistencies in the book too- like at one point someone looked up at the night sky, and a few sentences later suddenly it was afternoon. Those things bother me.I would still recommend reading it, but not if this is your first Crusie novel. Go out and fall in love with her books first, then turn to this and grin and bear it because it's still a good story and it's Crusie."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book. I have never read either Crusie or Mayer, so have no basis for comparison to their individual works. It is the first audiobook I have listened to that had both a male and female reader, which made it interesting. Sometimes in audiobooks, I get distracted by the reader not doing a good job at the opposite gender voices. That didn't happen here. I thought the story was interesting and the characters o.k. There are a few unexplained things early in the story and more as it goes on. I wanted to know more about JT's early life, as well as Lucy's and Daisy's. We don't get that. Other reviewers have commented that the inner thoughts of the main characters are italicized and that there are a lot of them. I did note that in the audio version (Not the italics; the volume of inner thoughts.:-) ) My disturbance is that the inner thought content was sometimes very odd for the situation the character was in. I also found the end of the book to be completely confusing and unsatisfactory. I never did quite figure out who-did-what in the end. The audiobook is due back to the library, but I'm listening to the last disc again to see if I missed something. I don't read a lot of romance novels but when I do, I want resolution of the relationship between the characters. This book didn't provide that. It alludes, but once the action in the story is finished, the book concludes. I expected a little more, perhaps an epilogue. I know this was the authors first collaboration, so I am willing to cut slack and try another of their titles. Hope this helps another reader/listening. It's a lightweight, but it isn't awful. It isn't great, either."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I automatically buy anything Jennifer Crusie and devour it...but I had to make myself read this one just because I paid for it on my Kindle. Usually her characters make her books, but I couldn't make myself like any of these characters, except for the 5-year-old, and I was actually pretty concerned about her. The male character is a jerk who sleeps with the first female who offers, and then does the \\"love of his life\\" character a couple days later. I'm still not really sure what happened in the book, and I have yet to figure out the motives of the bad guys.

I was actually excited about seeing her go in a new direction. But this book was so not what I expected. What Crusie does best is create real female characters who aren't perfect but are interesting and lovable and funny. Lucy was those things, from the little we got to see of her. Honestly, though, there was just so much constantly going on in this book that it was hard to care about any of the characters at all. For example, chapter one introduces almost all the major players; one of my favorite characters from the chapter was Gloom, Lucy's gay best friend. We hardly see him again in the book- very disappointing. Overall, it's fine for a beach read but don't expect the same quality you're used to from Crusie. It's just not there."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"So cool to have Crusie do the feminine side and Mayer do the masculine... nice playoff.. loved having the hero and heroine attract and meld together into a team.. way cool..

The \\"dark moment - all is lost\\" is an action climax and not Lucy desperately heartbroken that she's lost the man she loves.I've read other books by Crusie and while they were fun, and I picked this up because of some vague name recognition, I bought this because the cover copy said clearly that it was a combo of fun romance with action thriller.I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I am a big Jennifer Crusie fan, and tend to enjoy action/adventure novels, so was delighted to see she'd teamed up for a joint venture that combines romance with action.However, after painfully making my way through this sodden mess, I have to say I am bitterly disappointed with the outcome. We got neither a good romance nor a believable, fast-paced action story. What we got was the worst of both writers -- perhaps there were territoriality tussles or they each agreed to edit the other's work -- I can just see it:Jennifer: \\"Wait Bob, that's a coherent sentence! Here, let me rework it for you!\\"Bob: \\"NO way can a character be both intelligent AND sexy -- here, let me dumb her down a bit for you.\\"I understand they've collaborated on a second book (an excerpt was included in this one), and it actually sounds a lot better.

If I'd plunked down the money to purchase this hardcover, I'd be angry, rather than just bored ((thank goodness for libraries). Who is the intended audience? I read pretty much everything and love well written, label defying multi-genre reads: this wasn't any such thing. The plot was exceedingly slow, which makes for a poor action adventure. The romance was unbelievable: within four nights, the hero sleeps with a faked boobed bimbo starlet (yeah, I know: he's a guy and she was there, in his bed, playing with his gun) and then the object of his true lust: the heroine. During the same time, based on nothing except the hero's rippling brawn and his off hand kindness to her niece, the heroine decides she is in forever kind of love and the hero concurs on similarly sparse plot grounds.Save your money people: wait for the paperback and even then, only if you have nothing better to do w/ your time.

But when he's confronted with a strong, intelligent, independent woman, he's probably gonna fall in love.Speaking of which, the sex scenes b/w Wilder and Lucy are the hottest I've ever read in a Crusie book (haven't read any of Bob's books yet).

Nor have I read a book by Bob Mayer.The character development in this book is just terrible. The main \\"hero\\" (I use this word lightly) is supposed to be a Green Beret. His thinking, actions, and words do not support a man that has handled combat situations. He is rather slow and his thinking becomes clouded by his lustful nature in regards to the main \\"heroine\\" (which I also use lightly).What is the deal with the sister, Daisy? Is she a total basket case or what? The main heroine, Lucy, is all about \\"saving\\" her sister. Pathetic. The plot is very badly drawn and the scene development is just POOR.It always suprises me when sub-par literature gets published. It is a shame when very talented and wonderful authors have trouble getting published. It is an even bigger shame when talentless hacks like these two get a book published.Hey, its perfectly okay with me when a book is trash - but is ENTERTAINING. I love classical literature and wonderful books that I consider gems. I keep those books on my shelf and read them over and over. Classical authors that are truly artists.However, this is not entertaining or even funny. It was like a bad movie. You finish it because you paid the rental or theater ticket fee. You want to at least finish it. However, no one will ever pay you back for your time or the fee that you paid.A note to St. Martin's Press: Please take a moment to think about publishing further work from these two.A WASTE OF TIME!

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Lucy was constantly being interrupted. For example, A said something to Lucy. B said something on a different subject to Lucy. Lucy answered B. A said something else again. Lucy then answers A. There were many times that two or more conversations were happening at the same time interrupting each other. Later when Lucy was alone with Wilder, she asked him a question, but before he could answer, her cell phone rang, so we didn't get to hear his answer. I found myself frequently annoyed. The authors create mystery simply because conversations are not being done or completed in a normal manner. I also did not like the character of Lucy. She would jump to erroneous conclusions, then later would have to do something different because she had been wrong. She told little white lies to her niece. I would have preferred gentle honesty. Other characters were not likeable or did stupid things. The only character I did like was Wilder, the military consultant. I wanted the book to be over. I did not enjoy it.

By the end, I found myself shrugging and saying, \\"meh, whatever,\\" about most of the plot details.But the real fun part about this book was the characters. I really think the interplay between male and female worked well. In romances especially, it's hard to get the male point of view, I suspect because most romance writers are female (and even if they aren't, are trying to appeal to the female demographic). I enjoyed reading the male point of view portions of the book, and watching macho macho man fall in love. I didn't think it was doable, but it worked for me. Heck, I fell in love with him, nevermind the heroine in the novel.This was the first book I've read by either Crusie or Mayer, but now I'll be looking forward to their next collaborative effort and probably thumbing through their backlists."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Don't Look Down by Jennifer Crusie and Bob Mayer (audio version read by Patrick G.

Wilder are thrown together for a 4 day shoot of a horrible movie which is merely a front for a more sinister plot. The story is uninteresting and the dialogue is not the witty banter I've come to expect from Crusie. There's little suspense and no humor to this book. There is however, a lot of yelling and talk about Wonder Woman.The readers do a decent job and having both a male and female reader makes the reading better... however, it's just not a good book.

Having the two combined should have made for a good book. Boy, was I disappointed. The first disappointment was the character of JT (the hero??) He was so one dimensional. The heroine, Lucy, was a better written character. Being an avid reader of romance novels, I was especially disappointed to find JT going to bed with another woman even after he had met Lucy. That really spoiled the book for me right off and made me dislike JT's character from the beginning. It just got more disappointing after that as the plot was not at all plausable. Crusie has always written witty and likeable characters in the past. I thinks she needs to stay with her previous winning formula."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Seems lots of whiners are whining about this very funny, well written, non-formulaic, great book. The team of Crusie/Mayer is a winner for me. The strengths of both writers is well balanced, synergistic, bringing to the book two viewpoints that make a richer, wittier, more well rounded storyline. The male perspective is well represented in this book and that contrasts nicely with the female perspective. Personally, I love it when weird things happen that one could not possibly think of themselves. Too often these days I've got the plot and ending figured out by Chapter three - books costs too much for that and it's not fun.Go Mayer & Crusie - More please!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I am not quite sure what Jenny and Bob were trying to make happen in this book. The chemistry between these two as writers, well, in my opinion is non-existent.They attempt to be telling the same story but fail horribly.J.T. Wilder is a stark, boring special forces character who was done no justice in terms of character developement. They were handed an opportunity to develop a rich character but rather reverted to a very....retarded, please forgive me the choice of words, boring, disengaging portrayal of a special forces man.Lucy, by the same stroke, lacked Jenny's usual eccentricities and believability. She was as much of a two dimensional character as J.T.I am a compulsive reader and this book took me two weeks to finish, when most take me a day or two.It was slow and boring and the only thing that prompted me to finish it was my OCD.I am shocked that these two have ANOTHER book coming out together and I must ask, are they both getting lazy as writers so they feel the need to write with other B-talent in hopes to divy up the work? Or perhaps they are running out of ideas and characters to write about and need to lean on another writer for assistance?Perhaps, not writing at all is a better alternative than churning out this...kind of writing.Forgive me for any harshness but I was very disappointed in the writing and now I feel slight pity for these two.I definitely will not be contributing to the sales of anymore books written by these two together and/or apart, which is a sad thing since I had just discovered Jenny Crusie this summer and have already ready four of her books.Such a shame and waste."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I would say Jenifer Crusie should stop writing with Bob Mayer.

It's different from a typical Jenny Crusie book in having an action-oriented plot with complications and surprising changes of side (and quite a lot of weaponry), but similar in that the characters are wonderfully drawn and talk just like real people would talk if we were all that smart and articulate.So, the book lived up to the anticipation - and I can still keep reading the blog, 'cause the authors are on a PROLONGED tour for the book, and sharing it with us fans."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I've been a long time Crusie fan, and waited (not so patiently) for the day this book would be released. I literally stalked the Waldenbooks guy for weeks until he finally smuggled it out of the back room three days early. Then I went home and devoured this book in one sitting. I could not put it down.Like many of you, I read a LOT. I rarely put a book away unless it is finished. However, it takes something really special for a book to stick in my mind after the last page. This book had that 'something'.Yes, it moved really fast. Yes, there were a lot of characters to remember. Yes, JT slept with someone other than Lucy. Come on though, isn't that what makes great FICTION?!? Getting to step into a world that is so far removed from mine, getting to squeeze inside JT's head, getting to meet all those crazy folks out there on that bridge - this is exactly the reason I waited for this book.It was not a disappointment at all. I really enjoyed it. If I wanted to read a book that was pure reality, I would not have picked up a ROMANTIC ADVENTURE! Hel-lo! The two genres are indicative of figurativly taking a step away from reality. The fact that they were so seamlessly combined by such masters as Jenny and Bob just go to show that Amazon now needs a brand new category, because there are hopefully going to be MANY more books from this dynamic duo!!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I have read all of Crusie's books and have loved every single one, especially Welcome to Temptation, so I was really looking forward to her new book, Don't Look Down. Unfortunately, I ended up being incredibly disappointed once I read it. This book is completely different from her others--not very interesting or likable characters, the \\"romance\\" was boring and uneventful, the plot was horrible...just pretty awful overall. It was really difficult to sit and actually finish reading this book. If you like Jennifer Crusie, pass on this book, because you will most-likely be disappointed. Hopefully Crusie's next book will be more like the ones before Don't Look Down, but I think I'll wait to order her next book until after I read some reviews here first, just in case!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love JC normally. But this one was tedious and boring. I found myself dozing every few pages and it took me till page 245 to perk up a bit. But then it went flat again. Hopefully...JC will go back to her fine romance writing and leave this stuff to Sandra Brown or Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Humor, romance, action, surprise twists and the best literary reptile since Peter Pan. And once the book has you hooked definitely head over to the He Wrote She Wrote blog for the fun to continue."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Television director Lucy Armstrong has a perfectly happy working with animals; she has no desire to go south to film action scenes for four days. The pleadings of her sister fail to persuade her, but she cannot refuse the blandishments of her niece pepper.Lucy arrives on location near the Eugene Tallmadge Memorial Bridge where the action includes a helicopter and a hero trying to defeat the villains. However the previous director died of a heart attack and the support staff walked out while her despicable ex-husband is the stunt director. All Lucy could think of is cut.Bryce, who is switching from comedic roles to macho hero parts hires Green Beret Captain J.T. Wilder as his stunt double and advisor. The CIA orders Wilder to watch for James Finnegan, who has invested four million dirty dollars in the movie that he plans to launder in order to fund various terrorist organizations. Finnegan is also meeting a Russian Mafiosi to return art objects that he stole from him. The CIA want Travis to find out the location of their meeting because since the Russian is so close to American soil they can arrest him. He does not expect to fall in love with Lucy or that his beloved and Pepper will be in danger from various factions willing to kill to gain what they want.The team of Jennifer Crusie & Bob Mayer prove a delightful collaboration because their writing styles blend smoothly together, so much so that the audience will not know who wrote what but are enjoying reading a tense romantic thriller. There is plenty of intrigue, adventure and peril in this action thriller, but the authors do not neglect their characters. Heroes, villains, and innocent victims are fully developed with everyone containing some degrees of humanity. Some of the scenes include humor while the romance is red hot.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I have been a Crusie fan for years so this was an interesting departure from her previous novels. I really liked having the man's viewpoint from a MAN. Yes, he says \\"get out of the kill zone\\" frequently - that's what his character SHOULD do. She is not petite, 85 lbs and drop-dead gorgeous. She's surrounded by movie-star type beauty, but she is compared to an \\"action hero\\" not Barbie! I bought the music used as background in the book (\\"In these Shoes\\", \\"Us Amazonians\\", etc.) and loved them. I appreciate a little more reality in a romance - family problems, work problems, ex-spouse problems, and being attracted to someone who sleeps with someone else isn't science fiction - it's the way life is. The romance part is that it all works out - even the alligator gets dinner!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"It may have been a sweet idea for Jennifer Cruisie and Bob Mayer to write a book together, but this bombs. Bob Mayer may have a successful career writing tough-guy adventure fiction, but readers of Jennifer Crusie's hilarious romps are in for a big disappointment. Cruisie's wit and unique female outlook get almost no face time in the book. The plot is 95% predictable Special Forces/macho male fantasy, featuring a wooden Indian hero so boring even the heroine has a hard time getting any conversation out of him. It's implied he's hot--but what about him makes him hot? We don't know what this guy looks like, period. Neither does he have any discernible personality. We just know he's the stock aggrieved, disenchanted, been-through-it-all action guy with two failed marriages behind him and nothing about him that would recommend him to any of the female characters in any of Crusie's other books. And, not incidentally, to any of her readers either. Cruisie lost her way here, her fans have to hope she will return to her own voice and the previous delights of her other books."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm a BIG Crusie fan, let me just say from the start. While some early fans of her work did not care for this book or appreciate the path taken in the author's career, I really enjoyed the different style. The male and female points of view do contrast, but not jarringly so. The story has pace, some well drawn characters - I'm partial to Pepper and the Gator - and I enjoyed the action. The plus side, I \\"found\\" another author I really enjoy reading. I don't believe I'd have found Bob Mayer and his other pen names without this collaboration.Perhaps I am biased because I had the opportunity to read the authors' dueling blog - He Wrote/She Wrote. Nevertheless, the collaboration between a romance novelist and an action-adventure/sci-fi writer held great appeal. Crusie's books get better and better with re-reads and I believe this story of how vastly different characters build themselves a \\"community\\" or family will only improve with age."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm not a Jennifer Crusie fan. I'm not a Bob Mayer fan. Honestly, I mistakenly ordered this (audio)book from my library. I would have returned it, but I found myself with nothing else to listen to during my commute.There's been plenty of comment from Crusie fans regarding this novel's shortcomings as a piece of romantic fiction. Let me address this book from the point of view of an avid adventure/thriller/military fiction reader.I know fiction is not reality. A certain amount of believability can be suspended without affecting the overall merit of the piece. But Don't Look Down is SO unbelievable, on SO MANY different levels, that I found myself finishing it only because my latest audiobook order hadn't arrived.Where do I start?How about in the first chapter, where JT notices Connor is wearing a pistol in a fast-draw rig. Is it normal for stunt coordinators to walk around movie sets while armed? OK, it could be argued that they're filming an action movie and it could be part of his 'costume'. Then why not tell us that? Nah, better to leave the reader guessing...How about at the introduction of Moot, the ubiquitous alligator? I've been to gator country. I've actually looked for an alligator -- any alligator -- most often without success. Yet we're to believe ol' one-eyed Moot not only shows up for just about every scene, but is readily visible to anyone glancing to the swamp/river/woods/etc.?How about Crawford, the \\"kid\\" put in charge of capturing one of the Russian mafia's top players?How about [SPOILER ALERT] the fact that two apparently successful Hollywood actors would chuck it all for a shot at criminal behavior and a big score?How about nearly a thousand descriptions, incidents and scenes pertaining to the military, the Army, Special Forces, the Green Berets and more that are so far from reality they could have been written by a Martian? If Mr. Mayer is indeed a former Green Beret, he has either been away from the service for a VERY LONG time and suffered several blows to the head in the interim, or he has a very long bone to pick with the person who collabarated with Ms. Crusie under his name.I could go on and on, but I won't. This book went off my OCO (Oh, come on!) scale before I'd finished the second chapter.The ONLY reason I gave this a second star was because the story moved along OK and I kinda liked the young adult disguised as a 5-year-old.I found nothing in the book to spur me to read anything more by either author. If you like romantic fiction, go read one of Jennifer Crusie's other books, which seem very well-regarded by others here. If you like adventure or military fiction, go read something by Tom Clancy...or any other writer that actually does a little research before putting pen to paper."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I have mixed feelings about this. First, the audio production I listened to was really odd, with the different male/female points of view and male/female dialog done by different narrators (male for male, female for female, of course). It was a little jarring at times, and I think it contributed to the outrageousness of the story. The plot is weak and unnecessarily confusing (I'm still not entirely certain what was going on in the end), and characters are so over-the-top they border on cartoonish. I guess this could be good or bad, depending on your point of view. I'd read more from Crusie, but I might shy away from this particular combination of authors in the future."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"First, let me say this -- my review is for the book, not the seller, product, or transaction. Seller was great, as was the experience. It's just a really convoluted book, and a very poorly done audio version. The male lead sounds like he's standing in a closet shouting all his lines through the door. I didn't even make it through the second disc before I gave up on it. I love Jennifer Crusie normally, but this one was bad."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"it is good but with more than one author it has a violent flavor. that is not my favorite."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"What a great duo! Her sense of humor and his manly input is fantastic. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"From the reviews, some people did not like this new style of writing by Jennifer Crusie with co-author Bob Mayer. I did like it! Yes, it's a bit different from her usual style, but I liked the element of danger and suspense, along with dollops of her trademark humor. I've also read the second collaboration, Agnes and the Hit Man, which I liked even better. I hope Ms. Crusie continues to write both solo and with Bob Mayer."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I found this book in the clearance bin ($5 for hardcover!) and it sounded good... a day and a half later I was on Kindle to see if there were any other books by Crusie & Mayer because I was left wanting more! I love realsitic romance books with good action/adventure plus a &#34;happily ever after&#34; (hey, I'm reading to escape reality!) and this one more than fit the bill... must read &#34;Agnes & the Hitman&#34; too. Crusie & Mayer are an amazing duo & I hope another book is in the works."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"As a fan of Jennifer Crusie, this book is just another good work from her, and coupled with Bob Mayer, makes it even better."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"When this book first came out, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I love Jennifer Crusie. By the end of the first chapter, I was so confused, I put it down for over a year. I decided to try one more time and I did get through the first chapter of who said what to whom,but the second wasn't much better. The characters still remained, so confusing to me. So far I haven't finished it but I am going to struggle through and try to get to the end. So having said that, I am going to buy their next book anyway and see if that one is better. To finish I have to agree with most of the other reviews, what were they thinking? I hate putting any book down and especially Ms. Crusie's books but I honestly just didn't get it. Maybe it was the team thing and they have to get it all together first. I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again. But I have loved your other books Ms. Crusie! Thanks you!!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I read the book without expectation and really enjoyed it. Lot's of characters and secrets revealed. Only now do I see what a departure it was for Crusie. I'm definitely on board for the next collaboration!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"and since romance readers have given this a universal thumbs down, I'm not sure what genre it fits into.I read both romance and action/adventure/spy/thriller books. I did not expect Mark Bowden or John LeCarre. I didn't even expect Frederick Forsyth or Ken Follet. But this doesn't come close to even the predictable but entertaining, Robert Ludlum. I asked a friend who is a genuine \\"spook\\" to read it. This CIA employee, who holds a PhD, graduated first in her class from a prestigious private university, stopped reading at about the same place I did, with the comment, \\"Oh, please.\\" I asked a friend who spent a few years in the Army, who was shot down twice in Vietnam, who has conducted undercover operations for Army Intelligence and who is now a test pilot to read it. He skimmed it and I won't embarrass the author with his comments. Just know that he wasn't thinking it was the CIA who were the clowns.The movie production part? I do know a bit about that, and this book is beyond ridiculous. With a budget that allows for location action shoots for action that could easily, cheaply and convincingly be done with a blue screen, these jokers call in a director of dog food commercials to complete it? A director who hasn't read the script?This action, romance might work as a comic strip, but as a book, you need to save your money."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I was disappointed in this book because it lacked a lot of the light-heartedness we have come to expect from Crusie and had too much technical info re: guns and explosives (an attempt to appeal to male readers?). I would read more by this team but hope they will not be so stereotypical in future."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"**spoilers below for this book**I don't know if this was Jennifer Crusie's first collaboration with Bob Mayer, or if it was \\"Agnes and the Hitman\\", but something definitely happened between those two books because \\"Agnes\\" was amazing, and \\"Don't Look Down\\" was...not. I agree with most of the other people who gave this book a negative review. Their points are valid. For me the biggest problems were:A) I didn't really like any of the characters. I *wanted* to. Keep in mind that I'm a big JC fan. She's right up my alley, normally. So I wanted to like this book. But there was not one character with whom I could relate or empathize or care much about aside from the alligator. You have to have someone to root for when you're reading fiction, or watching a movie, otherwise you don't care what happens to them.B) The male and female perspectives were too delineated. They were noticeable in \\"Agnes and the Hitman\\", but it was disorienting in \\"Don't Look Down\\". I listened to the audio book first, and I just remember being bored out of my skull during all the military guy stuff, and then we'd jarringly be back over in the \\"female\\" section with everyone dressing up in Wonder Woman underoos and trying way too hard to be adorably wacky and outrageous. It was embarassing.C) The male perspective in general. I guess Bob Mayer gets points for bringing the male perspective, and being honest about the way guys think. And I hate to be a cliche. But I just don't care. If I wanted to deal with real guys and the way they really think instead of getting into a love story, I wouldn't be reading romantic fiction! I read to escape reality and get involved in a world where guys CAN fall in love, hard, and choose not to be with other women. It's what I like, sue me. I read romantic fiction mostly because I like the whole process of two people finding each other, making a connection, going through some stuff, and ending up together. So yeah, I'm one of the people who stopped digging the story when the male lead has sex with the bimbo actress three days before he has sex with the female lead he's got a thing for. Hey, he's a guy. Right? That's how it's presented, anyway. Any self-respecting man is going to make the same choice, is what Bob Mayer is saying. And maybe he's right. I don't know. I don't care! It's not what I'm reading this book for! But it irritates me the way BM feels the need to throw this stuff in there. Like...what did that plot point do for the story aside from make me dislike his character? Was it important for anything except to prove to us what a man he is? What a real man would do? Would it have killed him to have the guy NOT sleep with the actress?Anyway, the result of these points was that I was in no way inspired to read the novel again, which is also a very clear departure from the way I regard JC's other books. I have re-read many of those, including \\"Agnes and the Hitman\\". But \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Wild Ride\\" make me grateful for my policy of renting from the library first, then buying the books if I like them. I won't be bothering with these."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I have been a huge Crusie fan and have read all her other books. I was really looking forward to this book and was very disappointed. The book dragged on and I was not terribly interested right up to the end. The character of Lucy was OK, but the little bits of background we were told had nothing to do with the characters behavior. The hero was a piece of cardboard who slept around. His only redeeming trait was when he interected with Pepper, the 5 year old niece of Lucy. The other characters were never developed and there were just too many of them. All in all, the book was poorly written and the authors should forget all future collaborations.If you still want to read this book, check it out from the library - don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I've read all Crusie's books and they're light hearted humor usually delivers a punch; along with delving into the characters' weaknesses, ultimately reserecting their strengths, that readers can identify with. This book had none of the saving graces. I was left dissapointed - serving up forced humor and characters that are surface level with an ending that is so unrealistic that one wonders why the time was spent to finish the book. I kept reading hoping somewhere along the line that the Crusie-style would resurface .... it did not."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Like J.T. (the Green Beret male lead), I'll keep this brief:Two authors from different genres, each at the top of his/her game, write a book that combines their strengths. The novel's funny, it's sexy, it's action-packed and dangerous, and it's emotionally real.J.T. is not your typical romance-novel hero. Killing a lowlife for him is easier than saying \\"I love you.\\" Lucy the heroine sometimes mystifies J.T. -- but a killer alligator he understands.Women, after you read the book, ask that special man in your life what J.T. meant when he talked about \\"taking one for the team.\\" Then explain to your man, as calmly as you can, why this remark made Lucy (and Jennifer Crusie, the co-author) angry. From the discussion, you both will learn something.(What your Special Man will learn is: Honesty in a relationship is not always a good thing!)This book is BRIDGET JONES' DIARY with sniper rifles; for the men, it's a Nick Carter adventure with comedy and emotional depth.If there's any justice in the world, this book should be made into a movie. Will Farrell or Jack Black should play Bryce, Russell Crowe should play Nash, Britney Spears should play Althea, Maria Lark (the little girl on \\"Medium\\") should play Pepper, and Hillary Clinton should play Moot."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Lucy Armstrong makes a good living by filming commercials. When Lucy's sister asks her to shoot the last four days of an action movie, she agrees, if only to find out why her young niece is so unhappy. She plans on a few days to film and sort out her sister's problems, not worrying about Irish terrorists or finding her own G.I Joe.J.T. Wilder is a Green Beret officer who has agreed to be a military consultant for the star of the movie. He plans on a few days of well-paid work, not ducking real bullets or falling for an Amazon of a woman in Lucy.Neither of them expect the shoot to turn into a disaster. With a sniper hiding in the swamp, a gator named Moot lurking near the movie set, and a precocious five-year-old noticing more than she's supposed to, this shoot is anything but dull.With Crusie starring as Lucy, and Mayer as Wilder, this novel moves with unique characters, lush settings, and intense moments. The writing is well paced and inviting, with wonderful cohesion of both authors' styles.While some of Wilder's early attitudes about the women may be questionable, it is easily trumped by not only his good deeds, but with the subplot surrounding Lucy's adorable niece, Pepper. The scenes involving the sniper are especially well crafted, leaving the reader on edge.Fans of Crusie and/or Mayer will find this an enjoyable read.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer5-12-2006"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Lucy Armstrong is very happy shooting animal commercials. She HATES shooting full-length movies. But when Lucy's little niece, Pepper, actually begs her, Lucy agrees to be the director for the last four days of shooting an action movie.The stunt coordinator is Connor Nash, Lucy's ex-husband from twelve years prior. Connor makes it clear that he wants Lucy back; Lucy makes it clear that she does not want Connor back. However, Lucy is very interested, against her better judgement, in Captain J.T. Wilder. The Green Beret has just been hired by the male star as a military consultant and stunt double.J.T. is off duty from the military. Yet instead of using the time to rest, J.T. agrees to the temporary job offered to him. After all, it is a huge amount of money for less than a week's worth of work. But even before he steps off the helicopter, J.T. knows something is dangerously wrong. The previous director died, seemingly of natural causes, several members of the crew have quit, and Pepper keeps talking about the ghost she keeps watching in the swamp. J.T.'s instincts tell him that Pepper's \\"ghost\\" is very real, even though he can find no evidence that anyone is in the swamp watching all the action. When the CIA contacts him for a quiet meeting, J.T. knows R & R is no longer in his near future.***** Jennifer Crusie is well known for her humorous romantic suspense novels. Bob Mayer is well known for his thriller novels. Even though they write different genres, the two authors blend their talents seamlessly for an outstanding tale that kept me up late at night and my eyes glued to the pages.

Fantastic! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Cardboard chacters, stock situations and a remarkable lack of depth make this book a real standout, in all the wrong ways, from Crusie's other work. One example: the heroine's obligatory gay male best friend tells the hero to \\"take care of my girl\\" because she's so special. After two days. In fact, one day after the hero couldn't say no to sex with one of the most two-dimensional bimbettes in history. What kind of a best friend is that? And has either author ever been on a movie set??? Ohmygosh... a dreadful disappointment.

I've decided that I must be ADD. I couldn't fully get into this story because so much is happening at the same time. I got confused. At the beginning of the story there are so many characters emerging, so much dialogue happening at the same time (is she saying it to the person on the phone, or the person in front of her or what) and so much action, I got lost. I love my Crusie. I like her light romance and humor, including the light suspense she's merged into the plot, but this particular book was definitely heavy in a military/action story. It reads like one of those Delta Forces action movie NOT as a thriller. We clearly know who the bad guys are, quite stereotyped. BUT I did fall in love with the hero. Just not my cup of tea. I don't consider it a thriller, just an \\"action movie\\". Will wait for the next Crusie avidly."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I hope you enjoyed this novel DON'T LOOK DOWN by Jennifer Crusie. I found it breezy yet humorous, a fun chicklit read, definitely. I wished some of the character lines would have been more developed. Sometimes you are just looking for a fun read and this is it. Not my favorite Cruisie novel, but OK, worth the read. I have given this novel 3 stars to prove that Crusie has a great sense of humor and the storyline is engaging, but the characters were a bit lacking and so she did not receive all 5 stars from me. Still fun though!!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I read Agnes and the Hitman before, which is their second collaboration and I have to say that it was a lot better than Don't look down. Their writing styles totally clashed and you could really tell what part Crusie wrote and which part was written by Mayer. And Crusie's part wasn't even good which was a huge disappointment because I usually love her books.It was really hard to get into the book too because you could tell who wrote what and the book just had no flow at all. I also had a hard time getting into the characters. Crusies heroes and heroines are all pretty similar but they usually have some personality and you start to like them but Lucy and J.T. were pretty cookie cutter and I couldn't care less about them. It's the same with the side characters. I like Crusies books because her side characters play a big part but in this case they were all cookie cutters as well.The plot was alright but also pretty forgettable. Matter of fact I don't even know what to write about it. It's about Lucy, who has to shoot the last 3 days of a movie and J.T. being the stunt double for the main actor. The movie is used by some criminals to laundry money and get some art back. Alright. The only reason the book didn't suck completely was that Bob Mayer knew what he was writing about. J.T. is Special Forces and provides the action in this book and you can really tell that Mayer used to be in the Military.

Nitpickers may find holes in the story line, however, I was having such a good time reading/listenting that I did not notice any lacks anywhere. The story is fun, romantic, full of adventure and keeps moving...the characters are great - I'd buy the DVD (if one existed) just to sit in on that Wonder Woman party!

Known for her intelligently funny, character driven, deftly plotted romantic novels, Crusie is all but invisible in this boring, schizophrenic, badly written attempt at romantic mystery with a dash of comedy thrown in.As other reviewers have pointed out, Don't Look Down is disjointed and lumbering, with dull, largely unbelievable and poorly motivated characters, and an outlandish plot. The writing is repetitive, amateurish and at times downright irritating (italized inner thoughts appear with annoying regularity). After the first chapter or two, I skimmed the remainder, hoping something would catch my eye and make me want to actually READ this book. Never happened.I've read and enjoyed most if not all of Crusie's books (Faking It, Bet Me, Fast Women, etc.) but if her future books are collaborations with Mr. Mayer, I believe I'll move on."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Don't Look Down pairs a Green Beret looking to make a little extra cash on his down time with a straight-talking director of dog food commercials. Captain J.T. Wilder knows that acting as an on-set stunt consultant for the movie \\"Don't Look Down\\" can't possibly be as easy as it seems. First there's the over-eager star of the movie who he's forced to babysit most of the time. Then there's the film's heroine whose big boobs and withering glances leave little to the imagination. Finally, there's the Amazonian director who seems to not take anyone's crap--including his own.Lucy Armstrong only agreed to step in at the last minute and direct the final stunt scenes of the movie because it would be a chance to spend some quality time with her sister and niece. The set is a mess when she arrives with most of the crew and cast gone. Her ex-husband is the stunt coordinator and she takes pains to avoid him. And then there's the stoic Captain Wilder whose presence is both irritating and invigorating to her.This is different from the other Jennifer Crusie novels I've read previously and enjoyed, and perhaps it's Mayer's influcnce. The story was good and typical of romantic suspense, but for some reason I found the character's and plot just a bit long-winded.There seemed to be too much riding on the on-set mystery and not enough on the relationship between the characters. In fact, I found the whole plot about the missing art or whatever (it was never really clear to me) detracted from what I really cared about which was Lucy and J.T.'s interaction. I thought this book was fine, but not nearly as good as some of Crusie's other books that I've read recently. It seems more like chick lit that was targeted at men, and maybe that's what I didn't really like about it. As a whole, it was fine, but nothing I would read again."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I love Crusie's witty, sassy, feminine books, and hated this one! What's with all the army, guns, macho stuff - Ugh! The only decent line in the whole book was when Lucy says, \\"I just don't understand how you guys got control of the world. Half the time there's no blood in your brains, and you're still in charge of most of the governments in the world, most of the companies, and all of the military. Which actually explains a lot, now that I think of it.\\"Please Ms. Crusie, drop Mr. Mayer and go back to writing what you do best. Fun, witty modern romance with interesting characters we actually care about.All in all a very uneven, not fun book. Don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers. This book was disappointing. I didn't like the characters, they had potential that never developed. I thought the plot was disjointed and confusing. By the end I really didn't care about any of them. I was so sick of the 'alpha' male thinking 'get out of the kill zone' I was ready to kill him myself. I normally LOVE Jennifer Crusie's books, but I had to rate this one a one star read."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm a big Jennifer Crusie fan...even most of her early stuff. (Favorites include \\"Welcome To Temptation,\\" \\"Bet Me,\\" \\"Crazy For You\\" and even \\"Charlie All Night.\\") Why do I love her books? Three reasons: 1) she has a wicked sense of humor, 2) she writes great sexual tension/buildup and 3) she constructs reasonably plausible storylines and strong yet human heroines.I am sad to say that this book really doesn't offer any of these. The heroine has potential but is woefully underdeveloped. The plot is relatively uninteresting, and the descriptions confusing at times. The plot overwhelms the characters (except the delightful \\"egg\\" Pepper).Usually a Jennifer Crusie is a can't-put-it-down-book that I read in one day, maybe two. I've been reading this novel off and on for more than a week. I actually put it down last night with about 10 pages left to go. I never do that with a book. Obviously, it's not holding my attention.I hate to say this because J.C. has written so many books that made me laugh. I've read all of her books (even the early ones) and enjoyed this least of them all. I pre-ordered this book (hardcover edition). Now I wish I'd waited and purchased it used on eBay. Barely worth reading."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Jenny Crusie is a writer in a class all by herself. I buy everything she writes, including brand new hardbacks. Even though I did not enjoy it as much as I did her previous reads, it is still a shining star romance novel (no matter where the bookstore files her books, the books are romance).I did not like the constant use of people's last names in the first chapters (I finally wrote all characters names down, so I could stop flipping pages). I also felt there was less character development and these characters had great potential.But, I loved the characters. I just wish we could of gone a little deeper in their history. I liked the storyline. I liked the plot. The hero - extra tasty alphamale (a little Suzanne Brockmann like, but I love her books too).I know it is a change from Jenny's usual, but it is still a super romance novel. Give it a chance, I think you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Often the buzz about a movie or book, prior to release date, is so much hype the end product falls flat. Not in this case. I'd followed the buzz and eagerly bought my book on the day of release. I wasn't dissapointed. Crusie and Mayer, independently, are great story tellers. Together, they bring something totally different and very exciting to the world of fiction. We need more collaborations.This is a big book with a big plot that takes many twists and turns. Once you've concentrated on discerning which character is which (there are a lot initially) it isn't difficult to keep them all straight. The pacing is great, just enough sex and in the right place in the story, good romance, good descriptions of setting. I was totally engaged the entire time. Wonderful ending that left me with a smile."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Count me in among the VERY disappointed. I was confused from the start. There is a mind-boggling cast of characters and one thing I really dislike is having to continually go back and try to figure out who's who. I've just finished it and STILL am not sure who some of the people are.J.T. and Lucy had potential, but most of it was wasted by the muck (pun intended) surrounding them. Four days and they're in love? They barely spoke to each other! There was almost no character development, such a Crusie trademark, that I didn't feel connected to either. Just a page or two about their backgrounds would have given us something, but no, we didn't even get that. How did Lucy wind up in a foster home? Why was J.T. divorced twice? Where was he from? Maybe I missed this, but what did he even look like?Each of the dozens of characters had a motivation for their actions, but in the end I felt unfulfilled and never cared. I did, however, feel that the character of five-year-old Pepper brought a rare warmth and humanity to an otherwise cold story.Surprisingly for me, the most satisfying part of the book was the last action sequence. It was exciting and witty, though yet again I found myself rereading it so it would make sense.Sorry, Jennifer and Bob. The experiment didn't work for me. Stick to what you do best and I'll be right there to pick up your next book."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"WHAT THE???What happen Jennifer? I LOVE your books.. Their Witty and Silly and Romantic and Outragously Real.. BUT this? This was... I have NO words..I've given the book 3 stars.. For the effort, the Wonder Woman references, the fact that there was an Aussie in it and for Moot the one eyed Aligator.. But the rest..It was beige.. The herione gave up too easy, the Hero was as exciting as a brick and who was the bad guy in the end?.. I found myself [for the first time in one of Jennifer Crusie's books ] skimming over parts just so I could read what Peppers new facts about Aligators or Wonder Woman.But Review readers DO NOT be discouraged.. The rest of Jennifer Crusie's books are fantastic! Read 'Bet Me' or 'Faking It' or 'Welcome to Temptation' THESE are excellent books worth buying in Hardback Seafaire!!On a final note; No offense Bob but stick to what you know dont mess with romance."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. Not what I have come to expect in a Jennifer Crusie novel. It was hard to read, the characters pathetic and the story was so slow that halfway through I jumped pages....Don't waste your time, read one of her older books they are MUCH better."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"The book was about Lucy and J.T.She is a director of commercials hoodwinked into directing the last four days of filming for her 12-year Ex-husband. She takes the job without reading the script...and signs the contract without reading it, too.J.T. is an Army Ranger on leave. He takes the job of teaching the leading man how to be \\"military.\\" Again, without reading the script.J.T. is HOT. Lucy is AWESOME...but the book didn't live up to its potential in my estimation.Supporting characters that tease and hint at a Crusie novel (ala' the Dempsey's or the Goodnight's): Pepper, Daisy, Gloom, and Rene.Jennifer Cruise is by far my favorite author - and that is saying something as I have been reading since Janet Daley was writing her 50-states Harlequins.Usually, Jennifer Crusie novels have the best repartee, most developed characters, no holes in the plot, and stories that stay with you (Tilda and Davy! Sophie and Phin! Amy & Wes! Mae Belle and Mitch! Nell & Gabe! Ford and Gwen! The list is long - unfortunately not endless - Please write MORE Ms. Crusie!). Her stories are fresh, worth reading, reading again, and re-reading. Quite quotable, too! (Best All-time Quote: Gwen Goodnight - If you can't be a good example, you'll have to settle for being a horrible warning!)Added to all this, Jennifer Cruise gets Buffy & Angel (even though she rooted for Cordelia...This is a free country).If this is your first Crusie novel, don't let it be your last.If she and Bob Mayer write another novel, try it out too. It may be like the first season of a great show - it takes time for the characters to feel like family."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"For anyone who doesn't know the history of this book, Jenny Crusie teamed up with Bob Mayer, a former Green Beret who writes military thrillers, to write this ROMANTIC ADVENTURE (yes, I'm a cherry bomb, go read their dueling blog if you don't know what I'm talking about. http://www.crusiemayer.com/blog/Actually, go read it anyway. The blog is really addictive and entertaining and tells you a lot about how they wrote the book). See the fun chick lit cover? If you take it off, it's manly man camo. A really kewel camo with gators in it.Jenny wrote the female POV, Bob wrote the male. I really like the changing POV and the way the two of them work together. It's not like Crusie's other books, but I didn't expect it to be. I love good thrillers so I found it a wonderful mix. If you're looking for classic Crusie, this isn't it, but in a way I like it better. Men think differently from women, so it's refreshing to read the guy's reaction as written by a guy rather than a women guessing what a guy'd be thinking.Plot: Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, people are trying to kill them. A messed up sister Daisy, a hilariously precocious kid Pepper, Moot the alligator to keep an eye on things and even eat a few bad guys. You'd never see this in one of Crusie's solo books but, hey, the bad guys really deserve it and it's not gorey. She's trying to finish up directing a movie, he's a Green Beret on leave brought in as a stunt double for the lead actor but ends up working for the CIA trying to find the bad guy who's backing the movie."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"If you are looking for the typical Crusie romance, which is of course so much better than most out there, you may be disappointed. But this book is so much more. More plot, more motivations, two POVs, and still a lot of the funny we have come to expect. This is an action book, with a developing relationship on the side (and sex, of course). I liked it, and will reread. Am looking forward to new collaborations and will take a look at Mayer's backlist as his insight into the military/male mind and traditions was fun to read."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"What happened to you Jennifer Crusie???? Please,please,please go back to writing by yourself! No offense but I had to force myself to read this book,in the hope of it getting better or even interesting! I waited so long for something from JC and I get this!! Where is the humor and romance of it all ? This is the only book of hers that I haven't loved and read over and over. If ur a JC fan skip this book! Don't waste your time or money! Sorry to be harsh , but this book is definitely below par!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Although at least Peter Straub and Stephen King write in the same genre.When you take a satirical romance writer (Jennifer Crusie) and pair her with an action novel writer, whose stories feature Green Berets (Bob Mayer)...well, how did you really expect it would turn out?A light love story set in Savannah (featuring almost nothing about that fair city!) about a film crew finishing a movie that is the key to a CIA vs. the Russians subplot was what you got. And Lucy Armstrong, one of Crusie's most interesting heroines in awhile, is wasted in the muck. Most readers of Cruisie are in love with whatever she writes, and I was slapped around plenty when I panned her last dud \\"Bet Me\\". This one's worse. Full of gender laden cliches and \\"action\\" sets that overpower characterization, it's a shame it saw the light of day.Cruisie's signature write - the great sex scene, well, was missing from the book, although she tried a couple of times. Mr. Mayer will probably want to forget it ever happened.Save your money."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I am a major Jenifer Cruise fan, but this book was a huge disappointment for me. Read like somebody else ghost wrote it. The wonderful humor and wit normally associated with this authors work was absent and the people, with the possible exception of Pepper were tiresome and humorless.Seems to be a lot foul language for no specific reason.In all fairness I have to say that I stopped reading about 3/4 the way through. The plot was really weak and at times really difficult to find. Just no reason to keep reading....hard to care about how it ended up.Here is hoping that her next book will be back up to her normal standards of excellence."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Jenny Cruise fans wonder whether they will see the true Jenny in the collabaration with Bob Mayer. The answer is YES! And Bob brings the strong silent type along with J.T. Wilder to play against Jenny's outstanding women's characters and dialogue. And don't forget the one eye'd alligator, Moot!This romantic adventure is witty and a MUST READ. RUN, don't walk to the nearest bookstore and buy this for you and all your friends. They will love you for it!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm not familiar with Bob's work, though I love his writing workshops. I'm a big fan of Jenny Crusie: workshops, books, and speeches. And I'm a bigger fan of Wonder Woman. Thus how could I fail to get a huge kick out of this book?As per 80% of Crusie books, the plot gets off to a slow start because she's got to introduce her cast of thousands (bad news for me, because I'm TERRIBLE at names and sorting out people), but after that things progress at can't-put-it-down speed. You've got Green Berets, SEALs, SAS, CIA, IRA, the Russian mafia, Hollywood directors, and lousy exes producing various kinds of mayhem. Yes, it gets confusing more than once, which isn't helped by an opening scene that is noticeably different from viewpoint to viewpoint, and by a few unanswered questions at the end.It's much rougher than your usual Crusie book due to Mayer being co-author, and there's a lot of deadly military stuff, along with military language -- and by that, I mean four-letter words and creative variations thereof. Which, come to think of it, sometimes pop up in a Crusie. (Thank you for not killing a cat.) Also, per a Crusie book, there's some hot sex -- yet according to the aforementioned workshop, Mayer may have written those scenes. Good job, Bob! Anyway, the book is not for kids.As a WW fan I found myself coming out of the story to shout, \\"Wondie! Wondie!\\" so I'm going to have to (aw gee) read the book another few times to see how it reads without the Wonder-shock. It's my duty to mention that Bob & Jen got the WW doll wrong. The \\"First Appearance WW\\" doll does indeed look in photos as if it has a skirt, but it is correctly presented with baggy culottes. Wondie began in those star-spangled culottes (a high school gym standard style for 1940's active girls), which almost immediately became baggy shorts, then shorts, and finally briefs. In the pages of her own title, Diana/WW has never purposefully suited up for action by wearing a skirt. Thus the discussion here about how silly Wondie was to wear a skirt is rendered moot. (I still laughed. Too many modern comics artists want to depict WW in such wear. Idiots!) [...] for all the awful costume history.The book reads like diluted Crusie, which means that it's much better than the average book out there. (Fave Crusie books: Faking It, Bet Me, and Manhunting.) I can't say how it stacks up on the Bob Mayer scale, but it does pique my interest to try some of his books. If you want to read a book with a lot of action-adventure, romance, humor, mystery, Wonder Woman, a hint of High Noon, and a smidgeon of Peter Pan, I would recommend this."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Don't count me among those that were diappointed that this wasn't the usual Crusie frothy romanctic romp. I thought that the his/hers point of view storytelling worked well. It contained the Crusie things I love - unique heroine, screwed up family, snappy banter and offbeat music references. If you can't keep up with it when you first pick it up, stay with it and you'll be rewarded."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"CD/abridged/romantic suspense?: I liked the book to a point, but I'm not recommending it. I think the abridgement took out too much. There are a LOT of characters and it's hard to figure out who is a good guy and who is a bad guy. It really needed six discs instead of five. There were parts missing that were probably important. There are no less than three parts where characters are hurt, attacked, or murdered that are told about after the fact. The first time it happened, it didn't seem too important. Later, you find out that scene may have been important by looking at the person demeanor because he ends up being a bad guy. At the end, I really couldn't figure out who was a bad guy or a sucker rooked in a scam.I did like the precocious five year-old Pepper (and I don't like kids). She is the best part of the book.The whole movie scenario plot/phallic art thing is stupid. If you do listen to it, take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I enjoyed Agnes and the Hitman so much that I went back to read this, it's not Agnes but was enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"The only thing I didn't like about this book was the profanity. There is also nudity, two sex scenes and a strip bar in the plot. The characters are believable and fantastic and the action is nonstop. The ending is also completely unpredictable, but overall it was well done. I laughed the entire time and I it was exciting to see how many things could go wrong while making a movie. Lucy is the absolute best female hero and I enjoyed her character the most. She's tough yet vulnerable and completely loyal to her family. This is a quick read and an enjoyable one if you can get past the profanity and violence."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I did like the wonder woman references but the story as a hold tried to combine too many elements. I had trouble remembering who the bad guy was and why and what they stealing."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"When her sister calls for her help, Lucy Armstrong leaves her job filming dog-food ads and heads for the swamps where her sister and ex-husband are involved in filming a movie. Then the star shows up with an Army Special Forces Captain, J. T. Wilder, as stunts advisor and ex-husband Connor gets bent-out-of-shape by the sexy soldier. It doesn't take long for Lucy to figure out something is very wrong with the movie. First, there's her sister who is abusing drugs. Second, there's the assistant director who's secretly the screenwriter who believes her movie is being hijacked, and finally there's the mysterious investor who insists that filming take place exactly his way. Oh, and down in the swamps is Moot, the alligator who's increasingly enjoying the food people bring him.There's instant attraction between Lucy and J. T., but it takes a while for each of them to overcome a long-held unwillingness to trust anyone. Still, if anyone is to survive the increasingly dangerous filming (and when the CIA gets involved, J.T. knows it is dangerous), the two need to work together. But will the secrets each refuses to give up destroy their chances for a relationship?DON'T LOOK DOWN is an intriguing attempt to combine the rich and quirky characters that Jennifer Crusie (see more BooksForABuck.com reviews of novels by Crusie) is famous for with convincing thriller action (co-author Bob Mayer is an ex-Green Beret). It's a good idea and it nearly works. The guns, helicopters, and male/male relationships add interest and depth to the story. I felt a bit short-changed both by the characters and by the action. J. T. was two-dimensional, Lucy wasn't much more (unlike Crusie's usual deeply layered characters). On the action side, the entire plot seemed too complicated, too far-fetched, and too incompetent for who was supposed to be involved and for what they were trying to achieve. Perhaps the Wonder Woman theme introduced early should have been a warning to expect comic-book characters and schemes.After a rough first chapter, though, the writing smoothed down and the Crusie/Mayer combination kept me intrigued and reading. Flaws and all, DON'T LOOK DOWN was a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Well, I had to read it even though the reviews weren't promising. What I liked about having it written by both a man and woman is that the male mind was portrayed more realistically than it usually is in books written by females.

Probably, although I have a mental picture of the editor being transported to a mental health facility after trying..."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that noted this book was difficult to \\"get into\\". I found the writing style to be disjointed, jumpy, and a detraction from the storyline. Not likely to spend $$$ on Crusie again, as this should have been an easy, enjoyable read and not torture."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Put simply - don't waste your money or time on this. I've read a number of Jennifer Crusie and expected a funny, well-constructed read. Instead, I found a confusing tale peopled with characters I couldn't care about.There are too many characters and stories competing for space here, the result of which is that nothing gets enough attention to make you care and the characters are cardboard. There are also a number of points where the story seems to jump or miss something - but I couldn't even care enough to figure out what I'd missed.The only consolation is that it was 50 per cent discounted, even in hardback (which says it all, I suspect, about sales) but I'm still sorry I wasted the cash on this sloppy junk."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I have totally loved every single book she has written until this one. The writing style was horrible, the story weak and not engaging (basically, it was dumb, like cartoon action), the characters superficial - in particular the cardboard, lifeless hero was totally uninteresting.

Can I get my money back?"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"The wit I've come to love in a Jennifer Crusie romance novel is combined with the action and attention to detail in a Bob Mayer (aka Robert Doherty) action thriller. Two voices, two unique points of view that blend fabulously. Plus, an alligator. How can you lose?"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I just couldn't put this book down. I read it on vacation and could barely lift my head from the pages to see the sights I'd paid good money for and spent loads of time traveling to see. Luckily, it didn't take long to finish, so I still got to enjoy my vacation! This is fast-paced fun, great sexual tension between Lucy and J.T., and amazingly convincing as a love story given that the whole thing takes place in four days. Loved all the minor characters, too, especially little Pepper and Moot the alligator. I just want MORE more more from these authors."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This is a great book! Crusie and Mayer do an excellent job of seemlessly tying in both of their perspectives. There's a reality to JT Wilder (the male character, and Bob's contribution) that is rarely found in Romance books.

I read the blog, I told my friends they had to give it a chance, I showed off the cover every chance I got.The JC magic just isn't there. The one character that almost, almost has it is the main character's five-year-old niece, and she's more twelve than five. That I can forgive. But the hero: UGH. He's no hero. I wanted Lucy to run screaming in any other direction, maybe even toward the alligator. Anything would be better than this he-man, jerk, poser who gets away with his actions simply because he's a Green Beret. Like that gives carte blanche to what he does. Lucy falling for him makes me dislike her. Of course, the falling for part was so strange, so off-camera, I was shocked it even happened. Chemistry: Non-existent. Sex, blah. But then with this hero, that's no surprise.One great scene involves Wonder Wear, and it gives me hope that maybe, just maybe this collaboration has hope of finding the magic JC's known for. I'll wait to hear what friends have to say before I buy the next one. I want the JC magic! Romance, mystery, I don't care. But I want it in a good story, and this isn't it."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"It is difficult to believe Jennifer Cruisie actually had a part in writing this book.

A reall winner and quite unique"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"It's a winner! Jenny Crusie is probably my all-time favorite romance author - she's in a class all her own. So I was thrilled to hear that she had a new book coming out, this time a collaboration with Bob Mayer, an ex-Green Beret. (Love those strong silent types! :) I didn't know what to expect with this collaboration. I think Jenny's books are absolutely magical, and I was afraid that a collaboration with another author would somehow change that -- but it didn't. The book is fantastic and I loved every word of it. The collaboration between Jenny and Bob is so smooth and seamless that you can't tell where one starts and the other one stops. They write together so well - I think because they share a similar sardonic sense of humor and wit. So, if you're a Crusie fan, you'll love it! Also, I really like reading the male's perspective that Bob Mayer adds to the book. His characters bring a new perspective which I find really refreshing and enjoyable to read. You can definitely see the male point of view in the book, and I think it actually makes a romance book better. I can't wait for their next book!!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Promising start, but then it just got way complicated and Wilder turned into a lecherous pig, sleeping with Althea. It just seemed to drag on and on to the point where I was just looking forward to being done.

Just not a good read."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I wanted this book after reading Agnes and the Hitman, but didn't buy it because of the negative reviews. Later, I found it discounted and didn't even realize it was the Cruise/Mayer collaboration I'd been looking at earlier. I should've known to just decide for myself and not listen to the reviews. I really enjoyed this book. It's funny how people's tastes differ. One reviewer found Pepper annoying. I found her delightful. Five stars."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This is my 2nd Jennifer Crusie novel borrowed on digital audio from my library. It was definitely hard to get into and I ended up not finishing the book even though I was less than 1/4 of the way through.

It distracted entireley from the story.Perhaps I'll try it in book form at some other time. :0)"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I expected a funny, witty, romance with a taut exciting story, I got a very unexciting, slow unbelievable story. The characters were hard to care about, and the story was so totally ridiculous I had to stop several times and think about what was going on.When she is asked by her ex-husband to finish out the 4 day shoot of stunts to end the filming of a movie, Lucy flies from New York. Her sister and niece, who was very obnoxious, are on the set also. Her ex-husband is the stunt coordinator. Lucy is directing because the first director had a heart attack.J.T. Wilder is a green beret that the star has hired to help him do his stunts as well as do some stunts. Later JT finds out he has been sent here because the CIA thinks a terrorist is using the movie for his own ends. The CIA agent and agency come off as being a few notes short of a song, Very inept.Lucy and Gloom, her asst. director, don't see the need for the stunts but they are getting paid. Lucy feels she has to save her sister from whatever is bothering her. It seems Lucy saves her sister all the time. Her sister and her niece have been living with her ex-husband for the last 12 years.I have to say if you are confused don't be surprised, I think everyone who reads this book will be confused as to why it was written. I didn't like the hero, who jumped the bones of the leading lady the first day he was there, she turned up nude in his bed. He never really recovered my respect after that. The story only covers 4 days and yet we are to believe he and Lucy find the love of their lives togather.I missed the witty repartee, I missed the funny human failures that bring so much enjoyment to a Crusie read. I was tired of the niece by the end of the first chapter. Mr. Mayer may write good spy novels but this was pathetic. I did finish reading it but I have to say I had very little sympathy for any of them and I just could not believe this was written by Jennifer Crusie. I was disappointed in the book and disgusted that I paid that much for it."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"This foray that Crusie and Mayer have taken into writing a novel together worked out really well. At the beginning I could tell the difference in the writing, but towards the end I didn't care, they both do a wonderful job folding in wit and emotion and action all into one novel. In the end I was very satisfied, I loved Lucy and I loved J.T., and I want to see more Pepper!!!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Personally, I loved it - its a fabulous read filled with suspense, humor and lots of great dialogue. Both authors are similar in writing tone and snappy wit and the change in POV's were virtually seamless to me. The heroine still has Jenny's characteristic features...she's strong, smart and definitely *snarky* - just what we've come to know and love from Crusie. The secondary characters were filled out well - I so loved Pepper's interaction with JT and Lucy. I'm really looking forward to more books from this partnership."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I read the other reviews - after I read the book. I really enjoyed this book and don't quite see what the other reviewers saw. This not just a Crusie book - it is a Crusie & Mayer book. I found the male perspective pretty humorous. The 'hero' had a hangover and didn't want to be a hero - he was attracted to Lucy against his better judgement. First, her ass. Second, her 'take charge' attitude. Third, her gumption in the swamp.He found her attractive but didn't want to think about it and he didn't want to articulate it - and yes, most men with a 'live for the moment' life of a soldier (who was not married or in a relationship) probably would have sex with the woman they found naked in their hotel rooms. And feel only kinda bad about it the next day!She didn't want a hero but kinda fell in love with someone she could count on to do the things he said he would do... and someone who had her back.There are some things that could use more development & perhaps a little more about the characters motivation. But this was a very fun, light & frothy read. This was also the first collaberation and I think these two authors works will only get better with time."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I'm not going to be long and drawn out because I hate it when someone trys to re-tell the entire story in their review.This book is a great collabrative effort, the writing blends seamlessly and I challenge you to pinpoint who wrote which part (except for the obvious small arms references).Expect to be entertained, just sit back and enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I loved this book. While I admit it felt like the romance was an after thought shoved in ther because that is what people expect, I found this book very fun. What also addded to my enjoyment was that my husband actually read it and enjoyed it. It read almost like a movie and if it was a movie I would pay theater prices to watch it. It had that feel of movies like Romancing the Stone.\\""},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I love jennifer cruise so I thought well a new book to read. Wow I did not like this. The people go by there last names by some people and first by others and there are too many people to do that lol.I agree with what one perosn said about jt jumping into bed with the lead actress and I just could not get over that. It was like no please no.If you liked this book I am glad you found something you like about it.I will say again I normally and all about her books"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"Just a quick note to encourage readers to buy the book... it was very entertaining-- I agree that the first chapter was little confusing with so many new charachters, but after that it was a fast paced fun story. I think a lot of the other reviewers were expecting straight up Crusie and were judging the book solely on the criteria that this was different. I'm betting if it was released under a psuedonym the readers would judge the book more on its own merits rather than it's differentness from sole Crusie fare. It's a well plotted\\"Romancing the Stone\\" sort of story and I very much enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I love Jenny Crusie and have actually purchased all of her books (unusual for me) because I love her witty dialogue and intelligent characters. This book however was a struggle. Still the same Crusie dialogue...but I didn't especially care for the characters. And the plot was SO STUPID! I mean really...it was completely and totally improbable that the only thing I could think of was the authors are trying to write a movie script posing as a novel. And, yeah, this would probably make a good movie, but as a novel it was a disappointment.Still, the dialogue moves it up to a 4*."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"The characters were shallow.

So this book must be really baaaadddd to get 1*. In fact, I would give it a 0* if I could.

This book is awesome but I will admit she kind of lost her vocie, that signature charm that lured me into her other titles. It took me awhile to get started on this one, but once I got started, I couldn't put it down!! It is a faced pased good with wit and romance. It's not her best (seeing as it is a co-written book) but it's definatly high on my list!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie's books, but not this one. The plot was unbelievable, boring, and depressing. It was unbelievable because I had a hard time buying the fact that a director was hired to finish 4 days of a movie shoot, not to mention the CIA, IRA, etc., etc., etc. angle. And, the hero and heroine were supposed to have started a long lasting relationship after the 4 days were over. Hard to believe, especially since the male main character spent the first day having a good time with the female star of the movie. No, she wasn't the heroine. It was boring because the characters were so 2-dimensional I just didn't care. It was depressing because I was supposed to like the male main character (the hero?), but after he had sex with the movie's female star just because she showed up naked in his bed, I couldn't wait for the book to end, which made me depressed about the money I spent on this book. My guess is that these two authors write great books on their own, but don't do so well as a team."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie books, and have read all of her previous novels. However, this book seemed too much action novel/romance/back to action. It has a split personality, and lacks the wonderful humor of Crusie's other books. Even the one eyed alligator named Moot misses the opportunity to be funny, and the idea that a child speaks without contractions to show that she is a child is a bit strained. I think that the action author should stick to action, and that Ms. Crusie should go back to the sort of writing that has given her such a large fan base. The combination was not appealing, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing the hard cover. You could wait for the paperback on this one, and even then, borrow it from someone else if you don't want to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, thinking it could be pretty exciting to pair Crusie's talents with those of a thriller writer. The book is much more Crusie than thriller, however. For Crusie fans, that's not a bad thing.Lucy Armstrong, a director of commercials, arrives on the set of a movie for which she has agreed to direct the last four days of shooting. The previous director died unexpectedly, so her ex-husband, the stunt coordinator for the movie, called her and asked her to come. She would have turned him down if her sister Daisy hadn't also been working on the movie, with her 5-year-old daughter Pepper in tow. The same day Lucy arrives, the lead actor shows up with his newly-hired stunt double, Special Forces captain JT Wilder.JT regrets taking the job almost immediately. The movie people seem crazy, the lead actress has him in her sights, and the director reminds him of Wonder Woman. He also finds out he was maneuvered into taking the job when he gets a call from the CIA. Seems the movie shoot is just a cover from some nefarious activities with the movie's backer. JT not only has to jump out of helicopters on film, he also has to keep Lucy and her family safe from the threats that suddenly come their way from some very bad people.The book is written in Crusie's signature style that always starts out feeling as if you entered a room in the middle of a conversation, but sweeps you up and takes you along for the ride. Her observations about people are humorous, the dialogue witty and tight, even with the five-year-old. The only sticking point with me is that JT and Lucy took all of four days to decide to spend the rest of their lives together, and I just think that could be handled a little more smoothly. In all, this is fun, lighthearted romance from Jennifer Crusie...and coauthor Bob Mayer, too."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down","review":"I was a little hesistant to buy this book, even though I love Jennifer Crusie's books, simply because I don't care for author collaborations, even if I enjoy both authors' book. In this case I had reason to be leery. The book Don't Look Down probably would have worked if it had just been an action book or a romance book but the plot seemed much too busy with the connection of the two elements.I've noticed that some of the other reviewers have made comments about all of the characters that were thrown into the beginning of the book and the problems that they faced trying to keep them straight while reading. I had this problem too, often reading and rereading passages of the book trying to make sense of the collection of characters that were brought into the story all at once. Often, I found myself confused as to who was the hero and who was the heroine of the story.The only interesting part of the story was the relationship between J.T. Wilder ( the hero, I finally figured out from the flap on the book cover) and the little girl, Pepper (who turns out to be the niece of the heroine). Though this book scratched the surface of who these characters were supposed to be, I have become used to Crusie's style of slowly unfolding different layers of depth to her characters and was left short at the end. None of the characters seemed deeper than two dimensional and the constant plot change of who was behind what was going on the movie set (CIA, FBI, and Army, just to name a few) kept me from really enjoying the book.In the future, I will continue to buy Jennifer Crusie's books, but only if it's a solo effort."},{"Title":"The Fussy Baby","review":"a really great directed approach for attachment style parenting. my only criticism is that the intended audience seems to be moms who are able to stay at home and dads that are away all day in the workforce. there aren't any approaches or direction for moms that need to return to work and dads who stay home, or for both working parents. it would be great to just be able to make the choice to not use babysitters, but that is not a viable option for a large majority of parents these days."},{"Title":"The Fussy Baby","review":"Great book, gave some great ideas for how to calm a fussy baby.

This book basically tells me what every mother and father already know. We don't need to know it will go away with TIME.

I should have looked at it's ranking number before I bought it, I think that says enough.I did take one more chance and also bought Dr. Marc Weissbluths, &quot;Sweet Babies&quot;, now that's a book that is worth buying and really what all parent's of colicky infant can use. Thank God someone knows what he is talking about!"},{"Title":"The Fussy Baby","review":"Even though my child was past six months by the time I had the energy to read this book, it validated the various strategies that I had attempted in order to have some relief from the screaming. My child screamed 95% of the time when we first brought her home and slept less than 8 hours a day. Many of these strategies provided me with at least temporary relief. Therefore I highly recommend the book, especially for the chapter on creative ways to soothe a fussy baby. Also, validation of the feelings of shared by parents of similar babies helps one feel understood at a time when perfect strangers constantly offer useless advice. The chapter on hidden causes of fussiness in infants is one that is still of interest to me as we as parents continue our search for answers to our struggle. I read other reviews that were not as complementary, however as a parent of one of the most difficult children that I have ever met (professionally, I deal with parents and children) this book was especially helpful to me in looking at our struggle from many different angles and feel encouraged that we will survive. Some are opposed to the idea of the &quot;family bed&quot; however if a child is truly difficult, parents are willing to try &quot;ANYTHING&quot;. The &quot;ANYTHING&quot; is what I believe the Sears have willing explored and shared. The only thing that would have been better for me was if this book would have been on videotape or audiotape so that my arms would not have been free to consume the information contained."},{"Title":"The Fussy Baby","review":"I found this book very useful - as the mother of a very fussy baby (now a very high need 2 and a half year old) I was at wit's end trying to figure out how to calm my baby and why she just didn't sleep like my friends' babies.

Other people told me I was spoiling my baby and I should change the way I was dealing with her crying, but I couldn't bear to let her suffer alone in her crib.This book is very supportive for parents who want to nurture and calm their fussy, colicky babies. I thought that the Sears' provided nice tips for handling baby and I also found there advice on breastfeeding helpful.My baby is now 10 months.

YOu start to doubt what is best for your child. This book really helped to reassure that I am doing what I FEEL is best for my daughter.

It's been a long road but now we're at 5 1/2 months and her temperament is dramatically improved. No plan or program can substitute for unconditional love.

It is themat so that is examines attitudes towards the Synagouge in one chapter and examines the attitude of Jews towards the Slave trade and other occupations in another area. It examines all facets of Jewish life from communal life to Rabbis, occupation, family life, marriage and clothing.A fascinating view into the life of Jews in Europe in the Middle Ages that shows the incredible diversity and depth of the Jewish community and shows how much we can learn about their culture and how they coped in a world that was often unsteady and insecure.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Jewish life in the Middle Ages (Jewish publication series)","review":"The most important thing to know about this book is that it was written at the end of the 19th century, before the Holocaust and before the spasm of hatred in the early 20th century that led to a mass exodus of Jews from Eastern Europe. Important, too, is where this book doesn't cover. There is almost no mention of Russia or the Baltic States, although Poland does come up several times. Also, as far as this book is concerned Scandinavia does not exist. Spain, France, Italy, England, Portugal, Germany, Palestine, Egypt and to some extent Morocco and Algiers are the regions of primary concern.The author takes pains at the beginning to point out that while the Medieval period may have been something of a Dark Ages for Christendom, the Jewish communities of Europe (or \\"Israel\\", as he refers to it) were shielded from much of that until the end of the period when they became increasingly isolated, culminating in being sent to live in ghettos in many areas, or simply exiled. However, Jews were frequently the subject of specific legislation which both limited what industries they could enter- money-lending in many areas was the only form of activity left open to them- and taxed them exorbitantly. At one point, the Jewish communities in England provided one-twelfth of the royal revenue. That communities could thrive despite that is remarkable.The topics covered here include religious life, social life, home life, marriage customs, love and courtship, games, clothing, trade, slavery and education, to name just a few. It discusses not only the laws governing a topic but the deviations by area as well as the ways in which restrictions were countered by different communities.The amount of knowledge the common Jewish man in Spain was responsible to master- everything from Religion and Philosophy to Optics and \\"Indian\\" mathematics- was staggering. The author makes the case that the Renaissance was ushered in by the Jews, to a great extent those who brought Arabic and Indian learning with them from Spain. He notes that Italy, where there were the fewest restrictions on Jews, was where the Renaissance initially flowered. I would agree.The book ends by exploring the relationships between Jews and Christians. That so many laws had to be issued so frequently to restrict social exchange between the two groups, the author argues, shows how deeply the communities were connected. The author cites many examples, famous and mundane, to show how often Jews and Christians worked and socialized together.The author appears to apologize in the introduction- and in places throughout the book- for the character of his contemporary co-religionist. These are the hardest parts of the book to read, in part because he never makes clear what, specifically, is wrong with the Jewish character, and in part because it smacks of the ingrained self-effacing seen in so many oppressed minority groups. But this, in and of itself, is instructive too.Recommended for any student of Jewish history."},{"Title":"A Topical Index to Matthew Henry's a Commentary on the Whole Bible","review":"Matthew Henry's whole commentary may seem verbose to modern ears, but this compilation of great quotable quotes gives the distilled essence of some of his deep, profound and moving insights into Scripture.For example:\\"It is better to serve God in solitude than serve sin with a multitude\\" -- Psa 84\\"The name of God is not found in the book of Esther but the finger of God is.\\""},{"Title":"Sermons on Biblical Characters","review":"16 sermons on biblical characters by one of the 20th century's most important and popular Methodist preachers.

Calhoun (Great American thinkers series)","review":"Richard N. Current's biography, John C. Calhoun, like Gaul, is divided into three parts: The Man and His Career, The Theory of Government, and Significance and Influence. I found it particularly useful in developing my understanding of the concept of sovereignty. I hope the following paragraphs adequately describe my conceptual journey through Calhoun's Theory of Government.Part 1: The Man and His CareerPart 1 provides a 31 page thumbnail sketch of Calhoun's public life from his rise to prominence as a nationalist and War Hawk in the years before the War of 1812 to his increasingly strident defense of slavery and states' rights in the second half of his career. He probably did as much to inflame passions in both the North and South as any single individual. Dr. Current's epitaph for him is: \\"In the desolated South of 1865 it could have aptly been said, if you seek his monument, look around you.\\"Part 2: The Theory of GovernmentThe substance and value of Dr Current's book lies in his articulation of Calhoun's Theory of Government which I will try to briefly outline.The Nature of Man and GovernmentMan is a social animal. Mankind never existed in a \\"state of nature\\" and did not one day collectively decide to form governments. Social structures and the means of collective decision making existed from the earliest ages and form the basis for governments. Governments are run by men who are motivated by their own self interest. Those in power naturally oppress and exploit the rest of the community unless prevented. A constitution (in a very broad sense) is the means by which the power of government is limited.The Nature of MajoritiesAn absolute or numerical majority is any subset of the entire population consisting of more than 50% of the population. Absolute majorities arise because different interest groups in the population form alliances to their mutual benefit, each giving up something in the process. Once an absolute majority if formed, only some form of constitution can prevent the possibility of tyranny.Calhoun supported the concept of \\"The Concurrent Majority\\" as the basis for an effective constitution. Under this concept, government is constrained from acting unless all interest groups with a voice in government agree upon the proposed action. Each interest group has a veto. Obviously, the key to making the Concurrent Majority concept work lies in the identification of these interest groups. Under the US Constitution, Calhoun viewed the states as the interest groups. He also cited other examples: (1) the Roman model of Patricians who controlled the Senate and Plebeians who elected their Tribunes with veto power over the Senate and (2) the British model of the king (who consumed tax revenues), the House of Commons (which represented the tax payers), and the House of Lords (who defended their own status quo, thereby keeping either the King or Commons from accruing the power to rule alone.)Sovereignty and PowerThe concept of sovereignty evolved to describe and justify the absolute power of kings. Sovereignty is indivisible and absolute regardless of whether the sovereign is the king or \\"we the people\\". Sovereignty is the ultimate source of governmental power. However, unlike sovereignty, governmental power can be divided among different entities. Following the American Revolution, the people of the 13 individual states became 13 sovereign entities. Via the Constitution, they granted certain enumerated powers to the federal government but retained their sovereignties. In Calhoun's system, the concept of sovereignty divided between the states and the federal government was a logical impossibility. Either the states were sovereign or they were not. He also rejected the idea of One American People: The United States were created by the peoples of the 13 states when they ratified the Constitution in their 13 state conventions.In Calhoun's system, the powers of constitution-making and law-making were separate. The peoples of the states, being sovereign, had the power to make constitutions and, as a practical matter, delegated that power to state constitutional conventions (or their standing legislatures acting in place of conventions). Under the state constitutions, the state legislatures were given the power to make laws acting on individuals to regulate their behavior. The critical difference is that the legislatures cannot act on their own authority to change the state constitutions. Similarly, the sovereign peoples of the 13 original states delegated the power to draft a federal constitution to the delegates they sent to Philadelphia in 1787. That draft constitution then required ratification by the people of each state before it became effective in that state. Thus, the sovereign people of each state created two governments, a state government and a federal government, but sovereignty, the ultimate authority, remained with the peoples of the individual states.In legal terms, Calhoun viewed the US Constitution as a compact among the states. The states were the legal principals and the federal government their agent. In this setting, the power to determine whether an act of congress was constitutional lay with the states not with the federal government or any of its branches. Therefore, the US Supreme Court has no authority to determine the constitutionality of any law, regardless of the claims of Chief Justice Marshall.Nullification and SecessionThe idea that a state can nullify an act of congress that the state believes is unconstitutional flows directly from Calhoun's concepts of The Concurrent Majority and the sovereignty of the peoples of the individual states. Examples of nullification include the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 which declared the Alien and Sedition Acts of the Adams administration unconstitutional and without force, and South Carolina's nullification of the \\"Tariff of Abominations\\" in 1831.In Calhoun's theory of government, when a state has nullified a federal law, the supporters of the law can use the constitutional amendment process to change the constitution to declare the law constitutional.If the amendment is approved, the nullifying state must accept that decision or secede from the union. Since the union was created by the individual states ratifying the Constitution in state conventions, each sovereign state has the right to call a new convention for the purpose of revoking its prior ratification and thereby removing itself from the union.Given the difficulty of the amendment process, the more likely outcome would probably be that the amendment fails to gain approval. In this case, the nullified law is void in the nullifying state. However, it is not clear what status the law would have in other states. Would it be valid outside the nullifying state(s)? I didn't find a clear answer to this problem which could have potentially created a nightmare of determining which federal laws were valid in each state. It seems to me that the only logical answer, which seems consistent with the concept of the Concurrent Majority, is that the nullified law would become void in all states if it were nullified by one and the constitutional amendment failed to validate it.Slavery and Class ConflictCalhoun developed his detailed theory of government, in part, to protect southern slavery. There seems little to be gained from analyzing this dead issue, so I won't.In the process, however, Calhoun started with Locke's labor theory of value (a product's value is the sum of the labor that went into its manufacture) and developed a model of economic class conflict that predated Marx and Engels. (I wonder if they appropriated some of Calhoun's ideas). Calhoun's goal in this exercise was to forge an alliance between southern planters and northern capitalists against the forces of abolition and militant labor. In the process, he hoped to convince northern industrialists that high, protective tariffs were not in their best interest. While the tariffs did shield their products from foreign competition in the American market, they also reduced both their potential sales in foreign markets and eliminated the stimulation that foreign competition would have exerted on American manufacturing efficiency.Part 3: Significance and InfluenceIn Part 3 Dr. Current provides his critical analysis of Calhoun's Theory of Government, most of which I agree with. Rather than summarize it here, I'll offer one brief argument. Calhoun's Theory rests on the definition of sovereignty as absolute and indivisible. This definition was justified by usage of the term going back to William Blackstone, Thomas Hobbes, and Jean Bodin. However, Dr. Current cites one counterexample that invalidates this definition in the American constitutional system: The territories of the United States are under the legal control of Congress and, therefore, not sovereign. To become a state, Congress first passes an enabling act authorizing the people of the territory to hold a convention to draft a state constitution. Congress then reviews the draft state constitution and, if it is found to be consistent with the US Constitution, Congress declares the territory a state. This arrangement effectively negates the arguments that sovereignty is absolute and indivisible and resides entirely with the peoples of the various states.Reviewer's CommentsSince Calhoun's Theory rests on an apparently false assumption, his conclusions cannot be accepted as valid. However, it does not follow that are they necessarily all false. They are, in any case, an elegant exercise in logic.Dr. Current's description of Calhoun's Theory was a great help in clarifying my thinking about the nature of sovereignty. In the American historical experience, I think that I now see sovereignty as an evolving concept. Under the Articles of Confederation, it resided entirely with the states. In the years since the Constitution was ratified, sovereignty has moved progressively away from the states and toward the federal government. One may approve or disapprove but it is hard to deny that this has happened."},{"Title":"The Flying Pencil: Dornier Do 17 and Do 215 (Schiffer Military History)","review":"The Dornier Do 17, along with the Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88, was one of principal Luftwaffe bombers of the early war period.

It starts in chronological format covering the first Do 17 prototypes before moving on to the production E, F, M, P, and Z versions, as well as the Do 215 derivative. Much of the narrative in this book is unfortunately weak and can be found in other published books such as J.R. Smith and Antony L. Kay's \\"German Aircraft of the Second World War\\" or David Mondey's \\"The Hamlyn Concise Guide to Axis Aircraft of World War II.\\" The strength of Nowarra's book lies in the large numbers of photographs it possesses. Also thrown in are several line drawings of the different Do 17 versions and a couple three-view illustrations. The book concludes with technical data for several versions discussed. Finally, what is missing besides a strong narrative are color plates which would be useful for modelers."},{"Title":"The Flying Pencil: Dornier Do 17 and Do 215 (Schiffer Military History)","review":"As always from this collection, this book is impressive, with a lot of interior and exterior photos, and drawings with colour.

It rises from the surrounding plains to an elevation over 8000 feet above sea level. The irregular rim of the crater is about a mile in circumference and this small pamphlet, published over forty years ago, presents and explains the highlights that one may see hiking the crater rim. This little book also contains some very nice lines drawing of the sights.It is important to note that this book has been out of print for many years, but it is relatively easy to find a used copy."},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Amazon River Rescue","review":"This work certainly may be aimed at children but I was totally absorbed in every page that I read, and excited to see how the story would unfold.Riley is going on a river expedition through the Amazon Rainforest while visiting his Uncle Max, who just happens to be a world-famous conservation biologist.Riley is excited, and with his cousin Alice, he sets out to help discover new plant and animal species. The adventure begins as the children stray too far from camp and use a very interesting tree to be rescued. Quite an amazing tree I might add. Who would have thought a tree could do what this one did?During their adventure, the authors give insightful facts about the Rainforest. Interweaving them within the storyline, children will learn without even realizing that is what they are doing, about the importance of the Rainforest to the earth and the unbelievable amount of plant and wildlife that live there.The illustrations are dramatic, colorful and realistic and will totally draw any young person along the story trail,and make them wish they too could be there to discover a new insect, plant or animal that the world has yet to know.This is an outstanding work, a beautiful book and a resource of great educational value.Highest recommendation.Shirley Johnson"},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Amazon River Rescue","review":"August 30, 2004Nine-year-old Riley travels to Brazil to visit his uncle Max, aunt Martha, and cousin Alice.

In their quest to find home Riley and Alice encounter the many wonders of the Amazon.This is a delightful book that children as well as adults will enjoy.

I was so excited when Iris started releasing this series again. Although Loveswept were formula romance novels, she pushed the envelope for the time.

It seemed she wanted to tell Gunners story, but the story was not as large as the character."},{"Title":"STAR LIGHT, STAR BRIGHT (CLANAD)","review":"Story was a little strange and definitely not one of my favorite Iris Johansen novels."},{"Title":"Gog","review":"I first read this book in high school, and it altered my reality.The seamless blending between ancient myth (Gog & Magog), amnesiac dreamstate and lucid adventure story keeps the reader in a continuous state of bewildered disorientation. The adventures of the lead character -- who remains nameless except for assuming the name of Gog -- are wild and wooly in the tradition of late '60s London. In fact there's a fairly graphic rape scene somewhere in the book which my parents happened upon, leading them to burn my copy in a fit of Bradbarianism.It took me several (pre-internet) years to find another copy, which now remains among my most cherished possessions."},{"Title":"Gog","review":"I enjoyed this book. Let me quote from the review by the Wall Street Journal, blurbed on the paperback:&quot;Mr. Sinclair's novel is wild, confusing, but fascinating. The author displays an explosive, overspilling talent...laughter, horror,violence, and lust are all facets of Gog's unconcluded quest-journey which may be long remembered.&quot;I second."},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is filled with loads of good information in lay terms to help family members, friends, teachers, social workers, etc. understand the various childhood cancers and their often complex treatments. Every family having a child diagnosed with cancer should automatically be given this book, because it contains so much information on diagnosis, procedures, tests, treatments and side effects. It also realistically discusses the potential effects on a whole family when a child is diagnosed with cancer, and provides tips on how to have an active and constructive relationship with doctors and nurses. The authors apparently interviewed a lot of parents who've been down this road and you can read their ideas and suggestions about how to deal with all sorts of issues from the mundane (how to get your child to take a certain medication) to the tremendously difficult (how to deal with relapse or talk to a child about death). I wish this had been available when my child was first diagnosed!"},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation fully endorses this book and places it on the 'must have resource list' for any parent whose child is diagnosed with any type of solid tumor cancer. This comprehensive guide provides extensive information on the diagnosis, prognosis, procedures, treatment and side effects of neuroblastoma, Wilms Tumor, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and bone sarcomas. Included is a thorough explanation of the various chemotherapy drugs used in treatment and their common side effects. Detailed information on radiation therapy, surgery and bone marrow transplantation is also included. Additionally, the book provides practical advice to families on related issues such as nutrition, returning to school and the end of treatment. The book addresses the emotional impact that such a cancer diagnosis places upon the child, their family and friends and offers practical insight on how to cope. A comprehensive list of childhood cancer websites, support organizations and additional reading materials is listed at the back of the book. The authors'extensive interviewing of families who have 'walked down this road' offers hope to those whose 'journey' has just begun."},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"This book was recommended to me after my daughter was diagnosed with nueroblastoma. It explains it all. The book is broken down by topic (ie radiation and chemotherepy) and also by tumor.The language used was easy to understand. The book was my map through the world of childhood cancer."},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"If you have found yourself catapulted into the nightmare of having a child with cancer, this book will help you to understand much of the journey to come. No matter what stage your child is in treatment...beginning, middle, finished treatment, relapsed, or palliative...this book is an indispensible resource. Personal stories peppered throughout the book help you come to realize that you are not alone in this battle. This book also has a wonderful list of resources to help families through this hard time. Buy one for yourself, family members (especially in-laws!), your child's pediatrician, your child's teacher, and your closest friends so they can have a glimpse into what you and your child are facing and can help you along the way. This book should be given to EVERY parent when they hear those horrible words, &quot;Your child has cancer...&quot;"},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"I am a Pediatric Oncology Nurse that buys these books to give to the newly diagnosised families. All of them have told me that it is a wonderful tool."},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is amazing. I keep it handy at home to help answer my questions or learn more about the disease. My daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma right before Christmas and this book was given to us by a social worker in the hospital. There is an entire chapter about retinoblastoma as well as chapters on many other solid tumor cancers. There are real stories from parents and it is written in language that is informative but easy to understand. It is especially helpful right after diagnosis when all of the jargon is still new. I would caution people to take the advice given in the book and only read sections that are relevant to your situation at the time."},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","review":"I cannot overstate how helpful this book was to me. My daughter was diagnosed with Wilms (kidney) cancer 14 months ago. This book was given to me several days after her initial diagnosis and I turned to it many, many times over the long journey to recovery. Even today, with my daughter happily in remission, I turn to it for help in dealing with late side effects and the emotional consequences of the rollercoaster that is childhood cancer. Of all the books I have read over the past 14 months (and there have been many - I'm an avid reader), this one was absolutely the best. If I could, I would buy up all the copies and give it to every parent of a child with a solid tumor."},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","review":"This was the text for part of our Field Camp. I was fortunate enough to have the Dr. Fritz as my personal guide to Yellowstone National Park. I still use the book as a reference in my personal studies of U.S. Geology. It is must for anyone traveling to Yellowstone with even the most remote interest in Geology."},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","review":"I'm a nerd. I was left with nothing to read in the cold nights. I was also having trouble sleeping. I thought this book would help.Yes it put me to sleep because reading about rock and millenia of dirt moving is tiresome.But what I absorbed made me look at yellowstone in a new way. The book was quite clear-and I could see and easily understand how Americas greatest monument to beauty was madeof millions of years.It's like seeing the Louvre after taking an art class. The paint on canvass comes alive with history and meaning.So too if you read this."},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","review":"We purchased this book while in Wyoming after we came across the Roadside Wyoming book at Devil's Tower. The geology so intrigued us and the kids that finding this book in the National Park Service store made our summer trip even more enjoyable. As you travel through Yellowstone, this book is like a personal guide to the geologic features. It goes beyond the typical travel guide explaining the sites since it is from the geologic perspective. We have purchased other titles in this series after our Wyoming/Yellowstone purchase. Recommended reading as you travel through Yellowstone."},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","review":"Although parts of the book are too technical for an amateur like myself, I very much enjoyed reading about the tortured genesis of Yellowstone Country. I wish I had read it before I visited the park, but it was still fun and very informative. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in rocks and earth history."},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","review":"There is a lot going on underground in Yellowstone and this book helps to make sense of it all"},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","review":"The title sums it all up. The book is indeed useful, you can find all sorts of neat features by using it, but it really is a bit simplified. Perhaps it's just me, but it was GREAT for my kids (8 and 11) who are both, well, they read. Anything. As long as they can catch it."},{"Title":"Applied Principles of Hydrology (3rd Edition)","review":"For an introduction to hydrology this is a good book, but it's a little too basic and laymen for my tastes. This criticism aside, the information in this book is nevertheless good and adequate to provide you with decent background information in hydrology.If you've had any education in basic meteorology, climatology, oceanography, etc... you won't find this book very useful since it is mostly a recap of 101 courses in the physical sciences, but for the rest of us who haven't had much experience in these fields, this book is not only very informative, but it is a very interesting read... who would've known the molecular structure of water was so unique and life-sustaining?! Alter it even a little and life would be impossible, lakes would freeze from the bottom up instead of the top down... and other weird possibilities! For the beginner, this book is easy to read, avoids math, and provides a relatively strong foundation.I recommend this book the 90% of you who want to learn more about the physical sciences... but for the 10% looking for more details over what they already learned in beginning courses, look for another book since this one will only recap that info."},{"Title":"Applied Principles of Hydrology (3rd Edition)","review":"I picked up a copy of this book many years ago (probably an earlier edition). I thought it might be a candidate as a text for an introductory hydrology class for young civil engineers. I read the book and even used it one semester. I can offer a few comments on that basis.First, this book is well-written. The language is clear and the prose is enjoyable. In fact, for a book intended to convey scientific material, it is exceptionally well-written and clearly understandable be anyone with a reasonable background.When I used this book in the class, it was as a supplemental book intended to be a reader. I don't know whether the students appreciated it or not, but that was my intent.What the book doesn't do is present technology. If you need to apply technology, then this book is not useful. A standard engineering textbook is required to provide that information. Viessman and Lewis is competent in this regard and is also well-written.However, if you want to understand hydrologic principles without the need to execute computations, this book will do that very well. You will find much of what you want to know about hydrology from Manning's book. Then, if you need to execute computations, another text with that material will be more approachable, given the knowledge derived from Manning's book.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn basic hydrology, particularly those who do not need to do hydrologic computations."},{"Title":"Applied Principles of Hydrology (3rd Edition)","review":"Very disorganized. TERRIBLE... TERRIBLE.... TERRIBLE INDEX. \\"Reservoir\\" -- subject covered over multiple pages-- is not included in the index. SERIOUSLY?! Pray your actual class isn't as painful as this book.PS- NO COLOR (not okay considering how many photographs are included)"},{"Title":"Applied Principles of Hydrology (3rd Edition)","review":"I ordered this book for a geology class, \\"Water and Society\\". The book is simple yet complete enough to leave the reader with a full understanding of all aspects of the hydrology cycle."},{"Title":"The Fragmentation of the Church and Its Unity in Peacemaking","review":"For those wanting an orientation to the breadth of Christian thinking on the proper relationship between Church and State, particularly as it concerns war, there is no more current collection than this one. Particularly in times when many churchgoers in the West may be wondering whether it is right to be waging war against a largely unknown enemy, this collection is startingly broad and eminently readable. Rempel, furthermore, is no mere academic, but an accomplished peace practitioner working at the United Nations."},{"Title":"The Fragmentation of the Church and Its Unity in Peacemaking","review":"Peace is said to be a central theme in Christian scripture, but through the ages, different churches have persued this each in their own ways. There is an ecumenical effort under way now to bring unity to Christainity and peacemaking is one of the areas of hope. This book is the result of a consultation put on by the National Council of Churches to find ways to bring unity to Christainity. There are 11 essays by 10 different demoninations printed here. They are fascinating. As much as I enjoyed reading the essay by the Quaker (being one myself) I also really enjoyed reading the essays from the Lutheran, Mennonite,Orthodox, Brethren, Catholic, Refromed, Asseblies of God, Baptist, and Church of Christ perspectives. The essays speak of both the history of each church in terms of peacemaking, as well as thier current views. There was a lot I didn't know about the changes in attitude in regard to the just war tradition, for example. I wasn't aware of how other churches have grown and changed in the last forty years or so. I enjoyed this book very much and found it pretty accessible (for a non-academic)."},{"Title":"The sea otter in the eastern Pacific Ocean, (North American fauna)","review":"This book is an essential piece of literature for anyone interested in the behavior, ecology or morphology of Northern sea otters. It is well written, with a fair amount of pictures, but most importantly, it gives so much information while keeping the reader's interest."},{"Title":"The Sayings of the Desert Fathers","review":"Pope John Paul The Great suggested to the world that its unfamilarity with the writings of the Eastern Church was a loss to those so deprived. There was a time in which there was only the Catholic Church. As Newman found these authors they levered him back to truth. Without the Pope's prompting few would venture to study the early Church. Orthodox Greeks might consult the Philokalia and Russian Orthodox might be aware of Soloviev but us regular uninformed sorts would not. The reviewed book is similar in giving us something of great value but it comes hard like all good things. I'm afraid that we have to become time travelers to get at the core of this work and that probably means many readings. Even then, I'm not sure that we can unlock the treasures even though the sayings seem to be quite simple. I'd quote several but I've lent the book to a friend-perhaps Amazon will allow a peek at a page or two? Take the time to attend a Greek Orthodox service or a Byzatine Rite service and you will see and feel kinship with what is now called the extraordinary form of the Mass (in Latin)."},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"One of the best collection of short stories I've read in years. Each story is a completely unique gem, and there is a wealth of material within this book. The stories are almost &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; like in that there is usually a very good twist ending, and they are never predictible. Some are quite funny, some scary, and some rather dark and sinister. Shades of Salinger, Vonnegut, Serling, but really, just check it out for I.J. Schecter himself. It's his first book, and he's one to watch. The story about the kid trying to cure her parents of coffee addiction is worth the price alone. Other noteworthy stories include one about God as a precocious child attending summer camp, and a future in which you pay a fortune to be able to take a short nap during the work-week which is now weeks long without break. Cheers."},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"I've never read a book so funny and so warped at the same time. Many of the stories had me laughing out loud, while a few also kept me chilled for days. I read a lot of different writers, and Schecter's voice is completely unique from anything else I've seen. His characters and plots are original. His style is fluid and clean. God as a camper! Sleepwalkers on jumbo jets! Two hundred pushups to prove one's love! I don't know where he gets his ideas, but they're wonderful! After finishing the last story, I was wishing for fifteen more. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"Found most of the stories in this collection to be on the Stephen King side of writing. The story about the children at the beach was particularly fascinating. The writer seems to have a thing for death and baseball, in a whimsical sort of way.Judging by the gentleman's photo, he seems like a normal sort - but I'm not sure I'd want to meet him in person. Quite bizarre!"},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"I haven't had this much fun inside of a book in years! I.J. Schecter is truly one of Canada's fastest rising literary stars - someone, I hope, is paying attention to this kid. There's everything in here: sex, violence, terror, romance, giggles, blood curdling screams and belly laughs."},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"I.J. Schecter's first piece of work, The Bottom of the Mug is a real page turner. Every story is imaginitive and revealing. I found so many of the stories to touch something from my past. Schecter has the ability to grasp at something from within the reader's own experiences and put the appropriate words to it. Its a tremendous mix of humour, love, youth, and the unknown. You literally never know what you'll get next, but I guarantee you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"This is the best short story collection I've ever read. It takes rare talent to write stories which are so enjoyable and disturbing. On the back cover, Peter Trueman writes, &quot;Schecter writes with ease and sophistication.&quot; This comment hits the mark precisely.Mr. Schecter's ideas are original and his characters vividly drawn. Though most of the stories would best be described as contemporary satire, many of the themes in The Bottom of the Mug deal with current issues - overpopulation and obsessive behavior, for example. The difference is that Mr. Schecter gives these themes hilarious treatment. His timing and ear for dialogue are wonderful.For the record, my favourite stories were &quot;The Overbearing Camper,&quot; &quot;Summertime and Birthdays,&quot; and &quot;Ump.&quot; I'm still thinking about that poor umpire!"},{"Title":"The Bottom of the Mug","review":"I.J. Schecter's debut collection is a brilliant mix of funny characters, fresh dialogue, zinging wit, and a page-turning style. The stories in this book all have amazing pace and acceleration. It's difficult to read just one at a time. Without revealing too much, let me say that my favorite story is the one about God as a 10-year-old camper. I also loved the one about the bumbling gangsters in Kansas. Skip the books about politics, the economy, and self-help. The Bottom of the Mug offers a refreshing change of pace from a dazzling new author. I can't wait for I.J. Schecter's next book!"},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"Love to start your day in an empowering way? If yes, this might be for you.

Each day's reading is inspiring and designed to allow the reader to see that we are each and all children of God, totally loveable and forgiven for our sins through Christ. Each day's reading gives a clear picture of how we can recognize and utilize our God-given gifts to be the person God intended us to be. I cannot recommend this book more highly for the help it gives in understanding what a wonderful and joyous life God wants for each of us. Learning to accept God's love opens us to unlimited exchange of love and caring with our fellow man. What more can we ask! Moreover, it clearly directs us to ask what we will of God since He wants to do all He can for us.

Each entry has another insight for beginning each day, and really helps give me something important to think about during my daily activities."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"This book of daily devotions contains unpublished and published works including selections fromThe Sermon on the MountandPower Through Constructive Thinking. There are poems, prayers, scriptural passages and their exegesis. The theme is personal transformation and the practice of the presence of God. The main theme is that there exists a power that can liberate the captive and transform one's life for the better. This power of being is the Kingdom of God within (Luke 17:21), the power indwelling in consciousness. It is the invitation of Psalm 55:22 - Cast your burden upon the Lord.The text begins with an explanation of Isaiah 9:6, the attributes of God as Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father and Prince of Peace. God is Spirit and we must worship Him in spirit and truth. The seven main aspects of God's nature are revealed as Life, Truth, Love, Intelligence, Soul, Spirit and Principle. Compound attributes consist of 2 or more of these, for example Beauty is made up of Life and Truth whilst Wisdom is a compound of Love and Intelligence.Much information is given on the concept of scientific prayer, which is the practice of the presence. When confronting a problem for example, it is wise to think about God instead of the difficulty. The book is highly inspirational and uplifting and an antidote to spiritual exhaustion caused by wrestling with religious dogma and doctrines. I also recommendAlter Your Lifeby this author andThe Hidden Power of the Bibleby Ernest Holmes."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"No matter what day it is, the reading touches on a part of my life.

Readers beware! This is not a &quot;whatever you want to believe&quot; tome. Rather, it's a gleaning from his larger work &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot; as well as other writings, published and unpublished. Designed as a book of daily brief devotional thought, it delivers enough of a thought for the day that the spirit's thirst will be quenched, and its hunger satisfied, for a day.

At that time Ileft the church I grew up in. Disillusioned with all I believed growing upa friend gave me one of Emmet Fox's books. Through his many lectures published,I found a new profound way of connecting with God.Around the Year with Emmet Fox is one of his 7 inspirational books."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"This has been a great addition to my morning routine. I love his way of relaying the lessons of scripture. I'm very open minded when it comes to matters of religion and spirituality, and this book has been a breath of fresh air. Nothing that conflicts with my liberal religious views."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"If you've read Emmett Fox's interpretation of \\"The Sermon on the Mount,\\" you know that he sees the bible as a series metaphors and poetry, as well as an account of the life of Jesus Christ. No problem. But if you're in need of a daily spiritual word, this is not the book for you. His daily readings are very much geared toward the intellect and not the emotional or spiritual. I kept it on my bedside table and read the daily entry for about two weeks until I realized I was thinking too much. Try \\"God Calling\\" for daily, concise inspiration. This is more intellectual self-help with a slash of the Spirit."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"Everything I've read from Fox has a few brilliant insights, then a bunch of useless filler. This is no different."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"Although the paper is a bit thin and flimsy. . . .the books were delivered in excellent condition and totally effective."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"For the record, Oswald Chambers would have NOTHING to do with Emmet Fox; I would unhesitatingly go as far as to say that he would EMPHATICALLY DENOUNCE Fox (as a crackpot and as ANTI-Biblical/Christian). Of course he never did any of this because NO ONE knew who Fox was in his time, practically speaking. I just googled his name and you will see that there is NO scholarly work on him, no reference materials; the wiki page is almost a wisp and offers no historical DOCUMENTATION (Carnegie Hall/5,500 member church, etc.). Whether any one of these details is true; if not for AA his books would not sell enough to be in print[either true or not true!]. I will also say that, unless someone is researching AA itself, ZERO seminaries or academies (philosophy or religion or American History depts.) discuss Fox, his concepts or New Thought. Why would that be? (Because he offered nothing worthy of study!)My point is that Fox offers New Age pablum, which rides on the back of biblical teaching to [sound] authoritative but is actually just an attempt to subvert it. This guy's [weird] [vague] [insubstantial] teachings would have been lost to the dustbin of history if not for AA members making it the most recommended non-conference-approved literature in the program. I love my recovery and would like to have the record straight."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"The most introspective, Inspirational Daily Reading book I have come across in my seventy-six years.

Its better than getting preached at by people who don't understand that the Bible is meant to be used as a manual for the living...not a \\"how to book\\" to avoid hell."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"This man is a miracle. This book is a gift. I read it every day, every year. I have had to get a second copy because the first is thread-bare. It is dog-eared, highlighted and annotated from cover to cover. Give yourself this gift. You will not regret it!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"I bought this book for a friend because he really likes Emmet Fox. When I received the book, I leafed through it and found it very interesting. Once I gave my friend the book, I went to look something up in it, and realized it was not at my place anymore, I have decided that since I like it so much, I will order one for myself as well as one for my father for Christmas. Emmet Fox is very logical and inspiring. He is a great teacher."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox: A Book of Daily Readings","review":"My first copy of this book was one that I shamelessly asked for from a fellow member in recovery in P.V., Mexico. It looked like it had been in the sun and the sand, and maybe splashed by the ocean for many a day. It was water stained and the pages were crumpled, yellow and wavy. Pages slipped to the floor. I read the book, everyday, while it continued to fall apart in my hands, for the full year. I have since purchased a brand new copy that now sits on my book shelf, full of wisdom and challenges, waiting for me to go around the year again. I'm not sure when that will be, but I hold this volume dear to my heart. I am grateful.
