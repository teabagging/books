She is now Mrs. Brandon and have just returned from her ten-month honeymoond with Luke, having travelled all over the world. As usual, she was addicted to shopping, buying multiple of things she don't need and having them shipped secretly back to London, without Luke's knowledge. Eager to return home after her long honeymoon, Becky was in for a surprise when her parents introduced her long-lost sister, Jess to her. Becky was especially eager to have a sister as she felt that her best friend, Suze, had replaced Becky while she way away. Unfortunately, Jess was totally different from Becky and winning her heart would prove to be very challenging.Even though many people find Becky's behavior to be annoying and irritating, I find that this is still a fun book to read, especially if you have been following the Shopaholic series. It's fast-paced, sweet, and contains many funny moments. The way Kinsella ended her book, there may be possibly be a fifth book of this series. This is definitely a must-read book for all Sophie Kinsella's fans."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I immediately started reading this book when I received it in the mail and finished it in about 3 hours. I have the other books from the series and loved them all as well. This latest addition is any better than the others, but a great continuation of the trials and tribulations of Becky Bloomwood-Brandon. The author, Sophie Kinsella, once said in an interview how much she missed Becky and that's why she wrote a fourth book. As soon as I started reading I realized I felt the same way! Becky is such a wonderful character and anyone can relate to her, even if you don't like to shop! Everyone has their own flaws they can never seem to get over, but they still have those wonderful people in their lives who still love them in spite of it all!Anyone who is reading this has hopefully already read the synopsis of the book. As you know, Becky has found out she has a long lost half sister who is her complete opposite and everything of course goes downhill. She also begins having problems with her husband and best friend to boot!This is of course highly recommended for fans of the other three Shopaholic books and fans of chick lit in general. I dont' want to give away the end, but from what I can tell I hope Ms. Kinsella is getting busy on book #5! :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as others from the author. \\"Becky, character in these books are just too funny'.

Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was really excited when I found there would be a fourth Shopaholic book since I loved reading the first three. When I started reading, it was easy to get back into even though it had been a while since I read the others. Becky still had her quirks and it was fun to see how her and Lukes honeymoon was going. Like always it was also fun to read about her shopping adventures and find out what extravagent purchases she had made this time that she could not afford.After she met her sister though, the book started to go down hill. Becky became so self-absorbed trying way to hard to win her sister over. To me, this didn't seem to fit Becky's character. Another big dissapointment was some of the problems she was facing with those close to her and the way she handled them.I managed to get myself through the book, laughing at some parts and frowning at others, and was happy I finished it. The ending throws a twist in and makes you wonder in anticipation about Becky's next big adventure."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book is the fourth in a series of Shopaholic books that follows the life of Rebecca Bloomwood.In this book Rebecca and her husband are on their honymoon when they get an invitation to the christning of the twins of Suze (Becky's friend) They decide to go back to England and surprize everybody, but they dont expect how things have changed since they have been gone.Fist Suze has a new best friend andBecky's father has another daughter whom she did not know aboutWhen Becky tries to get to know Jessie (her sister) things do not go as planned. Jess is the opposite of Becky and that causes some problems between the two of them. When Luke (Becky's husband) goes out of town Becky goes to visit Jess, but finds her unwilling to forgive her for the things that she said to her. She even goes so far as to say that they might not even be sisters.After being stranded on a mountain in a rainstorm they form a sisterly bond and Becky helps Jess work on a protest.

One, that Luke is one of the people involved with the opposition of the protest and two-that she is pregnant"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Shopaholic & Sister by Sophie Kinsella follows the same theme as the other books in the Shopaholic series (excessive, over the top spending of naive, but charming Becky). However, the latest addition to the Shopaholic series just didn't capture me as the other books did. The storyline was bland and I felt there were parts of the story that could have been expanded more (Suze's new friend). The wit and humor millions found in the first few books in the Shopaholic series came from us being able to relate to the scenarios Becky Bloomwood got herself into. They were believable to the point where you would cringe with embarrassment because an all too similar event happened to you! In Shopaholic and Sister I felt Kinsella was trying too hard to force wit and humor in this book. It was difficult to relate to the situations Becky gets herself into because, quite frankly, they were too over the top-even for Becky. I gave this a three star rating because although Shopaholic & Sister was a bit bland it still was lighthearted and did have its funny moments."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"It may be time for the heroine of the Shopaholic books to hang up her credit card. Although the fourth installment of the series is good; the extreme shopping tendencies of Rebecca Brandon and the overly dramatized ANTI-shopping tendencies of her sister are just too much. I found myself saying 'Oh c'mon, give me a break' many times. The author, Sophie Kinsella, should have left the books as a trilogy and moved on."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was introduced to the series a year ago by by best friend, and have loved every Becky Bloomwood book. I sit and wait patiently for the next one to be published."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"In this, the fourth installment, int the Becky Brandon (Nee Bloomwood) Shopaholic Series, we join Becky and Luke at the tail end of their \\"around the world honeymoon.\\" Becky is mastering Yoga and Luke is as relaxed as ever. As a reader I started to think that my friends had changed - maybe this would be a good thing!Before long, Becky and Luke decide to return to reality and it is very apparent that neither of them really changed, they were just on a holiday from real life!On suprize return to london, Becky finds Suze has a new best friend and her parents are acting very strange. Maybe the suprize part was not the best idea. Quickly, Luke is fully emersed back into his work and his old 'work obsessed' ways, Suze and Becky are drifting apart now that Suze is the mother of three, and Becky's parents lay on the biggest shocket - Becky has a long lost sister, from a relationship her father had prior to meeting her mother.This the the wonderfully well written, expertly told story of how Becky adjusts to all the changes in her life, now that she is a Brandon with a sister.Just like the other books in this series, there will be times that the reader will relate and empathize with Becky but most of al there will be times where the reader will get fed up with Becky's spoiled and Selfish ways. But as always, she learns a valuable lesson and we cannot help but love her a little more in the end.The story ends with the perfect opening for a fifth book, which this reader is very much looking forward to.I recommend this book to all the Shopaholic Lovers, you will not be disappointed.To all of you new to Becky, start with the first book, this series is meant to be read in order. It may take some time to get to this forth book, but it will be worth it!Keep reading and keep laughing!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I loved this book just as much as the first 3, (maybe even more than the 3rd book). I'm so glad that Becky is back, and I'm looking forward to more of her adventures.The only downside to the Shopaholic books (and \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\")? They're such page-turners that I read each one in a matter of a couple of days, and then sit there cursing myself for reading so quickly! Oh well...books like these are always good for a re-read.Bravo, Ms. Kinsella!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Shopaholic is back and I enjoyed the continuing story. Okay, maybe a bit recycled and maybe Becky should really get a reality check and curb the lying -- but, this is a character and a series that you will either enjoy or not. I enjoy."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love all of the Shopaholic books, and this one was no different. It was a cute story with characters that you just fall in love with. Great chick book!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Let me start off by saying that I've read a pretty wide variety of books. I've read everything from Dracula to Gone with the Wind to Lord of the Rings to Animal Farm to a whole heap of Ray Bradbury. And out of all my reading, I find the Shopaholic series one of the hardest to put down. I've said it. Maybe it's my guilty pleasure. I've read other chick lit books as well, but none of them suck me in the way these do.Becky Bloomwood is hilarious and infuriating all at once - the way she takes every situation and gets carried away by fantasies of what it will be like if only she buys this particular item. The purchase of a dining room table in Sri Lanka leads to visions of her and her husband Luke sitting around eating homemade stew and all of their family members gazing at them adoringly over Sunday dinner. The fantasies get old, believe me they do. And the fact that Becky never, ever, learns a lesson, and is always let off the hook and forgiven by everybody around her, is enough to make you punch something. Not to mention the lying. My God, the lying. Yet I can't look away.This installment was no different, with Becky going overboard after finding out she has a long lost sister. Even when it is quite clear that the two have nothing in common, that doesn't stop Becky from trying to force some kind of cosmic sisterly relationship on them. And in her spare time she also grandly screws with her husband's PR company. Sometimes I get angry thinking about why Luke would stay married to someone like that, but then I realize that he's no bargain either.I think this book may have come the closest to having Becky realize she actually does have a problem, though I doubt we will see any changes in her in Shopaholic & Baby. Which is fine. Because as much as she drives me nuts with her fantasies and her narcissism - she's also a boat load of fun. We all like to watch a good train wreck.I'm going to take a break before starting Shopaholic & Baby, but believe me - I always come back.Beth LabonteAuthor of What Stays in Vegas"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I've read the first 3 shopaholic series and it was pretty satisfying.. but shopaholic and sister was disappointing. in fact i didn't even finish reading it.

The characters are very easily to relate to. The book is of great quality. The book was much better than expected. I paid 16.99 and was very happy with the paper quality. This is a great vacation or beach book. I would recommend this book to anyone who understands the joys of shopping and being a female."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"In Shopaholic & Sister Becky meets her half-sister, Jess. Becky has been spoiled rotten all her life and has never wanted for anything. In contrast, Jess was raised by a wealthy but strict, miserly, emotionally unavailable father who insisted Jess live a life of frugality. Jess could easily be representative of unemployed, poor and struggling people (which in the United States would be millions). I related more to Jess' character and actually found myself resenting Becky's snotty, privileged attitude and lifestyle. Becky's profound sense of entitlement just seems so wrong in this day and age when so many people are jobless and struggling financially -- but I have to bear in mind the book was published in 2004 NOT in 2011. I'm also tired of Becky's constant lying. It's as if she'll never become an adult, like she's emotionally stunted. Instead of being grateful that she has a wonderful man like Luke she deceives him and lies to him. She also does truly irrational, stupid and dangerous things -- like climb a mountain in high heels. That's just dumb. Becky is selfish, self-centered and self-absorbed and thinks nothing of squandering thousands and thousands of dollars EVERY SINGLE DAY on unneccessary expenditures. In every sense of the word Becky is an addict and a hoarder. Usually I can deal with that but in Shopaholic & Sister it got to me, probably because comparisons were drawn between Becky's obscenely privileged lifestyle (think Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian) and Jess's deprived one. The contrast between their lifestyles is truly stark. In this book I LIKED Jess. I was annoyed by Becky who whines and complains because the honeymoon is over and Luke has returned to the real world where he actually has a job. Becky expected the fantasy and euphoria to linger indefinitely and is offended when reality intrudes. When Becky doesn't get her way she does what she always does -- makes irrational decisions, thinking only of herself. I was a little dismayed when once again Luke, Suze and everyone else rallied around Becky pouring love and adoration her way. I gave the book 3 stars because it is well written. I also very much enjoyed the introduction of Jess. And I always appreciate Luke's character. Even though I was disappointed with Becky in this book, I still recommend it. November 2011"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I must declare that KINSELLA IS BACK! The author is just as witty and humorous as the first two Shopaholic novels, and I truly enjoyed reading her fourth book!One of my favorite scenes is reading Becky's obsession with acquiring the limited edition \`Angel Bag'. Becky compares the rarity of the Angel Bag to the Bengal Tigers, wherein she describes the former as being even more extinct! So true! I have had many experiences like this in my when I justify my shopping splurges with \`I have to have this no matter what!' or \`this is a collector's item!' These are what I call the \`FF' moments...aka Fashion Fanaticism!I also enjoyed the introduction of Jessica, who is Becky's long lost sister. She is also a fascinating character, and it is really nice to see how different she is from Becky, which often results into petty arguments between the two! Note that Ms. Kinsella barely made mention of Danny, who is Becky's NYC best friend. Thank goodness! He was absolutely annoying in the previous Shopaholic book that I truly wished he would not appear in the future novels. Perhaps Ms. Kinsella received a lot of negative feedback on him. There is also more of Suze in this book, who is Becky's longtime best friend. I like her, and she is definitely more endearing in this novel."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Another amazing book, was so Happy and excited to read it because of the other series. Any ways it had me in Tears and Laughing alot. I was starting to hate Jess at one point because of how cold she was acting with Becky. Also Luke had me so mad when he told Becky that he would like for Becky to more like Jess, and I know he said because he was upset with her. And her little journey to Jess hometown at Cumbria. Like I said I luved it and it had me in tears and laughing so hard and Luved how Suze did that Fax Message to Luke in regards to Becky \\"URGENT-EMERGENCY\\". Suze is also AMaing clear thru all the these Series. She is an amazing Friend to Becky and she supports her all the way!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Shopaholic and Sister is a fun book. Becky has a sister and she is nothing like Becky--will they be able to still bond and learn from each other? All the fun-loving characters are back for a hoot of a good time and some new characters too! I was hoping that Suze would be in the book for longer than she was--so big Suze fans will be disappointed that she wasn't in it as much as I had hoped. Jess (Becky's sister) in an interesting character and Kinsella has written her in a different way than any of her other characters and does a nice job showing off her ability to write a variety of characters. Overall all fun read and if you liked the other ones--you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was so excited to get this book by one of my favorite authors. The book was excellent quality and I was happy about the price and the seller keeping me in the loop!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky Bloomwood is one of the more endearing heroines of the recent past, far more endearing than Bridget Jones.Still, with the fourth book in this series, SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER, it does seem that author Sophie Kinsella has exhausted the eccentricities of Becky as the topics of her SHOPAHOLIC novels. By now, Becky is becoming not so much endearing as annoying; her adventures (and misadventures) must strain the belief of her most faithful fans.Of course, \\"SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER\\" contains much that fans of this series have come to expect, including the detailed, even loving, explanations of the merchandise Becky compulsively acquires.Yet even for fiction, the irrational way that this character behaves, and the greed and self-involvement she displays, make it impossible for a reader to accept that the fictional character of the terrific husband has fallen in love with Becky.Kinsella is a talented writer. She should take a lesson from some of television's better series, such as \\"Seinfeld,\\" \\"Frasier\\" and \\"Friends,\\" and move along professionally before she destroys the reputation she worked so hard to earn.Other than cashing in on her success, there doesn't seem much reason for Kinsella to have written SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm a huge fan of the shopaholic series although I was finding them to be alittle over the top the more they went on, which still didn't stop me from buying the next one just to see what happened to Bekky next. Shopaholic and Sister started off as they always do with Bekky never being able to say no to the perfect pair of shoes or that one of a kind handbag, but the story took a great twist with her long lost sister coming into the picture and showed a new side to Bekky when she tries to find common ground with her sister Jess. I found it to be a heartfelt book with all the great laughs I got out of the other shopaholic books I just couldn't seem to put it down, without giving away the ending it looks like there may be another shopoholic in the works and after reading this one I sure hope so it was worth waiting for."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"... become so popular? What is this teaching people? That it's okay to have a serious psychological problem provided that you're endearing and 'cute'? That you can easily buy love and companionship? Well, in the fourth part of Sophie Kinsella's 'Shopaholic' series, one realises that it's socially acceptable to do all this ... and more!The main character, Becky Brandon, is the most irritating character ever put to paper. The 'novel' (if you can even call it that) begins with her and her husband, Luke, returning from a ten-month honeymoon. On the way back to Britain, they stop off in Italy, where Becky purchases a hideously expensive handbag. This impulsive purchase eventually leads to a relationship breakdown and other fun and one-dimensional plot elements.After returning to the U.K., Becky meets up with her long-lost half-sister, Jess, who is frugal, plain and hates to shop. Becky attempts to buy her sister's love with expensive gift baskets. How shallow is that?Becky is one of the least-likeable characters in any book I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books. Her stupidity may be percieved as endearing by some, but it's just sad that a grown woman can act like a spoilt five year-old and get away with it... even in a book. Hopefully this will be the end of the series, although the ending ensues that a part 5 may possibly be in the works. Oh, dear."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Unfortunately, Becky is at it again. Although I loved the previous shopaholic books, this one is never-ending.

I loved the other ones in the series and Can you Keep a Secret?, but this book was boring me silly. I just can't take it anymore. I read about 3/4 of it and I just don't care about what happens to Becky anymore. Her character seems different now. Before she was intelligent, but loved to shop. Now she's a walking moron (maybe that's what happens to you if you honeymoon for 10 months). The story line is so obvious and I can't take it any more. I'm off to read The Secret Lives of Bees."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Sophie Kinsella has done it yet again, and taken the presumably one-note concept of a shopaholic to new heights of character development, plot twists and comedy!The introduction of skinflint Jess, a newly discovered sister, holds a mirror up to Becky's obsessive devotion to conspicuous consumerism and lays the groundwork for conflicts so far reaching as to put Becky on a life-threatening mountain climb (in kitten heels!) and further throw her into conflict with her new husband's major client by staging a protest march against him!The story has Becky on a roller-coaster ride from one crisis to another, and in-between there is plenty of pathos and sentimentality as our favorite chick lit heroine learns by hard experience the precious value of friends and family.I simply can't wait to read more by this author!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I must admit, I LOVE Becky Bloomwood! But this book was not as good as I hoped it would be. I had to skip over some parts that I didnt care for, the boring sister made the book kind of...BORING. I agree with some of the other reviews, Becky needs to grow up a little. I thought the concept was good at first \\"Becky becomes frugal\\" but that only lasted like what 2 pages? With that said, I will read the next book because I still love the protagonist, and I have to finish out the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I think there were moments that made me laugh, but I agree with some of the readers, and share their sentiments when I wondered just how stupid Becky could be.

Come on, girl - you're at an environmental protest, and you think that their main concerns about this mall are its hours and selection of stores! Please! How stupid can one person be? If I pulled half of the crap she does in this book, I don't even think I would want to associate with myself. I didn't like how everything ended up nicely and neatly, tied up in pretty bow.

Unbeknownst to Luke, the honeymoon has actually been one, very long, world-traveling, shopping spree for Becky. When the happy couple returns to London, Becky finds her familiar world has turned upside down. Suze, Becky's best friend, has replaced her with an insuffrable woman named LuLu. Luke, who had been totally laid-back and relaxed on the honeymoon, has returned to his uptight and condescending businessman attitude. And Becky's parents deal her the final blow: Becky has a sister.Apparently, Becky's dad Graham fathered a child several years before he met Becky's mum. The child, Jessica, is now a grown woman and has sought Graham out. Becky is thrilled by the news. At first anyway. But then Becky meets Jessica and finds out the worst news yet: Jessica hates shopping.Becky Bloomwood is a hysterical, bumbling, and completely endearing character. Kinsella has created a character that is totally loveable, because of her many flaws. Kinsella's works are a fabulous addition to the chick lit genre and I look forward to each of her novels!I highly recommend this novel and all of Kinsella's other works."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Shopaholic and Sister begins where Shopaholic Ties the Knot left off. After their wedding, Becky and Luke Brandon decide to take a year off and see the world. Somewhere in Sri Lanka, Becky gets homesick, and they cut their trip short by two months. But when they get back to London, everyone Becky is close to seems to have changed. Her best friend, now the parent of three, has a new best friend, and her parents have begun acting strangely.It turns out that Becky has a half-sister, a woman with whom Becky shares a father. Apparently, he had an affair on a train (very romantic) before he met Becky's mother. Jessica has come to tell her biological family about a blood disorder that could affect the Bloomwoods. Becky daydreams about having a sister who she can go shopping with, laugh with, and in general someone with whom she can bond.Becky's half-sister is completely different than Becky. Jessica saves money wherever possible (even taking up an offer of free mailing envelopes from a stationery shop), whereas Becky thinks nothing of spending 2000 Euros on an Angel handbag in Milan, or purchasing twenty silk kimonos in Hong Kong. Jessica has no imagination whatsoever; Becky is always daydreaming. Jessica is working on a PhD. in Geology; Becky has spent a year working as a personal shopper. Yet Becky continues to hope that there is something there, some sisterly bond that will link the two women.In all, I don't think this book was as good as the previous three Shopaholic books. Becky keeps getting ditzier and ditzier with each book. However, the way the end of this book is set up, I fully expect there to be a fifth book, entitled somewhere along the lines of \\"Shopaholic and Baby.\\""},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"My wife gave this to me for Christmas \\"from\\" our young daughter. I'm not sure why. I'm not a big consumer of chick-lit, but then I don't think my wife even knows what chick-lit is (she's Chinese and doesn't read much English fiction). Anyway, I had to read it because my daughter got upset every time she saw me reading a book which wasn't Shopaholic and Sister.I took it on a longish business trip to Beijing, and having read everything else I brought (Effective C++ and Natural Atheism being amongst my favorites), I finally picked up this piece of tripe. Is it lack of imagination or just sheer laziness that makes the author put the protagonist (the infinitely dislikable \\"Bex\\") into situations that even my five-year-old could see through as contrived and avoidable if Bex exhibited the slightest degree of common sense, honesty or decency?Is a character so selfish, annoying and just plain dumb that you want to shake her and slap some sense into her on every page really supposed to be entertaining or endearing? And then we have the problem of a first-person present tense narrative. I guess this is supposed to be Bex's \\"inner monologue\\". If she's capable of the occasional insightful thought (and even the odd blip of humor), how the hell can she be so blissfully cloth-headed and unself-aware the rest of the time?The rest of the cast were mostly ciphers. Luke was about as three-dimensional as the picture of the hero on the cover of a romantic novel. Kinsella could have done something with Jess, but apparently she was too lazy to invest her with anything beyond the usual trite \\"right-on\\" clich&eacute;s.Apparently some people liked the earlier books in the series better than the current one. I certainly won't be wasting any more of my time (or money) finding out if the earlier incarnations of Becky were any less fatuous and tiresome than this one.Dreadful."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm so glad there are no more Shopaholic books to read!!! I really liked Becky in the beginning, but as I continued to read the books her character made me want to hurl the book onto the street. Becky is the most selfish, materialistic person ever. She just doesn't quit. She buys things that make absolutely no sense because most of the time they aren't things she'll ever use. I was really hoping that at some point she would come to realize her mistakes and truly, 100% change. Sure, she starts to do some frugal things in the end, but she will never completely be a different person. I also hated the fact that she is always keeping things from Luke. Maybe she wouldn't be in such stupid dilemmas; in this one it was promising a man she didn't even know that Luke would help him in a business venture all because of a very expensive bag he helped Becky purchase, if she was straight forward with her husband. The only redeeming quailty of the book is her sister Jess. When Jess told her off, I almost jumped up and cheered. I know this is only a book, but come on already with the excessive shopping.

Those were just daydreams. Will Becky and her sister eventually develop similar tastes? Could they become sisters in the real sense of the word?This read ends on a high note with a wonderful message about all the different expectations we have about our relationships.Enjoy the read!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book was different from all the others in the series. Becky goes to a different location the last half of the book, and lots of new characters are introduced. Becky's enthusiastic aproach to her new sister was so refreshing. She never gave up trying to win her sisters approval. Her enthusiasum really shows in the end when Becky almost risks her life trying to see her sister. The end is very exciting and thrilling with a huge twist that is very unexpected. You don't have to read the other ones in the series to enjoy this one. I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a novel that will make them laugh, cry, and be on the edge of your seat (or couch which is where i read usually)."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I like these books, I really do. I especially liked the 2nd and 3rd, however this one grated on my nerves. She is in her late 20's and she is acting like she is an 11 year old girl! How many times does she have to bury herself before she learns. Of course all things are fixed in the end but I admit by this 4th book her antics got old. Still with all that said I, of course, will read Shopaholic and Baby as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This time around Becky, the spoiled, materialistic bumblehead is unemployed and married to her sure to be long-suffering lover Luke. They spend the early part of the novel honeymooning around the globe for a year while Becky secretly spends all sorts of dough on silly trinkets and other assorted things (such as two dining room tables!) that Luke doesn't want or need. How the business savvy Luke remains oblivious to her spending is beyond me but oblivious he is until they return home and the huge trucks arrive with all of her secret purchases. He frets about the finances and puts her on a budget and, of course, she has a secret credit card that allows her to continue to do major damage. Luke nearly works himself to death while Becky is off putting his career in jeopardy so she can buy a trendy bag. Serves him right for marrying the bubblehead, if you ask me.When Becky returns home from her travels she discovers she has a half sister and is overjoyed with visions of shopping, sleepovers, popcorn and spending endless hours watching Pretty Woman and Sleepless in Seattle with her new sis. It's difficult to believe this woman is nearing 30 because she thinks like a tween, but what do I know? Much to Becky's dismay she quickly learns that her new sister isn't all she dreamed her up to be. First off she hates shopping, is super thrifty, is an environmental activist and wisely wants nothing to do with Becky. Due to Becky's wildly self-destructive antics the new sis warms up to her and opens up. This part of the book partially redeems Becky's silly behavior. As always, Becky means well in this novel and down deep has a good heart but she's such a materialistic airhead she makes me want to scream throughout most of the book. I'm sure I'll be back for more punishment when the next releases comes my way . . ."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book was a nice quick light read. I was a little shocked at how much money she spent so freely, so I wasn't surprised at all the grief it caused her. And some of what happened to her was a little hard to believe. But I enjoyed it and I liked the characters and I will probably read another one of this series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm not a big reader, but the shopaholic series got me hooked! Enjoyed the first 3 books and this one is not much different. Easy to read, funny, and a little boring at times. Becky is my girl! Continues to be the shopaholic that she is always been,witty and naive, getting into trouble, but always finding her way out of it with success, i wish life was that easy. This is what this series is about; transporting you to a fantasy world where no matte what you do everything turns out perfect at the end. I personally find it very entertaining. Looking forward to reading shopaholic and baby and watching the upcoming shopaholic movie!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love the Shopaholic series, and although she can be annoying at times, Becky Brandon has an endearing quality and I can't help but like her. Yes, I do want to strangle her at times for being so darn naive and overenthusiastic, and I feel that in this book she is so over the top. But, even more annoying was her sister, Jess...what a b----! Of course, I knew it would work out in the end, but I couldn't stand Jess on her high horse. And, who the heck is so darn cheap?! I'm all about being thrifty and finding a good bargain, but she was acting like a homeless person! Other than those annoying points, overall, it was good and I enjoy Kinsella's style & wit. I did like the earlier books in the series better, but still a fun, easy read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Here we go again with Becky Bloomwood, and her obsessive need for always shopping-and running up credit cards! In this book, she and Luke will finish up their honeymoon sooner than they had expected to, and go back home. Becky of course, can't resist buying an expensive angel bag before they leave, and she must keep it a secret from Luke-which she is famous for doing all the time.When they reach home, things have changed. Becky's best friend Suze, is now tied up with Lulu who also has kids, and seems to have no time at all for Suze. And, that isn't all of course. She has an unknown sister through her father, namely Jess, who is quite the very opposite of Becky. She has a zero personality, and HATES shopping! She is a cheap-o and finds all sorts of ways to harbor her money. So right off, she and Becky don't get along. In fact, when Becky takes her shopping, Jess just stands there bored while Becky is completely, totally enthralled with the mall stores!Luke and Becky have problems because of Becky's shopping problem. When not one, but several lorries drive up to their apartmenet with all of Becky's lavish items, Luke is horrified. They have words many times over this, so Becky proceeds to sell many of the items over ebay, convincing Luke she can use it to pay off all of these bills. But then she spends more-and more.When Jess and Becky really have it a big fight over her lying and shopping habits, Jess gives up altogether and doesn't want to be sisters. But an event makes Becky take a second look at what she is doing-and she wants Jess's help. But it may be too late for them to make up, and not only that, but with Luke too."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"After reading the previous Shopaholic books you already get a sense of what this story is going to be about, where the story will turn, and how it will all end up. That being said, it is still a very entertaining read as long as you don't mind the fact that with each passing novel and page there is less and less for you to like about Becky. Yet still, you can't help but feel for her. Shopping to her is an addiction and as she tries once again to change ger spendthrift ways you can't help but laugh and cry at the mess she gets herself into."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"After reading all 4 books, I found the storylines very similar. I honestly have to lower down my ratings because of the lack of originality. Some people who want new plots and stories better move to another part of the bookshelves and get a book that isn't a series.Nevertheless, Becky Bloomwood is back from her honeymoon with her new husband, Luke and is funnier than ever. She discovers her \\"former\\" best friend Suze has a new best friend, her parents are acting peculiar. She expected a warm family reunion with her friend but it seemed everything was turning upside down.Then, out of the blue, she finds out she has a long-lost sister. She gets madly excited and plans shopping sprees and makeovers for both her and her sis. As time passes, she realizes her sis, Jess, has nothing in common with her. Jess doesn't like shopping, makeovers or anything that involves spending or wasting money. What can Becky do?Then she has this huge row with Luke and Jess. Desperate as she was, she did something and of course I'm not telling you what she did. You wouldn't buy the book if I did right?All in all, I found the book fun and easy to read. I must agree some people won't be able to stand this book because they hate the fact that - as they say - \\"every page is talking about shopping\\". Teens will presumably love this book as I do.Looking forward to Sophie Kinsella's 5th Shopaholic seriesKirstie Mabitad"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Sophie Kinsella continues to make me laugh. I love her Becky books!! She keeps me wanting more!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"If you have not started on this series you do not know what you are missing. Funny, candid, and alarmingly naive Becky Bloomwood will have you rolling on the floor laughing while you will relate to her throughout the entire book. I absolutely adored every single book in the series as well as 'can you keep a secret' by sophie kinsella. Her british humour will have you reading her books in 1 or 2 nights and leave you lacking in sleep once you start, but its well worth it! My favorite books of all time! be sure to start with confessions of a shopaholic, then shopaholic takes manhattan, then shopaholic ties the knot, and finally shopaholic and sister. Her new book \\"the undomestic goddess' is equally fabulous and hilarious and the characters unfailing justification of herself is just as prominent! you will love it love it love it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"As a fan of all the books in Sophia Kinsella's \\"Shopaholic Series\\" I was not disappointed in this one. I found the book to be delightful and very funny. I often laughed out loud. Although Becky (the shop-addicted star of the novel) can be irritating at times (you think she'd be a bit more money savvy by now!)deep down she's a good person if a bit flighty.This is a nice quick summer read. It's definitely fun. I loved this book!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was so excited when this book came out that the day I bought it, I went home and read it that night! I was very disappointed the next day, when I realized the book was over, and I have to wait until the next book comes out... The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that the ending was very obvious, but Sophie Kinsella did it again. I hope she keeps this series going for a long time.... and I hope she hurries up with the next book, I am getting antsy!!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Wow. I was excited about the frist three books and now a forth!! It was too good to put down, I couldn't stop once I started.The book starts off with Becky's honeymoon and then she finds out she has a long lost sister and this story is about her finding the sister and being the person she always wanted to be. It reaches a new depth and a new revelation to Becky as she learns from her new marriage, her friends, and her sister."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have read the whole shopoholic series and they are all sooooo funny!! I adore Bex and her mad fantasies... all women must agree do sometimes go through your mind (well at least in mine they do)It is a great book to read before bed and it really cheers me up...the only bad thing about this book is that it has to end!Please don't let this series end!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm surprised to read some of the negative reviews. This was my favorite of the Shopaholic series--mainly because we get to see more of Luke Brandon in it. I love it when he pays her debts off (c'mon, he's a millionaire!). What a fantasy!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"That's all I've got to say. Really!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back!!Ok so I finally finished it...I'm still not impress and have to say that this book does not live up to her previous ones. I moved it up from 2 stars to 3 only because I'm a sucker for a happy ending and this book has ATLEAST that piece."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"The delay in shipping annoyed me. I think ten days is ridiculous. I received another book ordered on the same day from another vendor four days earlier. I will go with the more efficient vendor in the future."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"My dog could have written a better book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"What a disappointment! What a flake! How contrived. I feel ripped off. I need to go buy the other 3 Shopaholic books to know what's going on, but after reading this one, I really don't care. Becky is so clueless, so ridiculous! Jess the sister is a mean little drip who lacks the tiniest bit of manners and all social graces. Luke is-- what? A multi-billionaire who pays for year-long honeymoons, a thousands and thousands on secret credit cards, has a penthouse style flat, and launches a new business. The Nathan Temple idea thrown in for-- what reason? THAT'S the plot?? The dad turns out to have been a womanizer with children who-knows-where, so maybe that irresponsibility is a family trait?? And meanwhile this airhead who suddenly \\"changes\\" falls off the side of a mountain because she's too clueless and self-absorbed to care about anything other than her own impulsive needs? The drip of a \\"sister\\" was right: she's a spoiled little liar, and when I read she's supposed to be 27 years old, I had to toss the book across the room in disgust. This behavior is just pathetic. If this is what \\"chick lit\\" has come to, we ALL need to demand more for our $15.00 I'd call this a \\"beach read\\", but gazing at the ocean would be more entertaining.Let me guess... Shopaholic And A BABY is the next moronic book, and we can expect more of the same bubblehead with a credit card. Wait a minute.. an unexpected pregnancy due to careless behavior-- how apropos."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I LOVE the Shopaholic books, and like the others, read this one in just a few days. However, it did not seem to have the same punch as the other books. Becky, back from her honeymoon, finds out from her parents that she has a sister, Jessica--product of a fling her father had before meeting her mother. She is 2 years older than Becky and could not be more different. She is frugal, hates shopping and had a harder time growing up. Yes, the idea is a little far-fetched like some other reviews have mentioned, but it is fiction, and that did not bother me anyway. Luke is also a little furious at the 2 truck loads of honeymoon souveniers that arrive at their flat, and he puts Becky on a budget. Of course our dear Becky finds a way around that. Becky invites her sister Jessica to the flat for a weekend of \\"sisterly bonding.\\" Jessica sees Becky's problem and offers to help her be more frugal, but Becky tosses insults back at her sister and they fight. Becky, true to herself, gets Luke and his company into a bit of a pickle and they have a huge fight. Suze has also found a new best friend while Becky was away so Becky feels a little alone in the world. Becky is determined to change and be more like Jessica and heads off to make things right. I will let you take it from here--this part was probably my favorite part. They story was still good, easy to read and enjoyable. Just not on par with the first 3 in the series. Though how this ending was left, the next chapter in Becky's life is bound to be hysterical!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was so happy when I moved to the UK and realized that I would get first dibs on the new Shopaholic book. This one is great. It is just a funny and over the top as all Becky's other adventures. I am a sucker for friendships and always get teary eyed during the special Becky/Suzy moments. If you like Becky you will love this book. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"While the flighty yet well-meaning Becky is back in similar style to the first three books, Kinsella's choice of contrasting her with the ultra-practical, unbelievably thrifty Jess has made it difficult to enjoy Becky's character as in the previous books.Perhaps it is that Becky is now married and it is difficult to justify her half-truths towards her husband. Perhaps I'm expecting her to have grown a little along the way. In the first few books, I sympathized with her and saw a little of myself in Kinsella's shop-at-all-cost Becky. It was a little bit of fantasy. Wouldn't it be nice to spend and buy and spend and buy and not feel guilty or suffer the consequences? Now, she just seems immature and irresponsible. The fact that she always manages to land on her feet, despite silly choices, seems unrealistic.Check your brain at the door and this instalment of the Shopaholic novels is light, fun read, albeit not quite as enjoyable as the first three books. Think about it too much and it may just border on annoying."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"After coming back from her 10 month, around the world honeymoon trip, Becky discovers a change in her universe. Her fashion designer buddy in New York doesn't return her calls. Bestest friend forever Suze (now mother of 3, Ernie and boy-girl twins)has a new bestest friend who would rather ride a horse over the hills than ride a horse to the local shops. Luke is cranky. And Mum and Dad have been acting oddly.While sorting through the mounds (literally) of mementos from her honeymoon, Becky discovers something that couldn't be picked up in a cute little boutique or the high street. Becky's got a half-sister Jessica thanks to Mr Bloomwood's premarriage adventures. But the biggest shocker isn't the long-lost sister, but the mere fact that Jess loves her beloved rocks more than shopping.The fourth volume (yes, it has been 4 Shopaholic books) moves along rather smoothly. There's not the same I am Becky, Becky is me (aka addicted to shopping) feeling as in volumes one and two. However the ending leaves wide open fresh adventures in life experiences and of course related shopping for Mrs Rebecca Bloomwood Brandon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I enjoyed the first book in the Shopaholic series. I thought is was amusing and cute. But with every subsequent book in the series, I have been more and more annoyed with Becky Bloomwood's antics, and frankly just thought this book was a waste of time. Why does Sophie Kinsella never address the real serious problem Becky has with self-control? She gets into all these messes that she has created herself, and through her pluck and luck manages to get out of them. Becky never does any serious soul searching- everything always just works out for her. That is not realistic. To me, the character of Becky just seemed spoiled and pathetic in this book. There are plenty of other chick lit books out there that are less fluffy than this one- where the characters actually learn from their mistakes and don't continuously repeat them over and over and over. Try those instead..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I tried to like her. I really did. However, I found it truly impossible. The story itself was okay, but not extravagant. It was like bread and water, so to say. Nothing special. However, I could NOT stand Rebecca Brandon! The first two books were okay, but Rebecca was just a pain in this one. First of all, she went on a round-the-world vacation, and all she does is shop shop shop. Doesn't she have a sense of value? Is that really all that she cares about? And in Milan, she buys a 2000 euro bag when she's already bought truckloads of useless, unresourceful items! And everywhere her head turns, she always seems to find an item here and an item there that she likes. What is her problem? She's always like, \\"they'll call me the girl in the ____,\\" and she'll be all giddy about it. Although she is unemployed for a few months, all she does is think of ways to have fun. Doesn't she have a sense of dignity? During that time before she re-enters her job as a personal shopper, she could at least try to read, or something other than doing her nails or shopping. She is truly the most blatant, extraordinary shopaholic! She went horseback riding and came back toting several hatboxes and some cheese with walnuts in it. Overall, the book was bearable, but I can't say the same about Rebecca Brandon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have not yet finished the book but I wanted to see what others thought. I don't know why I keep reading these books. I find parts amusing (which I why I keep reading them) but I really wish the character of Becky wasn't so stupid and selfish. Why would someone like Luke stick around for this? What is endearing about Becky? She is just plain clueless about life and marriage. I think she is truly the most annoying character ever. I will finish the book but honestly, I can't stand Becky."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This latest Shopaholic adventure was definitely not what I had hoped for and expected. The story starts out in the usual and loveable way - Becky and Luke are still on their honeymoon, and everything is great. On their way back to their normal lives, it starts to go wrong. Both for Becky and Luke and for Sophie Kinsella. Becky overspends (as usual, but this time she REALLY overspends, and it is hard to believe that she has this kind of money) and hides her overspending from Luke. Back in London everything starts to go wrong. As usual one wants to say - but this time it is not cute or even remotely funny. Becky is too much, and it is very hard to believe how Luke can stand her, how anyone can stand her. Her non-shopping sister is more likeable than Becky, and it is in her company, the sister's, that Becky becomes most obnoxious and naive. And yes, it is also very hard to believe how one can be so naive and clueless. It used to be easy to see a little of yourself in Becky, thankfully that is not the case with this book. This one was not good enough, and I only recommend it if you feel you 'need' to read all the Shopaholic-books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was stuck without a book at the library a few days ago, and this was what I came up with. I've read \\"Confessions\\" and \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\" before, but really, this is too much. Why would Luke Brandon love Becky? She is constantly immature, sneaky, and deceitful, and I don't really get what goodness overcomes this. I probably wouldn't be so frustrated except that I always have to finish a book once I start it, so I was stuck with it until the end."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Honestly, the Shopaholic books were the first 'girly' books I've ever read. They were so funny! I started off with Shopaholic &amp; Sisters until I realized that there were a few more prior. I stopped reading it and started from the beginning of the series. I laughed out loud so many times! These are great! The type of books I read has now changed, thanx to Sophie!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have read all of the Shopaholic books, and this one was passable, but not as good as the others, in my humble opinion. Becky continues to be her charming, hapless self, though this time around I found it a little irritating that she practically has a perfect life already, almost destroys it, but then it all gets tied up neatly in a bow in the end. But then again, that's why we read these books, is it not, as an escape from reality? All said, I would recommend this book, but if you haven't read the other Shopaholic books I would read them in order first, and then read this one. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I will not write a long review, but Becky seems to have gone from adorably, sympathetically, quirky and mildly lacking in self control to outright mentally ill. Kinsella's first two were clever and Becky was adorable but she seems to have just gone insane. It is not so much fun, as it is cringe inducing. The books still have their funny, lovable, moments, but overall Becky has gone from a great character I could relate to to a complete flake with a dangerous impulse control disorder, whom refuses to learn a lesson. This is a Shopaholic book with a seriously dark underbelly. This is the \\"Becky goes insane\\" version and it goes far beyond the shopping obession. Case in point, the \\"Sisterhood\\" t-shirt."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I hacve a confession to make: I'm a shopaholic fan. No matter how boring Becky B.'s spending habits might get, I'd still be one of the first people to get the book, and I'd enjoy every antic, shopping trip, or mishap that involves the beloved Becky.That said, I'd have to agree with many of he reviewers: while still enjoyable, Becky's \\"bad spending habits\\" are getting a little tired. In \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\" Kinsella wisely changes the focus of the book from Becky's shopping craze (well, except for the occasional Miu Miu skirt or some antique furniture) to her unability to choose between two desirable weddings. Recycling the \\"Becky's shopping gets her into trouble\\" plot line makes the character and story lose some of their charm, almost as much as th forced inclusion of some of the \\"&ouml;lder\\" characters (Janice & Martin, Tom, Alicia). While the notion of having Becky handle &auml; \\"non - shopping\\" - holic, frugal character is fun, the idea of a long lost sister is contrived.On the other hand, Backy still has her charming moments. Convincing her Yogi of her spiritual enlightment (especially when running over hot coals for some very unspiritual jewelery), re - defining the concept of budget through E - Bay, or just hiking a mountain in kitten heels (and finding them usefull!) is classic Becky Brandon (nea Bloomwood). The book also ries to deal with more \\"grown up issues\\" - such as parents having lives of their own, or how friends can drift apart when one is gone for a long period of time and their lives are growing diferent (having kids, etc.)."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky Bloomwood is back and this time she is newly-married Becky Brandon, who is shopping around the world on her honeymoon with Luke. When she and Luke return to England, she finds that everything has changed. Her best friend, Suze, has found a new best friend, and her parents have just met her half-sister, Jessica, the product of her father's affair previous to his marriage. Becky fantasizes about the wonderful relationship she'll have with her newly-found sister, but she's disappointed when she discovers that she and Becky have nothing in common. Added to this, Luke is upset with Becky for all of the secret purchases she has made, which are just now showing up at their apartment. It seems that things couldn't get worse, but as usual, everything turns out well at the end. This book is not quite up to the standards of the previous books in the series. Somehow, the fun has gone out of some of Becky's escapades and this series probably needs to end with this book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I LOVED LOVED LOVED this book. Each of the books in the Shopaholic series keep getting better and better. I have enjoyed them all, but I think this may be my favorite. I felt as though I was right there with Becky, going through all of her pains and experiences. It was a very fun and fast read. Great for anyone looking for a bit of fun and wanting to escape and relax!! Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite \\"fun\\" authors and I sincerely hope she continues with this series!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Before beginning the book, I was very intrigued as to how Becky was going to have a sister out of nowhere. I assumed Luke would have a sister we hadn't yet read about and that they were referring to her sister-in-law. It was not the case and I did like this surprise. It did seem slightly contrived and the image of the Bloomwoods I had previously had was changed a little. But - as usual with this series- I couldn't put the book down and had many laugh out loud moments.In terms of the Shopaholic Series I think its better than the last one (Shopaholic Ties the Knot) but not as good as the first and the second. I continue to love how Sophie Kinsella always throws in some twist towards the end that I am totally not expecting and am completely surprised by.I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I loved the previous \\"Shopaholic\\" books, but was disappointed with Kinsella's \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" so I was afraid she might be losing her touch.

It's as funny and entertaining as the previous ones in the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"\\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" by Sophie Kinsella is the fourth book is the Shopaholic series. The fourth book opens up as Becky and Luke deciding to end their year-long honeymoon a couple months early and head back to London. But things have change best friend Suze has made some new friends, and her mom and dad are hiding a big secret. Becky has a half-sister Jess. Becky thinks that she has found her new shopping buddy. But Jess isn't anything like Becky and that where the fun begins.Fans of the shopaholic books have be looking foward to this book, but \\"Shopholic and Sister\\" doesn't have the charm of the first three books. Characters have seem to changed alot and some of not of the better. I hopeful that any future \\"Shopaholic books\\" will be better"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This is latest book in the Shopaholic series, which follows British Becky Bloomwood through live, love and career while trying (but not very hard) not to max out her credit cards. I was so excited when I went to London and was able to buy this before it came out in the US. But I was a little bit disappointed- it was definately not on par with the first three.The book begins on Becky and Luke's year-long honeymoon around the world. While in Sri Lanka, they decide to head home and back to their normal lives when they both decide they miss home. But Becky is in for a few shocks- her best friend Suze has had twins and seems to have replaced her with a new friend, and her parents have started going to therapy and are newly enlightened. Then she is hit with the biggest bombshell- her father had an illegitimate daughter before he married Becky's mother, and she has a half-sister! When Luke goes back to work, Becky, who finds herself lonely for Suze and jobless, gets excited to meet her sister, Jess. But it turns out Jess and Becky are polar opposittes- and yes, Jess HATES to shop.This book is cute and charming, but lacks some of the fun that the first three books had. While Becky's eternal optimism of her and Jess being great friends is very cute, it is a little bit annoying to see her still spending money like water. Apparently, she hasn't learned any lessons and her husband should stop bailing her out. But there are other good plots- how Becky's quest for a purse in Milan lands Luke in hot water, and how her drive to get closer to Jess allows her to help out an important cause in a small town.All in all, if you are a Becky Bloomwood fanatic, read it but know it's not as good as the others. But the best part of this book is the end- and what hints at the next chapter in Becky's life, which should be a riot!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Another chronicle in the saga of Rebecca Bloomwood....the sister twist is a bit far-fetched, and you just want to shoot Luke (the stupid husband!) but it's the thoughts that just pop into Rebecca's head that make you howl with laughter. It's a good thing there has been a break since the last book, because she is starting to get a bit tired and repetitive....the end of the book does leave LOADS of room for the next installment. Kinsella should stick with creating new characters that are equally as witty (like Can You Keep A Secret?). Still, a GREAT summer read! I bought it on-line from the UK because I couldn't wait and then read it in one day!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Fans of the Shopaholic series featuring the engaging yet exasperating Rebecca Bloomwood may savor the following rebuke delivered to her face by her ... sister?:\\"You're spoiled! ... Your whole life makes me sick. ... You're shallow and materialistic, and I've never met anyone so obsessed with their own appearance and shopping.\\"In SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER, the fourth book of the series by Sophie Kinsella, Becky is now Rebecca Brandon, wife of successful Luke Brandon, head of his own public relations firm. Just back from their 1-year, around-the-world honeymoon, during which Becky purchased more stuff than even Luke suspects until it's delivered to their London flat in two large lorries, Becky discovers that she has a sister. Half-sister, actually - her father's daughter, Jessica Bertram, conceived with a stewardess employed on the London to Carlisle train before he met Becky's Mum. Becky is thrilled; they can go shopping together, as well as do each other's nails. But to Becky's horror and despair, Jess is cut from different cloth; she's frugal to a fault, e.g. she reuses coffee grounds and makes kitchen scourers out of old onion bags, and carries a week's change of clothes in a brown rucksack. And she loathes to shop.SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER is perhaps not as lighthearted throughout as the previous three. Through several chapters, Becky is bleakly despondent over what she perceives as a marriage on the rocks and failure to bond with Jess. But Becky's strongpoint has always been her resilience. Upon waking from unconsciousness after falling off a mountain ledge, she can observe the need for a manicure by the person waving a hand in front of her face asking, \\"How many fingers?\\"As much as the reader of the series might want to shout at Becky the reproach heading this review, the woman is unfailingly good-hearted and generous, and you just want to hug her - or shake her until her teeth rattle. Becky is one of the most winning heroines of trashy literature. By the end of the book, it's obvious where the author is going with the next installment. Keep 'em coming, Sophie!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I liked this book. I've liked this series since Confessions of a Shopaholic and think it's only getting better and better.This book deals with Becky (back from a 10 month-long honeymoon) finding out that she has a half-sister. As usual, Becky finds herself getting into predicaments that, for her at least, are typical.This was a fast and entertaining read. The plot is predictable, but it's an entertaining read nonetheless. I loved the ending because it hints at the next book having to do with Becky having a baby."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"After reading Shopaholic Ties the Knot, I just knew the next book would be Shopaholic Has a Baby. So I was surprised to learn it was Shopaholic and Sister. Originally the plot sounded funny.... having a sister that doesn't like to shop. But the actual plot was just average. I'm really not sure what to say about this book. It wasn't entirely bad, but wasn't entirely good either. If you've read the other books in the series, I'd say just read this one bcuz Jess may appear again in the follow-up book. However, please just check it out from the library. Or wait until it comes out in paperback. Better yet, buy it in paperback from a used book store."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I LOVE this book, I couldn't put it down the minute I start reading it! It is a heart-warming yet witty book; all the Shopaholic fans have to read it! The only problem is I just can't wait to see what Becky does next..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have read all of Ms. Kinsella's books. I have enjoyed all of them and ususally I read them on long airline flights. This last book although ejoyable makes Becky fit more the traditional model of airheaded, dependeant wife. It made me slightly uncomforatble since I wouldn't want this series to become a dime store, chick- lit series. Luckily later in the book Becky's previous \\"intelligent\\" credentials are not just -discussed but also utilized. This is fun reading not to be taken too seriously but I still want Becky to reclaim her voice within her maariiage to a multimillionarire."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky, Becky. When will you ever learn? By the end of all the previous novels, Becky has come to a realization that shopping is not the most important thing out there. These lessons, however, are forgotten by the start of the next novel.This episode is as trite and silly as the previous novels, however, Becky has begun to seriously get on my nerves. Behaviour that she considers cute is actually very immature and selfish. I find it very difficult to believe that a man like Luke could ever fall in love and marry a silly, flighty twit like Becky. She takes being spoiled to a new level, and she is so selfish and self involved that it boggles the mind. She is amazed that her new sister Jess is not more grateful for all the effort made when Jess comes for a visit. Well, if Becky would actually crawl out of herself for a while and actually notice other people and their feelings, it would have been obvious that her sister had different interests.Becky is also a first rate liar, which she demonstrates again and again to her husband and family. We are supposed to believe that someone that is this dishonest has a good marriage. Would YOU want to be married to such a liar?Becky is also shallow, and wrapped up in herself. Could you imagine her ever doing anything for charity? Not likely!Finally, we are left with the ending where it is likely that Becky is pregnant. God help that child! A good mother is not someone who is as selfish as Becky.I find it truly sad that Becky is held up as some kind of hero. God knows there are millions of people drowning in debt with scads of stuff they don't need. Do we need a character like Becky to encourage people?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I LOVE all the shopaholic books. I always get the audio books. This one is read by a different narrator and it is AWEFUL. I am sure some of it is because I am used to Becky sounding a certain way. This book is a little melodramatic. The \\"accents\\"the narrator tries to pull off just sound ridiculous. It is over the top. And it is really distracting. I am having the hardest time listening to it. Normally I can't wait to get in the car and listen. This one is different. I am pushing through to hear the story. But I won't ever buy another audiobook with this narrator."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Another winner for Kinsella who has managed without flaw to keep Becky Brandon's (nee Bloomwood)quirky character thriving through three sequals! Although there are times that you wish Becky's long last half sister would fall off the face of the earth, she eventually redeems herself and wins over the reader just before Becky reveals some very exciting news that gives us a good idea what the sequal will be. Who's ready to go shopping for baby clothes?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"After the \`not so good' review I gave Shopaholic ties the Knot, I was rather hesitant to read the next Shopaholic book, which is Shopaholic and Sister. By the third book, all readers following these series know that Becky Bloomwood is an only child, so the title of the fourth book does stir up some curiosity.Well, to sum up my reaction to this book.....I must declare that KINSELLA IS BACK! The author is just as witty and humorous as the first two Shopaholic novels, and I truly enjoyed reading her fourth book!One of my favorite scenes is reading Becky's obsession with acquiring the limited edition \`Angel Bag'. Becky compares the rarity of the Angel Bag to the Bengal Tigers, wherein she describes the former as being even more extinct! So true! I have had many experiences like this in my when I justify my shopping splurges with \`I have to have this no matter what!' or \`this is a collector's item!' These are what I call the \`FF' moments...aka Fashion Fanaticism!I also enjoyed the introduction of Jessica, who is Becky's long lost sister. She is also a fascinating character, and it is really nice to see how different she is from Becky, which often results into petty arguments between the two! Note that Ms. Kinsella barely made mention of Danny, who is Becky's NYC best friend. Thank goodness! He was absolutely annoying in the previous Shopaholic book that I truly wished he would not appear in the future novels. Perhaps Ms. Kinsella received a lot of negative feedback on him. There is also more of Suze in this book, who is Becky's longtime best friend. I like her, and she is definitely more endearing in this novel."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"We all have a little bit of Becky in us or know someone just like her! All of the SHOPAHOLIC books are great fun, I already have my order in for \\"BABY\\", can't wait!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky Brandon (Bloomwood) is at it again! During her honeymoon to Luke Brandon she buys all kinds of things around the world without telling him and puts them it storage. After a ten-month honeymoon they decide to head back home and surprise everyone.But, things are not the same as they left them. Suze, Becky's best friend, has found another best friend and her parents drop a bombshell on her. Becky has a long lost sister named Jessica \\"Jess\\". Once Becky meets her she finds out that she hates shopping. How can her sister hate shopping and what will they have in common? To make matters worse she makes Luke mad and has possibly ruined her marriage.If you have read the other shopaholic books then you will love this one. Sophia Kinsella creates characters that you can really relate to especially Becky. I think that Becky really grows as a person in this book and by far this is one of the best books in the series!! I can't wait to read more about Becky and Luke and their friends and family."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have read all previous shopaholic books,and I think they're all great!!!This book is wonderful for anyone who wants a lighthearted moment in the day.I am a stay at home mom of a 21 month old girl,so after I put her to bed,and after a stressful day,it is nice to curl up and get a good laugh!Becky's adventures always hold my attention.I found it hard to put the book down,and read it in just a few days.One things I would suggest,particularly to the review before mine,is that books like these are not intended to be taken seriously.I think its very insulting and assuming of someone to put that a writer has a \\"warped sense of marriage\\".That is the whole purpose of being a writer.Unless you are writing true stories,the whole point of it is to be in another world.I highly doubt that Mrs. Kinsella lives the same type of marriage that she writes about in her books.If she were doing that,then she would just be writing a story of her life,not a fictional character.If the previous book \\"pissed you off\\",I dont think I would have bought the next,so you really aren't in place to review it.Why even finish it if you found it to be so bad.I think that if Becky were a Bridget Jones,then what would have been the point in this series.A writer doesn't write a book to copy ones before it,they want to be unique,which is what this book is.Once again,a sweet LIGHTHEARTED,book.Not to be taken seriously of couse,and if you a an easygoing fun-loving person,I'm sure you will enjoy it.I cant wait for the next one!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I just finished listening to the audio edition of this book in my car and I thought it was hysterical! My two teenagers even enjoyed listening to the book with me..... we even parked the car and kept the motor running just to listen to the story. This is the first book in this series that I have heard.... I can't wait to get my hands on the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Before I bought this book I had read the reviews and I was disappointed to see that most everyone was saying they weren't pleased with this book. I am now done with reading shopaholic & sister, I found it to be great!!!! By now you know the characters and in this book you have a sense of emotion and understanding of what each character is thinking and going through!I thought it was a typical Becky Brandon (Bloomwood) rollercoaster. The ending of this book just left it open for another shopaholic adventure!!! I can't wait to hear what will happen next. Honestly a MOVIE should be made from these series haha I highly recommend!!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love Sophie Kinsella books so I was extremely happy when I heard that Shopaholic & Sister was coming out. I even pre-ordered it. It only took 3 days to read, but I was a little disappointed. The other 3 books in the series were laugh out loud funny, and I thought that this one was just off the mark. It won't keep me from reading any more in the series (if there are any... PLEASE) I love Bex and Suze and Luke... Please keep them coming, but leave Jess out of it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I bought this book while vacationing in Ireland and I'm so glad I did. You would think that after three Shopaholic books that Becky and her antics might get a little dull, but that is absolutely not the case. Shopaholic and Sister is just as funny, witty and absorbing as Confessions of a Shopaholic. Becky is hysterical and I found myself laughing out loud at many, many points in the book. I mean, mountain climbing in turquoise kitten heels with diamant&eacute; straps? Who wouldn't find that funny? I am thrilled that Sophie Kinsella has returned to Becky Brandon (n&eacute;e Bloomwood) and I look forward to the next chapter in her life."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I thought this book was horrible - I liked the first 3 books in the series, but this one was horribly written and the main character - who had previously been charming and loveable - in this book became a shallow, pretentious \\"cow\\" like her erstwhile nemesis Alicia \\"Bitch-Long Legs\\". I can't believe she never learned anything from getting herself into trouble with her spending - but I suppose this is because Luke keeps bailing her out. I was amazed that Luke wasn't ready to divorce her after the purchases arrived from their 10-month 5-star-hotel trip around the world - a trip that would cost most people their life savings. When Jess - an annoying character herself - tries to talk some sense into Becky, Becky's response is just to say \\"Well, nevermind.\\" And go shopping again. She goes to visit Jess to get help when she believes her marriage is in \\"tatters\\" because of her excessive spending and the first thing she does is to go into a shop and start buying stuff she doesn't need.The book became more painful to read with each chapter. I wanted to reach through the book and smack some sense into Becky a couple times when she kept doing the same thing again and again and again. In the first three books, she makes mistakes but she learns from them. In this book, it's like she never learned anything from her past mistakes of going out and buying more stuff when she's upset. What made Becky likeable in the previous books had been her naivete and charm, but in this book she comes across as extremely shallow and only concerned with money and material possessions. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This is the worst of the series so far. One question, can Becky Bloomwood get any dumber? In &quot;Confession&quot;, I assumed the auther was having fun with the personality. It was fresh and cute. As Becky's life progressed, her IQ was dropping from one book to the next. She becomes the typical &quot;air-head&quot;. It seems that all she knows is nothing else but fashion (don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Harvey Nicks and Harrods too). Her life seems to be flat and uninteresting. Sophie Kinsella may want to do more research if she wants to write the 5th shopaholic. It is very evidental that she has been taken over by a lot of British writers who can come up with better plots and characters.If you like the same stylish/ modern British chiklit, you can try Helen Dunne or Clare Naylor. Their writings are way better than Kinsella's. If you really want to read this book, wait for the mass market copy."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"The first books were great, simply because they were the first of their kind. Another lovable clueless English chick, ala Bridget Jones. But after three books on the same note, full of Becky's shallow character and stupidity, i just couldn't take it anymore.Note to Sophie Kinsella - time to stop with the \\"Shopaholic\\" series while you're ahead. I know similar to Becky one-brain cell women will gobble them up as long as they're written, but broaden your horizons a bit and dig deeper."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I agree with Rainforest's review...I loved the 2 first books of this series, 3rd one was \\"ok\\"....this one is simply boring...To be honest, you get bored with Becky's addiction to shopping, her blunders,...I even found her very, very stupid!...I'll read the latest books by Sophie KInsella, with the \\"other character\\", hoping that she will be more interesting than Becky, and that I will enjoy reading these books as much as I enjoyed the first stories of \\"shopaholic\\"."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I thoroughly enjoy the entire Shopaholic series..... I liked this one better than Shopaholic Ties the Knot. Yes - sometimes it can be silly, but that's what makes it so great! It lets you forget about your own problems for a short while and read about the ridiculousness that is Becky Brandon (formerly Bloomwood).I enjoyed reading about Becky's relationship, or lack thereof, with Jess, and her ever-evolving relationship with Luke as they settle into their marriage. I can think of no better books than the Shopaholic series when you want some funny, enjoyable chick lit to sink your teeth into. 5 Stars! :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I enjoyed the first couple of the Shopaholic series, but the rest just deteriorated in quality and fun. Shopaholic & Sister seems like a rush job, like the author was on a deadline, and slapped a few ideas together. It wasn't original and I gave up in the middle of the book. That said, I am still a big fan of Sophie Kinsella and look forward to reading her future non-shopaholic books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This was a good read (I love everything by Sophie Kinsella), but it definitely felt much slower than the other installments of the Shopaholic series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"While Becky's adventures in this Shopaholic book weren't quite as funny, it was entertaining and a quick, mindless read.Becky finds herself saddled with an older half-sister...a sister from one of her father's previous relationships. At first, she's delighted and determined for her sister to like her. Everyone else is skeptical that they're going to get along.Disaster strikes again and again in Becky's attempts to find something--anything--in common with Jess.I'm happy to report that a happy ending did happen, however obviously forced it turned out to be."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky Brandon is loving her honeymoon. She and new husband Luke are traveling the world, and the last ten months has just been like a never ending shopping spree filled with exotic goodies. Only hitch- Luke is slightly unaware of the extreme purchases Becky has being shipped to their home. Such as huge giraffe statues. But who doesn't need them? When the newlyweds decide it is time to get back to London and real life, Becky is slightly jilted on her return. Her best friend Suze has found a new BFF, the horrible condescending Lulu who seems to keep pushing Becky out of the way. But even more shocking- she has a sister! Turns out Becky's father had a fling with a train stewardess back in the 70's and Jessica is the result of that. Becky is thrilled! She now has someone that she can shop with, have sleepovers with, and have sister's night out together. What isn't great about that?Well, it isn't so great if your sister turns out to be a frugal environmentalist that - no!- hates shopping? How can that be? But it's true- Jess has no interest in designer labels and worse, doesn't seem to have any interest in getting to know Becky. Becky is crushed- but is also trying to untangle herself from another messy situation involving her, a purse, and Luke's professional reputation.Shopaholic and Sister by Sophie Kinsella will bring you the usual laughs from Becky's antics, but the ending will also teach a nice lesson on the importance of friends and family. This installment was actually one of my favorites; my interest was held until the very end with all the different situations playing out in the chapters. If you love the \`Shopaholic' series, this novel will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"In Shopaholic and Sister, Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) suddenly finds that she has a long-lost sister who unexpectedly hates shopping. How will Becky cope?! Not only is the relationship with her sister, Jessica, not as Becky had expected, but her friendship with Suze and marriage with Luke may also be in trouble. In this fourth book of the Shopaholic series, Becky once again charms her way into and out of trouble, but as always with a sense of humor and style.After coming home from a relaxing 10 month honeymoon with her husband Luke, Becky angers him with two secret truckloads of souvenirs and must cleverly get rid of it. As Becky finds out that her best friend Suze has replaced her with a snobby girl, Becky soon looks forward to meeting her half sister. Surprisingly they are total opposites and do not get along. Jessica is responsible, frugal, and hates shopping, meanwhile Becky is hysterically irresponsible, lavish, and loves shopping. Becky and Jessica soon get into an argument that seems to shatter any relationship that they have. As Becky is still distressed over the argument with her sister, her husband Luke finds out that she has secretly made a deal behind his back. Luke becomes furious and mentions unintentionally that Becky should be more like her sister. In an effort to save her marriage, Becky travels to the countryside to ask Jessica for advice.At times people frown upon Becky, but somehow she always shines in the end with her wittiness and sincerity. Despite being irresponsible, Becky's recklessness and wild imagination will surely entertain anyone looking for a fun and light read. I enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to read about a fun and lighthearted shopaholic."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Just love all the Shopaholic series.

Hands down!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER is yet another great book by Sophie Kinsella. Kinsella has created a character that is incredibly quirky and somewhat annoying, but is still loveable. SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER breathes new life into the Shopaholic series, and gives the readers a fun and carefree read.Becky and Luke are on their honeymoon - in fact, they've been honeymooning for ten months. They've gone to India, South America, North America, Denmark, and many more countries. The book starts off with the two in Sri Lanka, where they're participating in a yoga/meditation clinic. Becky and Luke have never been happier - Luke's relaxed (instead of being busy and worried about his business) and having a good time, and Becky can't believe how great the shopping is in all these countries!When Becky decides that she would like to go home earlier than planned so she can attend her best friend Suze's twins' Christening, Luke is all for it. That way he can get a head start on some more work.Their surprise visit to Becky's parents doesn't go too well, but she's so excited to see Suze that she ignores the weird way her parents were acting. But Suze has changed too! Her new best friend, Lulu, has totally changed her!Just as Becky thinks things can't get worse, her parents tell her something. She has a long lost sister named Jess! Becky is excited - now she'll have someone to joke around with, shop with, and have sleepovers with...until she meets Jess, who isn't anything like Becky imagined she would be.SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER is hilarious.

Becky and Luke are on their year-long honeymoon in the beginning of this one and having a wonderful time. Except that Becky can't remember how much she has spent or purchased in each country. The spending (and rationalizing) is enough to make you laugh hysterically. They end their honeymoon a little bit early and Becky is eager to surprise her parents and best friend Suze. However, they surprise her! Her parents tell her that she has a sister from a fling her father had before meeting her mother. And Suze has a new (and irritating) best friend. She thinks her sister will be her new best friend, but they couldn't be more different! Jess is frugal and HATES SHOPPING. The horror! Hilarity ensues as you read on. And definitely read on.

Returning from world traveling on their honeymoon, Becky and Luke hit some rough patches in their marriage. As the situation develops, you can't help thinking \\"Oh, noooo, Becky, don't do it.\\" But of course she plows ahead making the situation with her husband and her newly found sister go from bad to worse.Earlier Becky seemed self-centered, but here her actions seem more selfish. I tried to figure out why it was painful to read some of the developments. Kinsella hits too close to home sometimes with her seemingly light story of regretful situations that everyone falls into at least once in their life. Remember saying something unkind about someone and then turning to find them standing there? How about postponing telling someone you have goofed and their anger when they do find out? Kinsella makes us squirm a little as Becky goes through these situations.Happily it all works out for the best and the reader ends on an upbeat feeling."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Can Becky Brandon (n&eacute;e Bloomwood) be anymore like me?!?! I love her!!!!! She is the best character to appear in a book since sliced bread. Hats off to Sophie Kinsella who once again brought our heroine Becky back with full force, ready for another adventure.Becky and Luke return from their 10 month-long globe trotting honeymoon to find situations not quite the way they left it. Here she is thinking that things will fall right back into place when the pair of them get back home to their friends and family... Little did she know, her last name wasn't the only thing that changed.When her best friend Suze befriends another \\"best friend\\" Becky feels left out and distances herself away from her. She later on comes to find out from her parents - who have been acting EXTREMELY weird since she's been back - that she has a long lost sister. This is great! Now that Suze has moved on with her life, and found a new friend she has a SISTER to replace her... and this time it will be extra special because they are family and they will have that \\"special bond\\" that sisters have... She couldn't be more wrong. Becky's sister is THE complete opposite. She is frugal, plain, and HATES to shop! Becky is sure that this cant be possible. She tries any and everything to get along with her sister, but any and everything just isn't good enough. They simply cannot get along, and as time goes on they begin to despise each other... But the reason they cant get along maybe the fact that they are more alike than they think.This was such a good book. Becky hasn't changed one bit. She is the same wacky shopaholic we know and love.The ending was great...

Although she does tell some things about these bands, it was mostly about her. She toots her own horn quite a bit, takes credit for alot of the things that ac/dc did, and a few times refers to herself as \\"hot\\". I am glad I did not spend alot of money on it."},{"Title":"Rock N Roll Fantasy","review":"I normally am not one to post reviews for the books I read, but when you ask me to pay money to read a \\"supposed\\" true account of how things happened and then give us this, future buyers deserve opinions. I don't think there could of been a better title for this book.This is nothing but a self-congratulatory pat on the back fantasy from the author.Ms. Masino seems to have single handedly come up with every great idea or fix for any music review rags and rock group fan clubs. She also, at the ripe age of 21-22, seems to have known exactly which of our great rock groups would go on to become so, and exactly when. Not long into the book she tells AC/DC after first seeing them on an August night in '77 that they will be world famous, \\"not right away of course, but she predicts in 2-3 years.\\" And what album was released exactly 3 years to the month of that date??.......it was Back in Black!!I knew then it was going to be a painful read. As an avid book reader it is very rare for me not to finish a book, I have been pleasantly surprised in the past by some books I at first couldn't get into. Here, this was not the case. I knew I had to read it as if I was picking up a tabloid in the checkout line.She tries to make clear that she is a \\"professional journalist\\" and not some groupie, yet she has been with many of the members of well known bands or they were often after her and she wants you to know it. Sometimes it read like a journalist's point of view, others like Pamela Des Barres's. It was a disappointment for me.I just realized another book I purchased is by this same author, that one will be returned unread. It may be better, but I just can't stomach the smug writing style. Even though it is way past the 30 days I'll take whatever refund they give me, this one here will serve my fireplace well. It does not deserve space on my bookshelf. It is also very cheaply, very badly, printed. That should have been clue #1.I then see that the author has posted raving reviews on Amazon under her own name for her own two books!! I hadn't caught that when I read the 2 reviews that were here when I purchased this one. If I had saw that the review was posted under the author's own name I never would have bought it.They aren't written by her, she states, when a reader calls her out on posting her own review in the comment section of the review she posted for her other book \\"AC/DC-Let There Be Rock\\". It doesn't matter Ms. Masino if you wrote them or not, in posting them you just as well did write them. For an author to do that is pitiful. Seeing those after the self important attitude of the book is what prompted me to write my review. I also wonder about the first review posted for this book by \\"A Customer\\"....Hmmmmmm...It certainly reads like a promo to me. It's very concise and reads like a publisher or writers' words.Ms. Masino, you shouldn't ask for our money and valuable time then give us nothing but ego.If you want to read a good story minus the pompous attitude by a music journalist, I suggest you buy \\" Life on Planet Rock\\" by Lonn Friend. Fantastic. Mr. Friend is a true fan of rock music first, his career in the music biz is just the cherry on top. By the end of that book, Mr. Friend truly makes you feel like one of his many, many good friends."},{"Title":"Rock N Roll Fantasy","review":"I bought this book after reading Susan Masino's AC/DC biography (well worth reading also). This book is basically stories about her interviews and run-ins with lots of great 70s bands. Some great Van Halen, Cheap Trick and Nuge stories included.What makes Susan Masino's writing so good is that it comes from a fan's perspective. She comes across as a true fan of these bands, not some journalist who is mildly interested."},{"Title":"Rock N Roll Fantasy","review":"...For anyone interested in first hand stories about bands like AC/DC, Kiss, Ted Nugent, Van Halen, Cheap Trick (and many others) this is a must-have book!

The pictures are exceptionally thorough, and you can almost always find one of the model you are working on. The narrative is well crafted, and almost all needed explanations are included. The author has been successful in presenting needed steps and procedures that even an amateur can follow without bogging down in needless detail or cutting corners that the experienced reader would already know. I have been especially gratified that he includes procedures and information that the other \\"manuals\\" I use have omitted. This has been my \\"go to\\" source so far. Only weaknesses I see are that I have had to search, sometimes diligently, to find CJ2A information I needed, and the absence of parts numbers or exploded diagrams [including these was obviously not in his plan--further, they are readily available elsewhere].

This book is about this poor girl (she's not literally poor) who is mistreated by her only leftover kin. Well, actually, they SAID that her father and sister were eaten by the hybrid birmbas (part bear/gorilla, I think), and they had the remains of the pater, but not the soror (father and sister. Think of derivatves!). Is her sister alive? What is the meaning of her locket? Leona's her name, and her sister is Nell. What will happen? Leona, birmba. Birmba, this is Leona...well, whatever.

No explanations are given for why the great disaster caused a tyranny to arise nor are the tyrants, \\"The rulers\\", ever revealed as actual people . The reader doesn't know where they live or why they act as they do.More disturbingly the book is a crude attempt at feminism of an out of date type. There is even a culminating section in which the noble brave women slaughter the evil stupid men.There is an incompetent attempt to criticize racism but again not enough background. A quick reader might easily miss that Lex is a Native American.I would not recommend this book for any age.

For instance, I think a lot of things are way too easy for Leora, and that people are also too willing to believe her story. For people who are oppressed and ready to get into a war, they are unrealistically trusting of her, and her \\"predictions\\" which they buy into almost immediately. I also thought Leora was a very pale character, with not a lot of life. I am a very avid reader, and I like almost everything I read, so the fact that I disliked this so much is a surprise even to me. However, it is an amusing read, and like I've previously stated, the plot line is pretty good. Worth getting from a friend or the library, but use your book money to buy Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials instead."},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"this is a highly intresting book that I would recommend to almost anyone. The setting is in the future. A horrible disaster ( meteor crashed into earth) had occured, which has thrust civilization backwards, with no real technology. The story takes place in what was once the state of maine, but is now the small country of Maynor. The people are ruled by an oppressive goverment and are given little freedom. They live in fear of the birmbas, mutated animals which were created by meltdowns from nuclear power plants in the Disaster, and are said to be extremely dangerous. The main character, Leora, is an orphan who lives with her step-family (this may sound a little cliche, but I promise it really isn't that bad!). She has a webbed hand because of the side-effects of the Disaster, and through it has the ability to draw pictures that depict the future. She is scorned becausew of her hand, however, and, under normal curcumstances would be sent to the institute, a place for people lke her that are mutataed, if it were not for the fact that her father married an important woman of the village, and she keeps Leora because she would feel to guilty otherwise, although she has no love at all for Leora.

But one day everything changes when she saves a baby Brinbar from being killed and stepps outside to forbidden lands. When she is caught she runs away on her own quest for family, and to find out more about her past.I loved this book. It takes place in a futuristic world that resembles the one that Lois Lowry has so expertly crafted in her books such as THe Giver and Gathering Blue. It's suspenceful, exciting, and filled with beautiful descriptions. It will remain one of my favriotes for a long time and I can old hope for a sequel!

Now, the disaster had repeated itself and befallen the Earth once again. A government strives to dictate the few remaining establishments, feeding them lies to turn them against each other and prevent a rebellion. All the while, controlling the food supply to force the people into dependency, and terrifying the populace with frightening tales of the Birmbas: mutated man-eating gorilla/black bear creatures who terrorize the forests beyond the village walls.But when Leora discovers a captured Birmba cub, and finds out they're not as 'horrible' as the corrupted government might like to believe, can she survive the jungle outside of civilization, reach safety with her Birmba friend, and keep hidden her secret, the illegal \\"defect\\" beneath her very own cloak? Will she find the answers she's been searching for, answers to the mysterious deaths of her father and older sister, many years past; answers to the strange inscribed locket she received as birthright; or even fathom the meaning of an island full of quite a diversity of young women, from all 15 villages, yet who share one, common goal: freedom?Even more intriguingly, will the Hermit Thrush, a bird with a voice as sweet as a nightingale's, not heard since before the disaster, decades ago, ever sing again?I LOVED this book, and would recommend its splendor to any reader, however young or old!! Those who love to wonder of might be will enjoy this mesmerizing tale!"},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"A girl with webbed fingers on one hand inhabiting a post meteorite-catastrophy America is pretty standard fare for most Young Adult fantasy novels. What makes The Hermit Thrust Sings a better read than the rest of the tripe on the shelves are the precise character portraits.The narrator, Leora, lives in the former state of Maine, now the country of Maynor. She is spunky and smart, but has a ton of baggage familiar to most teenagers: feeling ostracized at school, issues with her step family, fears about the future. Of course, Leora is considered a mutant and threatened with incarceration at The Institute on a daily basis. And her fear of the future comes from the fact that she can &quot;see&quot; events before they happen and has vivid and violent visions.Then there is the matter of Leora's first tentative steps she takes away from her home. She doesn't go off to college but rather frees a captured baby \`\`birmba''--a mutant bear-ape-- and helps it find its mother. (Side note: I really loved the frightening yet gentle birmbas--they make interesting companions for a feisty girl like Leora) This act of defiance leads her to a whole new life outside of the heavily guarded village she has always called home.Leora, like most teenagers, finds herself questioning the authority of her elders. Her search for the truth about what is happening in the villages of Maynor also leads her towards her long lost sister---and a band of insurgents. Issues of race and class are touched in interesting ways, as are gender issues. It seems the rebels against The Rulers of Maynor are mostly descendants of Latin American migrant workers--but the brains behind the operation are a group of teenaged girls. Now that's what I call Girl Power!Author Butler does use some unconvincing plot devices, but in the end, Leora's story is a compelling one. The portrait of a teen girl, self-conscious and angst filled at one moment, full of ideas and longing the next, is right on the money."},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"I couldn't put down this book. Every second was so tense that I had to go on. Each time I thought Leora was going to be okay something suspenseful would happen to keep me reading. The feelings and expressions that the author described really put me into Leora's world. I felt like I was on a leash. Where the author led me, I followed.The Redwall books are my favorite and the Hermit Thrush Sings came very close with dramatic description and great storytelling.Jack, 11 years old"},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"I read this book my senior year in highschool.

My only disappointment is in not finding any other fiction by this author. I want a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"The work just isn't that well written. And yes, I know it's designed for children, but children's books can, and should be, extraordinarily well written. But nothing pulls you into this child's life. The author portrays the feeling of trying to create magic, and being quite unsuccessful at it. In the end the listener is struck with wonder that everything worked together, with multiple deus ex machinas. And the voice of Kate Forbes is not only sickly-sweet, but lacks character range.Still, children will likely enjoy it, and it's something to stick in the car as you are driving on a long trip. It's just not good literature."},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"I had decided to read this book for a book report a while ago. I was mostly inspired by the original plot to read it, however, I was disappointed by the rushed writing and lack of descriptions of characters and locations. Throughout the book, even the main character does not have a distinct age, physical appearance, or personality (unless you own the paperback copy with her on the cover). And although she does have the power of clairvoyance, most of the story is way too predictable. I would recommend this for young children who do not see such points as important, but for older readers, though, I think you should pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Hermit Thrush Sings","review":"When the world was hit by a meteor many years before, the world itself forever changed. Society reformed, but into a different position and with different forms of new breeds of people created by the devastating blow of the meteor. Thus began a new people, different in looks but still maintaining human characteristics and features. Leora is one of those called 'Mutants' -- people that were formed by the meteor, often referred to as defectives. She has one webbed hand, a marvelous hand that can perform fantastic gifts for her, the gift to draw things like no one else. Though she is mocked by her people for her defective hand, she defies their mockery and soon sets off on an unforgettable adventure : beyond the Wall, where all people of her home, Village Fifteen, are forbidden to go. What lurks behind those mysterious walls? What will become of it when she finally has the courage to go beyond the Wall, defying the laws? She soon becomes involved in a battle to save all she knows, and sees wondrous things that no one could have the gift of seeing but her. Leora wants to answer all the mysteries that surround her, but first she must keep herself alive and make the right friends to help conquer what lay ahead of her on her dangerous journey. The Hermit Thrush Sings was an excellent and marvelously plotted and written novel by Susan Butler. Readers of Lois Lowry's poetic novel GATHERING BLUE will no doubt love this wonderful young adult novel. But even if you aren't the type to read such a novel, The Hermit Thrush Sings because it truly is an exception from many, many young adult fiction novels to choose from."},{"Title":"Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy","review":"Reviewers are always amazed at Freya Stark for travelling \\"alone,\\" a single lady in the desert, but she always had 20-40 men with her as guides or baggage carriers. Ida Pfeiffer, traveling in 1842, WAS alone, getting around on steamers or sailing vessels and then seeing all the tourist sites on her own or in the company of a few people she met on the trip or a single guide and a camel driver in Arab countries. She even argued with them when they tried to hold her up for baksheesh. She writes very well in a straight-forward descriptive style which is somewhat affected by translation. I have been to many of the places she describes on trips with the AIA (Archaeological Institute of America) which are made up of other tourists, guides, and academic speakers, and I marvel at how she could have done this on her own. The language barrier alone would be formidable. She took letters of introduction and often was put up by those people to whom they were addressed, but sometimes not. She travelled for HOURS a day on camelback, horses(which whe had never ridden), and on foot, sometimes without food or water for long periods of time.

His writing is full of grace and enlightenment. In this book he takes on the difficult task of explaining the true condition of a human being-impermanent conditional consciousness. This topic is very difficult to explain by putting it into words. The Dalai Lama does a great job and then follows up with many exercises. Here is how I would summarize this books teachings:We are not our body, nor even our mind. if we were we could not say my mind or my body. Then what are we? We are \\"like\\" and illusion existing through our 5 aggregates, body, thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and consciousness. No \\"I\\" can be located. The closest we can come is understanding that we are consciousness observing the present moment, all else is thought and mental formation. Who we think we really are is just a mental formation we hold in our mind of our beliefs about ourselves our religion, height, weight, name, etc. Enlightenment is simply understanding this and the nature of reality.I hope I did some justice to this books topic, but I highly recommend reading this book to move farther down the road to enlightenment."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"I have over 100 books on buddhism and meditation and if I had to pick my favorite this is it.

In Buddhism, it is suggested that all our problems spring from the misapprehension that we and everything around us are separate 'things.' This book deals directly with this issue and provides a very solid foundation for practice, which so many other books on this subject lack. If you liked Ken Wilber's \\"No Boundary,\\" I think you may love this book, as it approaches the same subject from a different perspective and includes methods of practice as well."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"This is a book to own and reread if you want to grasp its depth. I would also suggest having some practice or enough introspection to continue the delving into understanding that the HH Dalai Lama is well practiced in and so shares his personal findings within these pages. There are years of wisdom emanating from these words which convinces us that compassion and calm abiding are approachable, it is the way we must be and we must practice and teach others to do so.But first we must understand ourselves and our tendency toward ignorance most especially our confusion with inherency. That is all is dependant on all, nothing exists in and of itself and as such all is intricately related with cause and effect. Dare I try to explain! The HH Dalai Lama walks us through and provides meditative exercises so we can learn to understand the emptiness of inherency and free ourselves through practicing morality, meditation and wisdom. I am still discovering these blessed implications that manifest themselves each day and further affirm that all is in view. Read to continue your own discovery and to see for yourself."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"Like a few other reviewers, I am in the beginning stages of my practice of Buddhism, and I have struggled with some of the concepts I have read about from other authors, lamas, and practitioners. However, when I read this book by the Dalai Lama, the veil was lifted from my eyes and I literally felt the sudden rush of understanding. Never have I meditated on a topic so deep and full of mystery and felt that it had been explained so thoroughly and with such clarity.The pages just fly by as you get lost in your own thoughts - your world will be literally turned upside down as you proceed through the chapters. This book will have you thinking long after completion and will allow you to experience your life through completely different (and more compassionate and understanding) eyes.Highly recommended for experienced practitioners, as well as beginners like me who wish to grasp an extremely deep and insightful concept that will not be explained with better clarity."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"As a beginner in Buddhism, this was the first Buddhist book that I read.

There are also many parts of the book that are redundant which also caused me to lose focus every now and again.

I agree with another poster who said that some of it should be glossed over. I'm glad I read it, but I don't think I'd necessarily rave about it and tell others to run out and buy it.

I have three [3] other audio books by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, 'Live in a better way', 'The art of Happiness', and 'The art of Happiness at work' and those are more engaging.An audio book must deliver more than just the spoken word, it should pull the listener in. I wished he had used someone else to deliver the audio book. A hard listen for me despite the subject matter.

Here he introduces us to the human struggle between the conditioned world of thoughts, memories and perceptions in which we spend most of our lives, and a totally different way of being as the unconditioned space that contains all. We are not our thoughts or even our emotions although we act as if we were over and over again, and this is the origin of our suffering. It is only through the path of mindfulness and waking up that we can break free from this illusional world of habitual reactivity we call self or ego. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"Emotions distort reality of self and others. Buddhism is a practice and a religion that offers a way out of illusion (Mara). The Dalai Lama brings forth his own wisdom as a world soul teacher immersed in Tibetan Buddhism. A wonderful guide on getting out of your own way."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"A previous reviewer says that His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama is the closest thing we have to Buddha on earth. I think his Holiness would disagree, first because he is an exceedingly humble man, and second because he would say, as the Buddha Shakyamuni did, that we are all Buddhas.HOW TO SEE YOURSELF AS YOU REALLY ARE is a wonderful audiobook filled with wisdom and practical exercises to help us all learn mindfulness and compassion, the two watchwords of Buddhist practice. Six discs in length, HOW TO SEE YOURSELF AS YOU REALLY ARE is a detailed manual of practice. It is read by His Holiness' translator, Jeffrey Hopkins, who manages to work his way through some rather esoteric concepts without losing the thread of the Dalai Lama's lessons. Hopkins is not a theatrical reader, and this is not really an audiobook to be listened to while doing anything else (like driving); it requires VERY active listening.My only negative criticism revolves around the complex, textbook quality of the material. Numbered lists, chapter subheadings, end of chapter exercises, and meditative reflections really require the student to take notes. There's no question that HOW TO SEE YOURSELF AS YOU REALLY ARE needed to be released with an accompanying paperback and a workbook. Fortunately, the paperback is available separately.There's a lot of depth here, and you'll be listening to His Holiness' lessons many times over. Don't go into this audiobook thinking that it is going to be a Snooze Along with the Lama lecture."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"When I first saw that the Dalai Lama had written books I knew that I had to read them.I have a huge amount of respect for this man.The first book I have read by the Dalai Lama is \\"How to See Yourself As You Really Are\\".It is a book on Buddhism, about realizing how we exist and the interdependency in which we live.I haven't read much about Buddhism before, not more than we were forced to in school, but what I learned in this book was a great place to start, it was in many ways a beginners guide to finding the clarity Buddhists are after.Everything is dependentPeople and things don't inherently exist; we exist as the result of many different things working together. Just look for example at a table, we often see it as one thing, existing in and of itself, but it is really just a sum of parts and it only exists because someone put it together.Just like our body is just the result of many cells working together who in turn are built by many molecules.The whole mindset teaches you to calm negative emotions by going to their root, by understanding cause and effect and that things aren't independent but instead interdependent.I understand why people become BuddhistsThe whole way of life of a Buddhist is very intriguing. Learning to control your mind, to feel love to all around and continuously improving yourself.I plan on reading a lot more about Buddhism in the future, as I plan to read about all the major religions.The lessons we can learn from religion is both important and enlightening, as long as we read with a combination of openness and a willing to find the underlying lesson, not taking everything for absolute truth.The question markWhen I read the Dalai Lamas book he many times discusses the \\"I\\", what is it? It is not our body, since we say \\"my body\\", it is not the mind since we also say \\"my mind\\". It isn't the mind + body since that would mean that they are one and the same, which they aren't.The problem is that I never got an answer to this question in the book.As a Christian I would answer, the \\"I\\" is the soul. It is the soul that is something other than the body and mind, something we cannot find, measure or understand.But I still wonder what a Buddhist considers the \\"I\\", what is it that gathers Karma and gets reborn?The answer wasn't in the book.I encourage you to read this bookSince reading \\"How to See Yourself As You Really Are\\" I have learned to take better control over my emotions and have a better understanding for myself and for others.I deeply encourage you to read this book, it holds many valuable lessons and a viewpoint not often encountered in western society, a view point worth listening to."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"After having gotten more deeply into the teachings I now realize what a master of explanation His Holiness is. All his books from simple to complex are amazing in the way they sense the confusion in us and answer our questions as we go. In other words, he can tailor his teachings to all levels. THIS book is easy to understand And yet covers the deeper more complex truths. IT is only a start. I am reading everything I can get by him but especially his treatises on the Dharma. This is a small book, easy to read and go back over, and carry in your bag. He is an amazing teacher. I did not realize how clear he is until I read harder books then hear him go over and over again the same things in a million different ways until we get it. Any book by him is a great blessing to have the grace to read."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"I don't agree with what's being said in this book. Fundamentally, this book teaches you that objects don't really exist in and of itself (inherent existence) but exists as a result of other dependent objects (dependent-arising). The basic idea is that when you see objects as inherently existing, your mind exaggerates-- for example, objects that you hate will seem uglier than they really are, and objects that you love will seem more beautiful than they really are. This exaggeration is the basis for ignorance (not seeing things as they really are), which results in other negative emotions such as lust, hate, etc, that creates a cycle of suffering in the world.\\"Ignorance, by relying on appearances, superimposes onto persons and things a sense of concreteness that, in fact, is not there.... by giving people and things around us this exaggerated status, we are drawn into all sorts of overblown and ultimately hurtful emotions.\\"In a nutshell, this book teaches you to see everything objectively and clinically -- e.g. a beautiful woman is nothing more than a collection of symmetrical body parts whose fat content is proportionate to each other. The problem is that in looking at the world clinically and objectively (detached from emotion), you also remove the \\"art\\" since human sight is 100% perception (i.e beauty is in the eye of the beholder). For example, a woman with a big nose is cute to some people precisely because that outstanding feature is what makes her unique and endearing. Without art, a woman with a big nose is always an ugly woman.That said, this book is beautifully written. It's amazing how the Dalai Lama can express such deep and abstract concepts into very simple language that's easy to read. It takes a person with great insight and clarity of mind to write this book, which shows that the Dalai Lama is not merely a man with a fancy title, but someone worthy of respect as a spiritual/religious leader."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"How You See Yourself As You Really Are is an amazing book. It is very detailed with clear explanations which have made me understand how I should look at myself from the Buddhist's and spiritual point of view.

He explains that we mistakenly view people, things, and other phenomena as inherently existing in their own right, but in fact their existence is dependent on their parts, their causes, and thought (i.e., our perception). The Dalai Lama expresses that by understanding emptiness, people will be able to free themselves of negative emotion, become more compassionate, help others, and end their cyclic of rebirth.What I liked: The Dalai Lama explains concepts that I may have been aware of but had not really reflected on. He repeats most concepts enough that you are easily able to remember them. I also thought the introduction was excellent; it was inclusive, open-minded, and it laid out why this book is important.What I disliked: The concept of the absence of inherent existence is repeated far too often. I tend to be a concrete thinker and don't do as well with abstractions, so if halfway through the book I felt like I was being beat over the head with the repetition of ideas, I can only imagine how less concrete thinkers felt. I also think it would have been helpful for the Dalai Lama to provide some more examples, especially as there were a few parts where I actually needed elaboration and did not get it, as opposed to much of the rest of the book in which there was, in my opinion, unnecessary elaboration on the concept of emptiness. Also, he does not explain how individuals can help others by using these principles. The approach seems almost naive; even if one were to commit oneself fully to helping others understand emptiness and the importance of compassion, there is no discourse regarding how to do this. Many people are not open to new ideas unless they are ready to be open to new ideas. I kept being reminded of the proverb that you can lead a horse to water . . .Finally, in the introduction the Dalai Lama explains that he values all religions, all are important, and his goal is to lay out some Buddhist principles that he thinks will help encourage love and concern for the welfare of others, which he believes to be of vital importance. However, I think he goes too far by talking about ending the cycle of rebirth. I don't take issue with the concept of rebirth; however, it seems counterproductive to his goals to repeatedly emphasize that understanding emptiness and cultivating love and compassion will help end cyclic existence. This end result is the carrot, so to speak. However, for those who do not believe in cyclic existence, they may lack a reason to follow the tenets the Dalai Lama describes. He particularly thinks it is important for world leaders to have insight and compassion, and I don't see this book as being much of a catalyst for those who do not believe in rebirth."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"This accessible text somehow manages to distill the profound methods laid out by the Buddha (and then restated by Nagarjuna and later adept followers of the Buddha) on how exactly to deconstruct this seemingly unbudge-able sense of an inherently existing self. Of course, it takes great determination -- particularly in the 21st century -- to think about and implement the teachings in this book. But since this habitual and unquestioned way of experiencing ourselves (as permanent, unitary and not depending on anything) is the font of all our pain, it behooves us to give it a shot.H. H. Dalai Lama and Jeffrey Hopkins have given us a fighting chance with this jewel of a book."},{"Title":"How to See Yourself As You Really Are","review":"This book explains, in direct and very concise language, the Buddhist teachings of impermanence and selflessness and provides meditation instrucions for personally generating these insights. One warning: Even in this clear and concise language, these teachings can sometimes be confusing and are very intricate. That's probably why this entire book is devoted to just a few concepts. It just spirals deeper and deeper to the core of Buddhist thought.

It offers the longterm dammage that is enevetable.Kit Allan, LSW"},{"Title":"Silently Seduced: When Parents Make their Children Partners - Understanding Covert Incest","review":"There aren't very many books on the subject of emotional incest. Were this the only one, I'd have to buy it. However, I've read two such books: Kenneth Adams's _Silently Seduced_ and Patricia Love's _The Emotional Incest Syndrome: What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life_. Patricia Love's book is far superior.I borrowed and read both books from the public library before making a purchasing decision. Whenever there are too many 5-star (or 1-star) Amazon reviews by 'A Customer', I've found this approach useful.The discussions in _Silently Seduced_ were too general to be useful. Too much of the text was spent discussing father/daughter and mother/son emotional incest in two-parent families. _Silently Seduced_ has a small number of excellent one-of observations, however, one could write these down after having borrowed the book from the public library.In contrast, Patricia Love's _The Emotional Incest Syndrome: What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life_ goes into greater detail about a wider variety of family configurations. Different issues come up when the emotional incest is between a married father and his eldest daughter, a single mother and her only daughter, a single mother and her only son, and so on. These subtle differences are important if one is looking to these books for advice on self-healing, as I am.Love's emphasis that an unbalanced dynamic between any two family members affects ALL other family members is critical to understanding the damage wrought by emotional incest. Love's objective presentation of this chain-reaction, in different types of families, helps the reader to approach their own problems more effectively. It helped me to begin to understand root causes and to put my considerable anger into perspective. For me, this was huge. I came away from Love's book with a directed approach to handling my past that I was unable to derive from Kenneth Adams's _Silently Seduced_.I'm glad I borrowed both Kenneth Adams's and Patricia Love's books from the public library first.Because I KNOW I will want to re-read several parts of Patricia Love's _The Emotional Incest Syndrome: What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life_, I plan on buying only that book."},{"Title":"Silently Seduced: When Parents Make their Children Partners - Understanding Covert Incest","review":"This is the best book I've read on the subject so far. I underlined about half of the book. It is concise, incisive, it is \`substance-full', it's easy to read and understand, and it is comprehensive. There are other great books out there but I'm always so grateful for authors who know what they're talking about, who get to the point quickly, and who seem more concerned with quality than with quantity. I'm sure Mr. Adams could have produced a book 4 times that size if he had wanted, thanks God He didn't!I'll add this: if you are an emotional incest survivor, know that there are millions of us out there.Also realize that neither this book nor any other book will solve your problem, but it will help you understand what your problem is, and that's a huge part, perhaps the most important part of solving any problem.But as with everything else, recovery will require patience, diligence, qualified help, trial and error, and an open-mind, don't be afraid to try different approaches and don't believe everything people tell you, no matter how qualified they are. Remain in control of your life and destiny and understand that even the most well-intended person out there can mislead you. Listen to expert, take what you need, and leave out the rest.

The children become the receptacle for all the frustrated sexual energy the parents are experiencing, even if they are not talking about it. This is exactly what happened to me -- the oldest daughter of an alcoholic and his angry wife. Finally, I understand the &quot;ickiness&quot; (the author's word) I still feel every time I am required to spend time with my parents.This book talks about the specific, sexualized emotions you experience while growing up in a dysfunctional home that don't get articulated because it's too squeamish to talk about them. And yet, it does so in a very safe and comforting manner. It's like getting the hug and shoulder to lean on that you never got growing up.Facing the truth of being emotionally used by one's parents is a sobering experience -- but oh what a relief to have these feelings explained and validated.

Subtle things that might seem innocent in a parent's mind can actually cross a line into inappropriate territory with a child and his/her development. The child may feel \\"icky,\\" but also privileged to have such special attention from the parent.The author offers advice for recovery and gives very clear statements about what must happen in order for the adult survivor of covert incest to make healthy changes and free him/herself from binding dependencies.I purchased this book based on a recommendation on a message board. Wow! I am filled with relief to suddenly realize why I feel this way and why there are these inexplicable patterns in my life. The biggest relief of all is to know I'm not alone and that my odd feelings about my parents are not unjustified. I read it and said, \\"Finally!

I read it from cover to cover, in one sitting. Just could not put it down. It is written in a clear and concise manner. Almost every word seems well selected and carefully considered to support the theme of the whole book. Very convincing with powerful logic.I have to admit when I was hesitant to order this book at the beginning. I thought, \\"What this says about me, if I need to read a book on this topic?\\" I felt uncomfortable to put myself in the category of covert incest victim.Several things which are happening in my life, made me decide to take a try. My career has experienced a setback for several years. I have difficulty in establishing a great long term relationship. And most immediately, I have dreams of being angry at my parents. Those dreams rarely occur, but when they do, once or twice a year, I find my whole body tighten up in anger when I wake up. I ask myself, if I can be so angry about something I don't understand, why not spend some time to understand what exactly makes me so angry?When the book arrived, I wrapped it up in a book cover to hide the name. I have to agree this is an uncomfortable topic and I do not want to be seen reading such a book in public.But let me tell you, this is one of the most important books I have read in years. It is neatly organized:First two chapters:-What is the silent seduction?-When is a child betrayed by a parent's love?Introduce the concept of silent seduction and general pattern.The next two chapters:-The man of the house-Daddy's little girlTalk about the specific situations in case of a mother and a son, and a father and a daughter. The author uses different cases to address different areas. It is quite specific.The following chapters:-When does sex become a hiding place?Discusses the impact on the victim's sexual feelings when the victim grows up.-The struggle to CommitTalk about the impact on relationships the victim will face as an adultThe last chapter:-Towards WholenessA short but comforting guide towards healing.When I was reading the first two chapters, I found myself nodding occasionally but suspicious. But when it got specific, my eyes grew wide, as I saw a step by step description of my life. It is as if the author had followed my life and summed it up in different cases. It is scary to see your life being so accurately depicted.As it was very late (midnight), I went to sleep. And I was sad. The author reminds in the last chapter that when we let it go, we would feel sadness.I turned back and forth on bed, feeling emptiness. The kind of emptiness you feel when you cannot find the purpose in life.The book made a very important point, that when we were treated as special by our parents, often it is perceived as love from our parents, and we hang on to it as the only and most powerful love we have experienced, but actually it is not love, it is an expression of needs of our parents. We were there merely to satisfy the emotional needs of our parents. And our needs, when as little kids, were ignored.Logically, I accepted this point. But emotionally, it was sad to recognize the single most powerful love in our life experience was not even love. It brought a question: what do we live for?Since I could not sleep, I got up and started reading again.The next chapter talks about sex addicts. I almost laughed, hey, this could not be about me. Out of curiosity, I did not skip it entirely. Wow, when my finger touched on the last page of this chapter, it turned out it was talking about me. It talks about the seeking of sexual highs, and the seductive patterns.It exactly describes the experience I have been having in the last year. I reveled in the attention of many suitors. I seduced one after another. Of course, the seduction was very subtle. I behaved exactly like a lady, but secretly put the man of my seduction in anxiety to get me. It was like a power game. And I felt safe when powerful men fell for me. And I do not stay for any long term relationship. I just seduced and moved on. The reason why I never labeled myself as sex addict, was because actual sex seldom happened. The seduction was very sexually charged (with strong sexual energy), but I almost always moved on before the man could actually get me on bed.I did not realize this was what I was doing until I read this book. I just did it unconsciously. For me, it was a game of fun and power to get back at men, and to make myself feel safe, treasured, chased and desirable. Upon this chapter, I began to realize, maybe, just maybe, it is the start of sexual and love addiction.The chapter also talks about double life. It did make me laugh, because in my fantasy of success, I always added on a second life of sexual satisfaction. It is my ideal life to be a highly successful woman, with a colorful secret sex life. The thrill of having a secret dirty life against common convention seems so exciting and satisfying, against the background of success and social recognition.This chapter makes me rethink my goal. Is my goal of success, really something I want, or is it a way to get back at my past so that I do not need to face my past? Is that a way to prove to my parents I grow up to be better than them, beyond their wildest expectations? Is this a way to prove myself I was not hurt by my parents, I grow over and above the hurtful past?My career is in a setback for several years now. It happened very unexpectedly. When everyone expected me to become a great career woman, suddenly all motivation drained away from me. For several years, I just sat around, wanting to do nothing. In business meetings, though I knew I probably were the most qualified in giving out professional opinions (due to my qualification and educational background), I sat in a corner, demure and obscure. I do not understand why I hate to go out, getting what I deserve, and what the other people think I deserve. It is like I clipped my own wings intentionally.It came to a point that I took a look at my past. I had been a wonder kid academically. I found whenever my academic future or career future opened up to a new height, somehow, on several important occasions, I just escaped the night (or months) before it happened. I undid the effort I put in for years, to avoid collecting the fruit of being much more successful than others.Every time I did that, it was extremely painful for me afterwards. Guilt and confusion took over. It took years to build the base for success, and it took years to recover from the disappointment of escaping from success and make a comeback. It was like a cycle. Maybe it finally got to my spirit, and I started to associate the prospect of success, with the slow and deep pains from disappointment and fear of escaping again. So, in the end, I felt chasing success did not worth it any more.In Ken Adams's book, it discusses the ambivalence of commitment to relationships. It is an extremely interesting chapter. From my personal point of view, I do see my own relationship surfacing from the pages, a quick commitment, an illusion of starting anew, followed by a slow stew of doubt, and the desire to get out.I do wish this wonderful enlightening chapter could address more issues: not only commitment to relationships, but also commitment to goals and personal ambitions. Does the fear of abandonment drive us away not only from committing to intimacy, but also to allowing ourselves the success we deserve, work hard for, and deny ourselves for?When it comes to the last chapter, it is comforting to see we are not hopeless. It talks about letting go of your idealized image of the seductive parent. Among the many thing I learn from reading this book, this is probably the most important. To realize what you cherish as the best love and the integral part of your childhood memory and what makes who you are today, is actually an unconscious seduction by your parent to realize his or her own need in an unhappy relationship. It is not about you, and never about you. And you miss the important development phase of recognizing your own needs, building your own character, wants and values as a human being. Chasing your parent's love is like chasing emptiness, something they never can give, and something which does not exist. The lack of it makes a strong emptiness in your heart, since you never learn how to live for yourself. That phase of development was stolen from you, by the need of your parents.Naturally it is angry to recognize it. It feels like being betrayed by someone so close to your heart. I now partly understand why my dreams were so intense, where I screamed at my parents for their lack of love and their insistency of not seeing the error where it is. (In real life, I never accused my parents. I just cannot.)The book talks about acknowledging your anger toward the seductive parent. And I agree it is very necessary. We need to see the reality the way it is, before we can come back to reality and come to terms with ourselves.Is it necessary to make your parents acknowledge your anger and their grand mistake? From my experience, it is a no. Because they most likely will never acknowledge their mistake, and it will become a contest of wills. My grandmother was seriously abusive, (hehe, now I agree family issues pass from generation to generation), and my father was deeply hurt. But until her death, my Grandma never ever admitted her mistake, no matter how miserable she made her children's lives. It is unfortunate in an effort to be a better parent, my father turned out to be very much like my Grandma, even though in different ways. From my lesson, it is largely useless to confront your parents, making them admit their mistakes, since they will never ever able to see themselves in that light. They pride themselves as the best, most righteous people in the neighborhood. While that blind pride probably will make you very angry, because you know how much dirt is wiped under the family carpet, they live for that image.But it is necessary to speak your voice, and set boundaries. (The book talks about: If your seductive parent is alive, begin to set boundaries and separate.) If you see something seriously wrong in your family, speak out.During my brief visit to the parents' home the last time, my father consistently verbally abused my mom before me, saying she was stupid, short-sighted, silly woman, never can do a thing right, blah, blah. I finally could not take it any more and I confronted him alone while my mother was away.He was so angry that I dared to speak like that to him. He screamed how badly he had been treated for years by my mom. I simply said, there is no way to treat even a stranger, the way you treat mom. No matter how bad she is, at least respect her as a human being in your words. Give her the respect she deserves as a person. And I stuck to this basic point. I did not argue what was right or wrong in their marriage, since that was beyond my ability to argue. My father nearly kicked me out of the home. (Hey, it is important to be economically independent, so when you are kicked out, you have a place to go).In a few days, when I made the second visit back home, he calmed down and even respected me a little bit. Later, my mother told me he changed a little bit to become more accommodating. I do not know whether my confrontation ever worked, but it is rare to see a man like my father change even a little bit.My experience is, even though I do not have guts to confront my parents directly about my childhood, start to set boundaries and address the family issues in simple, objective terms. Never take side and never be involved in a family political war, because there is no win for you. But address the serious and persistent wrongs happening in your family, in a simple, firm, objective view, to make the person who is aggressor realize it is wrong, and to make the person who is victim realize he or she is being wronged. Set an example of being assertive, and encourage each family member to stand up for him/herself and take responsibility in his/her life. Compassion is a good thing, but compassion can be misplaced and taken advantaged of.The last chapter, the healing and the change, is in my view, one of the sweetest things to read in this book. It makes me stay hopeful and think of how to have a plan to address the issues. So, it is no surprise I wish this chapter can be longer, and more specific in how to set boundary and how to address the anger invariably arising when dealing with the pains.Throughout the review, I repeatedly stress how close the cases in the book resembled my own life. And it surprised me a great deal to read the preface and find out the cases were not real life cases, but structured from the author's clinical practice.Nonetheless, I agree the cases are very close to reality. It happened some of my close friends have serious problems with their families too.A guy took to drinking to drown his frustration in dealing with his parents. His story was very similar to the cases in the book. Unfortunately, his anger was not recognized by any of his family members. Coming from a very traditional family background, every family member encouraged him to acquiesce to his parents no matter what. (It is valued as great family ethics to respect your parents, no matter what; and give them whatever they want, to feel like a good deserving child.) And it was exactly what I told him too when he came for my help. I said, \\"After all, it is your parents. Do you want them to feel unhappy as old man and woman?\\" In my words, I denied his right to be angry, just because he was the child and he had a duty to make his parents happy, especially since his parents were aging. It was several years ago. I wish I had read this book when he came for my help.He was not the only friend who has this issue. I am certain there are many people out there who experienced similar issues. It is just that this is not supposed to be talked about among friends, or in public. My book cover is still shielding the book title, and you see, I do not want to use my real name in the review.But, do yourself a favor. Buy and read this book, if you relate yourself to issues like this, or if you are like me, feeling angry and frustrated about yourself without knowing why. Your own childhood problems can spill over to your career, love life and your view on yourself, and potentially, your children. I wish I had read this book earlier. I would have viewed my family and myself more objectively, and also I would have started earlier to treat myself as an adult who takes responsibility for her life and decisions she makes in her life."},{"Title":"Silently Seduced: When Parents Make their Children Partners - Understanding Covert Incest","review":"I am a survivor of incest from the hands of my father. I was searching for a book to read on the topic when I ran across this book. At first I thought that it would not apply to me, but when reading this it gave me my first understanding to what happened to my by the hands of my father. When listening to profilers and how they catagorize different rape preditors I could not really place my father in any of the catagories. Once I read this book I realized that incest (especially from a parent) fits perfectly into the catagories of covert incest to overt incest. As a survivor I have come to the point that I would like to understand why I had suffered this type of violation in my childhood and life. I am really greatful for the insight of such doctors as Dr. Kenneth M. Adams. It was good to read that I was not the disfunctional one in my family but that my family as a whole was disfunctional.

He IS a REAL DOCTOR!!! Read up on family structure boundary violations, specifically those related to the \\"Surrogate Spouse\\" or the \\"Little Prince/Princess\\". These are emotional and covert sexual roles given by a single parent or parents(s) in a dysfunctional relationship with the their spouse. Children are made to feel special because take care of Mommy's or Daddy's needs. Their parent needs someone who will love them unconditionally, and how convenient, someone is right there!Parents don't consciously plan to do this to their kids, but Daddy's not home and Mommy is in the kitchen crying. Little Bobby or Suzie comes in and wipes the tears away. \\"I love you, Mommy.\\" Mommy hugs them and loves them and pours out her heart about the problems that Mommy and Daddy are having. Mommy smiles and says everything will be OK and the next thing you know they are at the mall for a shopping spree and an ice cream. When they get home, Daddy's still not there so Mommy lays down for a nap and you are a perfect Teddy Bear. To a child it feels like love. How nice to be able to take care of Mommy and make her feel better.Later in life, when you realize you were used, you feel hurt and angry, especially when you realize that all the beautiful memories are gone. You mourn your childhood but nobody acknowledges your abuse because there are no bruises. To the outside world you are whiny and nuts because everyone saw how much you were loved...and your siblings and the other parent resent you for getting all the love when they didn't."},{"Title":"Ready to Use Physical Education Activities for Grades 5-6: Complete Physical Education Activities Program (bk. 3)","review":"This book is full of age-appropriate activities for P.E. teachers to use.

I purchased a used copy of it last year. Although the translations are old, they are fairly accurate, if you're looking for a literal version of the Greek in English prose. There are also numerous foot notes explaining the more obscure jokes. (And unlike many modern editions of ancient texts, these notes are printed right on the bottom of the page you're reading, instead of in the back) That said, if you want a funny translation, this is not the best. Being literal, I believe, hurts Aristophanes more than it helps. I generally only use my copy of this book to reference along side other more imaginative translations; such as those by say Douglass Parker."},{"Title":"Python Standard Library (Nutshell Handbooks) with","review":"If you are learning Python, a beginner to intermediate Python programmer, you'll want to get a copy of this book. It won't do as your only Python book, but as a supplement to &lt;i&gt;Learning Python&lt;/i&gt; or one of the other introductory Python books, it is invaluable for the non-expert Python programmer. If you bought the first edition of the book, which was available only as an eBook, you'll want this edition as it covers Python 2.0 as well as Python 1.5.2. (The eBook edition covered only Python 1.5.2.)Each chapter begins with a brief summary of what will be covered. Chapter 4 is summarised as follows: &quot;This chapter describes a number of modules that can be used to convert between Python objects and other data representations. These modules are often used to read and write foreign file formats and to store or transfer Python variables.&quot; It's terse, to be sure, but it's not meant for someone who has never looked at Python before.Frederik assumes you know which module you want to use and gives you some sample code that shows you how to use it. You might ask on a newsgroup how to parse an HTML file. Someone will answer and tell you to look at either the htmllib or sgmllib module. Great. So, umm, how do you use them? A sample script showing you how to do something with either module or both could save you hours of frustration. Frederik also gives you tips on how best to use a module or when not to use it. For example, in describing the htmllib module, he says &quot;If you're only out to parse an HTML file and not render it to an output device, it's usually easier to use the sgmllib module instead.&quot;The book is sprinkled with tips. Early in Chapter 1 he points out that &quot;What you might now know already is that import delegates the actual work to a built-in function called __import__. The trick is that you can call this function directly. This can be handy if you have the module name in a string variable, which imports all modules whose names end with '-plugin'.&quot;The books covers: core modules (eg, re, time); more standard modules (eg, file input, md5); threads and processes (eg, thread, pipes); data representation (eg, pickle, base64); file formats (eg, xmllib, zipfile); mail and news message processing (eg, rfc822, mimetypes); network protocols (eg, socket, asyncore); internationalisation (eg, unicodedata); multimedia modules (eg, wave, winsound); data storage (eg, dbhash, gdbm); tools and utilities (eg, pdb, profile); platform-specific modules (eg, pwd, nt); implementation support modules (eg, macpath, ntpath); and other modules (eg, Bastion, calendar, posixfile, regsub).The sample code is printed in Courier and some of the samples are tracked too tightly, making it difficult to read. I assume in production they applied the same tracking values for the body text to the code text. (Tracking is the spacing between a series of characters where kerning is the space between two characters.) But that happens only occasionally.Also included with the book is a CD which contains copies of all the scripts plus an evaluation copy of PythonWorks Pro 1.2, a Python IDE for Windows, Linux, and Solaris. (Fredrik works for Secret Labs AB who develop PythonWorks.) I was able to browse and open the sample files on MacOS X. But of course I couldn't try the evaluation copies of PythonWorks. I would rather they had dropped the CD and made the sample scripts available as a download -- it would drop a few dollars off the cost of the book. If you're an expert Python programmer you won't need this book. But if you're a beginner to intermediate Python programmer you'll find the sample code and commentary invaluable when you try to implement an unfamiliar module, particularly some of the more complex ones. And the tips sprinkled throughout the text will help you achieve mastery of this most glorious of programming languages. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Python Standard Library (Nutshell Handbooks) with","review":"I bought this book in 2004 when I was just starting to learn Python. I never once used it. Its not a bad book, just less useful now than in 2001.The book covers Python 2.0. Anything before 2.2 for any Python book is probably not worth the trouble in 2006 and beyond.When looking for information about a Python module I look in Alex Martelli's Nutshell book(2.2) and the go to the online Library Reference. The nutshell is good for background and examples and the Library Reference brings things up to 2.4.If I am not quite sure what I am looking for then the Python Cookbook (2nd edition) is the most help.Mark Pilgram's Dive into Python is a great, in-depth look at some of the more useful standard library modules.I hope Alex Marelli updates his Nutsehell book for 2.4.There are other good books for learning Python but the Nutshell(O'Reilly), Cookbook(O' Reilly), Library Reference(python.org), and Dive into Python(online or an Apress book) do the best job of covering the standard library,"},{"Title":"Python Standard Library (Nutshell Handbooks) with","review":"The author knows python, but the book itself is not worth it.

There are some great books about how to program in Python (such as New Rider's Essential Python), but even these often fail to document the library in a sensible, searchable way.I had high hopes that this book would be a useful reference for the modules, but in fact, it's much more of a scattered illustration of how some of the modules work. Methods are not listed, modules frequently lack any real explanation, and the examples are often a bit cryptic. There are some useful areas -- the section on how the __builtins__ work, and how to exploit some nifty features about Python importing is pretty cool -- but as any kind of references, or even helpful guide to the standard libraries, this falls far short of my expectations. (Don't let this distract you from other O'Reilly books, though, which are often excellent.)"},{"Title":"Python Standard Library (Nutshell Handbooks) with","review":"The standard Python modules are presented according to topics, like: threads, file, mail, network, etc. Each module is introduced by a few text lines and then demonstrated by a code sample with it's output.

This book, together with the &quot;Essential Python Reference&quot; will be very helpful to those programmers, who prefer books over online documentation. The book is not yet five stars, because we will later on need a second edition with double the size, to provide further specifications and more explanations.

How can you move on when you think of one another constantly?The writing was straightforward and easy to read. I read it quickly, because frankly, I couldn't put it down.

When Caroline becomes pregnant, this seems to be the icing on the cake. Shortly after the baby is born, reality sets in, insecurities surface, and trust goes out the window, resulting in a divorce a scant few years later.Several years after the divorce, Charles and Caroline are once again living in the city. Realizing that he still loves Caroline and wants to be a family again, Charles sets out to win her back. When Caroline's old insecurities begin to resurface, he begins to feel that his efforts are an exercise in futility and that it may be best to leave things status quo.WHEN YOU THINK OF ME is your classic tale of love gone wrong and the sacrifices one must endure in order to make it right again. Although the premise of the book was good, the under developed characters, weak storyline, and the passage of time not clearly indicated, detracted greatly from the book.

Since his forced departure from the classroom, Kozol has been a student of public education, focusing on the inequities of quality of education between the haves and the have-nots. His books include: Death at an Early Age; The Night is Dark and I am far From Home; Rachel and her Children; Savage Inequalities; and Amazing Graces.Kozol describes his current work:&quot;This is a book about a group of children whom I've come to know during their early years of life, not in the infant years but in the ones just after, when they start to go to school and poke around into the world and figure out what possibilities for hope and happiness it holds. Most of these children live within a section of the South Bronx called Mott Haven which, for much of the past decade, was the nation's epicenter for the plague of pediatric and maternal AIDS and remains one of the centers of an epidemic of adult and pediatric asthma that has swept across the inner-city populations of our nation in these years.&quot;At the end of the book's introduction, Kozol says: &quot;I'm grateful to the priest and congregation of St. Ann's (Church - of Morrisania - Episcopalian) for giving me the privilege to share the lives of children here...But most of all I'm grateful to the children, who have been so kind and generous to me, as they have been to many people who do nothing to deserve their loyalty and love, which aren't for sale and never can be earned, and who, with bashful voices, tiny fingers, sometimes unintended humor, and wise hearts, illuminate the lives of everyone who know them.&quot;Kozol followed the children of P.(ublic) S.(chool) 30 and the eighty children who participate St. Ann's after school program for two years. Their stories and the stories of their parents, teachers and caretakers are anything but ordinary. These children will crawl right into your heart and take up residence. It's been a long time since a book has chronicled so many real-life miracles performed on a daily basis by ordinary people who happen to posses extraordinary compassion, kindness and caring.I challenge anyone who reads Ordinary Resurrections to remain unmoved by Pineapple's brashness, Elio's false bravado, Ariel's insight, Mother Martha (St. Ann's priest) and her dog, or Katrice's adroitness in overseeing the church's kitchen. Some of the stories are uplifting; some will break your heart.Although the book drags a bit in the middle when Kozol attempts to explain educational philosophies in laymen's terms, he never leaves the children long enough to make the intellectual content too boring.If there is justice for Kozol and the children of Mott Haven, this should garner a lot of attention and win awards. Words like Pulitzer, Nobel, and National Book Award will fit nicely behind the title. Ordinary Resurrections should be required reading for all teachers and the rest of the human race, too. It's that good.Kudos to Kozol and his kids. They deserve every good thing in life!Terry Mathews, Reviewer"},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"I think it's very telling that Jonathan Kovol is friends withFred Rogers (one of my heroes) and talks about that in this book, ashis writing reminds me of how Mister Rogers talks---his extremely strong feelings of love and caring and understanding of the children he is friends with (for that is what he is, friends, not an observer) comes through in every sentence. It's inspiring to read about the lives these children are living---how they manage to have a happy childhood and remain innocent and caring in such a tough environment, but you know the road ahead for them is not going to be an easy one. If you don't feel outraged after reading this book about the state of the public schools in big cities, you haven't read too carefully. And the fault is not where so many like to put it--with the teachers, with the students, with the parents, the fault is with a society where people are getting richer and richer but there is still not enough money to have reasonable class sizes in cities, to restore music and arts and doctors in the schools taken away 20 years ago, and to have a graduation rate not as shameful as the one where most of these kids will go to high school. This book really moved me and I am going to work harder to improve my childrens' urban schools."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"This powerful work is at once inspiring, frustrating and captivating. Kozol draws the reader into a world called Mott Haven that is filled with substance, love, service and hope. He poignantly describes the lives of children while blasting the manner in which we have chosen to deal with our most needy sectors of society. Kozol's gifted and powerful storytelling reminds us of several truths:1. Segregation is potentially a bigger problem today than ever. White flight, private schools, school choice, home-schooling, virtual schools and lack of equitable access to technology are widening the gap.2. Inequities in education must be addressed with the underlying belief that every child has the potential to achieve his/her dreams. Society must be responsible and held accountable for creating conditions ensuring that this occurs.3. Teachers and students must all be able to work and learn in optimum conditions that safeguard and ensure dignity.4. Although children appear to be resilient, we must protect their innocence, ensure they have the chance to dream and be inspired by their eternal optimism and hope. The real heroes of today are those who spend time with our children, listening to and nurturing their dreams.5. We spend too much on our prison system and must figure out a way to divert that funding to education and healthcare so we can be proactive rather than reactive.Kozol manages to convey the realities of inner city education by illuminating the complexities behind the daily challenges facing teachers and parents. His manner of connecting the problems to the institutions and practices that society has created to deal with those who do not \\"fit the system\\" provides a wake-up call to all of us who are working to make a difference in the lives of children. Kozol shows us that the system we have created is nurturing itself instead of helping people to break out of the vicious cycle characterized by lack of quality education, health care, meaningful work opportunities and dignity. We can no longer ignore the problems in the inner cities of America, not just because it makes economic sense but because it makes human sense to individually develop our most precious resources - our children. Community leaders, parents, educators, and corporate leaders should put this compelling book on the top of their \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"There are traps all to easy to fall into when writing a book recounting one's interactions with children. The children can be simplified into charicatures, they can be made more complex and no longer childlike, and they can be modified to fit the author's argument. Mr. Kozol draws upon 40 years of working with children to avoid these pitfalls in telling the inspiring and haunting stories of these wonderful children. Mr. Kozol writes with a beautiful simplicity that is both stirring and honest. This is a fabulous book."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"I, too, heard Mr. Kozol on NPR - and in the space of a few minutes was not only driven to tears, but driven to purchase the book. In a time when the world feels out of control and impossible for any one of us to alter its course, Jonathon Kozol gives me hope by reminding us that all children start out with pure love, truth and innocence - regardless of their economic or social circumstance. And that noticing and nurturing children is a precious and enriching process. The book is written in a compellingly intimate way, and I feel priveleged to have been introduced to the children of Mott Haven and to the grown ups who love and care for them."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"In Ordinary Resurrections, Jonathan Kozol deviates from his usual \\"gloves off\\" attack of the issues facing minority children. Instead of building the case against the inequitable system with facts and figures, as he has in previous work, he has chosen the subtle but effective approach of a storyteller. He paints a very descriptive portrait of the victims of continued segregation and racism that may inspire those in positions of influence to make more compassionate decisions regarding the lives of the children they serve.Things that scream out to me from Kozol's book(s):1) Incarceration vs. Education (do the math!)The incarceration industry is thriving on blind public support. If taxpayers knew they were paying on the average ten to twenty times more to incarcerate supposed perpetrators of victimless crimes than it would cost to educate them, I'd bet they might even overlook their racist fears. The corporate/federal mentality that chooses to decide early on what these children will bring to the economy seems to prefer them as a product in this system versus potential contributors to something greater.2) Resilience (despite our conditional \\"help\\")In their innocent naivet&eacute; the children neglected by the system remain courageous, hopeful, and resilient. This resilience may diminish as they weather the inequities of the system that oppresses them, but it is often the attribute that enables them to succeed regardless of our preaching and teaching. Just imagine what heights they might reach if they continued to be nurtured as they are by the caring individuals in their lives now.3) Compassion (essential)As a beneficiary of white male privilege his reflections from the other side of the gap are poignant and insightful lessons for those of us too far removed from the reality that exists in many of our cities. Even after this racial inequity is acknowledged it is difficult for most of us to express empathy in ways that ring genuine. Kozol does! He is trusted and welcomed by the culture and community he strives to serve. His stories reflect a model for learning and practicing compassion which, in my opinion, may be the single most important factor in saving ourselves from extinction. Kozol repeatedly demonstrates the importanceof compassion in his work. Listen to him!4) Racism, segregation, inequality (market view politics)Racism is institutionalized in the United States despite the hope segregation was ending that the civil rights movements of the sixties inspired. \\"Kids notice that no politicians talk about this. They hear the politicians saying, \\"We're gonna have tougher standards in your separate-but-not-equal schools. We're gonna raise the bar of academic discipline in your separate-but-not-equal schools.\\" But nobody says we're going to make them less separate and more equal. Nobody says that.\\" - Kozol interview in Education World5) Toxic environments (no one to litigate)AIDS, asthma, drugs, violence, toxic pollution, poverty, malnutrition, lack of medical attention, apartheid economics, and neglect are common elements in the environment Kozol's children try to survive in. Basic needs must be satisfied before we can expect children to be receptive to that which we would have them learn. Kozol is issuing a wake-up call to the complacent masses that are either unaware or in denial that this situation is serious and threatens all of us socially, emotionally, and economically.In my opinion, implications for educators that may be gleaned from Kozol's book include:* The extreme importance of compassion in all aspects of dealing with children.* Recognition that before we talk about diversity we need to spend a lot moretime in the conversation about racism.* Locking people up is not rehabilitation and in the long run is socially,emotionally, spiritually, and economically disastrous. Break the cycle of incarceration!"},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Jonathan Kozal has taken away the protective myth that America's school children are all treated equally, with dignity and given unvarying opportunities. In his latest book, ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS, Kozal's readers get a glimpse into a reality that replaces equal value with present day segregation to children of the poor. Although many in power would like to ignore the disgrace of how our underprivileged students are educationally treated in areas such as Mott Haven, New York, Kozal's first hand account of such inequality calls for a recognition and reformation of America's priorities. Told in the children's words, this book contributes awareness to the desperate need for compassion to and knowledge of the struggles of many American youth. The facts are both shocking and compelling, and will challenge the values one holds to necessitate action on our children's behalf. As Kozal states, the reality is that \\"...there are few areas in which the value we attribute to a child's life may be so clearly measured as in the decisions that we make about the money we believe it's worth investing in the education of one person's child as opposed to that of someone else's child.\\" Once read, ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS destroys the bliss of ignorance. One is faced with the decision to powerfully act or despairingly ignore."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"kozol is my hero. i am a teacher in washington, dc. i see the same things kozol sees, i feel the same way he feels and i am continually frustrated by those who don't. it is impossible to listen to the news and read the papers and get a clear picture of the inequalities in urban education. these kids are every bit as dynamic as kids in the suburbs, and i might even argue that they are more dynamic because they are forced to rise above their problems again and again. i challenge others to forget what the politicians say, forget what the media says, become a teacher or a volunteer in the inner city and meet these special kids. don't let this book just be one that sits on your shelf. use it to motivate you to help make a difference."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Having recently read Jonathan Kozol's &quot;Savage Inequalities&quot;, I am struck by Kozol's change of pace. Kozol is not a renegade, not a defender of children in this book, but a personal friend. I am struck with the lyricism and melody of the book. It is written from the heart, out of love and admiration for the forgotten children of the South Bronx.Kozol has no children of his own. A bachelor in his sixties, Kozol marvels at the innocence of the children from the South Bronx and is touched by their true friendship. The children want to get to know him better, want to know all about him and look forward to his visits. Kozol visits with them regularly, tutors them during long visits, and attends mass with them. He is deeply moved by the children's wanting to involve him in the Catholic rituals of mass, including taking communion. Kozol says the kids want him to &quot;try the bread and wine, its good.&quot; Kozol has a definite message. Despite poverty, violence, absence of parents, absence of security; all children are born into hopeful innocence which takes years to destroy.I was overcome with emotion during many passages in this book. It is a very personal book which bares the author's soul. I recommend this book for everyone. Kozol is a testament to the goodness in mankind. Goodness that often goes unrecognized. I give the book 5 stars, but I give Mr. Kozol an infinite number of stars, for his devotion, for his love, for his hope for the children of the South Bronx and their future."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"As the end of the book drew near, I knew that I did not want it to finish. Through Kozol's descriptive, real life language, I felt as if I knew the students and wanted to continue along life's journey with them. I became frustrated, because I want to know what happens to the individual children. Are they able to remain strong with the help of the people at St. Ann's? Or do they fall into a life filled with crimes and drugs? Although I am upset, it is good, almost like a passion that is a direct result of Jonathan Kozol. Within an instant, he invites his readers to come along with him into this world in the South Bronx, a world that many people have not entered and maybe never will. Therefore, I believe Ordinary Resurrections is extremely powerful, for it has the capability to extend its arms and touch many people; there truly is no limit to the people who Kozol may affect. This idea of having no boundaries is crucial in today's society, because people should take the time not only to acknowledge, but help those who are less fortunate. It's a frightening world, especially for our youth, which is why they need our guidance and assistance to make sense of it all and find their own path."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Some might describe Jonathan Kozol's &quot;Ordinary Resurrections&quot; as a softer, more positive book than his past attacks on the inequalities of education. While the story-telling style often presents the &quot;warm, fuzzy&quot; experiences Kozol shared with young children in the South Bronx of New York, the primary message is still an alarming exposure of stark inequity in the availability of educational institutions, personnel, and resources for children in the public schools of New York City. The setting for these experiences is a neighborhood known as Mott Haven, one of the most impoverished areas of the city. The majority of Kozol's time is spent visiting with children, parents, teachers, and workers who are connected with an &quot;after school&quot; program housed at St. Ann's, an Episcopalian church in Mott Haven. Children attending St. Ann's after school program have a major advantage over others in the South Bronx; the dedicated volunteer workers who feed them, help them with homework, offer special programs, and often care for them as closely as their own family. Mother Martha, St. Ann's priest is an active participant in all of these activities, as well as spiritual instruction and guidance.Kozol shares bits and pieces of the children's' lives, which include stark realities such as a large percentage of absentee fathers, many who are in prison, an extremely high rate of asthma due largely to poor environmental conditions, a high incidence of AIDS in relatives, gangs, shootings, hunger, lack of health care, and eviction. The term &quot;apartheid education&quot; is used in describing how skin color and class origin still determine curricular provision for these children, limiting their educational resources and their future. Stories shared indicate that expectations are set lower than other areas of the city and children's dreams for the future are effectively stifled. They are encouraged to plan careers as hairdressers, nurse's aides, or technicians, rather than professionals requiring a college degree. Kozol urges us not to impose &quot;global preconceptions on a multitude of diverse personalities and motivations in a given group of' children&quot;.The stark reality is that the money spent on children's' education per capita is much less in South Bronx than other areas of the city, and even miniscule compared to the amount spent to incarcerate men in the nearest prison. When Kozol is challenged with the question of whether money really is the only answer to the problems faced by schools serving poorest children in our cities now, he responds, &quot;I think it is fair to answer, No. It is not the only answer, but it is often a precondition for most other answers.&quot;Despite the disheartening facts of life and lack of resources, there is a bright side to Kozol's reflections. He describes with wonder at times of &quot;the deep, inextinguishable goodness at the core of creation&quot; evidenced over and over again in the children of Mott Haven. While many term these children resilient, Kozol argues that word does an justice the true qualities that help them prevail, such as ingenuity, courage, love, and especially spiritual faith. &quot;Ordinary resurrection&quot; is a term used by an Episcopal priest named Robert Morris who speaks about the commonplace and frequently unnoticed ways that people rise above their loneliness and fear. He states, &quot;We all lie down. We all rise up. We do this every day. The Resurrection does not wait for Easter.&quot; This is the life of the children at Mott Haven. How they rise up every day is the heartwarming encouraging part of Kozol's book. Why they have to do it is the heart-disturbing part that makes the reader want to agree that something needs to be done to invest in these children's' futures, that they deserve a chance at something better. As Kozol asks, &quot;why not give these kids the best we have because we are a wealthy nation and they're children and deserve to have some fun while they're still less than four feet high?&quot;"},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Having read many of Kozol's previous books, I have developed a great admiration for him and his lifelong dedication to social justice and poor children, and his eloquent arguments on their behalf. I've wondered at how he has managed to spend nearly 40 years of his life in this pursuit. This book shows us why--he truly enjoys and loves the children he advocates for. Like Savage Inequalities and Amazing Grace (both must reads) the children's words themselves move you with their honesty, their innocence, and their hope. I can still see Elio moving his arms to &quot;catch one of God's answers to his prayers&quot;. But this book also gives us some insight into Kozol himself--his struggles with the failing health of his parents especially. While his earlier books often were suffused with anger at the inequalities of the public education system and social framework, this book is filled with hope and joy. and a little bit of sadness too. And, surprisingly, it is just as effective."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Thank you Jonhathan...finally we have a public voice. I grew up in the South Bronx, on the Gran Concourse, and your book brought back many, many troubling and heart wrenching memories.My family became one of the sad statistics you referred to in your book...drugs, violence and jail time..are/were a very much big part of my families life. By the grace of God I have escaped the Bronx to raise my own child in Calf. but I have a longing in my heart to go back to the Bronx to make a difference.It is my plan after college to open a home for the children of the South Bronx and to work with places such as St.Anns to offer hope for these beautiful children.To those in our society that have written us off as hopeless and useless..may God have mercy on you..to the city of NY..may God forgive you for the violations you have inflicted upon the poor of the city...If this book does not urge you to change your views, contribute and help those that are less fortunate then there is surely something wrong with your heart.Johnathn I applaud you for your efforts, your love and concern..may God bless you and to the children of the Bronx.. I will be home soon and we will make a way."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"The Bronx has a long history. I'm always bumping into middle-aged and elderly professionals from the Bronx. Their mothers scrubbed floors; they went to City University. They now live in million-dollar condos in Manhattan. The ghetto is a conveyor belt for those who make up their minds to sacrifice their youth for future gain. Today's Bronx looks very much as Kozol describes. The very young are cute and inspiring, I suppose, but there must be a reason he leaves out the teens and their older brothers and sisters. The modern ghetto doesn't put a premium on discipline and learning. Kozol feeds into the victimology, seeing the community suffering from the failures of others to \\"do\\" right by them. Teachers know, however, that much would be improved if parents would simply make their children go to bed on time. Crime would be halved if kids were told to come in by 9. Early immigrants left the Bronx for the affluent suburbs, having devoted themselves to their children's education. Today it is rare indeed to meet a parent who has even one book in the house. Funding won't make up for this basic poverty of values."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Ordinary Resurrections is one of the most important books I've ever read and one of the most poignantly beautiful. It is an absolute must read for everyone who cares about children, the wide disparity in economic opportunity in the U.S., and who dares to hope for our future. Kozol movingly brings to life in his first-hand descriptive account the lives and conditions in their own words of children and their families who have been deliberately neglected, ignored, hidden away. This true story of their hope, strength, resilience, and beauty testifies to the dominance of the human spirit in the face of unspeakable abuse by government at every level and all systems that have failed them."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"kozol manages to do in this book, what he wasn't able to do in other books- simply love the children he was surrounded by. in this work, you can truly feel him love the children of mott haven, and in turn, feel them love him. you are given the awesome opportunity to appreciate unconditional love through his relationships with a host of characters from the community. he is so no longer the outsider he seemed to be in AMAZING GRACE. he has truly become a part of the community he once only studied."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"This is Kozol's most accessible and most hopeful book. It's a warm and moving portrait of children and adults in a very tough part of New York City, individuals we grow to care about as we journey with Kozol. Unlike his first book, 'Death at an Early Age, these children do not die. Kozol aknowledges and renounces his earlier pessimism and invites us to celebrate the human spirit."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"as a &quot;survior&quot; of the South Bronx I can only reassure the readers that Jonathans reflections of the segragation,poverety and dispair that thrives in the Bronx is sadly too true...but he is also correct in the innocence of the children of the Bronx and the one time in your life that no matte where you live or what you do...there is that special place.I never went to St. Ann's but I know plan too..after completing my degree I plan on opening a home for children in the south bronx to give them the chance, the opportunity that so many of us never had...To the &quot;elite&quot; of New York and the policy makers...may God forgive you for what you do to the children of the South Bronx..my deepest and most sincere respect go to Jonathan for such a well written book and his obvious care for these children."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"I just re-read ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS and wanted to update my review....the book is just wonderful....and full of such hope!Like other reviewers, I heard Mr. Kozol's interview on National Public Radio during my commute home and was completely enchanted by his stories of Pineapple and her friends in Mott Haven.I ordered the book from amamzon.com and devoured it in two sittings.I cannot remember when a book moved me as much as this one. I'm not sure what gifts God gave Jonathan Kozol, but one of them is true compassion and insight without judgment or pretense.I was continually amazed, as was Kozol, at these children's tenderness, kindness, their incredible gift of insight and their wide-eyed innocence.At the back of the book, there is an address for St. Ann's Church. I will be sending them a check...for St. Ann's Scholars...for Pineapple and Elio and Mother Martha and all the children and caretakers who perform miracles day in and day out.This should be required reading for not only present/future teachers, it should be required reading for the human race.I hope Kozol and his kids win the Pulitzer/Nobel/and any other available award!Read this book...you will be richer for it."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"Jonathan Kozol, more than 30 years after writing his first book, Death at an Early Age: the Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in Boston Public Schools, releases Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope. The subtitle, \\"Children in the Years of Hope\\", a pretty strong assertion considering what little real hope (a wish or desire accompanied by confident expectation of its fulfillment) he claims there is in the South Bronx area he is writing about now. He constructs a pretty bleak picture of the children the subtitle represents. Perhaps it should have been named, Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope against Hope. Most of the children of Mott Haven have faith (belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence), not hope. There is little reason or justification for even the prospect of hope with Kozol's repeated mention of unrelenting drawbacks, disappointing economic constructs and substantial statistics that overshadow the hope he attempts to convey."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"I got through 1/2 of this book and I couldn't get any further. I like the stories of the children. But it didn't keep me interested. I felt a lot of the information about the neighborhoods, school district issues, and the \\"political\\" issues were repetitive. The relationships between the author and the children and people of the neighborhood were fine and all, but it wasn't enough to keep me reading. It was rather dull and slow."},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"This book is brutally frank and wrenching in its portrayal of the children of this community. I have been inspired to purchase the book as a mother's day gift- what could be better than a book that inspires us to remember our dependencies?"},{"Title":"Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope","review":"This book is a radical departure for the author. It offers hope and an amazing view of what we can do for children and for society."},{"Title":"At the Origin of the Christian Claim","review":"If we live in a time and place of relative religious freedom, we may say that we &quot;believe in Christ&quot; or that we are &quot;Christian&quot; or that &quot;Jesus is our Saviour&quot; without worrying too much about the impact (on ourselves or others) of our statements. We also have the benefit of retrospect, the canon of Scripture, the established creeds... in short, we know the end of the Christian story.But those who first heard the claims of Christ did not have the privilege of standing back and looking at a completed picture. And so the question arises... What was it about this man Jesus that caused those who spent the most time with him, to come to the conclusion that he was the Son of God? Exactly how radical of a position was this for them to hold? In turn, how radical is it for us?This is what Giussani's book is all about. He shows that &quot;in Christianity it is no longer the person who seeks to know the mystery but the mystery that makes himself known by entering history.&quot; It is a profound study of the process of Christ's self-revelation. In this process, Christ constantly appealed to men's understanding. We learn that the faith that Christ asks of us is not opposed to reason, and the &quot;reason&quot; that Christ intends for us to enjoy, does not preclude faith.I followed along in my own Bible as I read, and I would encourage all other readers to do the same. You will gain new insights. I especially appreciated the fact that in Giussani's interpretive method, he thoroughly sticks to a crucial exegetical rule which states: Scripture cannot mean to us today, what it could not possibly have meant to its original hearers! He shows that a careful study of the Gospels reveals &quot;belief&quot; as not only the discovery of, but the UNDERSTANDING of, the truth that is proposed to us. As such, when I now say &quot;I believe in Christ&quot; I ought to be able to consider... &quot;Through what cognitive process have I arrived at such a grandiose conclusion?&quot; I know that such questioning will reap great benefits, for it already has. Rather than diminish my faith, it has strengthened it. It is a joy to discover that the claims of Christ can bear intellectual scrutiny. This discovery gives Giussani's book its overwhelming five-starness.In the 1937 publication of &quot;Nachfolge&quot; German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer first cautioned his hearers to be wary of &quot;cheap grace.&quot; &quot;At The Origin Of The Christian Claim&quot; seems to me to be a worthy and comparable polemic on &quot;cheap belief.&quot;"},{"Title":"At the Origin of the Christian Claim","review":"This is the most important book I've ever read, because it showed me the reasonableness of faith in Christ, and brought Christ to life as a man, (not some ethereal figure that people always talk about in abstract terms or as an easy way out of explaining the meaning of life). Giussani's amazing work exalts both the rationality and the humanity of the Christian position.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who questions the reasonableness of the Christian claim: that God walked among us as one of us, and is present even now. Giussani's understanding of the Gospels is amazing - though I've read the Bible my whole life I've never understood them as he explains - yet his explanation is the most complete and human that I've found. Furthermore, he satisfies intelligence's need for the Christian claim to be rational - since Christ entering human history is a *fact*, not a product of our imagination. (It's impossible to be fulfilled in life if we live according to fantasy!) So either this fact happened or it didn't. How can I verify this claim? What does are the implications for my life now? Giussani's love for Christ and each individual shines in the answers he gives to these questions in this incredible book."},{"Title":"At the Origin of the Christian Claim","review":"Guissani has once again shown himself to be among the greatest living theologians with this vibrant, and robust account of the lives of Jesus Christ and his disciples. An amazingly readable book (it is only 100+ pages) I have read it several times since."},{"Title":"At the Origin of the Christian Claim","review":"I was incredibly moved by the first book of this trilogy, and suggest to all of my friends to read Religious Sense, but this book is even better. This book identifies the core of the Christian Claim and what is a reasonable position in front of this claim... But more than that, this book helps me identify my personal attraction to Christ. Helps me realize my faith in Christ is much more than a moral code, philosophy, or doctrine..."},{"Title":"At the Origin of the Christian Claim","review":"The second volume of Giussani's trilogy. After having set the basis of his method for the search of truth in \\"The religious sense\\", he makes the jump from a general concept of religion, intended as the desire and need to pursue the unreachable absolute that gives meaning to existence, to the specificity of christianism.The exposition starts with a question: if we are talking of a search without an ultimate answer, imposing boundaries and directions to this search should be considered a violence to the individuality of man. Then why does he adhere to a religion that does this very thing?While the problem is well formulated, and precisely addresses the curiosity that brought me to take an interest in this book, I feel that he doesn't really give a satisfactory answer.This answer is mainly a presentation of the reaction that Jesus inspired in the persons who personally met him and followed him: they recognized him as the son of God, as the only one who could give the answers that completely satisfy the human needs. Actually only the \\"honest\\" ones recognized this, but this is the main problem of Giussani: he seems to think that everyone with a perception different than his is not honest, and must necessarily be deluding himself because of his fear of truth.For example he often makes bitter comments about intellectuals, philosophers and journalists on this basis, and he never seems to realize that someone with different ideas could say the same of him using the same criterion.However, if we accept his method of \\"moral certainty\\", the fact that people believed in Jesus after having met and followed him, demonstrates that the absolute that he calls God has actually interfered with the temporal history of man, and to follow the trace of this interference is clearly the best road to take for anyone who seriously wants to approach him.The reason why this answer is unsatisfactory for me is that every other religion supposes that God interfered in the history of man, although not always with a physical incarnation. I consider the method of judging the probability of a fact by the feeling of certainty it inspires in you or others fundamentally wrong. I would call it 'charismatic evidence', and it worked not only for many self declared messiahs but also with dangerous political men who could inspire this same feeling of evidence in people.I feel that this book could have a crucial relevance for a christian, for the insights on the origin and the meaning of their faith. If you haven't any particular curiosity in christianism it will of course have no value to you, but you could still enjoy the first book of the trilogy, \\"The religious sense\\", which can perfectly stand alone. As someone who sees religions as concealed mystical systems and not expositions of objective truth, and having enjoyed the humanity of the feelings inspired by the meditation on the life of Jesus, I rate it 3 stars."},{"Title":"At the Origin of the Christian Claim","review":"This is one book that everyone ought to read.

You see, I have been a huge fan of Hawkwind since I first heard the strident notes of the album In Search of Space in 1971. Now, after having released some 40 \\"official\\" albums and numerous compilations, you would think these Elder Statesmen of Rock would be accorded the fame and fortune befitting their role as innovators and creators of some of the most eclectic electronic music ever to come from Britain. Not so! Their fate appeared to be to appear as a footnote in musical history until recently.With the appearance of the live Out of the Shadows DVD and this entertaining book from Ian Abrahams, they are starting to get the recognition they so thoroughly deserve.The book centres on Dave Brock. Hawkwind is, has been, and always will be, his band. It starts off with some background on Dave and the other early members of the band. The text really starts getting detailed when you get to the late 1960's when everything was gelling for the formation of Hawkwind (or Group X as they were called for a handful of gigs). The book proceeds along in good depth all the way to this millenium and is well illustrated with a lot of captioned photographs (black and white unfortunately - to keep costs down I think).Ian Abrahams interviewed every member and ex-member he could contact and faithfully reproduces their recollections and reminiscences, ensuring every side of any tumultuous happenings in the band's 30 year history is reported in full. He also interviewed fans, management, record executives, in fact, anyone who ever had contact with the band in any context. Some of the more notable luminaries include (famed fantasy author) Michael Moorcock who did a lot of work with the band in their early days.This book is also fully-indexed, something a lot of books on rock music or bands seldom are. This makes looking up any particular member of the band or album very easy. There is also a complete album listing with notations on the major songs on each. Also present is a listing of websites that you can go to for more information.All in all, this 288 page hardcover book is well worth the published price of under $50. I would recommend it to everyone, not necessarily just to Hawkwind fans."},{"Title":"The Modern Fantastic: The Films of David Cronenberg","review":"Cronenberg is a director worthy of extended scholarly discussion, and as such Grant's collection of seven essays and an interview with Cronenberg is a welcomed entry. Unfortunately, the assortment is uneven, often too narrowly focused, and includes too few essays of import to necessitate reading in its entirety. While the variety of methodological approaches is rather interesting, the utility of the majority of the essays is limited, hardly explaining the film (or films) that the author attempts to unravel, and doing little to explain science fiction/horror films or Cronenberg's oeuvre.Parveen Adams's \\"Death Drive\\", a Lacanian analysis of Crash (1996), is the most interesting, and well written, of the essays in the collection that directly engage Cronenberg's work. Adams attempts to unravel the stylistic complexity of Crash and to align Cronenberg's directorial effects with the narrative estrangement at the heart of the film. While Adams's study is limited to only Crash, she does see beyond the film, linking Cronenberg's visual manipulations in the film to Luc Besson's earlier work, and, by implication, to work outside of Cronenberg's. Engaging and interesting for its use of Lacan and Cronenberg, Adams's essay is worth considering for any film scholar.Most interesting of the essays is Andrew Klevan's \\"The Mysterious Disappearance of Style: Some Critical Notes About the Writing on Dead Ringers\\", which chides both specific film scholars, and film scholarship as a field for its lack of consideration of a variety of filmic elements other than simply narrative. While inflammatory, Klevan's analysis of contemporary scholarship is a vital critical entry, acting as repudiation of the earlier essays in the collection (Klevan is placed last, directly before the interview with Cronenberg, in which Cronenberg also chides scholars for their lack of critical scope). Grant's editorial introduction spends too much space attempting to find faults in Klevan's argument, but his defense is too much a protest, and in both the introduction and Grant's contribution to the collection it is quite clear what Klevan is attacking: Scholars who are too concerned with their own scholastic exercises to actually attempt to engage the text at all, instead building a fortification of \\"theories\\" to hide ignorance behind. As such, Klevan's contribution should be required reading for every film scholar.The interview with Cronenberg is rather interesting, more for his concerns about the uses of scholarship than for his biographical revelations. The majority of the interview is spent considering critiques of his films, as well as arguing against attempts to understand his oeuvre through broad biographical or psychoanalytic means. Thus Cronenberg appears to be endorsing the methodological approaches embodied in the collection, which, with the exception of Grant, employ more contemporary theoretical modes. Otherwise, of interest in the interview is Cronenberg's extension of his earlier discussion of the aesthetics embodied in his work and the response of the audience to the grotesque visions in his films, which he attributes more to the reception of the audience than to his directorial intent.Finally, the collection is rather myopic in its cinematic interests: A predominant number of essays concern M. Butterfly (1993) and Dead Ringers (1988). Crash and The Fly (1986) are also widely considered (and a number of the essays insist on redundantly summarizing identical scenes); eXistenZ (1999) is largely ignored, as are The Dead Zone (1983), Videodrome (1982), and Scanners (1981), with many of Cronenberg's earlier, more horrific and science fictional works mentioned only in passing. The collection also includes an extensive filmography and selected bibliography of Cronenberg criticism and reviews, which should prove useful for future studies, which will hopefully learn from the mistakes of The Modern Fantastic."},{"Title":"Casca: The Eternal Mercenary (Casca (Americana))","review":"Very good book. I am trying to collect all of the books in the Casca series. I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"Title":"School Choices: True and False","review":"After wading through a few 300 to 600 page books recently, it was nice to come across a nice focused book. This is less than a hundred pages, but page for page it is a very informative book.The author's start the book with something that everyone knows, the current education system is broken, so very broken. He mentions that in 1983 an education commission commented that &quot;We have done something to ourselves that would be seen as an act of war if a foreign power were to blame.&quot;His basic premise is market forces are very effective in stimulating reform. Either you meet the needs of consumers, or you go out of business. Not all consumers have to be expert consumers, we all benefit from knowledgeable consumers. Our country is largely successful because we use market forces to constantly improve most parts of our society.The author goes on to say that while back in 1955 Milton Friedman proposed something like a voucher, but over the last 50 years we've never had a real competitive education market. The few places that vouchers have been tried have been very laden with restrictions and limitations.John Merrifield convincingly argues that we need a true education market, or the children of the United States will continue to get a sub-optimal education.There were a couple interesting points in this book:Currently teachers are mostly motivated to please administrators, parents have very little influence.In response to people who claim a true education market is too risky, the author responds that changing a badly broken education system doesn't risk much. (How could it get worse?)If you are interested in education and/or school choice, this is a good book to start with."},{"Title":"M.D.","review":"A wonderful, wonderful book--it ranks, without a doubt, among the top five books I have ever read. The author provides multi-faceted insights into the psyche of the protagonist, Ryan, a young and idealistic M.D., as he labors his way through morbidity, mortality and, not incongrously, romantic/sexual encounters. As with all good books, this one too can be read on many levels, with the reader obtaining whatever s/he wants from the book. As for myself: on completing the book, I was left with the realization that while it is impossible to completely live upto one's ideals, the continued possession of these ideals--even in the harsh light of &quot;reality&quot;--is necessary for the maintenance of one's humanity."},{"Title":"M.D.","review":"Published in 1981, before the appearance of AIDS, this saga of William Ryan's medical internship at the Manhattan Hospital and its sister institution, the Whipple Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases, this diary like account puts the reader through the emotional ringer. Shedding the usual pop media images of doctors, the characterizations of the interns, residents and attendings are lean and convincing. These doctors are fallible, tired but not burnt out, feeling victimized, feeling abused, often overwhelmed by circumstances, by implacable disease, but not spiritually defeated. The better known House of God, is a paean of defeat, in which the interns at a Boston Hospital react to the inevitable defeats and heartbreaks of medical practice by rejecting the practice of medicine altogether, one by one opting out, for psychiatry or some other line of work outside medicine. The long nights and frustrations endured by MD's front line interns are no less harrowing (and at time funny) than those of the House of God, but MD's doctors come to the opposite conclusion: that despite the harrowing nights, the price paid by the interns and by all the hosptial staff, the work they do, the patients, is ultimately worthwhile, worth the sacrifice. The romantic interest--love affairs of very different stripes between Ryan and a patient with Hodgkins Disease, a nurse and ultimately (and most destructively) with Diana Hayes, MD the head of cardiac diagnostics, serve to highlight how people faced with intense conflicts will often pursue the hypersexual, zanily romantic diversion, just to keep from dropping off the precipice into cataonic depression. The sexual cavortings reverberate with those of Catch-22, serving as what they must be in life, a crazy affirmation of life among the dying. House of God catalogues all the legends passed down from generation to generation of interns, the &quot;O&quot; sign, the gomers, the whole panoply of stories every medical student hears. But MD is more than a catalogue of stories, it's a story given shape and substance, and ultimately an affirmation of man's desire to do work which helps, to try to do something that counts."},{"Title":"M.D.","review":"Don't let the cover put you off -- Neil Ravin's M.D. is chock-full of good, hard medical details: patients, diseases, the life of interns and residents. I found it easy to skim past the protagonist's various romances with a patient, nurse, and fellow doctor. The characters are lifelike and varied, from the laid-back mellow California guy who wants to view his patients as whole people to the callous, driven New York-style residents who views his patients as diseased parts. The book is satisfying and surprisingly free of medical errors; I only wish the same could be said about Ravin's Informed Consent which contains so many medical errors one wonders where the editor was. Dated but delightful, M.D. will please those who like behind-the-scenes peeks at doctors' lives."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"This is the play where Henry IV squashes the Percy rebellion but himself becomes ill and dies. So, Price Hal becomes King Henry V and this leads to the next play of that name.The wonderful Falstaff is also on glorious display. This is also the play with the famous tavern scene (Act II, Scene IV) that can be read endlessly with new enjoyment.Everyone has his or her own take on Falstaff and his treatment at the hands of Henry V, but I dislike it even though I understand it. Prince Hal and his transformation into Henry V is not someone I admire a lot. Nor is Falstaff's manner of living, but his wit is so sharp and his intelligence so vast that it is easy to still delight in him.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the &quot;Complete Plays&quot; you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"First off, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Part I and absolutely adored Henry V. Having said that, I found Part II to be enjoyable, yet perhaps leaving something to be desired - like more action. Falstaff and Prince Hal both come off as somewhat disingenuous and calculating Machiavellian individuals. Disappointingly, Falstaff speaks poorly of Prince Hal while unwittingly in his midst. Conversely, The Prince of Wales prematurely takes the crown before his King Henry IV's death as well as disassociating himself with Falstaff after he is crowned King. These instances, along with others throughout the play, show the self-serving tendencies of both characters.However, we can proudly witness the maturation of the young King from wild & dissolute young Prince Hal into one of the most revered monarchs in English history, King Henry V. Part II remains an intriguing play due to its paradoxical nature, yet unfortunately rarely acted out today. Now that I have read Henry IV(I&II;) for the first time, I gladly move on to one of my personal favorites, Henry V. I recommend both parts(Folger editions) for all Shakespeare enthusiasts - they have given me greater insight into the young Henry V - when he was more concerned with downing a pint of ale rather than downing the French at Agincourt.2 Magnificent Quotes from Henry IV Part II -\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\\" - King Henry IV\\"He hath eaten me out of house and home.\\" - Mistress Quickly"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Believe it or not, Shakespeare's funniest play will be found in the Histories section of your Complete Works. That's not to say this is a comedy, but the group of characters gathering at the tavern represent the Bard's supreme comic achievement. Falstaff and the future King Henry V will have you laughing out loud. However, in the serious main plot, which picks up from the previous play, Richard II, the Percys are leading a rebellion against the usurping King Henry IV. The rebellion continues into the next play, but the Battle of Shrewbury marks an important point in Henry's reign, and serves as a fitting end to Henry IV Part 1. The play is a complete unity unto itself, but I recommend you read the complete series (Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, Henry V) in order to get the most out a very exciting and entertaining cycle. I usually recommend the Arden editions, but in this case the Oxford is superior. David Bevington is clearly one of the top editors in the field, and his notes help smooth over the rough spots in the text, especially the comic scenes which really need to be seen or heard to be fully appreciated. In that respect the Arkangel Audio version of the play is excellent."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"One of the more influential Shakespearean histories. Because of the inspiration it provides for any latter work involving a young male with 'daddy issues' (like \\"The Lion King\\") this play has had enduring power.The Prince of Wales, Hal, son of King Henry the IV is being thrust into power as his father dies. Conspiracies and the Crusades, a hysterical hostess and Falstaff, and the elevation of profanity to a high and refined art all add character to this play. I would argue that it is almost as much comedy as history.The most moving aspect of the play is Prince Hal understanding the reality that his father's death is thrusting upon him. From trying on the crown as his father lies unconscious but not dead to disavowing the rogues he had been a delinquent with, his growth is unmistakable.A very moving play and one of the more rewarding histories.E.M. Van Court"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"henry iv is misnamed since the play isn't really about king henry but about his son, prince hal, and his enemies, especially henry percy (aka 'hotspur') who is a rival to hal. hotspur is one of the leaders of the rebellion against the king and, at a tender age, is already an accomplished soldier. his story provides the drama of the play. hal, on the other hand, has fallen out of favor with the king, and is whiling away his days in the company of dissolute company, led by sir john falstaff, one of shakespeare's great characters. his adventures with sir john provide the comic relief. fortunately for the king, hal sheds his prodigal ways in time to save his father and his crown in the battle at shrewsbury, where, coincidentally, hal meets and slays his rival, hotspur.this is one of shakespeare's best plays. the story of the rebellion is intriguing, and the adventures of hal and falstaff are laugh-out-loud hilarious. the culmination of the two stories in the final battle scene is wonderful. this is a fitting sequel to richard ii.note that there are some historical inaccuracies and even outright inventions in this play. foremost is the character of falstaff who is pure invention (and genius). the story of hal's adventures stems from his reputation, enhanced by legend, as a playboy. falstaff was the perfect foil for a carousing prince. the biggest inaccuracy is hotspur's age. he was actually of the generation of henry iv, and not as young as he's depicted in the play. shakespeare made him younger to enhance, maybe even create, the rivalry with hal. there are other inaccuracies here, but better for the reader to consult 'shakespeare's kings', an excellent book by saccio that explains the history of the period and the discrepancies in the play."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"This is a review of the so-called *Kindle edition* of Henry IV.2.

Better yet, drop this piece of ill-formated trash from you store entirely."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"In Part One of Shakespeare's \\"Henry IV,\\" the titular king tries to defend his throne from a rebel army led by the hotheaded Hotspur, who has a long list of grievances about the king's treatment of his family, the Percys. Hotspur has allied himself with several principal figures including his uncle the Earl of Worcester, his brother-in-law Mortimer the Earl of March, Lord Douglas the Scot, and Owen Glendower, a Welsh chieftain with a vivid mystical imagination -- he is so egotistical that he insists an earthquake that occurred the day of his birth was a divine proclamation of his importance -- and a desire to usurp all of Wales from the king.While he is preparing for war against the rebels, Henry IV laments that his own son Henry (Hal), the Prince of Wales, is a shameful libertine living the high life in London and consorting with a gang of scurrilous miscreants. Indeed, Prince Hal's idea of fun is robbing people, and his best friend and accomplice in this activity is Sir John Falstaff, who turns out to be not Hal's peer but a middle-aged man. In a character transformation of an abruptness that can only be described as magical, Hal becomes a serious young man determined loyally to defend his father's kingship from Hotspur's assault after he receives an earnest lecture from his father about the dangers of acting irresponsibly as a public figure.Not enough can be said about Falstaff, who is undoubtedly one of the most richly realized characters in literature. He is fat, lazy, cowardly, yet boastful, but not in the same way Owen Glendower is -- Owen really believes what he says; Falstaff is just trying to make himself look better than he actually is, but fools nobody because he prevaricates and embellishes without bothering to remember his previous lies for the sake of consistency. You probably know somebody like this in real life -- especially if you're ten years old. Falstaff's piquancy, in fact, so outweighs the stature of the other characters that his absence is sorely felt in the scenes in which he does not appear.Most of all, Part One of \\"Henry IV\\" is a play of contrasts personified by Prince Hal and Hotspur, who incidentally is also named Henry. In their confrontation on the battlefield, it seems unlikely that Hal, who wasted many of his best days living as a rake, could conquer a seasoned warrior like Hotspur in a swordfight. But there wouldn't be much of a tale to tell if not to show Hal triumphing after his resolution to change his weak habits, and the play ends with the conviction that, despite his past mistakes, he would make a noble king himself."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"This is about Folger Shakespeare Library.

There's no question that Shakespeare fully appreciates military valor. The last play in the four part cycle, Henry V, testifies to this, not least with the famous \\"Once more into the breach\\" and \\"Band of brothers\\" speeches.But Shakespeare's greatest literary creation is perhaps the lovable rogue Falstaff. Falstaff is a Shakespearean fool, an anti-hero, a lovable villain. He voices opinions that no one would dare tell others. He can do this because he is a fool and isn't taken seriously by the king and princes above him. But audiences listen approvingly to his wisdom, and Falstaff thinks honor is for losers.\\"Thou owest God a death\\" says his friend Prince Hal as he leaves.\\"'Tis not due yet\\" says Falstaff left alone with the audience. \\"I would be loath to pay him before his day. What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honor pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery then? No. What is honor? A word. What is that word honor? Air - a trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died on Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No.\\"King Henry IV faces a revolution led by Henry Percy known as Hotspur. There's no question that Hotspur is noble, valorous, courageous and of course honorable. Henry IV wishes that this Henry in fact were is own son, rather then the rakish prince also called Henry. This Henry Hotspur is full of fire and verve. Yet as honorable as he is, he fights on the wrong side and dies. There lies honor, vindicating Falstaff.Certainly Hotspur fights for a cause: he believes Henry IV to have usurped the crown, but he values martial honor above all, even above the deep love he feels for his wife. If a war serves a greater purpose, then the men who fight deserve our esteem, gratitude and respect. Honor is honorable. But if a man fights only for honor as an end in itself, he is a fool and in a just ordered world, he will lose.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"This edition offers a strongly theatrical perspective on the origins of The First Part of King Henry IV and the history of its interpretation. In their introduction the editors clarify the play's surprising, decentralized dramatic structure, questioning the recent assumption that the drama focuses on the education of Prince Hal. They call attention to the effects of civil war on a broad range of relationships. Falstaff's unpredictable vitality is explored, together with important contemporary values of honor, friendship, festivity and reformation. (by Abe)Oxford World Classics are sturdy and beautifully laid out. I love my hard copy of this classic. Kbooks says: \\"During Shakespeare's lifetime, Henry IV was his most popular play. Today, Sir John Falstaff still towers above Shakespeare's other comic inventions. This edition considers the play in the context of various critical approaches, offers a history of the play in performance from Shakespeare's time to ours, and provides useful information on its historical background. Readers will also find detailed commentary on individual words and phrases, and selections from Shakespeare's sources."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"In the previous installment of Shakespeare's \\"Henriad\\", \\"Henry IV Part 1\\", we waited to see if Prince Hal would shake the corrupting influence of Falstaff and prove worthy of the throne. In \\"Part 2\\" we get to chew our spinach twice. Hal still stands at the same crossroads, Falstaff still tugging at his ankles.For me, that's the weakest element of \\"Henry IV Part 2\\", the warmed-over central plot. What makes \\"Part 2\\" terrific anyway is just about everything else. Structurally, \\"Part 2\\" is shambolic compared to \\"Part 1,\\" almost two stories entirely with Hal and Falstaff brought together only once, briefly, before the end. But individual scenes of the play shine with first-class Shakespearean luster, and \\"Part 2\\"'s thematic quality is singularly complicated in a way that confuses initially but rewards a second reading.Hal is still the prince, and still in poor odor with his father despite his heroics in \\"Part 1.\\" He must find his own way to glory while a civil war rages. Meanwhile, Falstaff schemes to take advantage of both the war and his friends for the sake of filling his gut.In the idiosyncratic way of this play, we begin with neither player onstage, but rather \\"Rumor, painted full of tongues\\", who sets up an opening scene featuring the rebel Earl of Northumberland, who as it turns out will play no major role in the proceedings and will leave in Act 2. It's like Shakespeare is playing with our expectations. Then he does the same to the characters. Time and again, we will see them tripped up by \\"smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.\\"Only Hal seems immune with his simple maxim: \\"Let the end try the man.\\"While Shakespeare worked hard to keep Hal at the center of things in \\"Part 1,\\" the character doesn't seem as well-integrated into the story here. The rebellion is dealt with this time without Hal taking an active part, or even being on stage. Falstaff carries the narrative bulk of the play almost entirely on his wide shoulders, his mischief providing amusing counterpoint to the cold-blooded realpolitik around him.Falstaff is helped this time by a supporting cast all his own, including slatternly Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly, the latter of whom introduces the phrase: \\"Do me, do me, do me\\" to the lexicon of Shakespearean quotation. The humor is more ribald here than it was in \\"Part 1\\", and more morbid, too. The first Falstaff joke is that he had his urine tested and the urine is found to be in better shape than its owner.These episodes, and another where King Henry IV soliloquizes about his lack of sleep (\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown\\"), are wonderful enough when read in isolation, enough to not mind that these story pieces never quite come together. The play's two masterstrokes both involve sharp reverses from what we have been led to expect, and though I feel the first is set up much better, they both leave an imprint on you while reading and line up with the message of \\"smooth comforts false\\" we were given at the start.A bridge between two better plays, \\"Henry IV Part 2\\" has its own special qualities and is very much worth reading - so long as you don't read it out of order."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" was one of Shakespeare's greatest successes in his lifetime, and has remained pre-eminently popular to this day. But each century has had its own version of what it is about.For Elizabethans, it was Falstaff and his merry pranks. For the 18th century, it was Hotspur and his proud nobility. More recently, the pendulum swung back to Falstaff, but this time as a tragic exponent of relativistic realism, a clown who understands his place as cosmic punchline.But as David Bevington points out in his introduction to my Bantam edition, the real central figure is the guy who encapsulates the best of both Falstaff and Hotspur, young Prince Hal. In \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\", he is the dissolute heir to the throne, living the fast life of drink and crime (petty and otherwise) with the dubious aid of his pal Falstaff, a fat coward who lives only to fill his purse and gut. Can Hal break out of his seeming tailspin and aid his father, the title character Henry IV, before the king loses his throne in a civil war?Bevington's point is Hal represents the true center of this play, the character for whom Hotspur and Falstaff represent opposite ends of an ideal monarch. Not for Hal the opportunistic legacy of his grasping father, \\"this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke\\" as Hotspur calls him, not without cause, early in the play. Hal must be his own self-made man, pulled from disparate parts, and \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" shows him at the start of his rather Machiavellian journey.\\"So when this loose behavior I throw off/And pay the debt I never promised/...By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,\\" he declares, less as a cunning rogue a la Shakespeare's Richard III and more as a cagey modern-day spin-doctor aware of how unsteadily his father's kingdom rests.Philosophy aside, \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is a worthwhile reading experience because it is packed with so much fun. You have low comedy, battles, court intrigue, and fast-flowing dialogue with sharp twists and turns. \\"I can call spirits from the vasty deep!\\" brags the mystical Welsh rebel Glendower, to which Hotspur replies: \\"Why, so can I, or so can any man. But will they come when you do call for them?\\"Others seem more inclined these days to gravitate to Falstaff. I enjoy Falstaff's comedy, and his undeniable relativism sets him up as an Elizabethan figure more grounded in the 21st century than the 16th (\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is set in the early 1400s, but was first produced around 1597), but as a personality he's about as callous as they come, at one point collecting a bunch of wretches to die in war so he can collect money from others who would have gone in their stead. Hal actually seems more attracted to Hotspur, the figure I find more compelling. Hotspur's an idealist, but entirely too mule-headed for serious statescraft. He's undone not so much by his enemies but his allies, including his shifting uncle and irresolute father.Hal here combines Hotspur's sense of a higher mission with Falstaff's pragmatic commonness to launch himself as a political man. \\"I'll so offend to make offense a skill/Redeeming time when men least think I will\\", he says early on. It's ironic how much more at ease Prince Hal would be in our era, running for office, than in his own, where the crown, if not attendant legitimacy, could be inherited. This is one of many things that makes \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" such a timeless pleasure."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing. Barbara Hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of Shakespeare.

Craig Barr."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Compared to Part I, Part II maintains a better balance between the court and Eastcheap. Royalty is allowed moments of glory: Henry IV in his berating of Hal and Hal in his response and in his speech banishing Falstaff. Hal is given to some complex emotions when he picks up the crown lying next to his dying father. Northumberland surprises with a sudden spark, punning \\"Hotspur, Coldspur?\\" at the news that his son may be dead.Falstaff continues to be a magician creating reality from words. (This may be the main reason he is so fun to be around). Enigmatically, this corrupt liar, coward and a thief through and through manages to remain appealing. By contrast, our opinion of John of Lancaster is immediately sunk with the singular unseemly scene in which he cons the rebels.Of course, Falstaff is not as much a black magician as Richard III, who in a course of one speech, convinced Lady Ann, whose husband he killed, to be romantically interested in him. Falstaff's magic is not as sinister, but in it he is similarly effective, as when in a course of a short conversation, he convinces the Hostess, who is asking him to repay what he owes her, to lend him more.His prose does not make him as elegantly spoken as some better versed Shakespearean characters, but it is nicely of a piece with his remarkable internal freedom.Falstaff is fascinating: deeply flawed, he is appealing well beyond his deserves. Maybe by admiring Falstaff, we learn to be a bit more forgiving of human imperfections in us and others..."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"The copy is very nice.

In 1 \\"Henry IV,\\" King Henry IV stopped the rebellion by Hotspur, Worcestor, and Vernon. But his enemy Northumberland remained a threat. This brings us to the 2 \\"Henry IV.\\"Despite the title, the real star of this play is Falstaff. One minor complaint I have is that while Falstaff could probably handle the play, some of his scenes do get too drawn out. Moving on, Northumberland reappears, and he is of course sad over the death of his son Hotspur. (Slain by Prince Henry in 1 \\"Henry IV.\\") We also meet the Arch Bishop of York who becomes an enemy of Henry IV. The Arch Bishop delivers a striking passage that emphasizes that the past and the future always seem better than the present.In Act 2, we quickly learn that Falstaff has built up some debts and he is neglecting his duties to the king. (Big surprise!) Prince Henry is a back stage player for the early part of the play, but rather than being close to Falstaff (as he was in Part 1), he bitterly rebukes Falstaff for his lifestyle. Also, Prince Henry does express concern over his father's failing health. But he is afraid he will be thought of as a hypocrite if he shows it.Interestingly, a woman named Doll begins to find Falstaff attractive. King Henry IV does not enter until 3.1, and we can see that the rebellions have taken their toll on him. He can only talk of the tribulations of royalty. It is even possible that he feels he deserves these sorrow and afflictions for stealing the crown from Richard II. (Richard II's consolation prize.)Later, Falstaff gathers his men together in a well drawn comical scene. Westmoreland and Henry IV's son Lancaster defeat the rebellion of the Arch Bishop of York, Mowbray, and Hastings in a less than honorable way. But this is not an invention of Shakespeare's. It did happen.In 4.3, Coleville surrenders to our favorite rogue Falstaff. It is comical when Falstaff comments that Lancaster is so uptight because he doesn't drink. But the sad part of the play returns soon enough.Henry IV's health fails, and he can not enjoy his victory. (This does constitute a small consolation prize for Richard II.) Some people dislike Henry V for banishing Falstaff, but Henry V had little choice. The actions of Falstaff (as comical and lovable as he is) are downright criminal. Though, Shakespeare promises us that he will return in another play.

This play is clearly the dramatization of a struggle for a kingdom, but it is equally the story of Hal's wild and reckless youthful adventures with Falstaff and other disreputable companions.Shakespeare did not write his plays about English kings in chronological order, but these plays do have a historical unity. It is helpful (but not essential) to read the tetralogy Richard II, Henry IV Part 1 and 2, and Henry V in chronological order. Whatever route you take, I highly recommend buying a companion copy of Peter Saccio's &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;, an engaging look at how Shakespeare revised history to achieve dramatic effect.A wide selection of Henry IV editions are available, including older editions in used bookstores. I am familiar with a few and have personal favorites:The New Folger Library Shakespeare is my first choice among the inexpensive editions of Henry IV. &quot;New&quot; replaces the prior version in use for 35 years. It uses &quot;facing page&quot; format with scene summaries, explanations for rare and archaic words and expressions, and Elizabethan drawings located on the left page; the Henry IV text is on the right. I particularly liked the section on &quot;Reading Shakespeare's Language in Henry IV&quot; and Alexander Legget's literary analysis (save this until you have read the play). The fascinating article &quot;Historical Background: Sir John Falstaff and Sir John Oldcastle&quot; adds a religious dimension to the play that I had not previously noted.The Bedford Shakespeare Series provides an excellent study text (edited by Barbara Hodgdon) titled &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;. It is a little more expensive, is about 400 pages, and provides a broad range of source and context documentation. It would be excellent for an upper level course in Shakespeare. The context documentation is fascinating and informative; it ranges from the Holinshed Chronicles to Elizabethan writing on Civic Order to detailed cultural studies of London's diverse populous. Other chapters address the OldCastle controversy and the &quot;Education of a Prince&quot;.I also like the Norton Critical edition (edited by James Sanderson), &quot;Henry the Fourth, Part 1&quot;, particularly for its extensive collection of literary criticism. The essays are divided into two parts: 1) the theme, characters, structure, and style of the play and 2) a wide variety of interpretation directed toward that roguish character, Sir John Falstaff."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am comparing it to other Shakespeare. Otherwise, the consistent \\"5 stars\\" wouldn't tell you much. So when I rate this book five stars, I'm saying it's one of the best of the best.As a matter of fact, it isn't unusual for Shakespeare's \\"histories\\" to be more interesting to the modern reader than either his comedies or his tragedies; they fit the modern style that doesn't insist that comedies must have everything work out well in the end, or that tragedies must be deadly serious with everyone dying at the end, as was the convention in Shakespeare's time. Thus, this book has a serious plot, real drama, and blood and destruction, yet still has many extremely funny scenes. And as Shakespearean plays go, it's a fairly easy read, although in places the footnotes are still neccessary. The only caveat I will make is that one needs to remember not to consider Shakespeare's histories particularly historical; they have about as much historical accuracy as the Disney version of Pocahontas. Treat them as excellent stories based (very) loosely on history, and you'll do fine.It's a real shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare was writing that his plays are no longer accessable to the masses, because that's who Shakespeare was writing for. Granted, there is enough seriousness to satisfy the intelligensia, but there is generally enough action and bawdy humor to satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they could understand it, and this book is no exception. Unfortunately, once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. I don't think I'll hold my breath waiting."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; shows King Henry IV dealing with complex problems: England is in the midst of civil unrest, as the Percy family, angered by their treatment after unwittingly helping Henry IV ascend to the throne, threatens to depose the monarch. At home, Henry IV is despairing over the development of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Prince Henry consorts with thieves, rogues, and scoundrels - his scandalous personal relationships seem to threaten the King's peace of mind more than the state of his kingdom.Aside from these larger concerns that frame the play, &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; deals more with Prince Henry than it does with the monarch of the title. Throughout the play, Prince Henry is seen more amongst the rabble commoners than attending to matters of state. He is guided in his licentiousness by the enormously funny (pun intended) Sir John Falstaff, whose schemes and drunkenness are more innocent and endearing in Part I than they become in Part II.Falstaff's reckless and conceited behaviour casts a shadow over the entire play, symbolic as it is of Prince Henry's moral dilemma and of the precarious state of the nation. Falstaff instantly calls to mind Kenneth Grahame's magnificent Mr. Toad from &quot;The Wind in the Willows,&quot; and is Toad's direct literary forefather. Falstaff is the most interesting and dynamic figure in &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; and certainly the most memorable character in the play.Prince Henry discovers that his responsibilities outweigh his fondness for Spanish wine, and is called to lead the King's army against that of the arrogant 'Hotspur' Percy, himself a rising political force. Their confrontation, brilliantly scripted and enacted, is central to Shakespeare's entire Lancaster-York saga, and should be read closely and with special attention.Of the two parts of &quot;Henry IV,&quot; Part I is by far the best and most flawlessly executed. The King's problems provide an adequate backdrop for the development of Prince Henry; 'Hotspur' is an excellent antagonist (with the whole Percy family offering a great contrast with that of the King); and Falstaff performs his role without dominating the play, as he tends to in Part II. Shakespeare does not need my praise or endorsement, but his &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; blows me away. It is absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"To get as much as you can out of this play, you MUST read &quot;Richard II&quot; first. Shakespeare deserves much credit for making the villain in &quot;Richard II&quot; (King Henry IV) the hero in this play. It is in this play that King Henry IV realizes political gratitude is short lived and Richard's prediction of Henry IV's trials comes true. Not only does King Henry IV realize that his seizing the crown came with consequences. but he also has to deal with his riotous son (the eventual Henry V). 3.2, where King Henry IV confronts his undisciplined son is quite memorable. Besides all this, Shakespeare introduces us to his comical Falstaff. So we have an interesting turn of events, dramatic confrontations, scenes of war, and comical touches. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Of all Shakespeare's histories, Henry IV, part I is the best. It is the first of three plays that examines the ascension of the great King Henry V. Here, we see a young Prince Hal as a troublemaker and a &quot;royal pain&quot; (pun intended), who hangs out in taverns with drunkards and derelicts. But we also see a young man who realizes his destiny and knows that the time will come when he will have to be a strong king for England's sake. The play is more than just one person's rise. It examines English society in atime of great instability and civil strife. It examines the role of family (fathers and sons, brothers, and uncles and nephews). This play is a reflection of Shakespeare at his finest and everyone should read at least this play, whether or not they love Shakespeare or not. It is worth the read. (and it is a rather simple read, too.)"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them. He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character. These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories. There are more comedic parts in them for one thing. The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V). We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development. He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible. King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler. He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II. In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death. The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry. The play leads us to \\"King Henry V\\". Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader. Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V. It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Having just completed Henry IV Part I, I must say that I came away delighted and impressed with Shakespeare's genius once again. Shakespeare's ability to intertwine the arduous dichotomy of the impcomparable comedy of Falstaff and the meaningful history of Henry IV, Prince Hal, & Hotspur is impressive to say the least. It comes as no surprise that this was one of Shakespeare's most popularly staged plays during his day and enjoyed an unusually long stage run.Falstaff is undoubtedly the most infamously famous literary comic character in the history of English literature. The scenes of him being robbed by Prince Hal, feigning his death, stabbing the already deceased Hotspur in the leg while claiming victory, and his employment of beggars as his foot soldiers galvanize the comic aspect of the play and make for a hilarious & farcical sublot. Interestingly, in the bar in Eastcheap, Prince Hal alludes to his future persecution of Falstaff when he is crowned king.I strongly recommend Henry IV Part I to all Shakespeare aficionados seeing as I deem it in the top five of all Shakespeare's works along with Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, & Henry V. Now on to Part II. Adieu.\\"The better part of valor is discretion.\\" - Falstaff"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot; concerns the triumphant decline of King Henry IV, and the ascension of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, to the throne as King Henry V. As in &quot;Henry IV Part I,&quot; Part II's main action concerns the attempts of the King to suppress civil strife, which is manifested once again in threatened rebellion. In &quot;Henry IV Part II,&quot; the rebels are led by Scroop, the Archbishop of York, the most powerful religious figure in England. The Archbishop's involvement &quot;turns insurrection to religion,&quot; thereby hoping to gain popular support and enlistment in the army against Henry IV.Henry, Prince of Wales, as the next in line to the throne, is expected to take a hard line against these threats, and lead the charge against the rebel forces. However, as in Part I, Prince Henry is nervous, as a young man will be, about accepting responsibility for himself, much less for an entire nation. A frivolous youth, he associates with the common folk in bars and taverns, led in his debaucheries by the notoriously comic Sir John Falstaff. The dichotomy between Prince Henry's father figures, the frail, but courageous King Henry IV and the robust, but cowardly Falstaff sets up the scope of the choice Prince Henry must make. His choice, he comes to realize, will affect the course of his country.The forces mount as the play moves forward - the King's army is ordered, well-equipped, and led by formidable generals - the Archbishop's army is made up largely of untrained citizens. The meeting of the armies' leaders in the Gaultree Forest of Yorkshire is the emotional and tactical climax of the play, and handled with dramatic precision by Shakespeare.The growth of Prince Henry, the shaping of his mind, his relationships with his noble father and brothers, as well as those with his low, vulgar drinking buddies, forms the focus of &quot;Henry IV Part II.&quot; Through five deceptively simple acts, Shakespeare illustrates the birth of a man and a king, and points the way to domestic peace. This is a play I enjoyed very much indeed, and would recommend reading alongside &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; for maximum effect."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"This is the play where the Percy rebellion begins and centers around the Achilles-like Hotspur. Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character. King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur. Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten. Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff. His wit and gut are featured in full. When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the \\"Complete Plays\\" you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"My only complaint about &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; is that Shakespeare draws the scenes with Falstaff out too much (in my opinion). Falstaff is funnier than ever. King Henry IV's younger son Lancaster is a very striking figure. While his father is ill, he commands the forces against his father's enemies. 3.1 where King Henry IV contemplates the consequences of the crown he usurped from Richard II is quite moving. The scene where Lancaster crushes the last of his father's opposition is quite chilling. I can not overestimate Shakespeare's genious in how he handles Henry IV in this play. In &quot;Richard II&quot; his ambition and cruelty for the most part never ceased. In &quot;1 Henry IV,&quot; he showed himself to be a competent (and even likeable) king. In this play, he clearly regrets and suffers for his actions against Richard II. (Even if we remember his cruelty in &quot;Richard II,&quot; it is hard not to feel sorry for him at this point.) The scene where King Henry IV has his final talk with the eventual Henry V is one of the most moving passages in literature. King Henry V's complete reform is not only well drawn, but it helps prepare us for the next play, &quot;Henry V.&quot; But if you want to see more of Falstaff, remember he has the lead role in the later play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor.&quot;"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's play King Henry includes comedy, history, and passion. You may find yourself to side with the rebels and cheer on Lord Percy. The only downside to reading Henry IV part one, is that you might have to do your homework to understand what is going on in this era. After reading this play, go see it in the theater if you can!"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","review":"i liked it that hal killed hotspur because in the movie hotspur was ugly and disgusting. everytime i looked at him i felt like i wanted to puke."},{"Title":"Dante Philomythes and Philosopher: Man in the Cosmos","review":"If you are working on Dante's cosmology- his astrology, anthropology, physics, angelology, metaphysics of substance or doctrine of creation- this is a phenomenal resource. What you might find in smatterings of other Dante sources (for example the two beautiful essays dealing with creation in \\"Dante's Commedia; Theology as Poetry\\") are treated with great breadth here. Boyde develops his study with a comprehensive detail and brilliance that over-all surpasses the similar scope of subject found in \\"The Divine Comedy and the Encyclopedia of Arts and Sciences.\\" Moreoever, Boyde writes with such clarity that even though he passes by the metaphysical detail that Christian Moevs treats so aptly in his \\"The Metaphysics of Dante,\\" Boyde's clear summaries provide the heart of Dante's larger metaphysical moves."},{"Title":"A Select Bibliography of Music in Africa","review":"A reference book that must have been a labour of love for its author to compile. This book surveys the literature of the roughly preceding century, to 1965, for books and articles on African music. The results are arranged in several convenient ways. Musical instruments have a geographic arrangement, and then by instrument types. Likewise, African music in general has a geographic arrangement. Similarly for dance.The citations also reflect the continent's colonial history. Many geographic groupings are under now disused names of colonies. Even more so, if you look at the names of the authors of the citations, very few are African. The vast majority were from the colonial powers. But these authors were probably amongst the tolerant and progressive of their times. After all, if they were otherwise, why would they write books on AFrican music?The book could do with a massive update to reflect the almost 40 years since its first publication. Nigeria and Kenya now have thriving music scenes, which often reflect influences from US rock and rap music. Basically, the book as currently extent, reflects a survey of traditional music."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"I like the book \\"Job and the Mystery of Suffering\\" because it has helped me to understand a little more the mystery of suffering in my life and the lives of others that I minister to. A good tool for reflecting more fully on the Book of Job as it might relate to one's own life. Richard Rohr is an excellent author. I have read other books written by him. He is very honest and upfront about things."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"I have always been a fan of Richard Rohr's writing, and this book is no exception. Fr. Rohr's reflections on Job and his relationship with God provide a challenge to the individualistic religion of our day. He speaks of God as friend, companion, and one who is large enough for us to be totally honest in our relationship with our Creator. This is especially the case when things go wrong that we just cannot understand and rightfully turn to God as companion with our complaints and sorrows.I recommend this book for those who have been through suffering. It might not be a good choice for those who are in the midst of a painful trial, but would be for those who are in the stages of recovering from such a trial. This books tries to help us make sense of what has happened when we can be a bit more objective. Fr. Rohr challenges the \\"comfortable\\" religion of platitudes, morals and regulations in the time of suffering. He focuses on who God is, not through conventional wisdom, but through what we have endured."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"Another Rohr book, this is not his strongist book, i struggled through it.

I had to read it for a class, so I approached it grudgingly. Yet now every other page (literally, I'm not kidding) is dog-eared with highlighted and underlined sentences. This book is amazing and I think every Christian should read it. Non-Christians would probably enjoy it to as it deals with probably the largest block to faith: the problem of suffering."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"Richard Rohr's writing is clear and concise. This is an &quot;easy read&quot;, meant in only the best way. It is not so deeply theological that one needs training to decode the message. For a topic as difficult as this, he helps the reader review suffering. The title is truly appropriate since bad things do happen to good people - as Job indeed was good yet suffered intensly. Rohr does an excellent job disecting the book of Job and revealing his (and our) relationship with God within the pain, not apart from it."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"Richard Rohr has a clear view about suffering. Through Job, Richard, explains away our misconceptions about suffering and leads one into a contemplation of Gods view of the human condition."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"Ever since I first read C.S. Lewis's \`The Problem of Pain', half a century ago, the search for answers has been part of my life. Richard Rohr has taken me in a new direction. Job and the Mystery of Suffering does not provide quick-fix answers, but offers instead a journey into the Pascal mystery. I found it an intriguing invitation and not an easy one to comprehend. A second, more thoughtful reading is yielding a much more meaningful understanding for me. The place of Job in human thinking is portrayed with an honesty that will appeal to many readers. One can identify readily with the great range of his expressions - rage, despair, pleading and impatience - but his unyielding trust through it all is well underlined as the book unfolds. I regard Job and the Mystery of Suffering as one of my better acquisitions."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"Have you ever had a setback that rocked you right down to the soles of your feet? And then your well meaning friends get busy telling you \\"everything will be all right,\\" \\"Just let it go, and go on.\\" Finally, a book that gives you permission to mourn and go through the process that will allow you to heal. This book helped me to tell my friends to back off and give me a chance to grieve.Typical Rohr wisdoms on the gospel and that is just an added gift included in this readable book."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"The way of perfection on the spiritual path is hard and narrow, with few willing to persevere. Painful circumstances, those that are self-induced or materialize for reasons that are beyond our control, jeopardize our security and primary attachments to persons, places, and things, all of which ultimately disappoint us (if only because they're losable). The pain of suffering and loss gets the attention of the mindful soul in a way that goads it to contemplate that which endures in the midst of all that fades and passes. Reaching for the fixed point is reaching for God, for Spirit, for one's God-self. In this book, Richard Rohr names and defines the mystery of the sacred process that leads us to God and our own center simultaneously. The book helps inform the reader with a Judeo-Christian perspective on suffering, which declares that suffering is not a virtue in its own right, but can be utilized by God in drawing us closer, via spiritual surrender, spiritual abiding and spiritual consciousness -- toward our true identity in God. Few books or authors address this reality more clearly or authentically. Highly recommended for spiritual sojourners and those lost and reeling in the midst of personal suffering and pain."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"I taught a class on the book of Job for my church years ago. I read everything I could get my hands on on the book including this one. I was almost immediately captivated by Father Richard Rohr's energy and fascinating insight into the real meaning of the book of Job for people today. This was a very big help for my class and I made notes from this book for the other people that would teach the class after me. This was the first book I ever read of Father Richard Rohr and I have read everything he has written since this one.

Quite the contrary.This book lifted me up from the spiritual mire I was in."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"I am a fan of Rohr's, but reading this book did very little for me. I think his message - which is astonishing and wonderful - is better available in other formats. The basic question I came to the book with was this: I understand that suffering is one of God's tools in shaping us; but why does the experience of it have to be so overwhelming and terrible? The book did not come close to answering that. I think its main value is that you recognize that everyone in life deals with the sufferings of Job - and that everyone is mystified by it. So I came away from the book with little. I'm glad that everyone else found the book so wonderful, though."},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","review":"This book contains some very deep and powerful insights regarding the human condition and the Divine enounter. At the very least, which is not least at all, this author has transformed my understanding of the Book of Job. What once were words on a page in my Bible is now a shared experience of profound suffering, deep faith and compassion and transformative grace. I took many notes and I'm sure to be revisiting them again and again. Thank you, Father Rohr."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Forbidden Attic (Mandie, Book 4)","review":"This was a pretty Good book. It kept me hooked the entire book. This is the first of the Mandie books that I have read and I am now exited to read more of these books.

The poems turn on a dime - one minute sharp and snappy, the next languid and exotic.We are led by Reddy's words into worlds enough, and time, that, from Esperanto to weird scenes onboard a boat sailing to a pseudo-darkness, query what it means to travel, or inhabit. The foreign trades places with the familiar, and a witty exploration uncovers lost cities of eloquence.Reddy is, to my mind, one of the most exhilirating younger American poets now writing - and his spare yet delightful use of line is only one of his many gifts. Another is his unexpected way with theme; yet another, his propulsion of dead language and texts back to life. This much is fact: this book should not be forgotten on the voyage."},{"Title":"Facts for Visitors: Poems (New California Poetry)","review":"I met Chicu Reddy, briefly, at a poetry reading in Boston whereat he autographed my copy of this book. His poetry is great stuff. Reddy injects new life into all the poetic forms he uses, which range from the prose poem to the villanelle. He is truly a versatile guy. No matter what form is he using at the time, Reddy makes poetry seem so easy and fluidly flowing and *fun* that reading this book will make you want to sit down and write prose poems and villanelles of your own. This is limpid, beautiful, visionary verse, full of dreamlike free associations and joyous wordplay, written in an authoritative yet conversational and all-too-human voice. Reddy's vision of life in the Information Age is a fundamentally optimistic one, and his poetry will leave you feeling that poetry is far from dead, and life is full of possibilities."},{"Title":"Facts for Visitors: Poems (New California Poetry)","review":"in is first volume of poetry, facts fa visitors, srikanf reddy accomplishes a goal dat is usually only achieved by much olda writers angin at da peak of their powers: he evokes a world dat seems maximum and coherent in its scope-a world dat is at once da world we recognize and one dat, coz fully and for real inhabited by is imagination, is also completely da autha's own. we recognize da details, but cukabillyva them within startlin landscapes and voicings dat shake us from da banalities encrusted around everyday perceptions. da book's cosmopotilan vistas vacillate betweun global perspectives. reddy's gravitational ouse is southern india, but da poet's collectin check circles out to europe and furtha west, involvin a ost of references from \\"a bone priest / pickin is way through crop ruks / toward da wreckage of an iron temple,\\" to \\"soviet-bloc comics,\\" to a speaka who in complete sincerity regrets neva avin \\"rested on a sunday / wiv a bea on da deck ... / listenin to styx.\\" balancin da quotidian wiv da mystical without recourse to irony is no easy feat, and dat is only one of da delights awaitin readers of dis thrillin debut. these poems leave da impression dat reddy is a kind of collecta of da world's abstract detritus and ephemera, similar to an artist dig joseph cornell siftin through da thrift stores of main bitchs. reddy, dig cornell, is an archivist of da abstract as well as da tangible. he is as much an encyclodepist as a collagist, definin, oftun wiv frightenin detachment, an emotional palette dat ranges from epiphany to disembomident, tenderness to tragic despair. is writin precise, almost \`miniarutist,' in its reverence fa detail;

Along the way, her borrowed carriage is accosted by highwaymen! After a slight fracas, one of the highwaymen is wounded--and he's only a fifteen-year-old boy! Frazzled, Alexandra sets out to find the young highwayman's family. They are a family of 5 children who recently lost their mother. Alexandra decides to help the children find the uncle they have never met.Richard Browning prides himself on his well-ordered lifestyle. He finally gained control of Greengage Manor, and he has a perfect, proper fiance. When Alexandra shows up on his doorstep with 5 children, his world is turned upside down. He doesn't care for children and their rambunctious ways, and his fiance (Miss Wingate) is particularly upset by the presence of his nieces and nephews. Little does he know, a little bit of disorder might be just what he needs...The strongest point of this book was the colorful characters. The author fleshes out even the most minor characters. Actually, the book was less about the romance and more about the children. The story focuses a lot on Ned, Clarissa, Isobel, Michael and Jennifer, and their struggle to find a place to call home. Richard's fiance was delightfully despicable. Unfortunately, Richard's and Alexandra's characters could have used more work, as could their romance. I was hoping for more interaction between the two of them.While the slight on the romance might disappoint some readers, I still thought the book was very charming. It's rare to find such a sweet, innocent story. If I could give an award for \\"most improved author\\", I would give it to Mona Gedney; her last book \\"Love Affair for Lizzie,\\" was charming and unpredictable.

I admit I love all the Anne books, but this one is one of my favorites. I loved hearing about her children and more about what is going on in Anne's head. It is a sweet book."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"The Book I read was by L.M. Montgomery. It is called Anne of Avonlea. This book is a realistic fiction.This book is the second in a series of 8. It is about an adopted girl named Anne Shirley. She won a scholarship to Redmond College but when she finds out her adopted mother Marilla may go blind she stays behind. Anne starts teaching at a local school. Marilla's Relative dies and she adopts her two twins.I loved this book. It was funny and cute. It kept me reading. I read the third one right after I finished it. I think that this book is appropriate for aged 10 and up."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Not the best Anne book, but good! :-) It's 'good' to see some conflict in Anne and Gilbert's marriage instead of the sweet but forced bliss in ANNE OF WINDY POPLARS and ANNE'S HOUSE OF DREAMS."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne of Avonlea was almost as good as the first Anne book. It is about Anne's life as a school teacher in Avonlea. Marilla adopts two mischievous twins and Mrs. Rachel Lynde moves in. So life is never dull for Anne at the school house or at Green Gables. You could read it on its own, but I recommend you read Anne of Green Gables first."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Anne is a teenager becoming a young lady and she undergoes many changes and her experiences are funny and meaningful to her. I would reccomend this book to people who enjoy great books wuth a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"The Anne of Green Gables series is truly amazing. Look at the number of people all over the world who are responding to this great series of books! And, they were written about 80 years ago. The first in the series was written in 1908. How Montgomery holds our attention in 2001 is remarkable. I enjoy the books because they are adventureous, humorous and romantic. Anne is the best female character in literature for young adults. This book, second in the series is sheer delight. You can escape into the world of Prince Edward Island and enjoy yourself. I think that the old world charm and innocence of the stories enchants people of all ages, all generations."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"The narrator is the worst; she makes this book imposable to listen too. At first it was funny, but then I thought about how much money I wasted on the book, and how I knew I could never listen to it, then it was not funny anymore. Save your money, otherwise it is \\"your money or your sanity.\\""},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"You can tell Maud wrote this book when depressedbecause it almost tries to hard to be happy. In many ways it is a feminist's nightmare. At the end maud confronts her old Redmond class-mate Christine. And snubs her because she is childless! She is afraid that Christina is prettier than her, etc, and that Gilbert has forgotten about her. We are lead to believe that a woman is nothing without children, that her only aim in life is her children. However it is interesting to read about the birth of Rilla. That's probably the most interesting part in the book. Anne does not really have much of a role throughout the novel. It is only stories of her children. I enjoyed finding out more about them, but there were some problems. I know this book and Anne of Windy Poplars were written after the other books in the series and this may be the reason. Nan was imaginative in this one and Di, Gilbert's favorite, was the practical one. In Rainbow Valley Di is the imaginative one and Nan the practical one. There is very little of Di, the red-headed twin, in this book. If you thought there was little of Gilbert in the previous books, then be prepared for next to nothing of him in this one. He is totally seperated from his family, all he does is work. I would like to see him interact more with the children, etc. Aunt Mary Maria makes life hell for them for awhile, but in my opinion she leaves too soon for things to become too interesting. We needed some more conflict, perhaps if Aunt Mary Maria stayed and Anne and Gilbert's marriage became threatened by her....if we had been taken into Gilbert's mind: Ok, so now he has to choose between his wife and his kin who according to the book he cannot bear to bar from his house. (That is why he does not bar the horrible aunt Mary Maria out.) In addition, he character was not developed enough. There must have been something good about her! The book gives us the impression that it is trying to be too cheerful. I know L.M. need not write like this, just read \\"Emily's Quest\\" for example.In short this was my least favorite L.M. book ever. I know she wrote this and Anne of Windy Poplars at the urging of her publisher and so I forgive her."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne of Ingleside is the sixth book in L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series. This novel takes place about seven years after Anne's House of Dreams (book 5,) and Anne is the married mother of five children.Anne in her mid-thirties is not as fun-loving a character as she was in the earlier books. She has much more responsibility now and this is plainly illustrated for the reader in Anne of Ingleside. I understand that Anne's freedom has been curtailed a bit by her choices, but Montgomery paints her life in such a negative light that I can't help but wonder what happened to the real Anne? Anne Shirley was always a \\"when life gives you lemons, make lemonade\\" kind of girl, but as a wife and mother she seems bitter and resentful of the people around her.Most of the story however is really about Anne's children in this novel and unfortunately, they all seem like paler versions of their mother. They are a little boring and ill-formed, and their so-called \\"adventures\\" are not very interesting at all. All in all, Anne of Ingleside was a disappointment and I am worried about the next two books..."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all. The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series. My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them. Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time. This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues. I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"After reading this book, my first impression is that I wanna be a mother too! I wanna be the kind of mother like Anne...who is so comforting, understanding, caring, loving and wise all the time. She loves all six of her children, loving them very much without spoiling them; teaching them to be good without being very strict..! I think if I were to become a mother in the future, I would act like Anne too!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This classic story is ruined by the wooden voice of the narrator, making it very hard to listen to. All of L. M. Montgomery's characters are so vibrant, and to hear this story read in such a deadpan fashion is awful. Even Anne sounds dull, and that's hard to achieve when you're telling the story of one of literatures most lively characters."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This sequel to Anne of Green Gables is perfect for any advanced elementary or middle school reader and is still great for all ages. If you like Anne of Green Gables, this sequel will not disappoint you. The book itself was softcover and a bit wider than average, but it was not unwieldy and I kind of prefer more text per page. No illustrations."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"My daughters and I are reading through the works of L. M. Montgomery. We especially love Anne of Green Gables and this book, Anne of Avonlea. We would recommend it but would also recommend that you read Anne of Green Gables first."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I bought this book for my mom. She likes nice stories that don't have icky, nasty stuff in them. She also doesn't like heavy literature. So this series is great for my mom. It's not just for young girls!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Briefly, in Anne of Avonlea, our heroine returns to her beloved Avonlea to teach. Her guardian Marilla Cuthbert has adopted again, this time mischievous but adorable twins. In the midst of school and home escapades, Anne and her friends run an Avonlea Village Improvement Society, which almost backfires when the first project is a disaster. Anne also meets new neighbors. One is the irate Mr. Harrison whom everyone assumes is single and whose parrot always greets Anne with the insulting, \\"Bless my soul, what's that red-headed snippet doing here?\\" The funniest incident involves the town's weatherman, who is famous for his inaccuracies but manages to have the last laugh. As you can tell, Anne of Avonlea is a fun cozy book about small-town life.Now just because I connect with Anne on enough levels for me to consider her a kindred spirit doesn't mean everyone will. Some readers might feel that the way she can win over all but the most cankerous is too Pollyanna-like. I love Anne for this reason. She is an exemplary model of how to deal with the nice and not-so-nice people in the world. Other readers might tire of her prattle and her flights of fancy. Again, I love Anne for this reason. Once I get over being shy, I love to chat and to imagine. Anne makes these traits feel desirable. Mark Twain once called Anne \\"the sweetest creation of life ever created\\". Yet this does not mean Anne is a saccharine character. She has her errors in judgment and spitfire moments, which bring balance to her character, making Anne someone who everyone can love. If you add to this, gorgeous scenic descriptions and cozy character portrayals, you have a great sequel to the beloved Anne of Green Gables story."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is one of my favorite books, along with the rest of the series. It is about a red haired girl named Anne. She loves romance and is full of adventure of spunk. She and her bossum friend Diana are always into some adventure or another. I advise you to read this book!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne a beaucoup d'elan. Elle est fantastique! Ce livre est tres fantastique aussi! Je l'aime beaucoup."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I loved this book. I recieved Anne of Green Gables and I loved it. I noticed the listings of the other Anne books, and decided to buy them. I have read all 8 in this series, plus many others by L.M. Montgomery. The combination of Anne's imagination and impulsivness can make for some very entertaining adventures. You've gotta read this one. -Alexandria"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is my favorite of the Anne series so far. I have read five books and those as I could find them. Not neceserally in the correct order. However Anne captured my heart in this one and made me laugh. I loved her stuggles wether inner or outer ones (her fears about school and the neighbours cow) and I loved the whole story in general.It is the best one ive read to date!!!! Read it ASAP."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is one of a heartwarming series about the life of an orphan who is one of the most real characters I have ever read about! I recommend the whole series this book included."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This second book in the Anne of Green Gables series is even better than the first. Filled with old-fashioned charm, and lots of laugh-out-loud humor,this book is ideal for any age. Shoshana, age 1"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Lucy Maud Montgomery (or any author for that matter) and I've read most of her works. Each chapter reads like an individual short story and the tales are beautiful and funny. A must-read for any Montgomery fan"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"LM Montgomery had a great ability to write stories that made us laugh, cry, and tug at our heart strings. Both Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea are books i bought, and will give to my children to read when they are old enough to appreciate them.I never read them as a child. I wasn't even introduced to them until I was planning a vacation to Prince Edward Island three years ago, and I read the first book. I also watched the movies which were both such wonderful adaptations.Anne of Avonlea picks up where the first one left off. Anne, who I think is the best female fictional character I've ever had the priviledge to read of, is now a teacher. She is growing up, but she still has her adventures with Diana, and her other friends.There are a few new characters are introduced, and although you don't instantly fall in love with them like Ann, they grow you. All but Davey, this character was just so annoying. THis boy was just a bad apple.I'm sure LM had good intentions, but I was utterly annoyed and it brought my feeling of the book down a bit.IF you loved the first book, you will probably enjoy this as well. There is a long series of books by LM. I am currently on break from reading her.She was a great writer, able to bring a great deal of sense of humor in her storytelling, and she is very descriptive. She really brings the characters so true to life, especially Anne.I do recommend this despite my problem w/ davey.Anne will always remain forever in my heart as a true heroine of classic literature. One of the best character to ever be put on paper..as she is kind, funny, good spirited, and what an imagination!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"It seems that Montgomery didn't know what to fill this book with. There are some nice stories about Anne's children (who are very sweet kids indeed), but there is also the extremely boring chapter about the gossipy Ladies' Aid meeting, or the too lengthy presence of the personage of aunt Mary Maria. Anne herself has turned into a common housewife, and there is nothing left of the good naughty little girl with the great imagination or the clever and ambitious young woman. Gilbert is a doctor, Anne is &quot;Mrs Doctor&quot;, and we almost forget about the earlier school and college competions between both of them, where they are equal and both interesting. Reading the previous books one could think Anne would become a famous writer, not just the shadow of man she loves. She is really a wonderful mother and wife, but she could be these things without losing her personality too."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"L.M Montgomery wrote &quot;Anne of Ingleside&quot; and &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot; years after she thought she was done with the Anne series. She was tired of Anne by this time, and this book shows it. If you read the collections of her short stories, you realize that &quot;Anne of Ingleside&quot; was slapped together with some chapters almost word-for-word her short stories, while some are more subtly lifted, while she does some original stuff to tie it together. This patchwork approach shows in an uneven story. I also didn't like Anne as much in the earlier-written stories - there were times where she seemed to cop a superior, snooty attitude."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This books was only written in 1939, three years before Montgomery's death and slipped in as the 6th volume long after what is now volume 7 and 8 were published. It has little of the lightheartedness of the earlier Anne books. It is more like a collection of short stories, were chapters are dedicated to the different children of Anne. Many of the stories are filled with bitterness and spite and bad gossip. Gossip has always been a part of the Anne books, but here it shows its nasty side, its destructiveness. It is not the entertaining gossip of good hearted women like Mrs. Rachel Lynde or Miss Cornelia. The children have again and again very painful experiences within their social circle and their disappointment in friends somehow doesn't seem to be theirs but the authors. To make matters worse, the book has no story line and is barely held together by the cycle of the year with its seasons.It feels very much like this book was not written because Montgomery wanted to, but she had to, whether under pressure from readers, the publisher or others and she did not enjoy it. It reflects a negativity and bitterness that is hard to take and one has to wonder what frame of mind she was in when she wrote it. Fortunately, as the book was added later, it is not necessary to read it to understand the later books and can be easily skipped which is my recommendation."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"First of all, Anne does NOT stop being Anne (with an e), for example, on page 8 Anne says \\"Don't talk as if our day was ended, Diana. We're only 15 years old and kindred spirits. The air isn't just full of light ... it is light. I'm not sure that I haven't sprouted wings.\\" My favorite part of the book was when the ladies were gossiping, it was really funny. If you skip that part of the book how do you know it's boring?Susan is definatly the funniest character in the book. And who says Anne has to be a feminist?If you like Anne you should like these books."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I can't understand why so many reviewers don't like this book. I loved Anne of Ingleside. Susan was really funny. Could it be that some of the reviewers didn't like the book because they were adults? This is one of my favorite Anne books."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is the first Anne of Green Gables book I've read, but I have seen the earler versions on tv. I guess I cheated by jumping right to Anne of Ingleside,but I was anxious to see how she fared with five kids, six actually, because she's pregnant when the story opens.I read it and all I can say is what a sweetadolescent book:) This story takes us on an adventure of Anneand her family. Mostly each chapter is devoted to a single family member's adventure. With three girls and three boys, there are many adventures, like the time when an aunt came and wouldn't leave,or the lesson about false friends.This was a fun book to read and I definitelygive it my highest rating:)"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I think this book was absolutely fantastic. I read this book first and then I read the others though I still have to read a couple more. A flaw in all the books I have so far read about Anne is that the author has created no romance between Anne and Gilbert . I mean a little kissing wouldn't hurt at all and it would make the books so much more romantic and sweet . I don't mean to say that the author has to be totally Danielle Steel but it would have been nice if she had made her books romantic. The worst thing in this whole book was the incessant gossiping of the old ladies at the sewing party. I skipped it because it was so boring. Nevertheless I really like these books and I think the author has described the natural beauty very NICELY. You would feel as if you were there.I find Anne's children very adorable. And I would like to inform the other readers out there that Anne has six children:Jem, Walter, Di, Nan, Shirley and Rilla. I recommend this book to all as it is full of laughter and fun."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I loved Anne of Green Gables as a movie, and I liked it even better as a book, but when I found out there were seven more books in the series I went wild! I am devoted to reading the books written by L. M. Montgomery, but I didn't especially love the show. Many important events in the book are totally omitted in the movie! But, considering the book alone, this is a wonderful item!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne of Avonlea was almost asgood as the first Anne book. It is about Anne's life as a school teacher in Avonlea. Marilla adopts 2 mischeifous twins and life is never dull. You could read it as a sequel or as a book by itself."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This story is not as boring as 'Anne of Windy Poplars' but not really fascinating.First, I don't like Montgomery mainly wrote about Anne's children.Second,I can't understand why Anne's life has to be sacrificed to Gilbert and her children.The unpredicable Anne of Green Gables,Avonlea,Prince Edward Island has now disappeared completely.She is just an ordinary housewife whose business is to take care of her family.No more funny adventures. Fortunately,the ending is better.Anne is back to the Anne of Green Gables ."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne of Green Gables, but Anne of Avonlea is devoid of all that made the first lively and captivating. We rarely see the world through the descriptive lens of Anne's eyes and colorful words in the second book as we did with the first. Instead we are bludgeoned over the head with narrative bucolic scenery after narrative bucolic scenery. Gone is the tension between Anne and Gilbert and gone is the hilarity of Anne's growing pains, and no sympathy is created for the twins Anne and Marilla have adopted. It's as if Montgomery has dumped them into the story and left them there to fend for themselves. I am only halfway through, but the narrative has become so tedious and dull with scenery and very little story, that I may not be able to wade through what should have been edited and rewritten."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"this book is harder to follow but its still as good as the rest. Now Anne has 6 kids to take care of. you can bet they get into more troble than she ever did! Jem, Walter, Nan, Di, Shirely, Rilla, Sunan, and Gilbert to take care of Ingleside is a full house."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is the book that comes before Anne Of The Island. You can see my review there, also. This is about how Anne gets money to go to college and how she is as a teacher. She is always imagining things. She has a special relationship with one of her pupils, Paul Irving. She takes him to meet one of her newest friends, Ms. Lavender. She used to be engaged to Paul's father, so they have a special relationship. And Ms. Lavender and Anne are connected because Anne is the first visitor she has had in a long time. This is a very exciting book. If you want to know more, you can read this book. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I have read Anne of Green Gables three times and this is the second time of reading Anne of Avonlea. I am hopelessy enthralled by the ways of Anne! The only sadness to remark about it the fact that she is growing up! I feel like Marilla at times because she feels a part of her not wanting Anne to let go of her girlsih spirit. However, I know that Anne will never loose her imaginative and creative ways, for she would cease to be Anne. I liked this second novel in the series once again because it continues the story of a girl who is young and adventruos and shares her wonderful stories with you. Much lies in store for those who loved the first, and I will not spoil the new attitudes Anne has come to hold, but you will probably be eager to read the third after finsihing the second!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I thought that this book was fantastic, but I know her heart wasn't it. I loved to hear of the antics of Anne's children. However the back of the book is almost souly about the last few chapters. Don't be decieved. You must read this book if you read the others its a must!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"When a friend of mine told me about the Anne books, I wassort of indifferent about historical foiction. I liked mystries and adventure stories. But, when I first laid eyes on Anne of Avonlea, I knew it was a good book. And then, like and avelanch, in about a month , I read all of the Anne books and some others by L.M.Montgomery. All I can say, is her books are good til' the ladt drop."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"With five unpredictable children and an adventure around every corner, Anne's life is not the only thing that is full to bursting! This book is overflowing with the awkward, comical, and sometimes dangerous exploits of Jem, Nan, Di, Rilla, and Walter--the same kind of adventures that charmed readers everywhere in 'Anne of Green Gables'. But you're never too old for adventures, as Anne discovers on every page, and soon she is deep in schemes and dreams of her own. No, 'Boring' is not a word in the Ingleside vocabulary, and it certainly wouldn't be a word to describe this book!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"We have listened to dozens of audiobooks and thoroughly enjoyed the experience but the stacatto, monotonous narrative style of Susan Omalley is the worst I have ever heard. A third grader could read this book better than she does. Do not buy this audiobook. You will only regret the purchase."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"If I could have, I would rate this book a three star one. But I had to rate it higher, just because it's an L.M Montgomery book, and an Anne one.This book features a few new characters, one of them is a queer, bad-tempered bald man, called Mr. Harrison. Anne and her friends also start a club to improve the community, although some parts are interesting, this bores me a bit.Gilbert is not shown a lot in the book, and when he is, it's usually for a few moments or for A.V.I.S, the club. Same with Diana.You will find that this book is true to it's title, it focuses A LOT on the Avonlea school. Most of the book is about the children, one dreamy boy in particular.Marilla and Anne also adopt two twins, a troublesome, yet lovable boy Davy, and the prim, unemotional Dora. They have a lot in the book.Oh, and Anne meets a new kindred spirit, Miss Lavender, the spinster in the cozy cottage. Anne reunites Miss Lavender with her old, old sweetheart. And Miss Lavender gets married to him. This was sweet, but somewhat dull. At the very end of the book, Gilbert does give a hint to Anne, about how he feels about her.Overall, this book was mostly disappointments, although I would highly recommend reading it. If you expect to be about Anne getting into interesting scrapes, Gilbert being romantic about Anne, and seeing Anne's old chums a lot, than stop expecting. But as I said, I would still suggest this book."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I was so disappointed with this book! I was driving from North Carolina to Austin TX, and Anne of Green Gables narrated by Barbara Caruso was great (even though she pronounced Avonlea as Aay-von-lee instead of Ah-von-lee). This one was terrible!! The woman speaking has random inflection, putting the wrong emph-A-sis on the wrong syll-A-ble, if you will. It completely sounds as if she's reading words that she doesn't understand the meaning of. And the voices she uses for characters! My sister and I literally tried to talk each other into listening at least to the first chapter, to see if we could adjust, but we had to turn it off. It was unbearably painful to listen to. Who hired that lady?? Her voice itself is nice enough, but good lord was her inflection awful! We chose to listen to fuzzy radio stations through the last three states rather than subject ourselves to this version of the book. Spare yourself!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" is the sixth book in Lucy Maud Montgomery's superb \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series. Anne and Gilbert have been married nine years and live in the large house they call Ingleside. Gilbert has a thriving medical practice in Glen St. Mary; he and Anne have five young children, with a sixth on the way. They have also the unique maid of all work Susan Baker.The story centers around a lively series of domestic crises, large and small, delivered with humor and gentle wisdom. Some are typical childhood events, such as the death of a treasured pet or the consequences of a lie. Some affect everyone, such as the prolonged stay of Gilbert's ill-tempered Aunt Mary Maria, whose pessimistic posturing threatens to unhinge the whole family. Some are quite frightening, such as Anne's near-fatal bout with pneumonia.Near book's end, Anne suffers a crisis of confidence in her marriage. Her fears are triggered by Gilbert's air of preoccupation and a visit by an embittered Christine Stuart, whom Anne once saw as a rival for Gilbert's affections. Anne's imagination will lead her down a dark path to an empty marriage sustained for the sake of her children, before a fateful conversation with her husband.\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" and \\"Anne of Windy Poplars\\" were written years after the original six \\"Anne\\" novels, to fill in gaps in her story. Montgomery cleverly uses \\"Ingleside\\" to update the reader on characters previously introduced in \\"Windy Poplars\\", including Rebecca Dew, Jen Pringle, and the now grown Elizabeth Grayson, as well as to drop one or two hints of the future.\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" is rich in the details of a maturing marriage. It is also an introduction to the little Blythe's, each healthy, imaginative, and unique, of whom we will see more in \\"Rainbow Valley.\\" It is highly recommended as a very good read to \\"Anne\\" fans of all ages."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables. It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college. Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad. It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first). Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change). For anyone who liked the first book, this is sure to not disappoint."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I first read the \\"Anne\\" series when I was a child and have read them several times since and thoroughly enjoyed them every time, reading them most recently at the age of 41, a couple of months back. They always make me laugh and cry as much as they did the first time I read them, possibly even more so now, because I can now relate to a lot of the experiences she has as she grows up into a woman and mother.Many readers are aware of the 6 original Anne books by Lucy Maud Montgomery - Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Anne of Windy Willows, Anne's House of Dreams and Anne of Ingleside (all beautifully written and thoroughly enjoyable books), but there are two further books by Lucy Maud, which may or may not be in print now, called Rainbow Valley and Rilla of Inglside. These final two books in the series tell more of Anne's story through the exploits of her 6 children and are well worth a read - both made me laugh and cry in equal measure.All of these books leave you wanting more from Anne and I believe that is the mark of a truly fabulous book! :)"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"A very fun and joyable book where L.C. Montgomery pulled you into the lives of the Blythes, their relative and neighbors."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne is back, and she's still peppy, funny Anne, and she's \\"growing up\\". There is a lot of humor and fun, but Anne is blind-sided by four new characters--two small twins distantly related to Marilla, whom adopts them when they are orphaned; an elderly woman who likes to \\"pretend\\" as much as Anne does (but to such an extent that she comes off as senile rather than charming); and a child prodigy from The class Anne is teaching at Avonles school, to whom an entire paragraph is devoted to describing how handsome he is, and so unlike the other children, and so imaginative...yawn. These characters really detract from the story, even when they are interacting with Anne. But there is enough classic Anne left to make this worthwhile."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I have read and reread this series since i was 12 and will continue to enjoy them with my daughter. This is by far my favorite book of the series."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne of Avonlea by Lucy M Montgomery is the second of theThe Complete Anne of Green Gables Boxed Set (Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Anne of Windy Poplars, Anne's House of Dreams, ... Rainbow Valley, Rilla of Ingleside)series. I had never read the books as a child but when PBS showedAnne of Green Gables: The CollectionI became curious and read at least the first three books. Truth is, I think there were only six still being published at the time or maybe my bookstore didn't have more than the first six. Either way, I was surprised to find out there are eight. I read at least the first three books but then became bored . . .? Or I found Anne less charming . . . ? I don't know. I honestly can't remember why I stopped reading the books.Sooooo . . . I am rereading them. Or some of them anyway. Some of them will be first time reads for me.I remember when I saw the PBS miniseriesAnne Of Green Gables - The Sequel, I was confused. The story was so different from anything I remembered and, at the time, I reread the first three books. The television show departs drastically from the books, give or take some minor similarities. The book is charming, a little more romantic as Anne plays matchmaker and watches her friends slowly fall in love. Things at Green Gables change but Anne, herself, is still enchanting as she dreams through her life but also does what needs to be done, growing into the kind of young woman who manages to maintain her innocence and imagination.I'm curious to see how I respond to the rest of the books in the series. Will Anne lose her charms for me? Will she outgrow them and become less enchanting? Or will what is adorable in a young girl become deplorable in a mature woman? It'll be interesting, I think."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"The House of Dreams became too big for Gilbert and Anne's burgeoning horde of children, so they have moved to a larger home. This book starts when Anne has had six children already, and a large part of the story focuses on the children and their individual adventures. There's also the arrival of GIlbert's aunt, who wears out her welcome quickly but the family has to ensure her presence because Gilbert is too clannish to simply tell her to go home. However, a gesture of thoughtfulness turns out into the unintentional mishap that sends her home, much to the joy of the children and the relief of the parents.One thing I remember fondly is Anne visiting Green Gables (with Marilla still alive) and spending time with her and her best friend Diana. When she goes back to Ingleside, she says a lovely and very Anne-like thing. I don't remember the exact words, but it went something like 'It was nice to be Anne of Green Gables again for a while, but it's a thousand times lovelier to go back as Anne of Ingleside' Ahh, home sweet home.I do wish that Anne hadn't given up her teaching job or other employment. I understand this was written back then where women were expected to be homemakers and the like, and in this book, the year is around 1899-1900, but Anne is a very intelligent and spirited woman, I'd have liked to see her juggle a part-time job or something. :P"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne of Green Gables was a wonderful debut novel for what would become a memorable series starring one of literature's most beloved characters - Anne Shirley.Anne came to Green Gables as a girl, but in this book, she is growing into a fine (but still spirited) young lady. With the loving help of her adoptive parents and a few good friends/neighbors (such as Rachel Lynde) Anne explores the world around her as she prepares for adulthood, taking on bit by bit of responsibility. This book is also a great read in that it lets teenagers of today compare their lives to Anne's own - today's kids sure have it EASY!Despite her burgeoning maturity, Anne is still a fiery and lovable person who is happy to help out friends - or stand up for them or herself! Her wit and spark is endearing, and it's impossible to not like her."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"It has been a long time since I first read this series, and I must admit that I remembered much less of this installment in the life of Anne Shirley than I did of her scrapes and adventures in _Anne of Green Gables_.

Still, this made for a delightful read, and it always put me in a better mood, even if I only read a chapter or two at a time. To see the world through Anne's eyes certainly improves it! And though Anne was much more grown up here at the age of 17, she still managed to fall into some mischief, and the antics of her students and Davy brought genuine joy and laughter to the book. I can't wait to see what is \\"around the bend\\" for Anne Shirley!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"In L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Avonlea, we pick-up the story of Anne Shirley where Anne of Green Gables leaves off. Anne is now a teacher at the Avonlea school. Despite having \\"grown up\\" a bit, Anne is still Anne, and with the help of some delightful new characters, continues to get herself into trouble in a way only she can!Anne of Avonlea is a wonderful story. We see Anne growing a little older and wiser in the ways of the world, while still maintaining her whimsical spirit. She is a wonderful, positive heroine, and immediately becomes a \\"bosom friend\\" to anyone and everyone who reads her story.Montgomery's descriptions are both beautiful and beguiling. Her writing style is entertaining and readable, making it impossible not to become lost within Anne's favorite haunts in Avonlea. When reading these books it is easy to see why so many fans of the series vacation on Prince Edward Island!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I read this with my 12-year-old daughter and we both loved it. A real classic."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"In this book anne becomes a school teacher and meets intresting new characters. I enjoy her struggels with her students and the keith twins. the ending leaves a hint of romance between gilbert and anne."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Lucy Montgomery can't seem to write convincing men, and only does marginally better with women. The quality of this series has really gone downhill since Anne was a girl, or even a young woman. Now that she has children, the book no longer focuses on her, which was really the main reason the books seemed to come alive in the beginning. Now, they drag on and on. I found myself having to skim large sections simply because nothing happens. One of the longest chapters is a quilting circle's gossip- and that's it. And it's not even gossip about characters we know or care about! A genius to the early books was that Anne either had many problems, or believed she did, and we could join in the child's angst about life. But now Anne has the ideal life she has always wanted. And there is no conflict. And hence, much of this book is simply boring. There are times when things pick up- like when her children get into trouble. We start to see something similar to the adventures of the Anne we knew. But each issue is quickly resolved within a chapter, and nothing encourages you to go on to the next pericope. There is some hope when Anne starts to dabble with match-making, but this is quickly ended before it could get very interesting. Aunt Mary Maria is a pill of a woman, and she makes for some very interesting reading- but then she leaves after the first quarter of the book, never to be seen again, and with everything unresolved.When Lucy writes of Anne's son, Jem, there is something missing. He doesn't seem like a boy somehow- or else not like a real human. And I realized that this is further developed in Lucy's treatment of Gilbert, who seems to be amazingly absent in these later books. There is no great undying love between her and Gilbert as there was in earlier books. Yes, it is mentioned, it is assumed, but we don't see it. Gilbert does very little thought or action- he is mostly wallpaper. Lucy doesn't write convincing male characters.The last third of the book picks up somewhat, with a few more conflicts for the children, and Anne's marriage appears to be in jeopardy. But I finished this book really unsure as to if I wanted to read the final installment- despite the foreshadowing of the last two pages."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Enjoy the CD book you loved as a child. Audio books are a great way to get your middle school aged child to read. Why not listen to the book together as you ride in the car?"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to \\"create\\" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in \\"Rilla of Ingleside.\\" There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is \\"Christine,\\" the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to \\"steal\\" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction. I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said.I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books. At least the movies keep your interest."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I've re-read this book (along with the whole series) about 6 times, and I still find it so good it's hard to leave it until I finish it. Lucy Maud created a character that catches your heart strings and won't let go! (Well, I fell in love with Gilbert Blythe, but that doesn't matter)I also reccomend other books by Lucy M. Montgomery featuring Anne as well as others like Emily of New Moon, Kilmeny of the Orchard, and SPECIALLY, A TANGLED WEB. See if you can stop reading them once you have started!!! I asure you that you'll spend hours of enjoyment with them."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I really liked this book. I enjoyed reading about Anne as a grown woman with children. Her children are really just like her. Their imaginations carry them on some very enjoyable adventures. I think that if you enjoyed the first few books in this series, you'd definately like this one too. To anyone who hasn't read the series yet, start them now. They are all very good books."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Without a doubt this classic piece of work shaped my life in various ways. I cannot emphasize how positive Anne Shirley is as a character. She is a heroine who is not only beautiful(spirit) but extremely intelligent. The most drastically different aspect of the novel is the fact that the romantic male character, Gilbert, gestures to the idea that &quot;being smart is better than being pretty&quot;. How often spoken or written are those words? I believe that phrase is something young girls must recognize as well as understand in life. For beauty is fleeting and knowledge is eternal. Timeless and pure, I suggest this novel for anyone who loves a bit of comedy, romance,intrigue, and pure fun. This novel as well as the entire series is a gift. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I'm surprised at how many Anne fans are disappointed in Anne of Ingleside. Of course, Anne can't be the same 13-year-old girl we first met, but I'm still rooting for her all the way. Some say Anne has her \\"ideal life,\\" but near the end of this novel, Anne does stumble upon some insecurity, which I found absolutely devastating. I have laughed and cried with Anne throughout this series, and this installment is no exception. Now, we get to meet Anne's children, who have trials of their own. Not a bit boring to me. I would still recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the younger Annes."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. Now I'm 21 and recendly read it again, and I liked it even more. The plot is great. The characters are alive, and the writing is superb.A must for anyone that wants to laugh, love and cry with the town from Avonlea."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"In this, the second story of the Anne series, we become reacquainted with Anne and her friends, and we are introduced to many fascinating new characters who either make her feel like tearing her hair out or enrich her life. Although she is now sixteen and a fully fledged schoolmarm, she still displays the irrepressible knack for getting into scrapes that she had as a child, which include falling through a roof, dying her nose a ghastly colour, losing her temper with the irrascible Mr Harrison, her next door neighbour, and sowing the first seeds of love with Gilbert Blythe.Millions of readers around the world are forever thankful that Lucy Maud Montgomery wrote several more books about Anne's escapades, for if she hadn't, we would forever be wondering what would have become of Anne, asking ourselves what kind of teacher would she have been like, would she have gone on to university, would she have married Gilbert Blythe and borne his children? When we contemplate asking ourselves these questions, we would perhaps feel amazed that a mere literary character has had such a profound effect on our lives. Then perhaps, after doing all this, we would then return to our bookshelf, pick up a story about Anne, read a few pages, and then we would know for sure why we have fallen eternally in love with her."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I really enjoyed the first Anne book, but the second was a bit dull. It was still nice, but Anne and Gilbert's relationship doesn't go anywhere!!! So if you want to read an Anne book where it does, I strongly recommend Anne of the Island. I just didn't find this novel as capturing as I had hoped. Maybe it was too much description. I always have a problem with too much of that. While reading I had to keep skipping ahead to see when the next time Gilbert would even be mentioned!!! So like I said, it was okay."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"When I was finally able to pick up a copy of this book, I was quite excited to read more of Anne's continuing adventures. Up to this point, I had found myself enthralled by all of Anne's adventuring. But when I finally managed to finish this book, it really was a disappointing moment. The book revolves, mostly, around the adventures of Anne's children, none of which were in the least bit interesting. Her children's stories all follow one main plotline. 1: I'm going to be naughty even though mother and everyone says I should be good. 2: Oh, it really was horrible wanting to be naughty, because it all turned out badly in the end. 3: Mother's holding me and everything's all better again. About half way through the book, I really began to wonder how two such interesting characters as Anne and Gilbert could have possibly had not 1, but 6 dull, rather stupid, flighty children. Even their imaginings, which, in Anne seemed so interesting, were all terribly lackluster and idiotic in her children. There was absolutely no character development of Anne or Gilbert, which, I rather felt there should have been, considering the book takes place over quite a number of years. Anne is nothing more than window dressing, brought in and out of the scenes in the most haphazard fashion. Gilbert spends the entire book going from work to more work, and yet another spat of work, before starting it all over again. Everything that I enjoyed so much about their earlier romance was gone completely, and the end, to which the back of the book aludes is flat at best. Anne does nothing to 'win' Gilbert's love all over again. It's practically all of one chapter. 1: Anne has a fit, and is sure Gilbert no longer loves her(which, if I were writing Gilbert, considering how utterly boring Montgomery writes her out to be, would be completely understandable). 2: Anne gets jealous. 3: Anne and Gilbert come home and suddenly everything's right in the world again. I was thankful to finally finish this book, something I've never felt with the first 5. With those it was always, Good grief, it's over already? All in all, if you're HUGE Anne fan, you might want to read this book simply to have read another book into which Anne figures. But don't expect her to be anything like the old Anne so many came to love and respect."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" is the sixth book in L.M. Montgomery's \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series, but it was the last of the eight books written. Montgomery had originally ended her series in 1920 with \\"Rilla of Ingleside.\\" In 1936 she wrote \\"Anne of Windy Poplars,\\" which became the fourth book and fit in between \\"Anne of the Island\\" and \\"Anne's House of Dreams,\\" covering the three years the red-headed orphan spent teaching while waiting for Gilbert to finish medical school. \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" was written in 1939 and is set ten years after \\"Anne's House of Dreams,\\" and before \\"Rainbow Valley.\\" This allows Montgomery the opportunity to retroactively foreshadow what would happen to her son Walter in the World War and other aspects of the final pair of books.At this point Anne and Gilbert have five children, are about to have a sixth, and have made Glen St. Mary into a home. But then Gilbert's maiden Aunt Mary Maria arrives and puts a serious damper on the happy household. Anne's primary focus is on her children and their daily little crises, although Jem wanting a dog turns out to be a constant concern. It takes a little get used to Anne Shirley being a mother, but what is impossible to believe is that Anne is suddenly worried that Gilbert no longer loves her. But Anne is not only convinced of this, but is equally sure that Gilbert is interested in somebody else, the widowed Mrs. Andrew Dawson of Winnipeg, who was formerly Christine Stuart. Yes, the same Christine Stuart that Anne was jealous of in \\"Anne of the Island\\" when she thought Gilbert was dating her, even though the truth was he was simply providing her with an escort since her fiance was out of town. Apparently our Anne-girl can be fooled twice and the entire business is carried all the way until the final chapter, which is why I round down on this one. It has to be clear to all those who love the character of Anne Shirley and the writing of L.M. Montgomery that this novel is on the bottom shelf and it is there for good reason.This was Montgomery's last novel, her previous effort being \\"Jane of Lantern Hill\\" in 1937. That was a solid story about a young girl reconciling her parents, but \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" really does seem like Montgomery took everything she had left and mixed it together for a last novel. At the end Montgomery describes Anne in her white gown, her hair in two long braids, looking, \\"like the Anne of Green Gables days . . . of Redmond days . . . of the House of Dreams days. That inward glow was still shining through her.\\" That is what we want to hear, but it is really too little too late. However, just accept that this book is an abberation. Even though the Blythes are secondary characters in the next book, \\"Rainbow Valley,\\" is it one of my favorites and the story of the Blythes during the World War makes for a fascinating ending to the story, even if it is far removed from where we started with the red-headed orphan who was adopted by Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This book is awesome! Although I have to admit, that some books are better, say \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\". I've recommended the \\"Anne\\" series to all my friends and they've promised me that they'd read it, for my sake.

I've read the first five books many times. But this one falls quite flat. LMM spends about a page every chapter describing the flowers and the trees and whatnot, which gets old fast. Additionally, I feel like I as a reader got demoted. While Anne and Gilbert have their lives, the reader gets relegated to the kiddie table to see what hi-jinx the children are up to. I'm sure the children are great, but I've followed Anne from eleven years old, and I want to stay with her. I felt condescended to.The quilting chapter bored me utterly to death. The other characters that were introduced came and went too quickly...except for Aunt Mary Maria, I felt cheated out of getting to know anyone. The whole book is too much telling, not enough showing.

At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her &iexcl;Sweet Teacher&iexcl;. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair &iexcl;carrots&iexcl;) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn&iexcl;t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger. My mom keeps telling me to go and do work but I cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written. I like the others in this series also.Thank you L.M. Montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life!~~ Referring to the special collectors edition"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I love this story. Echo lodge was great.

In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles! Anyways, more happens in this story than a change in appearance: Anne becomes the Avonlea schoolma'am, and loves her students like crazy, especially little Paul Irving, who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher. Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I have read the first three Anne of Green Gables books and I liked this one best! The first time I read Anne of Green Gables I couldn't finish it, I only read the first chapter. This time I got through it and read Anne of Avonlea which I really liked. My favorite part is Miss Lavender's wedding. There were some parts in this book that were veeeeeerrrrrrrryyy boring but if you can manage to get through them it's worth it!!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I loved this book every bit as much as I loved the earlier ones. Anne's children are sweet and wonderful, and it's good to know that Gilbert still loves her after all those years! I only wish there were a book in between the previous book and this one. It seems quite a jump for Anne, whose life we have known so intimately ever since she was 11 years old, to suddenly go from having one baby to having 5 children and one on the way."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It was very interesting once I got involved. I like Anne's personality and at times it was very funny. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Since Anne is no longer a little girl in Anne of Avonlea, I was expecting the deligtful flavor of Anne of Green Gables to gone from the saga. I was pleasantly suprised. The wit and whimsy that was so common in Anne of Green Gables is even stronger in Anne of Avonlea. Anne never ceases to amaze me with her creative view on life. This is also a very positive story, and the emotional ending nearly brought me to tears. Another must-read in the world of Anne."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"When I first read this book, I disliked the new characters, and wanted to know about Avonlea, Marilla, Mrs. Lynde, and Diana. But that was because I didn't read the books in order! My favourite part was the touch of cynicism Anne shows when Gilbert seems to forget their anniversary. Up until this point, Anne has been nothing short of perfect, and this book made her REAL to me."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I enjoyed reading Anne of Ingleside. The author captures the life of Anne as a wife, friend, mother, and relative. Anne does so many things for her kids by giving them love, care, and understanding. You can almost feel Anne's happiness, fear, anger, and doubts in her life. Therefore, I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read something wonderful. I sure loved it from the beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"I have just finished reading this book and I could not put it down.The way LMM describes every little detail is fantastic.I was furios towards the end when it seemed that Gilbert was neglecting Anne.However everything worked out and I am desperate to find out more.I really want to know about Anne and Gilbert's six children and Anne and Gilbert themselves!Anne of Ingleside is an unforgetable book and a MUST for all the Anne fans of whom I know there are many."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne of Avonlea is a great book, and if you haven't read it, you're missing out!

I also recomend Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"in this book we talk mainly about the children which is good we get new characters. anne although a mother still has plenty adventures she just grew up more and has new intrets too. she is still tthe anne we knew in anne of green gables."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Anne Shirley returns in another wonderfull book that bring us back to her little world of Avonlea Where now she teaches and also founding the organization for improoving Avonlea. The way of writting in this book cna hypnotyze you and even can make you feel like you are inside the story and you see and feel and here everything that happens in the story. everytime that i read the book I start to jelouse in the children that are anne's students just because she is their teacher Anne's character again is charming and wonderfull and easy to like from reading this book and all her others and liking her character my whole Identity designed like hers and till today she is my favorite character in literature. I'd like to get responses for what I wrote."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This book tells of Anne's marriage after having quite a few more children and worries - does Gilbert still love her? Is he still attracted to his college sweetheart?I didn't feel that Anne had developed enough as a character to be worth another book - maybe it's because her children (lovely as they are) are starting to dominate the book. Maybe it's because unlike the previous books, the changes in her life (e.g. moving to Ingleside and having kids) was not a major &quot;bend in the road&quot; but rather a walk down a straight one from her last book, and even though the road might be a lovely one, it does not contain as many surprises as a bend would. All of her other books had a bend, or a little twist, between them, and I feel I miss it in this book.The main characters added to this book are the children, and Susan. The children are all somewhat similar to Anne, they are not Anne herself as a child, and they all seemed a little &quot;bland&quot; to me by comparrison to her. Even though they were all difference ages, which would have made them more likely to experience different events on different levels, they do not, which is a little disappointing.Susan, on the other hand, is nothing but bland - she has her own ways, her own opinions and basically - a woman who knows her own mind, unusual as all of those above might appear to be. She is just so funny sometimes! God bless Lucy Maud Montgomery for inventing her!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"\\"Anne of Green Gables\\" is one of my favorite books ever. I never read any of the sequels, so I thought I would read it with my 11-year-old daughter. Big disappointment. While Anne was incredibly charming as a little girl, she is now just a little too perfect. Marilla doesn't even seem like the same person. The twins are kind of annoying and don't have much of a role in the story - they just kind of pop in and out. Anne's relationship with Paul Irving seems a little creepy. My daughter found Miss Lavender really creepy. When we were introduced to her - all dressed up with formal tea set out even though no guests were expected, a mute servant girl whom Miss Lavendar didn't even bother to call by her real name - my daughter said \\"I would be running out of there!\\" She reminded me of Miss Haversham in \\"Great Expectations.\\" I know she's supposed to be whimsical but she just comes off weird. Overall, I am not enjoying this book at all. Which is disappointing, because the first book in the series has truly been one of my favorite books since I was 11 years old."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Even though L.M. Montgomery did not intend Anne of Green Gables to be a series, she still captivates with her eager readers in Anne of Avonlea.There are still quite a few differences, Anne has grown from a \\"queer\\", fiery, young girl to a wiser, calmer, auburn-headed schoolteacher. Yes, a schoolteacher. Also, as we follow Anne in this Bildungsroman literature, the romance between her and Gilbert Blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel.Some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first, and perhaps this is because Anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude.Altogether, my opinion of the book is that it was a good follow-up and I sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Maud's &quot;Anne&quot; series has captured my heart since I was a young girl. I can relate to Anne because we share a lot of the same characteristics. We are both hopeless dramatists and romantics. Anne is as hilarious as she is touching. I know I will share this beautiful story with my own daughter some day. A MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"This insightful, tender novel really touched on my feminine side. It is the story of the spunky Anne and her adventures in dealing with the twins, her school, and her best friends. Yes, I know, it is hard to be a 16 year old male avid L.M. Montgomery fan, but without her books, I would never have realized the world of wonder attached to novels commonly thought of as &quot;girl's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"Since this book was in hardcover, I was assuming, in the lack of a date or description, that it was an earlier edition. What I got was a cheap-looking modern edition that I never would have bought if I had had information as to the publication date, which was never listed. I don't like being exploited like this. Books should be advertised with dates."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"The title of this book is Anne of Avonlea. This book was written by L.M. Montgomery. Anne of Avonlea is historical fiction.This book is about a girl named Anne Shirley who lives at Green Gables after being adopted. She starts teaching school at Avonlea after her education at that school and another school farther away. She stays in Avonlea and teaches at the Avonlea school for two years before she goes to college. When living and teaching at Avonlea, Anne gets acquianted with many new people, but also gets into trouble as she always does. Her new neighbor she meets when he visited her, in a very bad mood, bringing her Jersey cow back after it had eaten some of grains. She soon becomes friends with him. Her other friends she doesn't meet as abruptly and in a nervous manner as she did Mr. Harrison, the old man that brought her cow back to her. She soon becomes more like a woman and less like a girl, but she still daydreams.I liked this book because it was enthralling and made you want to keep reading it. This book was very enjoyable and you never knew what would happen next. This book is best suited for teenagers and young adults."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"In Anne of the Islnad, the character that I have grown to love and become familiar with, grows up and moves on to college.

However, Anne learns through her failures and to my contentment, ended up with the one person whose heart truly belongs to her."},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","review":"a lovely book-though not as beautiful as the other Anne books. I was terribly disappointed with the names of Anne's children. Imagine naming your child after your sur name!(Shirley). And it seems so stuck-up somehow to name your child after yourself(Anne or Nan) I think Montgomery could have been a bit more original with regard to the names.I like their system of naming your children after people you love-like James,Walter,Rilla,Diana. So why on earth could not Anne do the same with Nan and Shirley? Otherwise quite an entertaining book- I'm a HUGE fan of all Montgomery books and my personal favourite is Rilla of Ingleside.Makes for good reading and the language is flawless and absolutely beautiful...."},{"Title":"Ever the Eagle","review":"This well-told tale about a hero/fighter pilot and his family during World War II and the Korean conflict is accurate in the details, believable, understandable and well organized. It is easy to put yourself in the place of Tommy Chandler as if taking part in his adventures. Tommy is an admirable man with human weaknesses and desires. He lives in highly dangerous times and performs as we would like to think that most of our countrymen would in such terrible circumstances. It is obvious that the author is a patriot with high morals, and his research was thorough."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum","review":"...Rushdoony, in typical crushingly intellectual yet real world livable fashion, makes the case that schools (public, private, or home) for Christian children must have a distinctively Christian curriculum. The implications of Christianity permeating all areas of life are developed in this book as the default rational for making every subject of education distinctly within the shadow of Christian theology.While you do not have to be a scholar for this book, nothing Rushdoony writes is for the intellectually lazy. Be prepared to THINK and in some cases reread whole chapters. A perfect book for homeschoolers to be."},{"Title":"Dirt & Deity: A Life of Robert Burns","review":"Ian McIntyre, with this elegantly researched and crafted volume, has established himself as a truly exceptional biographer. This was the first work on Burns I have read that presented a compelling portrait of the poet as we know him from his work: a complicated mix of joy and sorrow, deep thought and bawdy humor, loyalty and infidelity, generosity and poverty, arrogance and innocence, British patriot and sentimental Jacobite. McIntyre's incisive and compelling research, copiously documented in notes, completely debunks the equally silly positions of overly sentimental hero-worshipers (mostly Scottish) and effete Burns-trashers (mostly English). McIntyre demonstrates what Burns lovers have known all along: all of Burns' poetry was not good--but when he WAS good, he was one of the truly great poets. The author also wades into many of the great Burns' controversies. He presents the evidence for Burns heavy (if not excessive for the time) use of alcohol, without diminishing Burns' worth as either a man or an artist. His depiction of the &quot;Highland Mary&quot; debate alone is worth the price of the book. This will become THE essential book on Burns, and it is apropriate (and probably essential) that it was written by a Scotsman."},{"Title":"Dirt & Deity: A Life of Robert Burns","review":"An excellent biography of the great Scottish poet and songwriter. It sits proudly on my bookshelf next to the Burns biography by Mackay. Much blather has been written about Burns, of course, and in a crowded field, I think these two books stand out. A worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Dirt & Deity: A Life of Robert Burns","review":"The author performed an incredible amount of extensive research using primary sources. In _Dirt and Deity_ he also dispels many of the legends associated with Burns in the past. However, the book suffers a major shortcoming: the book is written like a stream of events, many of them unrelated, rather than in coherent phases. There are chapters, of course, but McIntyre does not summarize or &quot;re-cap&quot; each one (or any of them, really). This leads to confusion and a lack of coherence in the reader's mind."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Log4j","review":"This is an excellent reference. However, be aware that it does not provide much that isn't readily available in the composite of a couple of references available on-line on the Apache web site. I am very happy with the book, because I prefer to have a reference I can use off-line and at the side of my computer instead of in a window buried beneath my work."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Log4j","review":"This is not a large book by any stretch, but it packs a lot in. There's all sorts of stuff I hope I never need to know about log4j here, and there's examples of almost all of it. It would be a bit of overkill for what I need, except that it is also very logically organized.A word of warning, though. This book is not a simple recipe book for log4j. The examples are helpful, but they serve to illustrate the exposition of the API. If you don't want to see or understand what log4j is doing behind the curtain, you'll get a limited benefit. I am somewhere on the fence here. I've toured the book, pulled out what I can use now, and plan to return to get a better understanding of the inner workings later."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Log4j","review":"Of all the Apress publications I've read, this is by far the best. This book provides a wonderful introduction, refresher or skill set extension for Log4J. I recommend this book for the beginner to moderate Log4J user.Quick, concrete examples and explanations are the strong point of this book. It's fast and easy to read (I was able to read the book and work through it in a single day) and provided me with not only an understanding of Log4J, its core competencies and the business requirements that it meets, but also provided me with a creative inspiration.Many of the topics covered can provide you with ideas of your own for existing or future applications that you are or will be working on. Reading this book will provide you with a foundation for using Log4J effectively in your own applications.I do, however, recommend reading some of the other extensive Log4J books for more detailed information. However, this will serve you as a wonderful reference and overview of the technology."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Log4j","review":"I think this book could have been written in a much clearer, more easy to understand way. I also think it could have addressed much better the real world logging issues that a developer faces on the job.It is not entirely the author's fault. Still, logging is a crucial subject to master, and it is very frustrating in that it requires dozens of hours to understand log4j and all its configuration options and gotcha's. For example, I have never yet been able to get log4j to work in Websphere. Certainly it's my fault, but that does not change the fact that it's very hard to configure log4j with multiple class loaders in effect. This book does not address the problem of using log4j in Websphere at all. Rather, it has a not terribly clear chapter on using log4j with Bea Weblogic.The kind of real world help that real programmers need and which this book does not address at all, is topics such as how to have logging in a java framework which is distributed as a jar file, which is then invoked in an entirely separate java application that itself uses log4j logging. For example if I include a jar file in my project that has logging messages at the DEBUG level, and my own project has messages at the DEBUG level, I want to see *my* debug messages but not see the debug messages of the included jar file. This book does not deal with these kind of real world problems at all. Nada.I have tried reading this book several times. It is mind numbing at times in the amount of detail presented. The important information is often hard to pick out from all the other information that is less important.Maybe I'm being too harsh. Maybe I am really criticizing log4j itself rather than this particular book. This book is a \\"must have\\" purchase for a serious programmer, but having said that it could certainly have been written more carefully and thoughtfully. The examples could have been much better planned and varied. The author seems at times a little lazy in using the same not very interesting example for an entire chapter instead of illustrating more things.It's not the fault of the authors that log4j is needlessly complicated to understand and configure and gives very cryptic error messages. But on the other hand the authors certainly don't deserve any praise for going out of their way to make an easy to read, carefully edited book. A lot of work went into writing the book, but I still can only give it two stars because it's eating up much, much more of my time than should be necessary to absorb it.In re-reading this review which I wrote over a year ago, I continue to agree with most of what I wrote. If it would let me however I would raise the number of stars to 3 and feel mildly guilty for not giving it 4 stars. It's actually a pretty good book, but it's crucial to be forewarned that it simply cannot be read straight through, cover to cover the way I did. It's better to hunt and peck through the book looking for the occasional useful gem hidden among all sorts of information that only an experienced power user would ever need. The hardest part for a new log4j user who reads this book is to figure out where the \\"20\\" of the classic 80/20 rule resides, versus the 80 percent of log4j that 8 out of 10 people will never need to use or know about."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Log4j","review":"It's disappointing that Java requires so much logging. It's an artifact of the complexity. But I can't hold that against this book. This thin tome is a well-written and illustrated walkthrough of all of the Log4J fundamentals. There are some insightful examples and good use of UML to illustrate message flows."},{"Title":"Good Carbs, Bad Carbs: An Indispensable Guide to Eating the Right Carbs for Losing Weight and Optimum Health","review":"This book really breaks down what everyone needs to know into very easily read information.

The information presented walks the old &quot;food pyramid&quot; party line, advocating a high carbohydrate diet. The authors seem to be trying to capitalize on the interest generated by the latest studies on carbohydrates, but without adding any new information. The back of the book does have a short (8.5 pages) list of &quot;glycemic index values,&quot; but rather than listing the actual glycemic values of anything, they resort to the patronizing, vague and annoying practice of assigning everything a value of &quot;gusher,&quot; &quot;tricker,&quot; or &quot;intermediate.&quot; They also list whether each food in the table is a &quot;sugar&quot; or a &quot;starch,&quot; a line of thinking proven meaningless.As an example of the discredited advice they offer, &quot;healthy&quot; snacks recommended in the book include: chewy granola bars, graham crackers, pretzels and cookies.In a menu they recommend for a second-grader, the foods include pre-sweetened breakfast cereal, graham cookies, and sugar-sweetened pudding...all in the same day!Even if you can get past the unsettling &quot;gushers and tricklers&quot; analogies used ad nauseum throughout the book, you are unlikely to gain any new, much less valid information."},{"Title":"Good Carbs, Bad Carbs: An Indispensable Guide to Eating the Right Carbs for Losing Weight and Optimum Health","review":"This is the ideal book for those who would like the whole story on carbohydrates and the glycemic index!

At end of the book it says &quot;Carbs rule!&quot; This book could pass as a term paper written by a fifth grader who has done no research, just wrote the paper off the cuff in about an hour.

It is also a story about &quot;moving on&quot;. It's an exceptionally well told story and a fine addition to literature and fictional prose regarding the holocaust and the lives of those that nightmare affected."},{"Title":"The Pawnbroker","review":"This is a rich work whose central theme is the meaning of true humanity. It is the story of a Jew who knows the worst inhumanity in the destruction of his family in the Holocaust( Shoah) and is tested as to the possibility of coming back to life through his meetings in the new world. It is a tightly written and in a way poetic narrative, troubling and moving. A very highly recommended work."},{"Title":"The Pawnbroker","review":"Years after it was written and hailed not only as a fine literary work, but historically as one of the first post-WWII books to fictionally address the war and survival of it. It is a story that goes beyond the harrowing history to deal with a single person broken by life, who has created a protective shell to insulate himself from the horrors. Yet finally he chooses to painfully shed the shield and open himself to the sensations of life."},{"Title":"The Pawnbroker","review":"This work contrasts with the sanitized view of war in much of modern media.

But this is what Wallant wanted - a real person - not some literary hero larger than life, but a real person who has been pushed to every extent imaginable and merely desires to stay alive and keep moving, nothing else.Wallant, unfortunately, died early, in his mid 30's of a sudden heart attack. Had Wallant lived and continued to write for decades, we - this country - would most certainly have a much deeper respect and appreciation for this man and for his craft. He was a writer of unmatched precision and empathy. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Pawnbroker","review":"This is a gripping tale of one mans loss of humanity and his regaining of it.Mr. Wallant's untimely death cut short what would have been a brilliant writing career, although he did manage to write three other books before this one.I am a great fan of the film, starring Rod Steiger in his breakout role, although many of the characters are the same in the film as in the book. There is great plot development from the onset, and the story really keeps you riveted to the book.My one qualm with the authors writing is that he uses very, for lack of a better term, \\"poetic\\" descriptions of places and emotions which I found just a bit tedious.Barring that, this is a read that I would highly recommend to anyone that wishes to explore the depths of misery and redemption."},{"Title":"The Pawnbroker","review":"This is not a book I would've picked on my own.

Beautifully portrays life after the Holocaust"},{"Title":"Competing Truths: Theology and Science as Sibling Rivals","review":"There is a small but growing band of Christians who believe an honest dialogue between science and theology is not only possible and necessary but would be beneficial to both parties. Richard Coleman is committed to the enhancement of such a dialogue. His book is an excellent addition to this endeavor. His description of the relationship between sicience and theology as sibling rivals alters the myth of science and theology as enduring enemies and gives a new sense of the long, complex and exciting history of two tradititons growing up in the same household. Sibling rival captures the depth of love, hate, power and passsion tht exists between these two worldviews. He writes, &quot;I wish to take seriously a scientific view of the world, knowing that it is limited and embedded in its own self interest, and ash how it coheres with a theological understanding, likewise circumscribed and driven by it own intereest.&quot;The argument in this book focuses on the relationship between ontology and epistemology and the shift that is taking place in current science and theological communities. Coleman develops interesting lists that help explain how both disciplines approach the relationship between how-we-come-to know and the world itself. Science, for example, developed an epistemology that depended upon manipulation and vexing nature. Theology was more passive, accepting and responsive in it understanding of the world and prized mediation as the par excellence way of knowing. The scientific epistemology (empiricism) eventually became the accepted way of knowing, but the author believes both disciplines have valuable and distinctive ways to answer the perennial questions about the nature of the universe, who we are, and our place within it all.Critical to his argument is the shift in our postmoderan age concerning the ontological real. No longer is the scientific community so confident that its epistemology will give final solutions to life's questions about nature and human existence. There is a deeper understanding of the universe which indicates there is more mystery and depth than expected. The author's extensive knowledge of the literature in science, theology and postmodern philosopy is amazing.This is not an easy book to read but the author does explain any technical terms. It demands some knowledge in the fields of science, theology and current philosophical trends, but anyone who thinks the dialogue between science and theology is the critical interfiath conversation for out time will be informed, rewarded and encouraged by this book. It would be an excellent text for parish discussion groups of scientists and a fine text for student in both theological school and colleges.Read &quot;Competing Truth, Theology and Science as Sibling Rivals&quot; for a hopeful possibility."},{"Title":"Conecuh People: Words Of Life From The Alabama Black Belt","review":"I enjoyed reading Conecuh People: Words of Life from the Alabama Black Belt. My hometown of Union Springs Alabama is well represented."},{"Title":"They're A Weird Mob","review":"They're a Weird Mob is the first book by John O'Grady writing under the pseudonym Nino Culotta, and purports to tell the tale of Nino, an Italian journalist sent to Australia to write articles about the country and her people for Italians to read. Nino has learned English, so he shouldn't have a problem, his boss thinks. But English, Nino finds, is not Australian. As Nino experiences true Aussie culture in the form of Kings Bloody Cross, labouring for a brickie, drinking in the pub, picking a fight in the street, almost being arrested, travelling on the train, being invited to tea, a buck's night, a wedding reception, going shooting and swimming at Bondi, he relates his interactions with Australians and his puzzlement with their language. Some of the conversations he overhears, like the discussion of horse racing in a caf&eacute;, are confusing to me now, after having lived in Australia for 55 years. Nino learns about the attitude of many Australians to migrants, but finds his appearance and his willingness to \\"have a go\\" soon defuse this, and finds himself taking part in many Aussie-male rites of passage. He also learns that many words (ticket, drum, shout, before, only) have multiple meanings. This novel is a very long way from being Politically Correct: when Nino decides he wants to marry, the discussion on \\"sheilas\\" begins \\"blondes are easy on the eye, but they get dirty quick\\". One needs to remember, though, that it was written in 1957, and reflects attitudes of the day, and if one bears this in mind, there are many laugh-out-loud moments. While O'Grady's writing does an excellent job of portraying a nave Italian migrant, his eulogising about the Australian and how to become a good one is a bit transparent.

Feldstein, with Don Cohen (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003) is a must read.Better Together tells the stories of twelve different groups: from a community organization to a church, as well as a dance group and a web site, from a union to a branch library, a Fortune 500 corporation and a neighborhood group, to name a few. The stories hold in common the building up of community, of social capital. It is the best book of general interest that I have read in more than a year.Putnam addresses a critical aspect of how we are brought together as citizens and neighbors. I cannot stress enough how highly I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Better Together: Restoring the American Community","review":"Robert Putnam dissected what might be the fraying of American community in \\"Bowling Alone\\". Here he and co-authors Lewis Feldstein and Don Cohen look at 12 examples of community.It's quite interesting to see how, for example, branch libraries became social hubs in Chicago. The vignette of CraigsList is dated only a few years later and, in any event, it is difficult to accept CraigsList as as true example of community. It may have been in its earliest days, but is certainly not now. The depiction of Portland may be a bit blindsided in that Portland's activists seem to be against anything and everything, more like Babbit's than enablers of any kind.On the whole, though, it's an interesting collection of community endeavors. Not truly a complement to \\"Bowling Alone\\", but rather a standalone effort.Jerry"},{"Title":"Better Together: Restoring the American Community","review":"I saw this book at Barnes and Noble. I only skimmed it but it does not seem as good- or as depressing- as Bowling Alone. I agree that it is a very relevant theme but I think the authors need to gather more real-world input and not just paint a rosy picture from just a couple of examples. I think that as a writer, you need to take on the hardest and most entrenched issues and then try to dig through them. When you've reached the bottom, then you start to come back up, gathering solutions to the issue and examples of what did and did not work. This book does not go deep enough and it just skips around among various topics and issues. One of the problems with sociological writing today is that it tends to really focus on the problems but not the solutions. So in that way, I feel that this book succeeds. But I guess it just seems hastily put together and in need of more research."},{"Title":"Better Together: Restoring the American Community","review":"I had hoped to really like this book, because the theme seemed so pertinent and promising. Instead, I was sadly disappointed. It was very much like watching Oprah. Lots of sunny stories about community turnaround, neatly packaged for consumption, with no individual relevance or useful guidelines for reproducing the effect elsewhere. This is not a book about getting to know your neighbors, or building bridges in your community. Whether this is a failing of the book, or just misleading marketing you can decide."},{"Title":"Better Together: Restoring the American Community","review":"Wonderful survey of various US groups that have fostered community over time, by the author of Bowling Alone. Groups range from a community dance project in New Hampshire, to student groups making changes in their Wisconsin town, to the city of Portland, a hotbed of community involvement. Some of the examples of community work better than others, with the New Hampshire dance project and the story of a Chicago branch library both being very moving on a human level. Other selections, such as an inter-faith group in Texas and the history of a union at Harvard are more academic and harder to get invested in. The ultimate message is that community can be built, but communication and some strong leaders need to be in place. One conclusion I would question is that civic community needs government involvement to work. The argument behind this conclusion is not spelled out and the book is full of examples where government was not involved, from Saddleback Church to Craigslist, both in California. We do see examples of government being part of the problem, not being response to student's desires in Wisconsin and limiting growth in Portland through green zone initiatives. Still, an interesting cross-section of community around us."},{"Title":"Better Together: Restoring the American Community","review":"Absolutely inspiring.

This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still my personal favorite. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.When I first looked over other possibilities as a basic textbook for my Classical Greek &amp; Roman Mythology course (I know, it sounds redundant and repetitive to me too), but I selected this one as my basic text (with &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; by Robert Graves to provide more details and alternative tales). Unfortunately our bookstore is convinced this book is now &quot;out of print&quot; and I had to replace it and the rest of my texts with one giant textbook with lots of photographs. It is a nice textbook, with lots of excerpts from various works to go along with the analysis, but I miss the storytelling of Hamilton. Yes, if you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list as far as I concerned. I fully admit that I am biased because I read this during my formative years and her language and rhythms are engrained in my brain)."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"The series loses a bit of speed in this installment. The story is divided between more narrators than usual, which makes it lose some of its coherence. I'm also not crazy about the sudden emphasis on religion and gods. The first 4 books gave a very human, soldierly face to fantasy, but in &quot;Dreams of Steel&quot; we suddenly get superbeings influencing the action. Not my favorite example of the series, but still worth reading."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"I am tired of The Black Company and their constant fight for \\"right\\". I never really liked the lady. She is just another bad woman turned good and Croaker is another quiet guy turned bad. The rest of the characters are boring or you dont know anything about them.We all know that the survivors of the black company will ride into the sunset with \\"the golden child\\" and Soulcatcher will be defeated. All books end that way. Why can't true evil win sometimes?Shadowmasters= Taken. Not much of a shock. Althought it would be nice to see The Black Company defeated by someone different. I love Soulcatcher. Finally someone who is evil. Unfortunately we all know what happens to evil people; they make stupid decisions and are defeated by the person with the least amount of power. The killing of the evil person is such a let down after the build up to the end.I expected more."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"Croaker is missing, so Lady takes over control of the Black Company and the narration of this book of the series. In order to rebuild the Company and the armed forces of Taglios, Lady poses as an avatar of the goddess Kina, who seems basically equivalent to the Indian Kali, who is dedicated to bringing about the Year of Skulls, which entails a lot of death and destruction.The book feels like it has more of an independent plot than the previous one, but it still leaves a lot unresolved for future books. The character of Lady is not that well developed. Having her narrate the story is not much different from having Croaker do it, and you don't get much sense of her as a very powerful, very old being. This is still a good read, but doesn't live up to the earlier parts of the series, or other similar fantasies that are out there."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"Though most of the narrative in \\"Dreams of Steel\\" is written from the viewpoint of (The) Lady and Croaker is relegated to a secondary role, I highly enjoyed it.

In fact, I found the change to be very interesting in what it reveals of Lady's personality as well as her past. My complaints with the book mostly echo the recurring ones voiced in other reviews here: the wholesale transplanting of Kali worship into it is a bit ham-handed, and the ending, though nowhere near as abrupt as in the previous book, feels rushed. One other quibble I had regards the \\"message\\" that Lady gets near the middle of the book. Since the information in that message was only ever known by a handful of people, her mere location and any thought toward motivation should have told her the author. But, regardless, as a \\"Black Company\\" book, I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"This book is crammed with info that must be taken in heed because the events that unfold within this book will haunt The Company for many years to come.

They also scheme into many things that only confuse those in Taglios and beyond.After the battle at Dejagore, Croaker is gone. Everyone is gone! The Lady finds herself amongst a battle torn field and she is feeling lost. Seeking revenge against these Shadowmasters she begins to reassemble The Black Company. What starts as a small band of brothers grows especially large in a few short months. Not only does The Lady have to deal with The Shadowmaster but also the religous and political factions that reside in Taglios. She does what must be done in order to fulfill The Company contract: meaning to finish of The Shadowmasters and continue on south to Khatovar.In the mist of her new self realization, she takes in a new band of thugs completely commited to her goals. Led by Narayan Singh, this new cult calls themselves The Stranglers/Deceivers. They only wish to please there Goddess Kina, so they decide to help in The Lady's struggle against The Shadowmaster. The Lady is haunted by dreams of carnage, death, destruction that tear her within. Whom is this Kina? Why are The Stranglers, in such dire need, helping out The Ladys cause and why does she feel she is getting stronger everyday ?Another great book, I love The Ladys perspective in this book. She is lost. So she confides in Narayan Singh and his bands of followers to do her bidding. Also we find that a new juggernaut of a character re-establish themselves waiting for the right time to strike. Not much story with the rest of The Company is told in this book, if any at all.

Naturally most other people oppose this vehemently and violently."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"spoilers may followThis book picks up right after the events in Shadow games, where we learn that once again dead isn't dead in the black company universe, with numerous Taken reappearing, including the decapitated Soulcatcher.Viewpoint is written mainly from that of the Lady, with smaller parts by secondary characters, of which Croaker is now one. Plot involves more deific mysticism than previous novels, including a death-goddess intent on using the Lady for nefarious ends.Adequate story, which he then dropped for 6 years."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"One of the recurrent themes in the Black Company series is the importance of recorded history through the eyes of the Company Annalist and throughout Croaker's books we have gotten used to his voice and his style. Lady's voice is very different, and so is her emphasis on events. The change is dramatic, sometimes romantic, occasionally bitter, and often curt. It is a mistake to compare the work to Croaker. Stylistically, Cook has captured a completely different voice and a completely different viewpoint. I think this book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"Lady, now in command of the Black Company, gets drawn into a Thuggee-like cult. Meanwhile, Croaker ends up in the company of Soulcatcher...Like the books before it, this has a refreshingly straightforward tone and plenty happens. I was frustrated by the lack of increased depth in some of the secondary characters, especially the Swan-Mather-Blade group. And I never felt I had a grasp on what was going on in Longshadow's head. Lady's POV generally works pretty well, though she's awfully slow to realize she's pregnant; the reader is hundreds of pages ahead."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"I must say I enjoyed this installment of the series a bit more than some of the other reviewers here. When I finished the very first Black Company book, I would never have imagined that there would come an installment featuring the Book of Lady. Cook blurs the lines between good and evil so well, and this book illustrates that as well as any of his others.Yes, this book does focus more on religon and gods shaping events, but that's not a bad thing. One of the themes running through the series has been that of triumphing over an opponent by understanding them; by knowing how they will react to a situation. Croaker has always been good at second-guessing his enemies. as has the Lady. And now they find themselves immersed in a culture so unlike their own, that this is not always possible. How does a religious fanatic react when you claim to be sent by their god? I found it to be a refreshing challenge for them, and an interesting one to read about.I also liked how Cook took the real-world cult of the Deceivers, and introduced a version of them into the book. Part of the attraction of this fantasy series for me has always been that there are equal parts fantasy and reality, and by including the Deceivers (you can watch the dreadful Pierce Brosnan movie if you dare) Cook again gives us a connection with our own world. I will say that yes, some of the 'surprises' aren't exactly surprises (the Lady's illness is a good example), but overall the book really works. It's more of a chess game than the military seige that some of the other books have been, but it works just as well."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"I really enjoyed every bit of Shadow Games and Dreams of Steel. And my four Favourite Characters, Croaker, Lady, One-eye and Goblin. I was very happy Cook decided to write things from Lady's point of view. I gotta agree with an earlier review, if Cook continued writing operation's like in the first few books, they would start to get boring, but what Cook has done has taken you to a different culture, which you must work you way's around. Cook has set up obstacle's which the company has never had to deal with before. Cook has set up for something very big. And I can't wait to read the next books."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"It's just not that good. Mr. Cook takes us away from the traditional focus of the Black Company books. It's no longer Croaker, Goblin, One-Eye, and the rest. Instead we're provided a view from the point of &quot;The Lady,&quot; some guy named Smoke, and other characters that we don't give a hoot about. The story has also completely diverged from the other novels, no more company business, it's about the Lady's goals and desires for power and conquest. I don't want to give much else away about the book, but most of the plot is quite obvious and not surprising.There are some other aspects of the story that bother me as well, such as the sudden introduction of gods and religion. I personally thought he was doing quite well without them. It's as if Cook wants to change his world in the middle of the story..."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"The last &quot;Book of the South&quot; is really not a conclusion at all, but a segue into the four books comprising to date &quot;The Glittering Stone.&quot; Despite arguments between earlier reviewers as to whether this book represents a departure from his earlier novels, I found this to be fairly typical Black Company fare, regardless of the introduction of Indian religion or who was keeping the Annals. Cook has previously written from multiple perspectives, and the increase here only offers the potential for a richer character development and perspective, complaints of not caring for characters other than Croaker, One-Eye and Goblin speaking more to the limitations of interest in individual readers than a desire on the part of the writer to enliven or enrich his narrative. The same might be said of the recent inclusion of Southeastern Asian mythology and religion, were Cook not so bald in his borrowings. I can think of other authors who have recently drawn from this source---Steven Erikson or more pointedly Martha Wells in &quot;Wheel of the Infinite---who have done a far better job recontextualizing their sources. But if concerns over derivatives primarily influenced our thinking, it is doubtful any of us would be reading The Black Company.There are other reasons one turns to this series---the delightful if by now typecast crew of scoundrels, the fast-paced and action-driven narrative and Cook's not to be undervalued ability at rapidly stringing us along through a sequence of events direct if relatively uncomplicated in their presentation. True, the author does mix it up with intrigue, but all the various plots stay relatively at the surface, what mystery that is present most often due to a lack of information than a true building of suspense. But for those moments when one wishes sheer, unadulterated avenues of escape guised as heroic fantasy, more often than not Cook delivers.However, in this entry Cook fails to resolve his narrative even as a credible cliffhanger. Instead he summarily and loosely ties up the various threads, even while rushing leaving most of them still dangling, and, without giving too much away, introduces certain new dramatic developments from a distance, announcing them and then simply discarding them in a couple of pages. There is a sense here that the author suddenly wished to wrap up this chapter of the saga and move on to other narrative pastures, even while leaving as well as adding things hanging. The fact that a six-year hiatus followed before the author again picked up the story reinforces this conclusion. However, this is sheer speculation. All I can say is that the end of this novel is abrupt and very dissatisfying, as much so if for different reasons as the extreme cliffhanger that concluded &quot;Shadow Games.&quot; I have come to accept that Cook plays fast and loose with his plots and characters, often resurrecting them, remining earlier storylines or conventions, or introducing elements without clear explanation or motive. Nonetheless, in the past these failings have largely been able to be submerged by the author's relative strengths in story telling and non-stop management of action. This however left me cold and questioning the author's investment in his story and audience, unavoidably raising questions as to my own continued participation.But for the conclusion, this is typical Cook fare, with all the usual rewards and weaknesses. For that reason I have given it the same marks I've given to his previous novels, in the main not seeing a substantial shift, either for better or worse, in what is being offered. However, were I to weight the ending, this book would not be the equal, nor would &quot;Shadow Games,&quot; of what has preceded. While I am not abandoning the series, the next book will need to prove to me that the author is once again committed to the Company."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"Take the other reviews of this book with a grain of salt. Yes, it's a bit slower and yes, the narrative is split between more characters, but it's written that way for a reason. 'Shadow Games' and 'Dreams of Steel' taken together are meant to be a transition between the old Company of the &quot;Books of the North&quot; trilogy and the new Company of the &quot;Glittering Stone&quot; trilogy.The Company is scattered and nearly ruined after their defeat at Dejagore, so DUH! of course it's going to take them time to get their act together. (Be glad that they pull it off in just one book.) Everyone is still alive and kicking -- Croaker, Lady, One-Eye, Goblin, Murgen, Mogaba, even a few of the Taken -- but they're all changed for the experience.And that's the whole point: things change -- including the Black Company. If you're expecting the same old same old missions and schemes from the first book, you'll be disappointed. We already know who they are and how they operate, so it's time for them to take on something new."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"I\`ve read some reviews that were less than glowing about this title. But in a series that runs through ten volumes some effort has to be expended to hold all the plot lines together. The first few times I read Tolkien's Two Towers, it was my least favorite volume of the Lord of the Rings. Because it mostly just maintianed a multitude of plot lines. Over the years, Two Towers has become my favorite. Dreams of Steel has a similar function in the Black Company series. It tells a necessary part of the story. It also demonstrates Cook's ability to develop a character. Lady may not have been the ideal analyst, but then, neither would One Eye. So Dreams of Steel is presented as the work of a less than perfect chronicler. Dreams of Steel is a great read and an important part of a great epic tale. I recommend it for any Glen Cook / Black Company fan."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"The Black Company saga continues as Lady, assuming that Croaker has died, becomes Captain of the Black Company. She assembles legions of cast-offs and wannabes and molds them into a fierce fighting force. Unfortunately, she unintentionally adds members of a mysterious murder cult to her ranks. Ultimately, they will betray her and rob her of a most precious gift.Good story and it is fun to finally have a Black Company novel told from someone else's point of view besides Croaker (the Silver Spike did this but is it really a Black Company novel?). Lady tells the story and author Glen Cook does an excellent job of distinguishing her from Croaker.Be warned: The murder cult portrayed in this novel will give you nightmares. It did me.Tired of Tolkien-esque epic fantasy? Does it all read the same after awhile? Try Glen Cook and the Black Comapny novels. Good stuff. Dark fantasy told from the soldiers' point of view. The first one in the series is titled the Black Company. Shadows Linger is second followed by the White Rose, the Silver Spike (even though this one doesn't deal with the Black Company directly), Shadow Games and then Dream of Steel. Bleak Seasons, She is the Darkness, Water Sleeps and Soldiers Live finish off the series--so far."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"Glen Cook's fifth Black Company novel, Dreams of Steel, is a nice change-up from his previous novels. If you haven't read those previous novels, check out the Black Company (or the omnibus the Chronicles of the Black Company, which contains the first trilogy). You don't really need to read those first to appreciate Dreams of Steel and its predecessor in the Books of the South set, but it certainly helps.The biggest difference is that we have a change in narrators, adding some much needed variety to the series. We do get some chapters from Croaker's point of view, but the majority of the book is told from the perspective of the Lady who, for reasons I won't give away, has taken over the role as Company annalist. As much as I have enjoyed Croaker's narrative (indeed, Croaker has become one of my favorite literary characters), the Lady adds a much needed perspective to the story.Speaking of the story, the novel is a continuation of its predecessor, Shadow Games. The Black Company has been hired to fight a war against a bunch of strange, unknown sorcerers called the Shadow Masters. The plot isn't as gripping as that of the original trilogy, which featured a great spin on the standard evil empire fantasy fare. Aside from the somewhat dull story, Dreams of Steel also suffers from the lack of a conclusion. Although this is the last book in the Books of the South series, Dreams of Steel lacks a real ending. The characters and basically left in limbo, the plot undecided. Although the plot will certainly continue with the next book in the series, it's hard to get excited when the conclusion of a mini-series is completely inconclusive.That being said, a lot of the strengths of the Black Company series return here. Mr. Cook is a very good writer. He isn't as verbose as a Martin or an Erickson, particularly since he writes from a first person perspective. But when Cook wants to, he can turn some beautiful phrases. Because he doesn't try to turn every paragraph into an epic, the effect is much more pronounced when Cook does go for eloquence. His dialogue is as strong as it has been in previous novels.The characters remain some of the most interesting ones in the fantasy genre. It's hard not to care about the members of the Black Company. And, as I mentioned before, the addition of the Lady as the major narrator really adds some excitement to the novel. Cook's world is a cold, hard one. There are magical creatures, but they aren't your typical elves, orcs, unicorns, etc. They're strange, unique and fascinating. And these are not \\"good\\" people. The Black Company are not your typical heroes. They're mercenaries. Murderers, thieves, some are even rapists. For those of us who are tired of the great prophecy, the young, honest, goodhearted hero, and the great quest to stop the evil of the world, well, this is your series.I'd give this a 3.5 if I could. The plot trails off at the end. The magic of the series is wearing off a little. Cook added some variety with the Lady's narrative, but the series is going to need something more in the future. I certainly hope Cook manages it."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"After four volumes in which she has played a major, is somewhat silent, part the inevitable has occurred. With Croaker missing in action after the disastrous battle for Degajore and presumed dead, Lady has taken over. Welcome to Dreams of Steel -- Lady's own book. Once a cruel empress and once of the most powerful wizards of the north she is the now leader of that part of the Black Company that did not get trapped in the city. It is up to her to rally and bring the battle back to the shadowmasters.Just as important as the struggle for Degajore is the introduction of several new characters. In fact, a whole sect of new characters -- the Stranglers, who are more than a little reminiscent of the thuggee. Instead of Kali their goddess is called Kina, but she is just as many-armed and malevolent as her equivalent in this world. Somewhere she sleeps while her followers dedicate their kills to her and work to bring about the Year of Skulls. Now one of the leaders of this sect, Narayan Singh, has attached himself to Lady. She sees an opportunity to use Kina's followers to further the goals of the Black Company regardless of whether the Stranglers might have an agenda of their own.Nothing in this volume is as it seems. The story picks up some twists that are unusual, even for a Cook novel. Enough to keep the story interesting and convolute. Followers of the series will actually find little difference between Lady as narrator and Croaker. Her established character isn't one that would come naturally to being an annalist, so Cook defaults to his regular style. The result is that this volume works as well as its predecessors and has none of the weaknesses of the next few narrators. I found the book enjoyable, although the end is a little chaotic and sudden."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"Love the Black Company, plain and simple. If you're going to read one, you've got to read them all and in order. If you haven't read the books prior to this one in the series, you need to. And if those don't convince you to read the entire series, there is nothing I can say in this review that will."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"The Black Company series is a great read and all if the novel in the series are well worth taking the time to read."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"The Black Company and its Taglian allies have fought a great battle against the Shadowmasters at Dejagore. Whilst much of the Shadowmaster army was destroyed, the allies also suffered grievous losses and most of their army was forced to retreat into the city, where it now stands siege. Trapped outside and with Croaker missing, Lady is forced to assume command of the routed Taglian forces, attempt to regroup them and forge a new army strong enough to relieve Dejagore, but finds that politics and religious machinations amongst her own troops are as much a threat as the plotting of the enemy.Dreams of Steel marks a notable change in the Black Company books. For the first time, Croaker is dropped as the primary POV in favour of Lady, who now serves as the main POV character, narrator and 'annalist', recording events for posterity. This shift in structure and approach is successful, with Cook employing a character who is far less prone to moralising than Croaker (it serves to remember that Lady was, more or less, the main bad guy in the original trilogy, and has only repented up to a point) and is still fully capable of using incredibly ruthless and bloody means to achieve her goals.The book adopts a multi-pronged approach to the plot, with Cook alternating between Lady's endeavours, the situation with the Shadowmasters (who are, refreshingly, a foe of limited resources who themselves are in a bady way following the events of the previous novel), political events in the Taglian capital and the emergence of a third faction who delights in playing everyone off against each other whilst they sneak around in the background. This approach is successful in getting across the full weight of the story but also serves to slow the pace down. Compared to the first four books, which covered thousands of miles, numerous battles and some interesting character and plot developments in relatively modest page counts, not a huge amount actually happens in this book. For the first time, it feels that Cook is falling prey to the curse of the long epic fantasy series, namely the slowing of the pace and the easing off the throttle for more introspective books that may be interesting, but not as energetic as earlier books in the series.Cook is enough of a good writer to overcome this problem with some solid battle scenes, an amusingly straightforward answer to politicking and some interesting characterisation, particularly of Lady as she realises how she has been changed by her time with the Black Company. However, returning readers may start to feel a little wearied when, once again, an old enemy assumed dead books ago unexpectedly returns to play a role in events.Dreams of Steel (***) is an enjoyable novel, but the shine of the Black Company series is starting to wear off at this point, with the first signs of it falling prey to some of the limitations of the subgenre. The novel is available now in the UK and USA as part of the Books of the South omnibus."},{"Title":"Dreams of Steel (The Fifth Chronicle of the Black Company)","review":"If you are a fan of Glen Cook and the Black Company you will find this book a bit different than most of those which have come before. With the exception of the Silver Spike, Cook's protagonist Croaker has been the POV (by and large). In this edition, it's Lady who does most of the talking. I enjoyed a chance to learn more about this fascinating character and found that the writing took a much different direction and had a different pace than most of the other Black Company novels.The end is another cliff-hanger and the book is definitely not to be read out of sequence. If you are looking for a stand-alone, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Portugus Contemporneo I (Portugues Contemporaneo I) (Portuguese Edition)","review":"I used this text to teach myself Brazilian Portuguese while I was living in Germany. Every day I would play the cassettes in my car while commuting to and from work. The result: when I arrived in Brazil, I could already speak the language well enough to land a well-paying job.Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, this is a fabulous text for self-study. Of course, you must have the cassette tapes or a digital sound version. But is anyone so foolish as to believe that it is possible to learn to speak a modern language without many hours of practicing audio exercises?The first lesson focuses on teaching you the sounds and intonation patterns of spoken Brazilian Portuguese. It is a bit arduous, because this lesson does not concern itself with meaning or grammar at all, and the student will naturally want to know something about those aspects of the sentences (s)he is repeating. But actually, focusing on the production of the sounds at the beginning is the right thing to do, because if you don't focus on it, you will form bad pronunciation habits that are extremely difficult to correct later.Each lesson contains many pattern drills that help you over-learn the grammar and sentence patterns of Brazilian Portuguese. You must over-learn these aspects, because when you have to speak, you don't have time to reflect analytically on them: speaking right must be second nature.The text takes a more linguistics-oriented approach than do many casual texts that purport to teach foreign languages. The text's pronunciation exercises drive home the differences between phonemes. In its pronunciation exercises, the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) is used. (If you have never heard of phonemes or the IPA, look them up on Wikipedia.)Once you start working with this text and its audio recordings, you will want to buy volume 2. If Amazon doesn't have it for sale, you can locate it with a search on Google.The only downside to this text is that the pictures were taken in the 1960s, so they, and some of the dialogs, sometimes portray aspects of Brazilian society that are no longer \\"contemporaneous\\" with today, despite the book's title.Naturally, this text should not be used for self-study of *Continental* Portuguese, that is, the language of Portugal. Although the two dialects are 95% the same in writing, the pronunciation is quite different."},{"Title":"Portugus Contemporneo I (Portugues Contemporaneo I) (Portuguese Edition)","review":"This book is a standard audio-lingual introduction to Brazilian Portuguese. In the audio-lingual approach to language learning, students memorize dialogs and repeat oral exercises endlessly. Through these practices, they develop a fairly accurate spoken fluency relatively quickly (as long as they stick to the topics and structures that they have learned.) Students who use the audio-lingual approach generally end up with relatively good pronunciation and excellent intonation compared with students from other approaches. This approach isn't for everyone, and there's a lot of controversy in the language teaching field about whether it works for real language acquisition at all. In any case, in using this book under the guidance of a skilled teacher, I along with the other ten students in my class, was able to develop basic conversation skills in Portuguese in just one semester.Each chapter begins with a dialog in Portuguese that is to be memorized, followed immediately by the translation of the dialog in English. Then come cultural notes related to the dialog, and pronunciation practice. This is followed by the grammar point for the chapter. And then the endless mechanical substitution drills to be done orally, and many times over ad nauseum. Early vocabulary tends to stick to common words and student needs, while the cultural notes introduce many interesting aspects of Brazilian culture.Because this is an audio-lingual text, it would be very difficult to use it successfully for independent study. At the least, you would need to get copies of the corresponding tapes, but it would be hard to get the requisite practice that is needed for the audio-lingual approach to work without a teacher. On the other hand, if you're just interested in gaining a reading knowledge of Portuguese, this book might prove satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Best Websites for Business Appraisers, Accountants, and Financial Professionals","review":"I was skeptical that another book could be different than any other on this same subject, but was I wrong - this is a &quot;must-read&quot; book for any financial professional, accountant, CPA and appraisal expert who conducts online research and looks for in-depth information.

Democracy for Dewey was both a means and an end to the building of a good and just society. In this regard he sought to develop strategies and methods for training students through learning and discipline to become socially responsible adults and conscientious citizens concerned with the rights of others and the common good and to be equipped with the knowledge and technical skills to be productive members of society in the context of our modern industrial world. Dewey is truly a giant not only of modern educational theory but of progressive humanitarian thought generally. Those who disparage him in a knee jerk fashion out of a misguided effort to trash the &quot;liberal establishment,&quot; like the Intercollegiate Scholastic Insititute (ISI) which named &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; as one of the five worst books of the 20th Century, have radically misconstrued Dewey's views which merit serious study and application in practice. Dewey was truly one of the great Americans of the last century of which all people of good will can be proud."},{"Title":"Democracy and education;: An introduction to the philosophy of education, (Text-book series)","review":"Fantastic; a book I would recommend to just about anyone. To address some of the critics mentioned in the other reviews: RE: \\"Dewey Dogma\\" (1) There is absolutely no pretense of an application of the scientific method, hence there can be no mis-application; (2) This book strikes me personally as one of the least dogmatic things I've ever read in my life. The ideas are fresh, original, and beautiful crafted and ordered; (3) \\"Education is Socialization\\" - an equation of broadly construed \\"-tions\\" that results in a statement that one can neither agree nor disagree with.I could be wrong, but nowhere did I read these ideas as explicit recommendations to be implemented, rather I read this book as a general exploration of educational aims and processes. Dewey (justifiably in my opinion) explores closely connected concepts which I imagine are left out of other educational texts, which is why some with pre-professional backgrounds in education count the length and depth of this book as a negative.His writing, in my opinion, is clear and concise (at least in comparison with other great philosophers) - writing that I would personally aspire to. His ideas, and I can't say this enough, are some of the most original I've come across. We didn't really cover the pragmatists in any of my philosophy classes. Reading this makes me wish we had."},{"Title":"Democracy and education;: An introduction to the philosophy of education, (Text-book series)","review":"Perhaps the fact that this great work receives so little attention is indicative of what ails education: educators focus their attention on all the latest drivel concerning education while only paying lip service to Dewey, who remains the highest-ranking educational philosopher. It pains me to hear and read bungling educators mindlessly parrot Dewey's catch phrases (e.g., &quot;learning by doing&quot;) while pushing educational doctrines completely antithetical to Dewey's ideas. Dewey had it right, but is grossly misunderstood by the bozos who vapidly regurgitate his words and phrases.

This is not merely a book about education, but rather a complete philosophy of education which, of necessity, is a philosophy of individual life in the social world. Like any good philosopher, Dewey builds his argument brick by brick, each brick resting squarely on the bricks beneath it. One cannot fully comprehend and appreciate the entire structure until one has examined each brick in the composition and the logical relationship among the bricks. By necessity, a brief review of a work such as this will leave out many bricks and breeze over the connections from brick to brick. Any inaccuracies thus resulting are my own and not Dewey's failure to construct a solid argument.To the extent this book can be summed up, the overriding theme is that much confusion and debate regarding education (and, indeed, much of life), stem from false dualisms, such as the dichotomy between thinking and doing, mind and body, individual and society. Once we recognize that those dualisms are in fact simply interacting forces which shape individual experience and development, the aims, role, materials and methods of education become almost self-evident.Dewey begins his argument with an exploration of early childhood. From earliest days, all learning is experience, and all experience is learning. The infant must learn how to control his body simply by moving his body and adjusting to the reactions and feedback thereto. Such reactions inform future movements and so on, in an on-going interchange of influences which eventually lead to the mastery of skills such as sitting up, standing and walking, which are just as much mental feats as they are physical. Similarly, speech is learned through the interaction of the infant's own natural noises and the sounds she hears in her environment, particularly the sounds reflected back to her by other people. Hence, the infant is part of a social world from day one, and, like the material world, she both shapes and is shaped by such social world.By nature, humans are endowed with interests and aptitudes which draw them to certain experiences and stimuli which, if properly guided and allowed to progress naturally, result in each individual developing and contributing in rich, organic and meaningful ways in his or her unique capacity. But because of our false dichotomy between thinking and doing, we tend to isolate education either toward focusing on tasks and occupations or toward thinking, reasoning and \\"cultural\\" pursuits. This leads to a multi-tiered society in which the majority are consigned to labor at tasks considered menial and bereft of culture, while the \\"superior\\" class of people lead an idle life - supported by the laboring class - devoted to preserving the intellectual and cultural life. But because this intellectual life is disconnected from meaningful activity, it too is dry and devoid of rich experience. Hence, the upper classes and lower classes both suffer from such divisions, even if the upper classes are not fully aware of or able to grasp the cause of their affliction.Furthermore, while this split can work in a hierarchical, feudal society, it is incompatible with the ideals of democracy, in which each individual should be contributing his or her unique talents and interests toward his or her own development and the governance and progress of the whole. In a dualistic society where the majority of individuals are cut off from a true connection with the meaning and results of their occupations, there will naturally be many who can/will not contribute and instead will be a drain.Contrary to the frequent misunderstanding of progressive educational theory, Dewey does not advocate doing away with formal instruction or letting children simply do what they like. It's not that easy. It's a matter of structuring the educational environment so that students have experiences that relate to their prior experiences and to their experiences and interests outside the classroom and which spark new interests and associations. Through rich exposure, students are guided to explore and develop meaningful understanding which preserves the connections between thinking and doing and which cuts across and integrates material from various disciplines into a holistic understanding. You can't simply stuff a bunch of disconnected facts (what we commonly view as \\"knowledge\\" - the accumulated repository of past, settled experience) into a child's head and expect it to spark interest or pursuit. Rather, you start with the pursuit of relevant experience and the facts and knowledge will follow. As students integrate their own experience, they will want to know - and be in a position to understand - other people's related experience. Without such integration, there is no framework for such \\"knowledge\\".Furthermore, you can't teach \\"morals\\" as a distinct set of facts, rules or thoughts. Doing so implies a superior class which dictates to a lower class. Such dictates and morals only \\"stick\\" to the extent they are externally enforced because they are not truly part of the individual's self. Morals, like all other knowledge, must be learned through experience in the normal social environment. Again, the social environment must be structured to lead to desired behavior and understanding through experiencing consequences in a democratic environment.Sadly, our society seems to be turning ever further away from Dewey's ideals of full individual contribution in democratic life. At younger and younger ages, we are trying to stuff students full of facts and knowledge isolated from their relevant experience so that they can regurgitate this material on standardized tests which benefit not the child, but the adults enforcing such tests. This leads to students perceiving education as largely a dry and meaningless exercise to perform for the benefit of pleasing adults rather than for any intrinsic benefit. Furthermore, morals or \\"character\\" are being drilled into students as a collection of catch phrases of the \\"work hard, be nice\\" variety. Students are expected to comply unquestioningly with almost arbitrary rules regarding the minutiae of behavior, speech and dress with little understanding of the whys and wherefores of such requirements. These students are not being raised to be independently thinking members of a democratic society, but rather a compliant workforce for the world's corporate conglomerations. Interestingly, the heads of these conglomerations and governments tend to send their own kids to progressively oriented schools based on Dewey's theories. Again, we are cultivating a ruling class atop a laboring class, which is the antithesis of democracy.One jarring aspect of Dewey's writing to modern readers may be his descriptions and understanding of \\"primitive\\" or \\"savage\\" peoples. Such thinking is a product of Dewey's time when little thought was given to the different perspectives and paradigms of indigenous peoples and how such differences mask complexities in seemingly \\"simple\\" societies. However, even in the modern world, we still seem unable to bridge cultural gaps, and we still reduce societies alien to our own to simple caricatures. Every terrorist attack or outbreak of gang violence is simply evidence that \\"they\\" don't think or care about life the way \\"we\\" do. The possibility that their \\"savage\\" behavior might have something to do with our own relationship with them rarely occurs to us.This book is one of the seminal texts of modern thought and the \\"American Dream\\". It is not only a book on education (although it is that and should be required reading for every educator), but also a treatise on the roles and responsibilities of individuals in a democratic society and how best to prepare individuals to take on those roles and responsibilities. We have steadily - and silently - been losing our democracy over the past several decades as our public interests are sold off to private, moneyed interests which have profit, rather than societal benefit, as their motive. The fabric of our shared social interests is being rent, and individuals are being set against each other in pursuit of individual interests. But, as Dewey demonstrates, there aren't really individual interests separate from social interests. We are all intrinsically and inseparably related and dependent on each other. When we destroy social interests, we destroy the protections that allow our individual interests to flourish. We must realize our fundamental relatedness before we allow ourselves to be destroyed."},{"Title":"Democracy and education;: An introduction to the philosophy of education, (Text-book series)","review":"This edition of the book is unreadable.

Dewey as a writer might sometimes make us feel like kindergartners being lectured on mostly what we already know, but that's our fault, not necessarily his. His patience in building complex concepts from the actual basics is unparallelled, but he depends on the reader to retain in mind the outlines, to sort the key ideas from the supporting arguments, and to sketch the diagrams: for better or worse, there are no math-like formulae here. But his sense of those real basics--the respect he pays to everyday experience itself, that Cinderella stepchild of modern philosophy, is worth the effort it takes to follow him out. On the other hand, the book does get more relevant to our understanding of both education and democracy as Dewey proceeds, so again, patience is rewarded.

Despite my problems with this book, I have to say, that Dewey was WAY ahead of his time, in my opinion! Most of his theories are relevant today, and as such, I can only imagine the reaction he received in the early 1900's. Unfortunately, this book is not easy to read. It feels much too technical in both language and philosophy. For a student just entering an Educational major program, I think it would be great! However, at this stage, the theories were repetitious to me. I had difficulty remaining focused as I read it. One point to emphasize: we Never stop learning!

The book was very long and sometimes boring, but oveall I enjoyed it. I recommend this book to anyone who plan going to get any kind of master's degree or doctoral degree in education. I liked the book because it shows how education is still doing the same thing it has been doing for years. It suggests techniques like inquiry learning and cooperative learning. These things are very vital in an educational system. This book displays all these characterisitcs.

This text purports to offer expert advice on letters, proposals, presentations, and more. It does deliver average tried and true tricks but whether this advice is \\"expert\\" is debatable. The information on writing memos and letters provides generally useful advice about white space, headings, and using simpler words.But the advice provided on more in-depth issues, such as cutting the length of sentences, is limited. For instance, to cut the length of sentences, one is to look for compound sentences (find the conjunctions), and break the sentences into components. More useful advice about collapsing ideas into dependent clauses or eliminating redundancy is not discussed in detail or illustrated.The advice about using a variety of fonts and boxes could cause inexperienced writers to go astray and litter documents with visual clutter that will distract from the message. Worse is the lack of any real solid advice on using graphs and charts. The examples are cluttered and offer some of the worst elements of visual design such as hard-to-follow legends, pie charts that consume paper and ink but yield little information, and a hopelessly confusing figure. A suggestion to use \\"a strategically placed red bar\\" runs counter to business etiquette of remembering that quite a few people suffer from some degree of color blindness.One of the better parts of the book, Enlightening Letters, does provide easy to adapt examples of simple business letters intended to help solve simple problems. Likewise the chapters on proposals and reports will help the neophyte up to a point.Still, there is enough OK advice scattered through the book to make it a useful low-level introduction to business writing. Keep in mind that all corporate cultures vary, too, and assessing what is acceptable in your workplace will still be essential. My advice is to keep this book in your desk drawer when needed or read it at home. You'll learn more by examining the work of the seasoned pros down the hall and picking their brains over lunch (and consider picking up the tab)."},{"Title":"Business Writing for Dummies","review":"In writing this dummy's guide to business writing, the author has given us readers the verbal tools with which to build our careers with confidence and competence.

I think that it takes a very special talent to write a historical journal and this author didn't have it. With a journal you are suppose to write your personal feelings and thoughts. But this author never really wrote Catherine's feelings, which misses a big opportunity to relate to the character. Also with journals normally that have one big problem and then small every day problems. The one big problem is resolved at the end of the book and the small problems are resolved in about a week. A Gathering of Days didn't have every day problems and had three some what big problems that were never drawn out. It is a quick read and great if you are doing a lot of research on that time period with other books.

The whole book consists of Catherine's journal entries about her happy, sad, and eventful life as a young child growing up in England in the 1800's. The journal was given to her by her grandmother, which later Catherine passed down to her granddaughter. Catherine experiences many difficult times as a child. At the beginning of the book, Catherine's mother dies leaving her with her father and siblings. Later in the story her dad remarries and Catherine has to get used to living with a new brother and step mom. Her step mom teaches her many new things though that she never would have known, like quilting.The whole narrative is told from Catherine's point of view. She describes through her journal her feelings and emotions that she is going through as a child growing up. The story is realistic in such a way that young girls or even children can connect with Catherine as they may be facing the same situations that she does. By reading her journal, children can also see what is was like to grow up in England and compare it to their lives. The author does an acceptable job of describing the characters so the reader is able to visualize them in their head. The story though is a bit confusing because it is written like it was back in the 1800's.The overall story was okay. It was realistic in such a way because the reader could see what it was like growing up in England in the 1800's. The reader could also connect with the main character as she describes her feelings and emotions."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring:1. Added more suspenseful climaxes2. Taken out unimportant information3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"Catherne writes her diary from 1830 to 1832. She faces many challenges, such as growing up without a mother and losing a dear friend. Catherine can't find her school book. She looks for it everywhere. When she finds the book there is a call for help from a phantom, runnaway slave. Will she help? I didn't like this book very much. The text is a little &quot;old fashioned&quot; and the events are pretty boring. It started out with good suspense, but it lost my interest pretty fast. It is an actionless book. So that's why I rated it low."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"I did not enjoy reading the book, A Gathering of Days. The entire book uses odd phrasology that detracts from the overall effect of the story. The word choices throughout the book make it very difficult to read and understand. The story is fine in and of itself but I was unable to enjoy the story because of the heavy word usage and poor sentence structures."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"it says ages 8-12 and im 14 and i dint get half of the things they were saying!! i had to ask my mom every time what sumthin meant. but i had to read it cuz it was for a report. dont read it just for fun, cuz it wont be!! trust me!"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"This story centers around Catherine Hall, a thirteen-year-old young girl growing up in New Hampshire. The journal format of this novel makes it easy to read and wonderful to share with school age students. Catherine is a tender girl that has lost her mother and must gain instruction on housekeeping skills from her neighbor who is her best friend's mother. Because of the loss of their mother, Catherine keeps house for her father and younger sister, Matty. The main happenings of Catherine's exciting year are that her father remarries and brings a new stepmother and stepbrother to come and live with them, interesting events at school, the issue of slavery and runaway slaves, and a loss and new love interests close to home. One of the most interesting parts of the story is when Catherine encounters a &quot;phantom&quot; of sorts that she aids along his travels. The correspondence of Catherine to future generations is an interesting beginning and end to the book. This is a highly praised and decorated book from the Newberry Medal, School Library Journal's Best Books of the Year for 1979 to the appointment of an American Library Association Notable Children's book. I would highly recommend this book for any read aloud in an age appropriate setting or as a trade book integrated in a social studies curriculum on the time period."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"What a wonderful work of historical fiction! The time period (1830-32) was very well researched, thus, there will be some words, phrases, etc.. that are not so familiar to us. They lived and spoke quite differently in the 19th century and the author does an excellent job of giving it an authentic feel, while still allowing today's reader to follow along. The book begins with young Cassie Hall,in her early teens, describing daily life for herself, her father, and little sister after the untimely death of her mother. The whole of the book is comprised of Cassie's individual journal entries. From these entries the reader gets a glimpse of what New England life was like from the weather, the schoolhouse, politics, and death. I particularly enjoyed Cassie's description of the laborious process of making a quilt. I recommend this book for those families that value high moral standard and traditional values. It is an excellent supplement to a homeschool history curriculum of this time period."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"This modest book is written in the form of a journal by a fourteen-year-old girl named Catherine Hill. For some 18 months she records the daily events and personal feelings of life in New England. She shares her fears and disappointments, her sorrows and small triumphs of spirit with modern readers. The author bravely discusses serious moral and social issues--as seen through the eyes of a young girl: the Underground Railroad (slavery debate), school discipline (perhaps the origin of Zero tolerance and Corporal Punishment), the pain and humiliation of step-parenting (blended families were quite common even then), and women's domestic roles (we've come a long way, baby!)Catherine's life is not as peaceful as we might think on that pioneer farm in New Hampshire. Who is this mysterious Phantom and how does he affect her life and behavior? How will she survive emotionally her father's remarriage? Or the loss of a dear friend? This is a thoughtful book which quietly discloses the budding woman she will become. Catherine's coming-of-age story is woven as gently and firmly as Yankee homespun--with the warp of historical integrity and the woof of Blos' ancestral compassion. A good introduction to early 19th century Americana, which may not fascinate high spirited youngsters of the 90's. But that is their loss, since the heroine's feelings are remarkably like our own."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"This book is made up of the journal entries of Catherine Cabot Hall, a 13-year-old, growing up in colonial days of New Hampshire. Life is hard for Catherine, since her mother died, she must take of the house and her younger sister, Matty. During the book, her father remarries and brings in a stepbrother to live with and she must deal with a death of a close friend. For any one who enjoys historical fiction, particularly of early America, this is a wonderful addition to a collection. Catherine is a likable character and the story contains many details of pioneer life. Because the book maybe hard to understand for younger readers, due to different words and language structure, it should be saved for those mature enough to understand, so as to appreciate it for what it is worth. Highly recommend- to adults too!!"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"\\"A Gathering of Days\\", which tells the story of Catherine Hall, a girl growing up in 1830s New Hampshire, tries hard to make an impact. It really does. However, it just comes up a bit short. The language is quite difficult, and sometimes exaggeratedly old-fashioned. It is also done in journal style. As a result, it is often hard to find the true storyline. In addition, it is not by any means the most exciting book I have ever read. I understand that it is supposed to be low-key and serious, but this is one area where it overachieves its purpose. Many people will say that since I am a male teenager, I missed some of the subtleties and meaning that a girl might have picked up. Well, I first read this book as an assignment in fifth grade, and very few people in my class (in an educationally strong private school) enjoyed it, regardless of gender. Some may still argue that I was too young to appreciate it then. I have also read it since then, hoping that a change in perspective that comes with a different age would give me a different take on it. Sadly, I had the same feelings the second time around. In conclusion, the story has potential, but it is just not carried out right and doesn't provide any \\"hook\\" to catch the reader's interest."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"The book I read was A Gathering of Days. It's about a girl named Catherine Cabot Hall. She writes in her journal about life problems and weather. Some life problems are: her best friend dying, her dad getting remarried, and going to summer school. The weather is either rain, sunshine, snow, cold, or hot. She lives in a small town in New Hampshire. She lives with her dad, her sister, her stepmom and stepbrother. It's just like a real journal. It has the date on top and what happened that day. When it's Sunday she puts the Sabbath Day.I would give this book four out of five stars because she jumps to different things that are happening. This book has such great characters. Some of the characters are Catherine, Mary Martha, Cassie, her dad, and Cassie's brothers, Asa and Jim. If something happens Catherine will explain it, like who did it, when it happened, and where it happened. The word choice in this book is great. They use words like rendezvous, parched, zeal, procrastinate and commendable. In the beginning of the book they explain who received the journal. I would recommend this book to people who like journals. My opinion is reading a journal makes me understand what happening more.Brooke HaszMadison, WI"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"This is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read. I am an avid reader of juvenile fiction and I rarely find a book that would match the quality of this one. It is very well written and the author really gets you into the story. It is set in New England and is about the changes Catherine must cope with. It is a book about changes, growing up, and important decisions. The author makes it easy to identify with the characters and the book is also very moving. It is a book that I would read again."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"I love history, especially the 1800s. I've always enjoyed non-fiction more than fiction, but I do enjoy reading historical fiction. This is one of my favorite books along with The Witch of Blackbird Pond. I read both books as a pre-teen and have never had a problem understanding the vocabulary. As far as whether the vocabulary is too difficult, people need to expand their vocabularies. I think for those who love history, have a good vocabulary from being well-educated and well-read, and who are willing to use a dictionary, I don't think this book should be a problem. Also, this book is about life in the early 19th century in a New England town. For kids who grow up watching lots of fast-paced, action-filled shows, movies, etc., this book may not be appealing. But, I have always enjoyed it and have read it several times over the years. (Pardon me getting on my soap-box.) By the way, I am a teacher also."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"I thought that this book was very good. I understood the language pretty well, and the story was excellent.

This is probably the most difficult teen lit book I've ever encountered. The language was so stilted, trying (overtrying really) to sound like \\"old-fashioned\\" diction. While the story was passable, I found the language to be a major impediment (and I'm an English major, used to the likes of Shakespeare and Milton). I can't imagine any of my students getting out of this book what is actually in it. Unfortunately because of its brief length, well-spaced print and short chapters, I'm afraid my struggling readers will be drawn to it thinking it easy. As a result I'm taking it off my choice book shelf. I can't imagine what the people who set reading level, or who award the Newberry Medal were thinking."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"Written in the form of a journal, this book is the story of a year in the life of a fourteen year old girl living in New England in the early 1830's.

This is the most stupid book, and I pity anyone who has to read it!"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"I apologize to the writer if I am insulting that person, or anybody else by writing this review. But I just did not enjoy this book. I am not fond of historical fiction, but we had to read it in the fourth grade as a class and no one could understand a word that came out of a character's mouth. Every time the narrator said one thing, she really meant another. Nobody liked it very much. At one point, we really wished we had an Englishman who could translate for us!Okay. Perhaps fans of historical fiction (who are able to grasp the characters' old-fashioned vocabularies) would enjoy this, but let me just say that, for the record, this would be a horrible way to encourage older children or reluctant readers to keep reading, or interest them in literature. You may not even want to purchase this right away for fans of historical fiction unless you are sure that they would enjoy this book in spite of the old-fashioned terminology, which is really difficult to decipher. Purchasing it could turn out to be a waste of money unless you are absolutely positive that it is going to somebody who will enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"This book sets out to show an individual girl's response to life in the early United States. The author has taken care to use language as it would have been used and to show all aspects of her life from her family, to her education, to news of happenings in the broader country.The main character is a product of her time and upbringing but she is accessible to a modern reader. She shows her heart and struggles in her journal. I enjoyed getting to know her and felt the conclusion was very satisfying."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"Quaint period provincialisms, first person diary entries, and a reverent tone though not expressly Christian, all adorn Blos's A Gathering of Days. Set in rural New England in the 1830's this book provides a vision of an unrepresented era of national history, America in her adolescence. The author dedicated sincere scholarship to this work, thus the reader encounters the rather complex realities of a rustic farm. Fugative slaves, fatal pregnancies, and childhood illness play an expected part, but I was equally moved by scenes of the gueling heat and frigid winters in a period prior to electronic climate controlled homes, the staggering amount of time spent to food procurement and preservation, and the strict Sabbath observances. Additionally, I was reminded that single parent homes, step-parents, and family dynamic tensions are not the modern novelty that I often assume. All of this is more enjoyable and touching because it is composed as an adolescent girl's journal.I recommend this book for any child over ten and any adult interested in reading about a time when people were still naming children after Revolutionary War heroes. I do not think that this would be an ideal read aloud story due to the diary format. As a classroom book, I would not preference it because it is rather feminine, though I do think that boys could enjoy it somewhat. Certainly considering gathering this book into your collection."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"On Sunday, Oct. 17, 1830, Catherine Cabot Hall, aged 13 years, 6 months, 29 days, receives a journal from her father which she keeps for the next year and five months. Catherine lives on a farm at Meredith, NH, with her father Charles and seven-year-old sister Mary Martha, known as Matty. The girls' mother Hannah had died some four years before along with their baby brother Nathaniel. Catherine's best friend is Cassie Shipman, who lives on a farm just to the south with her parents and three brothers David, Asa, and little Willie. The book actually begins with a letter dated Nov. 20, 1899, and sent by Catherine Hall Onesti, now living in Providence, RI, to her namesake great-granddaughter on her fourteenth birthday accompanying the journal as a present.The journal records the daily lives and special events of Cassie, her family, and friends, such as going to school, attending church services, cooking the food which is Catherine's job following the death of her mother, celebrating holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and other such activities. Catherine sees what appears to be a phantom in the woods and later, after losing her copybook outside, finds it again with the message \\"PLEEZ MISS TAKE PITTY I AM COLD.\\" So she and Cassie secretly leave one of the old quilts that Catherine's mother had made for this person. Was it an apprentice who had run away, or perhaps an escaped slave? Also Catherine's father comes back from getting supplies in Boston, MA, with a new wife and her son Daniel. How will Catherine get along with her step-mother and step-brother? Then Cassie becomes seriously ill. What will happen to her? Also Cassie's Aunt Lucy arrives for an extended visit and catches the eye of the local teacher, Mr. Edward Holt. After they eventually marry and move to Exeter, they want Catherine to come stay with them to help take care of their new baby. What will Catherine do?In one of her final entries, Catherine says, \\"This year, more than others, has been a lengthy gathering of days, wherein we lived, we loved, were moved; learned how to accept.\\" The book then ends with another letter that Catherine sends to her great-granddaughter dated Dec. 9, 1899, evidently in response to a thank-you note with some questions, in which she ties up a few loose ends. Some people might find the diary-method of telling a story to be boring, but I found A Gathering of Days to be a fascinating account of New England life in the early 1800s, telling both the hardships of pioneer life and its many joys, accurately yet touchingly. The vocabulary, spelling and syntax are old-style and may present difficulties for a few children, but most youngsters, including homeschoolers, should have no problem with them. This very readable book which has nothing objectionable won the Newbery Medal in 1980."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"This book was pretty boring.

I only read this because it was part of my class project."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book gets better as the reader gets older. I read this in grade school (15 years ago!) and never liked it much, but now it's a whole lot better. It's not a fast-paced, super exciting book, but life in the 1830s on a farm wasn't exactly fast-paced either. When Catherine writes that the family was snowed in and she knitted all afternoon, that's exactly what happened. It's not exciting but life can't always be a thrill a minute. I thought the language was appropriate for the times, and the depiction of relationships was appealing. The small pleasures of life are recorded, and the problems of life also weave their way through the journal.If you hated it when you were young, try it again when you are through high school."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"The title is A Gathering Of Days A New England Girls Journal.

Then she looses her folder and when she finds it, she has to figure out who left the mysterious message written on it. It could be anybody but of all things, she believes it's a phantom.

The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me."},{"Title":"Preferred Risk","review":"Last week I read this novel in its original serial format.

Vitally important, they are also frustratingly ineffective. Like the old story of the blind men and the elephant, meetings are usually more of a political contest among competing pet ideas than a cooperative effort among people with differing perspectives and relevant information.The usual diagnosis of this situation is that it's a &quot;people problem.&quot; Thus, we have sent millions of individuals to interpersonal-skills training, communication-skills training and dealing-with-difficult-people training. We've sent thousands of groups off on retreat to rappel down rock faces and fall blindfolded into their colleague's arms. We've fielded an army of specialized facilitators to say, &quot;Thank you for sharing that,&quot; and &quot;Suzie, we've haven't heard from you, yet.&quot;But the treatment hasn't worked. Meetings still stink. And the things meetings are supposed to produce--decisions, plans, and solutions--have not improved either.In this important book, Altier approaches the problem from a completely different perspective. He argues that the fundamental problem with meetings is their lack of a disciplined, organized process for joint thinking. Focusing on decisions, plans and solutions as the key outputs created by managers, Altier describes in detail three separate, structured processes that remake meetings devoted to these ends.The process for solving problems is my favorite. Using a real but disguised example, Altier shows what a structured, disciplined thinking process can accomplish. Engineers had spent three months twisting knobs and replacing parts in series of failed efforts to solve a serious but intermittent manufacturing problem. Yet 20 hours of disciplined analysis by the same people found the cause, just by thinking together in a different way. At one point, I was so engrossed in the story, I darn near failed to get off my train at my stop.As this example makes clear, this is no theoretical book, but a practical guide grounded in real world experience. The benefit of Altier's deep experience with these processes is evident in his cautions about places where participants or meeting leaders can intentionally or unintentionally sabotage them, his recommendations about ways to keep them practical and result-focused, and his discussions of ways to avoid their contamination by our usual fuzzy thinking in the form of implicit, unwarranted assumptions about the nature of the task or problem.While there have been hundreds of academic books hawking &quot;decision science&quot; and similar nostrums, Altier's book is unique in bringing structured thinking processes together with the reality that meetings are filled with intelligent people with egos. It's also unique in allowing scope for hunch and gut feel to serve the process without taking it over. Altier's approaches have been honed by over 20 years of experience leading real people in real situations through meetings like those described in the book. If you're frustrated by poor meetings in your organization that lead to weak decisions, plans or solutions, read this book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Manager's Toolbox: Effective Processes for Problem Solving and Decision Making","review":"If you would like to see people actually solve problems together, then get this book and use the techniques Bill Altier describes. As a consultant who uses the tools described here, I can verify that they work. The thrill never ceases to watch a group of diverse people - from different groups and levels of an organization - learn that they can, in fact, work together, that among them they have the knowledge and creativity to solve problems and develop strategies.For people who are resistant to have a team attack a problem because meetings are unproductive, this book will show you that it is the way the meeting is run that is not productive. It is the thinking process that gets the result, whether for an individual or a group, and this book shows how much better that result can be from a group.This is not a &quot;light-reading&quot; pleasure book, but it is well worth the effort. It gives a great deal of detail on why and how the tools work and how to apply them. If you are willing to wade in and try these techniques, you will be surprised at how much better at problem solving both you and your people are.

It is especially relevant to those who normally rely on intuitive processes and fail to recognize the value that can be added by a formal decision process. The author makes a great case for the use of more formal processes and backs it up with his own experiences with business decisions.When I read The Thinking Managers' Toolbox, the innovative framework (the organization of the toolbox) jumped out at me. The author's years of experience in helping people and organizations make decisions and solve problems shines in his presentation of a method to choose the right tool for the right problem. But the author goes beyond the organization of the toolbox into a lucid presentation of some of the tools that have worked well over the years. The author explains these tools in a readable manner that can enable the reader to apply them almost immediately.Great book!

The author should consider writing a field book to support this book's use as an aid for consultants interested in expanding their practice into &quot;participative process&quot; consulting.This book belongs in the library of every manager, executive and consultant.

This book is still worth reading for those engaged in comparative and structural linguistics studies of extant or vanishing languages, providing a thorough grounding in methods of structural analysis and description that are still valid in terms of the treatment of the surface structure of a language's grammar.One only needs to read these pages and then a modern study in analytical and computational grammar, however, to see how far things have come even since Chomsky's book. Now linguists talk about harmonic context-free grammars, generalized and head-driven phrase-structure-grammars, formal recursive parsing algorithms, and other concepts that sound like they're from the field of computer science or engineering rather than linguistics--and in fact, these ideas are often used to analyze computer languages as well. Hence, you'll see articles in the literature with titles like, \\"Posterior Decoding for Generative Constituent-Context Grammar, or \\"Multi-Modal Combinatory Categorial Grammar,\\" and \\"A Parser for Harmonic Context-Free Grammars.\\"But getting back to Harris's book, this is still an excellent presentation of the subject at a time just prior to Chomsky's revolution, and remains one of the best books on the subject ever written."},{"Title":"Norstedts Comprehensive English-swedish, Swedish-english Dictionary","review":"Norstedts is a leading Publishing House that produce high quality works.

Having spent plenty of money in my own dyno sessions, Mr. Hammill got to the point of real working engine packages nicely with head porting, cam, and carburettor specifics; he could have saved me plenty of time and money in development had I known of his work earlier. What he describes can be extrapolated to other Cosworth conversions including Formula Atlantic (Ford), Cosworth-Vega, and Cosworth-Pontiac engine street/race tunings. It's indeed a rarified atmosphere at this level, only recently broached by Honda with their S2000, and you won't find Steve Jennings writing about his top-flight engine tuning/tricks anywhere!

There are subsequent volumes on Theater, Architecture, Poetry, Painting, Cinema, The Novel, Opera.The approach is by and large historical and Grunfeld ably conducts us along the long route from the 'primitive tribal musicmaker through the medieval chorister, the eighteenth century court performer, the romantic composer to the jazz improviser.'He touches in the last chapter on the Beatles and popular music.

While Hardy the novelist spun tales of romance and intrigue, his poetry suggests a more reflective tone. The sentimental nature of most of his poems thrusts the reader into a mind coursing madly about lost loves, and the ancestrial rememberances of better times. The metaphors are thick and the syntax archaic to a modern ear, however the sing song nature of much of the rhyme and meter ushers those of us in generation X back to the day of green eggs and ham. Near the end of the 1978 edition edited by Francis Shapiro Puk Hardy's Epic Poem recounting the life of Napolean is added making that edition a more complete and fulfilling read. I recommend Thomas Hardy's Chosen Poems as a vehicle to transport the bored reader to a time of ideal notions and lofty reflections. Your time will be well spent and your vocabulary improved!"},{"Title":"Underdog: A Melanie Travis Mystery (Melanie Travis Mysteries)","review":"I generally love dog mysteries, because I love dogs and I love mysteries. Even with that going for it, I found this novel very hard to get into. In fact, I didn't completely finish the book. It was my first book by Berenson, and perhaps I should give another book a try, but I probably won't. The plot was okay, but unfortunately it was just that -- okay. I found the main character Melanie to be somehow emotionless, even at times slightly unlikable. A little more joy in living would have helped this character a lot.The only time the book ever seemed to come a little bit alive was when the dogs became engaged, but it was just lukewarm even then. I'm sure others feel differently about it, perhaps it's just how it strikes the reader."},{"Title":"Underdog: A Melanie Travis Mystery (Melanie Travis Mysteries)","review":"I was so delighted when I found this series. I don't normally pick mysteries, but am an avid dog-lover.I do not agree that Melanie \\"...wear(s) on your nerves because she is so obstinate about EVERYTHING.\\" She's tough; she's had to be, as most single parents do. She's also had a lot of change in her life just in the year that's taken place in the books.This series, and author, are on my favorites list."},{"Title":"Underdog: A Melanie Travis Mystery (Melanie Travis Mysteries)","review":"While I enjoyed the book overall, I have to say that I was a bit offended by some things I read. I am a groomer, and in the story, the heroine makes it clear that she does not think highly of groomers. She visits a grooming salon, and much was made of the fact that the groomers were unprofessional, slovenly, and dumb. It was mentioned at least twice that groomers do not know how to \\"really\\" groom any show Poodle, and that all they do is \\"tie some bows on the ears and send them home.\\" She doubts that groomers can do quality work on any show dog, especially since her Aunt Peg, a show dog handler, spent several hours doing a show trim on her Poodle.Well, pardon ME. When a show dog handler can trim an entire poodle by hand, with no pieces sticking out, and scissor a perfect top knot, THEN you can tell me that the show dog handler has true grooming skills. As far as I am concerned, the extent of the grooming *they* do consists of mostly brushing and fluffing. I don't think it is necessary to snidely comment on the so-called \\"non-skills\\" of pet groomers just because the majority of dogs we groom do not end up in the show ring. Talk about snobbery.Yes, I know this book is fiction, but apparently the author's opinion of groomers is not. This 'groomer-bashing' occurred in another of her books, and I just cannot ignore it anymore. I will be the first to admit that there ARE many slovenly, unprofessional groomers out there. But the things I read in this book offended ME, and I happen to be the consummate professional groomer. I work pretty darn hard, and I don't need some author constantly belittling my industry. It's certainly not fun to read.The fact that I gave the book 3 stars despite this gripe? I guess I was feeling generous. Who would've thought a groomer had ANY redeeming qualities, right?"},{"Title":"Underdog: A Melanie Travis Mystery (Melanie Travis Mysteries)","review":"All of Laurien Berenson's Melanie Travis mysteries are entertaining and I've read most of them. My only objection is that Melanie Travis begins to wear on your nerves because she is so obstinate about EVERYTHING. There isn't just a few things she is hard headed about but everytime she comes up against something, she braces her feet. She is stubborn about her dog, her son, her job, her ex, Sam, her aunts and the list goes on. This becomes not only predictable but very boring. Melanie needs to become somewhat flexible and leave some of the pig headedness behind to make these books not only entertaining but more believable. Ms Berenson does an excellent job of transporting you to the dog show world, it's just that sometimes I wish she'd leave Melanie at home to grow up!"},{"Title":"Underdog: A Melanie Travis Mystery (Melanie Travis Mysteries)","review":"LIKE ALL HER BOOKS THIS ONE IS JUST SUPER , IT KEEPS YOU TO END ON YOUR CHAIR , YOU NEVER KNOW WHO DID IT OR WHY !

This conclusion differs from general Political Science thought that the manner in which Justices are picked for office makes little to no difference on how they ultimately decide cases.The author concludes that groups with little political and/or economic power fare best with Supreme Court Justices who are appointed. This is important as members of these powerless groups require innovative state Supreme Court decisions to obtain remedies they have been unable to achieve from conservative leaning federal courts. Elected state Supreme Court Justices tend to make more traditional stances and sun the innovative decisions.The book examines state Supreme Court decisions on similar issues in business law, criminal law, and family law in six states: two with elected Justices (Pennsylvania and West Virginia), two with Gubernatorial appointed Justices (New Jersey and Connecticut), and two states where legislatures select the Justices (Virginia and Rhode Island). 36 issues were chosen. This is a statistically signficiant sample size. Considering the multitude of decisions these courts make and the subjectiveness in comparing decisions where specific facts may vary, the argument can continue as to whether these conclusions may be broadly reached and whether these differences would occur in different times. Still, this is a remarkable study that combines case studies and backs these studies backed with statistical evidence. It is highly recommended to those wishing to learn more about Supreme Court decisions."},{"Title":"In the Wilderness","review":"These essays, as suggested by the title, tell tales of life in the forest. The narrator, a neighbor of Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, describes his experiences on camping trips, hunting trips and the like. They're very different essays from the modern variety; today they'd probably be classified as short stories, instead. Although Warner does make clear his distaste for humanity's killing wildlife, he does not go into deep issues as is the fashion in today's popular essays. He just tells generally peaceful, sometimes humorous stories. I can best describe them as relaxing. I wouldn't recommend this for someone looking for piercing nineteenth-century insight into life, but I would for someone who wants to curl up with a Victorian story."},{"Title":"In the Wilderness","review":"As a new Kindle owner, I was curious to find some free books (still hoping to recoup that $200 cost!) and stumbled upon this one. As a lover of the Adirondacks, aspiring 46er (30 down!), and amateur ADK historian, stumbling upon this gem was a treat!I had read the essay on Old Mountain Phelps before, so that one was no surprise. But the rest of these short stories were a wonderful portrait of what the mountains once were. As an earlier reviewer commented, the story of the deer hunt was an outstanding \\"thriller\\" that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone stuck in an office who'd rather be pitching a tent out in the mountains. It's about as good as one can get during the week!Bonus: The style of the essays has made them an excellent companion (via text-to-speech) for my morning ride!"},{"Title":"In the Wilderness","review":"Warner writes a handleful of essays about the Adirondacks Keene Valley and High Peaks area. Essays have very relaxed feel and Warner's description of the wilderness makes you want to pick up and go camping. An underlying theme throughout is mans destructive abilities toward the natural world. These remarks are are not dwelled upon however. One memorable essay is his description of a deer being pursued by hounds; all from the deers prespecctive. Another is a story of a legandary hidden cave on Nipple Top which the author ventures to with the wily Old Man Phelps."},{"Title":"In the Wilderness","review":"Mr Warner has a wonderful way &#34;explaining&#34; the great outdoors.

There were some pretty funny parts but the writing was very dated and may not appeal to all readers.

The book illustrates the significance of the massive Scotch-Irish immigration into North Carolina, South Carolina and the southeastern United States during the 18th century. Though shown as written by J. B. Eaves, it was actually written by Mrs. John Baxter Eaves. The author was the daughter of a Unionist Confederate congressman who opposed the Secession of North Carolina from the Union in the Civil War. Her husband commanded a company of North Carolina infantry from 1862 until the last major battle of the Civil War at Bentonville, N. C., but became a leading North Carolina Republican during Reconstruction and served twice as state chairman of the North Carolina Reopublican Party."},{"Title":"A Boy Without Toys","review":"Most toy-train collectors in Eastern Massachusetts (and many elsewhere) are familiar with the late Adolf Arnold, once owner and proprietor of the A &amp; D Toy-Train Village &amp; Railway Museum in Sharon and Middleboro Mass. However, I that many are aware of the historical details of Arnold's life. In &quot;A Boy Without Toys,&quot; Arnold details his journey from childhood in Frankfurt, Germany during the Weimar Republic, through the perils of fighting in the German Army during World War II, life as a prisoner-of-war, difficult times in post-war Germany and Canada, and the final realization of the American Dream through hard work, good fortune, and more than a little help from his friends. The narrative is intensely personal, told strictly from eye level with an amazing clarity of memory. It is told almost completely in the first person, although in a rather naive writing style. Throughout the introduction and much of the first chapter, Arnold's unsophisticated composition and habit of repetition tend to make for difficult going. However, by the end of the first chapter, the story becomes absolutely engrossing. Arnold's unpretentious technique becomes an asset throughout much of the book, especially when describing the Second World War from a German foot-soldier's viewpoint. There are numerous memoirs written by American and Allied personnel about their WWII experiences, but this is the first I have run across that details the experience from the German side. One characteristic I found quite interesting is the change in Arnold's English usage as the book progresses. At the beginning, his construction is very strict, almost stilted. One can almost hear the German accent in his voice. As his tale progresses to Canada and then the United States, his English flows more freely; becomes more American, if you will, as Arnold makes himself at home in his adopted country. Toward the end, some parts of the narrative trail off into details of interest only to family and friends, but it is this contrast between the familiar details and the extraordinary events that give this chronicle its poignancy. Toy train enthusiasts will appreciate this book for the insight it gives into the personality of one of the hobby's most complex and enigmatic personalities, not to mention numerous photographs of his justifiably famous collection. World War II buffs will find it essential for the ground level description of the experience from the opposite side of the lines. In the final analysis, Adolf Arnold's life makes for an interesting story, if only because he has managed to convey to the reader his deep feeling and enthusiasm for the various aspects of an unusually busy life."},{"Title":"Good Nursing Home Care : 10 Things You Need to Know","review":"My mother is aging before my eyes and I have not known who to ask and receive straight, honest, reliable facts regarding what is best for my mom.

I have no idea how anyone could give this peice of trash five stars.

You'll find a few of the cards odd, not being able to make out what they are, let alone what the picture stands for. As for the other cards, twirling pixies, enchanting faeries and a few other mystical things makes them gorgeous and real pieces of art. Even the smell of the book and the cards take you to another realm, as they smell woodsy and Old World.The book itself is a nice read I think, pushing you to believe and connect with fearies, and although you probably don't, it's whimsical and light. Exploring what the cards mean is another fun part, and becomming shocked when they may from time to time give you an answer to a question that you've been trying to work out.

The writing style in the book is lighthearted and a bit funny, so it's great to read when you're bored.I sort of stopped at the part where it required the reader to sing and dance, but I'm sure that would have been a good sort of spacey bit of fun had I been alone. But if I have the chance, I'll probably pick up where I left off. :D"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I have a number of Oracle card sets, this one is the best I have seen. In the way it is explained and the exercises that you go through to learn how to use the cards. I recamend this for anyone. Beginners will find it easy to understand and learn from and thoses of us who have other cards sets will truely lean to value this one."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This book was truly amazing! There were no lies. It was honest, inspirational and fun to read and do the activities suggested. Any faerie enthusiast should consider this oracle as it truly is a remarkable piece of work."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I stumbled on this set in a book store that was shutting down and bought it on a whim. Though I've been reading tarot for a while, the only oracle cards I've tried were much less accessible, so I wasn't expecting more than an art deck. The book drew me in, though, and as I did the exercises, I felt the connection to some other realm being forged...a realm I wasn't before even sure I believed in. I especially loved that the book said the cards are only ink and paper, the magic is in us, always there for our use.It may have just been a coincidence, but after I worked with the cards for a few nights, we started having a lot of night noises after bed time - bangs, scratching and scrabbling out in the house. The dogs in our room did a lot of growling, and my husband kept getting up and checking, but never found anything to account for it. It stopped after about a week (I haven't used the deck since I've started reading a new book)and I am beginning to think maybe it was some new friends just saying hello."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Brain Froud's art work is always a treat in any book, but now with the orcale cards they are fantastic. I own about 15 tarot deck, but none have ever touched me on a higher level than these stunning cards. They are awesome!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"You could say the faeries put this book and tarot-style deck in my hands. (Certainly I wouldn't have come across it on my own.) The Faeries' Oracle is a great break from our humdrum human lives, giving us the chance to fancy a world of &quot;fantasy.&quot; Brian's art is spectacular &amp; reminiscent of his work with Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal. Jesa's writing is light and fun. Both are set apart from most faery-dwellers because they got help from real faeries &amp; that adds an interesting note to the book and deck."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This deck is fabulous. It arrived in the mail today and I was so eager to pull the cards out, find three, and read them. But I didn't! I began to read the whole beginning and really did the exercises provided by the author. It helped, and I was instantly connected to the deck. I gave a trial-reading to my eager friend when I finished the book, and it was very accurate and she seemed pleased with the interpretations. I will use this deck often, I know it. The art is brilliant to look at in general on the face of the cards. Some might say they look demonic or terrifying, I don't see how. If they read the book, they would know that the world of the Faery is made of many different creatures, not just ladies with wings. There's dark figures, light figures, and abstract. There are healers, helpers, tricksters, and wise ones... everyone with their own suggestions and advice."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This is one of the best fairy oracle cards out there. I have seen this oracle deck for a few years now and have recently just decided to get it to see what the fuss was about, since there were so much of great reviews on this oracle. I am so happy I got it. Simply stunning artwork, plus the book is so fantastic. This oracle is truely amazing, its full of rich deep spiritual meaning/ interpretation ( especially with the singer cards ). Its best to study the book first before using the deck. Each card literally tells its own story with so much of meaning...This oracle is worth the buy."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"You will not be disappointed by this deck. This is the most amazingly accurate deck I have ever used. Appropriate even for folks that \\"don't believe in this kinda stuff\\" If you are looking for detailed and insightful assistance...this is the deck."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Faery Oracle is by far my favorite tarot deck (out of the pitiful two that I own).It's probably my favorite because I find faery magic so interesting and yet amusing, and the Fae depicted on the cards have been wonderful to me. In the past, they've brought me a great deal of closure concerning my earnest life questions.If you are seeking wisdom and guidance, the path of faery faith just might be what you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This deck has been a pleasure in every way. From the moment I opened it I have enjoyed every reading - accurate and insightful!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This is absolutly my favourite Oracle deck.It is really good even if you rather make a path of self meditation on each card than using the book which is really nice.I am really happy i could get The Faerie's Oracle."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I am a fan of Froud's work. But more than that, i am a believer in the Fae, and that is what i am able to communicate with through these cards.the artwork is beautiful, but thats not the reason i love them so much. Its because they work better than any other oracle or tarot deck i have ever used.The love and faith put into the artwork really brings the connection between the 2 worlds closer together and i feel, thats how they work better than some other decks.A must for any froud fan, but also a must for anyone who truly believes in faeries and needs help communicating wit them."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Feeling connected with Faeries most of my life, they were pulling on my hair, telling me to purchase this. Being a big fan of Brian Froud's work on Good Faeries/Bad Faeries, and his other projects (Dark Crystal, etc) I really wanted to give this a try. When I received my order, I couldn't put it down. The book that comes with this deck is by the kindest-hearted person, Jesa Macbeth. Her words and wisdom will help you to produce the kind of results you are looking for.Each of the Oracle cards have it's own personality and feel. When you go through the deck, you will find faeries that you are drawn to and faeries that you are not drawn to. These are important to note to yourself. These Oracle cards are not like Tarot cards. Tarot cards tend to be 'serious' and uptight. The meanings are harder to develop on your own. With these Oracle cards, the Faeries encourage you to laugh, sing, cry, do whatever you like. There are no rules, only that you feel comfortable with the cards and the message the Fae may be sending to you.Also, if you purchase these cards, or if you are curious to what more people think (who own the cards), you should check out the Faeries' Oracle e-group. ...Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Whether you are a beginning oracle reader or an accomplished sage, you'll find this book and card set are a pure delight.The 200-plus page text by Jesa MacBeth skillfully weaves the reader into a faery tapestry of pure energy, divine spirits and absolute fun. For those readers whose experience has been limited to traditional Tarot, be prepared for an adventurous excursion into the enchanting world of faeries, including their incredible sense of humor!MacBeth's explanation of faeries, their world and their feelings about humans are an education for those of us new to their realm. If you feel some trepidation in launcing into this oracle, don't! The book gently guides you every step of the way - - and believe me, the faeries will be cheering every step of your journey.The art work, of course, is superb. Froud fans will love the unique faces and garb of his oracle population. Of the many groups of cards, my absolute favorites were &quot;The Singers of the Realms&quot; - - abstract paintings which depict the most beautiful, life-filled energy you'll see in an oracle. I don't think there's a card in the deck I like more that &quot;She of the Cruach&quot; - - the Great Goddess of nurturing energy.When your deck arrives, sit down with a cup of hot tea. a biscuit for unseen guests, and an open heart. This is one oracle you'll return to time and again - - it speaks directly to the heart."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I can't add much to the already raving and beautiful reviews, but I am so happy to own The Faerie's Oracle, this will be my second oracle to date, so I kinda knew what to expect. Please know that this isn't a tarot set as some may come to believe that oracle cards are -- oracle cards are more self discovery cards to pin-point events in your life that may be happy, troubling, what you may be thinking and not aware at the time etc. So really to bring the ideas to light and make you more intuned with faeries and the welcoming energy/information they may give you.The magic is in you as the author points out in the first few pages of the hardcover book, she is so right. The book goes on to learn you how to pick out your power cards, to learn what each card means, and to really ask HONEST questions about how you feel about the images etc. Having the book Good Faeries/Bad Faeries is not necessary, but if you do have this beautiful book as well, you can really get into understanding faeries as the author and Mr. Froud elegantly state.In all the oracle is telling you to really embrace and enjoy life to the fulliest -- sing, dance, etc. as these acts brings faeries into your life. You will love this book/card set and will cherish it forever. Pixel dust is in this item for sure!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I just bought the Faeries' Oracle today. I had been using a tarot deck for divination, but I can see that I may have a difficult time getting back to my tarot cards now that I have this Faerie Deck!The artwork on the cards in absolutely stunning! I really love it. Froud is a wonderful artist. The expressions on the faces of the faerie are so telling of what the card means. This is not like tarot, where you have to figure out what one man standing alone on a hill is supposed to mean. This deck is so much easier to interpret, especially if you want to make up your own meanings instead of going by the book's definitions.Jessica MacBeth gives a wonderful exercise in the beginning to teach you how to interpret a few cards. I was extrememly impressed by the results I received by answering the simple questions she asked. I was able to make sense out of even the abstract cards! I have a lot of trouble doing this with my tarot deck. I won't give away the secret of what happens after you do this exercise, but I can tell you that it was wonderfully insightful.I was so impressed with the deck and book, I immediately joined Jessica's internet mailing list to discuss the deck with others. I highly recommend this oracle to anyone interested in divination, faeries, or if you just love Brian Froud's artwork! The combination of the three plus the wonderful book by Jessica MacBeth is really something else!! You won't regret buying this! :)"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I became interested in this deck after doing a research assignment into faeries as part of my tradition study. While I'd been taught that faeries weren't your Tinkerbell variety, this deck brought to light many other aspects that I had never experienced.This isn't a deck to take lightly. These faeries will make their way into your life in ways you never expected. I found that once I started working with these cards I couldn't get them out of my mind. One day I found myself promising the Fee Lion that I would get the dishes done as soon as I finished watching a television show!The artwork on these cards is detailed when appropriate, while some of the work is very abstract. Froud has really done a wonderful job.Jessica Macbeth displays a gift for communcating with the faeries and making their sometimes very complex natures easy to understand for someone just starting out. What I really enjoyed was how she guided you through learning how to interept the cards on your own, and encourages you not to rely only on her writings.This is a deck for someone who is willing to get involved, and to think about what they're seeing/learning and finding the answer within rather than in a book."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"When I purchased this deck, I was browsing for a new Tarot/Oracle deck. I was waiting for something to jump out and yell BUY ME! This deck didn't jump and yell as much as it fluttered into my hands and got comfy.I had seen Brian's work before without knowing it, but it's familiarity is one of the things that drew me. When I actually opened the box...WOW! These cards blew me away. They spoke to me immediately. I felt as though I were returning to play with my oldest and best childhood friends, only now as an adult, I can see the teachings of the games we play.The book that accompanies this deck is one that could stand alone. The artwork and descriptions of each faerie and his/her personality is just plain fun! I must agree with another reviewer who says that this set is underpriced! I would pay what I payed for the set for the book alone. I find myself snuggling under an afghan with a cup of tea re-reading it just to chase away rainy day blues. Beautiful art, wonderful writing.If you are looking for something that will comfort, guide, teach and amuse you, look no further. This is absolutely it!!!! If you were ever a child and would like to be one again, listen... the faeries are inviting you to come and play!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I had never owned a Tarot deck before. And I had never really examined Brian Froud's work closely before I bought this Oracle either. I was new to all of this. But I was extremely anxious to receive it. And when I did, it totally blew me away.The book was extremely well written. It made me feel so much more welcomed. It made me feel so much more connected to the faeries. I actually bonded with the cards immediately.The cards themselves are drawn with such emotion, that you cannot help but feel a personal bond with them. I think this deck was the perfect choice for me. It drew me in, and now I'm learning to be a better person, with the help of the faeries, Brian &amp; Jesa! I just wanted to thank all of them for giving me such a great gift! The price is not even a question, because this deck is worth so much more!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This is a brilliant item. The enchanting cards, that have a beautiful picture of a faery or elve printed on them, each with a meaningfull meaning. The oracle cards let you communicate with faeries, and ask some questions you always longed to know. The deck of cards come with a nice thick step by step book all about the meaning of each card, and how to communicate with the faeries and use the deck. I reccomend this book to all faery fans and believers, and that are willing to spend some time with the deck. I reccomend the deck for anyone at the age of 10 and up. I do not reccomend the deck for those who do not have an open mind, for those with a negetive attitude, and for those who want to get the deck for their small child as a &quot;play toy.&quot;The deck and book are exciting, enchanting, beautifull, and colorfull as well.The Fae Girl"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Brian Froud and Jessica Macbeth have created an oracle deck of amazing beauty; their pens and paintbrushes are surely guided by Faery hands. They have created a system all their own; it's not organized anything like Tarot or anything else you're used to. Loosely based on European faery lore, but mostly drawn from the creators' imaginations, each faery character in the deck has a specific personality and role. You'll feel like you know these faeries personally after reading through the book. An example, and my personal favorite: Ilbe the Retriever, responsible for recovering our lost stuff, from keys to dreams. If you love the Fae, you'll love this."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"First of all, I have to remark on the quality of both the deck and the book - they are beautiful and of the highest quality! I was amazed at the book that accompanies this deck - it is a hardcover and the pages are printed on parchment grade paper - nice and thick and creamy colored. Secondly, the book introduces you to the deck in a way I have never approached any of my other decks - I was in awe. Rather than giving you the meanings of each card immediately, the author of the book asks you to go through a little process and then pull some cards and study them, getting in tune with them... I don't want to give too much information, because I would want you to experience this for yourself, but this approach really opens you up to truly using YOUR intuition while reading the cards. I much more satisfying experience. I love this deck! I have done some readings on myself and on friends and family...let's just say, if you don't want the truth - don't ask. You will get answers, and they will be honest. Hope you are prepared.In all, I think this is my favorite deck I own (out of 9 total). I take it with me if I am going out of town and I sleep with it beneath my pillow. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I do!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Well what I first noticed is how BEAUTIFUL THE ARTWORK IS! I really love this oracle because we in the U.S. often times portray Faeries as just too pretty and perfect if that is the correct way to desribe, this Oracle is accurate and more truthful. Not every card is pretty but as many of us know not everything IS pretty so to me this Oracle is accurate in that you don't just have a bunch or pretty-(non-threatening) cards. If you are going to do a reading, perhaps you need to understand that there is a shadow side that may not always be pleasant and perfect. This is a beautifully portrayed deck of ARTWORK and I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!! I highly recommend this product."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I have always been fascinated with oracle cards. I have several tarot decks and a few other miscellaneous oracle sets, but Brian Froud's Faeries' Oracle is the first set that I have seen in a long time that really resonates for me. The images depicted on the cards are incredible. Each faery card seems full of life, and the accompanying book written by Jessica MacBeth is intelligent and practical, while still maintaining a sense of whimsy. The set is both very well written and very well designed."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I really like this oracle. Most oracle decks leave me feeling cheap. Most oracle decks to me feel like postcards that were too good for themselves, or tarot cards that just couldn't cut it. But Brian Froud's oracle set really is a great piece of work.More than anything though, I like the book. The book really helped change my thinking patterns on how I view tarot decks and oracle decks. It's more than an interpretation book, it's a workbook. I'm suprised at the knowledge of both of the authors.The packaging is also very well made and attractive. Makes a great gift for your favorite cartomancer..or best friend. :)"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"The Faeries' Oracle is an excellent divination tool. The portraits of the different Faeries' speak quite directly to the reader about the querent and the problem that has been posed. I find the book that comes along with it quite helpful as this is not a usual tarot deck.Along with being a great deck for divination use, you'll also have fun just looking through the cards! The artwork is incredible!!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"There are so many different oracular sets out there now, so many people trying to show an easier or more insightful way to get in touch with what is going on around and within you. Of all the decks that I have used, this one beats them all. Not only is the art impressively communicative, but the book is equally as chaming. I do not have the words to praise the artwork of Brian Froud, which I have had the pleasure of seeing many places other than this work. The book is not only of the highest quality (being hardbound and sewn rather than paperback and glued), but the author manages to cajole the reader into the empathic, intuitive response that is so necessary for such reading and invariably lost in the attempts to &quot;read it right&quot; and learn all of the meanings perfectly. Of all the non-tarot decks I have, this one is by far my favorite work."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"The Faeries oracle is one of the most imaginative and fun card decks I have ever own.

This makes a very good present for an imaginative individual who believes in the magic of faeries!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"These cards are so powerful that for me they aren't even cards anymore. They have turned into doorways, portals into a world where guidance, wisdom and the perfect mirror is always given, sometimes with a hug and sometimes with a swift kick in the butt. The beings and energies that are accessible are frisky, funny, very very loving and above all incredibly powerful. These cards and the world that Brian Froud makes available to us is a blessing and I am soooo soooo thankful. Thank you Brian & Thank you Jessica!!!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I have very little attraction to faery decks but this one I can't seem to part with. It is a beautiful,and sometimes, haunting deck. I keep it mainly for personal use and do not read for others with it. The images are gorgeous and curious-looking, if one is not familiar with the faeries in all their manifestations. The book is great--hardback and very durable--and filled with information about the cards and faeries that is easy to understand. It is a beautiful deck to use or just to add to the collectors shelf."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"One day I walked into a great little store I know to buy a Tarot deck for my Husband, because well our daughter spilt chocolate milk on the ones we had. The young lady working there, of psychic goodness, offered that she had a deck for me and believed it would be the one in which &quot;I&quot; should have. So I walked out of that store with a deck she offered for my husband and the &quot;Faery Oracle&quot; for me.My life has changed in ways I could not possibly explain without writing and drawing and taking you through all I now see and the doors that have been opened to my heart, spirit being, and pure exisitence of energy. The Faery were always with me from a young age and I drew them always, played when permitted. In some way or another I lost touch with them, the troll who now dwells next to the river that which flows of indigo through our living room has no offer of even guess, and well for a troll, in his silence I found truth. Ni, my guide, my faithful friend, over my shoulder always and well lets just say it's nice to have your realm touch again. As our flow goes, they have returned. I truly missed them and am so at home with their return. My paintings and many forms of faery work are well on their way and well me and the faery dance every night. Thank-you. A faery with her hair in braids and her spirit shares with thee."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Brian Froud, best known for his book &quot;Faeries&quot; and his conceptual design in the feature films &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth,&quot; has given us faeries we can hold in the palm of our hands! Chosen by Jessica Macbeth, or maybe chosen for her by the fae themselves, each faery, each pixie, each gnome has their own personalities, their own ways of communicating with each and every reader. Some may pop up (literally!) on a daily basis, with a new message or an old reminder, while others may slide in and slide on out again, as they each see fit. Macbeth's exercises to introduce you to the general collective as well as individual fae are introspective and illuminating. Froud's illustrations glow with life that you cannot ignore. When you hold these fae in your hands, you are the true captive.Kerrie Colantonio, Penny-A-Page Publishing"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"These cards and book just scream at you to use them.

In fact, I like it so much that I got rid of all of my other tarot type sets and play with this set exclusively.The artwork is stunning, and with the exception of the 'singer' cards, of which I am not particularly fond of (they are the abstract cards mentioned previously), they really resonate with the reader."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I love this oracle the pictures are great.

If you are at all interested in Faeries or Tarot this is most definately a MUST HAVE."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I adore this deck! I have extremely accurate readings everytime. The Faeries will not sugar coat the truth. They will tell you the truth, even if you don't want to hear the truth! I am amazed everytime I do a reading how dead on they are, as much as I hate to admit how right they are sometimes! The Faeries will speak to you through Spirit and their messages are so clear. The book Jessica wrote is filled with warmth and her love of the Faery show! Brian's art is gorgeous. If you want to work with the Faeries to help you improve your life, healing work, meditation, etc, they will help you if you simply ask them. Reading with the Faeries Oracle is an excellent medium for them to connect with your spirit. Very easy to read for beginners to advance."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Having used Tarot decks and various other oracles for many years, I can honestly say that these cards offer the most accurate and FUN readings that anyone could imagine.Each of the 65 cards is beautiful, plus there is a blank card for you to draw your own guardian Faery.While the cards themselves are inspiring, the book is equally incredible.

Even looking at the spelling signifies that Froud is, and always has been, interested in looking at the true nature of the fae, the Pre-Disney sanitized, unsugar-coated variety of fae. They are not always pretty and sweet, and of course they do not wear clothing (those monstrous humans and their gross rags!!!). The deck does have a sense of fae humor and laughs at itself, as well as you! I admire this deck greatly for evincing the ancient spirit of the fae creatures, whose folklore span centuries and continents. They do typify the European fae, from times when woods were deep and dark and we didn't think we knew everything about this world.It also makes a wonderful oracle deck. The benefit I see it having is that it is not a tarot deck. It doesn't have historically set meanings and centuries of meaning strung on; therefore, a reader of this deck must, and is encouraged by the authors, to use intuition and insight to glean meaning from the presented fae. The whole experience takes one into another world, if the reader is willing to go there.If you are looking for cutesy little angelic feminine pixies with sweet little wings, then go to your local Hallmark store. If you want the elemental denizens that exist between worlds and can carry you between them. Get this deck NOW!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"The pictures soothe me and the beauty in the art is grand! There is also an online email group for these cards in case you want to talk to others and learn. I found it more fun learing on my own though.

These cards ended up opening other doors for me to purchase more of Brian Froud's work."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I bought this for a friend and now I want one for myself! The cards are just enchanting and the art is incredible. A definite winner in all respects."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I just got this deck, and went through the exercises in the beginning of the book. The book is fun, interesting, well-written, and point-on about the use of the cards, and communicating with the fae in general. However, I am still having mixed feelings about a couple of the cards. Let me say, I'm a huge Froud fan, everything from Good/Bad Fairies to Labrynth, etc. But a couple of these cards really bother me, since (as I noted in an earlier comment to a review), I feel that the females are over-sexualized, and none of the males are sexualized at all. Nudity or their own interesting ecletic choice of clothes make sense for the fae, but when it isn't shared equally, it feels voyeuristic and odd. In particular, the Lady of the Harvest and the Earth Mother cards, I feel like the male sprites, fairies, etc are leering and strange. The Lady of the Harvest seems strangely passive and blank-faced, even slow. Anyway, it seems like at least a couple of others felt something akin to that. I never really noticed that in any of Brian's work before.Other than that, I really like the cards, and love the book. I am going to stay open to the message that the fae will bring as they will."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I bought this used through Amazon and it showed up with no cards. BE AWARE!!! If you buy used make sure you know what you're getting. The pictures in the book are lovely and the desciptions seem very insiteful, but I would never have bought used if i'd realized I was getting only half of what I wanted."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I had heard alot about these cards but decided to purchase the Heart of the Faerie Deck, then happened to stumble upon this deck fully in tact with guide book at a trash and treasure market. They quickly became my favorite cards to do readings with.The artwork is just fantastic, which goes along with all of Froud's products, the cards speak very loudly and at times I have found them to be quite mischevious. I think anyone could pick up this deck and have great success from the start. I had started using the cards without looking at the guide book, however it is well worth a read to get the background on all the faeries in the deck.I have quite a number of divination decks, but now find myself more often than not pulling this deck without hesitation at the beginning of a reading, I also regular use this deck to do my own cards or to reference another deck of cards. They have interesting and direct responses, and all the cards have a very unique personality and style in which they will respond to your individual questions and individual energies. I would recommend this deck for beginners and long time card readers, they are fun, direct, cheeky and interesting all at the same time!!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Just got this deck today, it my first faery deck. At first i was a little disappointed by the images, but then decided to play with the deck and see if i might like it. to my surprise i found them very accurate and interesting. it like they are physically talking to you, it seems like the pictures move haha. anyway now the problem is i can't seem to put them down. I'm really happy i bought this deck and would highly recommend it. ps look pass the image and you will dive into a different world and would love these faeres."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This Oracle deck was recommended by a friend and I must say I love it. It comes with a hard cover book, a big plus for me, and the cards are beautifully done. Its a must have for anyone that enjoys Oracle cards."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I got the book earlier Good and Bad Faeries.so I had to get this book and card set...It was such a surprise to see the same beautiful quality in the set as in the book.and these are cards you work with on a different level than tarot cards.to set your balance and tune into the faery realm.I appreciate all the hard work and education from the author and publishers that have gone into these..Its truly a gift...B.W."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"First, know that these cards are as wonderful as the book that goes along with it - it is very important to read the beginning which really connects you to the mystery. Some reviewers thought these were bad cards because they weren't all beautiful twinkling happy fairies on every card - but that's the point. Although cheerful, joyous, and beautiful most of the time, these cards are at their center: honest. With honesty comes both light and dark and it is important to understand this and have this in mind before purchasing these cards. I was put off at first as well, but the more you read and learn about these cards, the more you will find them all necessary aspects to the deck. The introductory lessons - if truly studied should not only make readings of all tarot cards easier but also teach you some valuable lessons about yourself. :)"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This book... like so many people have said, shows that the magic is in you. I was shopping one day for Tarot cards (I am a tarot fiend) And this one kept pulling me to it. The Faeries have always been in my life and they kept pulling me in this decks direction for months, but this time I had money!!! I bought it and immediatly ripped it open. Not only is the art stunning, but the authors are incrediably wise. They leave a blank card for you to draw your personal Faery guide. Using the meathods in the book I found my faery guide, and she brings joy and fun in my mundane life . I can honestly say that this oracle has brought light into my life and the Faeries have become an even larger part of my life. If you believe in faeries then this deck is for you!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"By far, this is the greatest book on the fae i have ever come upon. The art by Brian froud is trully magickal. Jessica macbeth's text is easy to read and follow. This Oracle has never failed me before. It has the easiest and most effective excercises i have performed to see the faeries and develope a relationship with them.All of my readings are accurate. The faeries have taught me alot, that there is no future or 'fate', and that it is always up to us to make our own changes in our own lives.You must see the oracle cards to understand the magick. I must have, you will NEVER regret that you have bought it."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I received my Faerie's Oracle in the mail a few days ago, and I can't put the cards or the book down! The art on the cards are so beautiful, and I feel such a strong connection to them. The book is a very, very helpful guide. It recommends creating your own intuitive interpretation of the cards before you read the interpretation in the book. This oracle has so much more to offer than a tarot deck, there are so much more possibilities. The card #0 is blank - you draw the picture yourself. This is such a personal deck, one I will cherish forever.Thanks Brian & Jessica!..."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I love to do readings and have many decks for this purpose but this is my absolute favorite deck of all time. I was never drawn to faery before, so don't let that discourage you. These cards are ideal for newcomers to the realm of faery. The artwork is beautiful and the book offers so much information, and is so very well written. It's a great bargain to get such an extensive book with such a beautiful deck of cards. The cards are always right on as well, what more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This Oracle is awesome! The cards, are beautifully created with rich and diverse symbolism that is actually quite contrary in some cases. I think that his connection to the Fae pervades through every single piece of art he creates and this deck is no exception. The book written by Jessica MacBeth provides great direction for how to connect with the world of Faery and guides the reader but lets them go at the same time. I discovered my connection to the world of Faeries through this deck and for that I am truly grateful and thankful. For those with a serious interest in seeing the world of the Sidhe, the Tuatha de Danaan, the Shining Ones, I highly recommend this Oracle!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I was wandering around a bookstore when I heard voices calling out to me. They kept saying, &quot;Find us!&quot; over and over; always followed with giggles. I searched through each aisle following the voices and when I got to the New Age section I knew the voices were coming from the other end. I continued down the isle and had never heard of &quot;The Faeries Oracle&quot; but I knew that's where the voices were coming from. I picked up the case and heard a tiny &quot;Thank you&quot; and went striaght to the check out counter. I've always been connected to the Faeries and have great fun with them on a daily basis. That's not to say they don't hide my keys and many other small items but I still enjoy them none-the-less. &quot;The Faeries Oracle&quot; is a must have for all who enjoy the company of the Faeries. . . or would like to enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"THE FAERIES' ORACLE is another masterpiece of faerie magic and wisdom from Brian Froud.Even if you have GOOD FAERIES / BAD FAERIES, this book illuminates Brian's faery world deeper and more personally than ever before. Having each image on a single card both magnifies and intensifies the power and energy of Brian's images and opens a direct door to faerie. Jesa's easy to read and use and surprisingly substantial text is a delight, entertaining and wise.And best of all, the cards really work, providing startling and accurate insight into life's situations. This is a beautifully produced, high quality package and makes an excellent gift; I bought several for Christmas presents. Thank you Brian; keep the wonderful work coming."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"The only deck that has opened my mind and heart to intuitive guidance. The deck is alive, with vibrant and real faery energy radiating from every card! The artwork is a feast for the etheric senses, with a multitude of beings per card flaunting many different symbols. It truly gets you in touch with faery energy. After using it for a while, I see every individual faery as an old friend, not just a card, and feel the tension and interaction between them (putting down more than 3 cards starts to feel awfully crowded, whereas I have no problems doing layouts with 20 cards using standard tarot). Amazing, amazing deck. I swear I can sometimes see the pictures move. I'm not crazy, really!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I used to be quite the cranky guy. My wife gave me this because she knew the world it contained was fun, silly and wise...something that I truly needed to step forward with my life. Apart from a particular fairy pulling my zipper down when I least expect it (work meetings) I have had nothing but joyous revelations and amazing encounters. Not only is the artwork on the cards AMAZZZZING, it also has a guide book that shows you how to really bond with your deck in YOUR OWN WAY, which is truly different from anything I've seen. I recommend this oracle to anyone interested in Faery, oracles, Brian Froud or for someone who wants something new and positive in their lives. No regrets on this one!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"The cards are differant, you need to read the book before you try using the cards. They aren't cutsie fairies either, but differant. Nice book easy to read comes with the cards."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Deck: The images are beautiful with a lot of variety. There are traditionally pretty images and then there are quirky characters that bring a smile to my face. In particular the wings are exquisite. The font on the actual card is hard to read (a bit too italicized and curlicue-d) but the card number is easy to see.Guide Book: Love that it is hard cover and high quality. There is a mini image each card along with the card's number and title. The descriptions have a starter reading for a quick or simple reference. There are longer story-like sections for when you want to delve a bit deeper into the Fae realm. How the author describes the mischief some of the faeries get into makes me laugh.This deck has become a favorite of all the members of our weekly women's group."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Not your ordinary oracle. If you want something that is not only beautiful but allows you a little more intuition and synchronicity than tarot decks, you've come to the right place. The words prompts are simple and thought-provoking, the artwork is beautiful and rich with details that you might notice one little thing during one reading and another the next time. the possibilities are endless."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Product is beautiful and pristine. Super quick shipping. I will definitely recommend doing business with this vendor. A+ experience! :)"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I bought it years ago at a high price before it was discounted.At that time, there's no any \\"Look Inside\\" of this product at Amazon website.Many rated it 5-stars with \\"great & beautiful artwork\\" as comments, and I was attracted by the cover, I expected to see many beautiful faries.I was disappointed when I received the product.1) The package inside has some dirty stains, but I think it's not the responsibility of the product creator.2) Half of the cards are presenting eccentric beings, most of them are not lovely faries, it's not what I expected.In spite of that, I've found its good side.1) The artwork is really great, professional & unique. I know the ugly part in the cards has its function for inspiration.2) It show the truth. It let you realize more about faries, there're good & bad faries, and many faries without beautiful appearance are also descritbed at other books or materials.3) The content of the book is useful. It guides you how to use these cards for inspiring yourself. You can know more about your real needs, how to heal and grow yourself etc.In conclusion, the deck set is inspirational with great artwork, but it's not a sweet & lovely style.It maybe good for those finding inspiration, but not for those finding only beautiful collection.It's extremely not recommended for children."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Hi I notice that many of these reviews mention oracle cards however it is not mentioned in the product description...can anyone tell me where I can find the oracle book PLUS cards???"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I would simply like to say that the artwork is fine. Most of the cards are gorgeous. There are a few cards which show the faeries' breasts and one which shows a naked bottom, but really, who cares? The naked body used to be a prized subject for art and was seen as a beautiful object. What happened? Many fairies are drawn naked anyway. It's a stylistic preference. This deck is definitely worth buying, and if you are offended by those few, just replace them with some other cards or try not to be so bothered by it. The book is very interesting also and gives an in-depth description of each card."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I can't really review this book cause I haven't even had the chance to use this book but if I ever do get the chance to use it and have the wonderful experience of the oracle I think it would be a great experience. overall I like the cards and I thnk that I would really like it."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"i have had this deck for a while now. it's not THAT bad, but the cards are just trying so hard to be art. if you can't get past the fact that it's Brian Froud, you'll never be able to use the actual oracle. read the book, keeps the journal, it really does help. But ignore what the book says the cards mean. they'll only really be able to help you if you have a good personal relationship with the little ones yourself."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I also received this book without the cards.

If you're looking for an enlightened experience, than this is the oracle for you."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This book is a must have if you believe in faeries. I entered in the otherword 4 years ago and started to see then, Brian Froud &quot;don't draw&quot; he take pictures of the faeries.

A lot more 'positive' in outlook than is the Tarot, it's also good for breaking in new people who might find the Tarot's gloom and doom disturbing."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This oracle set is great. The art work on the cards is beautiful. This set comes with a complete deck of 66 oracle cards and a complete 208 page illustrated book. This set helps you look at yourself and helps give a better understanding of ones self. It pervades a clear look into your personal problems and it also gives a clear look into the future and it gives you ideas of some different paths you can take to change the outcome of whatever issue you are currently faced with. The cards are very easy to use. the readings are clear and each card is numbered and in the book it will tell you the meanings of each card. These cards have never let me down I would recommend this set to anyone who wishes to have guidance and perspective in your life. the cards will know your energy after about three uses. The cards are just fun and make a very good heirloom gift."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I've been using these cards for years. The wisdom and insight they provide when I'm facing a dilemna or difficult situation is usually spot on and very helpful!!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"... and their biggest secret is how to have fun. I have used Angel, Tarot and other oracle decks for a number of years with some success, but as soon as I opened this pack, I knew I'd come home. Brian's imaginative and sympathetic (to the fae, not to us) artwork draws you in with it's joyous energy and you cannot help but be entranced by the tales each card tells. Jessica's accompanying words are wonderfully wise and between them, they have produced a deck that is incredibly accurate, completely intuitive and so much fun to use.Even if your instincts differ from Jessica's intelligent and thought-provoking interpretations, it really doesn't matter, the cheeky little critters are just having a laugh with you - they refuse to exist in a world without joy and if that means a little mischief, so much the merrier! If you have any interest in divination, I strongly recommend these insightful cards - they will lighten up your outlook on life and that's when the true magic starts to happen.Thank you Brian and Jessica for your truly inspirational gift to brighten up every single day."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"Thirteen years ago, on my seventeenth birthday I walked into a bookstore looking for a tarot card deck. I walked out with The Faerie's Oracle, a deck that would help me on my journey through the years to come. The art is amazing, the Faeries seem to dance and glow before your eyes, and the messages always seem to have a positive underlying theme, whatever the circumstances may be. A wonderful tool for introspection and self-discovery. I look into the cards much less these days, and have not read through the book in years, but the helpfulness and insight of this amazing deck still lingers. Now having lost the original, a deck that had been bent, soaked travelled and torn over the years, I'm looking forward to getting The Faerie's Oracle for the second time, and rediscovering it's magic again."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I actually purchased this a long time ago but have just gotten to writing a review.The cards in this deck are beyond beautiful and accompanied by a thick book of descriptions and ways to read your cards.I have found it very easy to channel myself in these cards and have never once made a wrong reading because this set is very open to beginners as I was. The beauty of the cards never ceases and the ways they constantly connects to each other and as you become more grounded you will find yourself loving this deck more and more.I high recommend you pick this one up and explore the Faeries' Oracle and all it's tales."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I went through several tarot decks until I found this one. I brought it for myself as a 16th birthday present, years ago. I fell in love immediately. The artwork on the cards is beautiful and the book is full of exercises to get you familiar with the cards. It also has great descriptions of each card's meaning.I've owned this deck for 8 years, and not once have I had a problem with it. I believe each person just has to find out what works for them, so I can't say it will definitely work for everyone, but it's never once let me down. I treasure these cards probably more so than anything else I have. And so do my friends! They love getting readings from them.If you're interested in the Faerie and are thinking of trying them out, I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This is a lovely little book I've had for a long time.

Very happy with my purchase !"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"If you work with, or want to work with, the Faery beings, this lovely oracle deck can help bring you into contact with the Faery realms. It can be used as a meditative tool, as keys for connecting with certain Faery, or even contacting your Faery contacts who help you within the Other Realms. One thing I love is that the writer of the book and the artist push you to develop your own relationship with the Fey rather than rely soley on the book for interrpretations which is as it should be!Hail to the Faeries!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I originally purchased these cards for a friend (on a whim) but when I saw them I was so enchanted by them I kept them for myself! (I'll order another set for the friend.) Their energy is delightful, intense, and a welcome change from the standard tarot deck. I like that the accompanying book is a hard-back and have found it a very useful guide to the cards. Users/collectors of tarot or other oracle-type cards should definitely give these a try."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"this oracle has a really good, detailed first part, where in the authors explain everything you need to know not only about getting started with this deck but also everything you need to know about starting to contact the inhabitants of Faery. playful but serious at the same time."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I'm a huge fan of Brian Froud.

There's so much magic in this deck."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I am a collector of oracle decks, and I enjoy doing readings from the different decks. This is one of my favorites, and one of the most lovely. The illustrations by Brian Froud are simply amazing, there are those that are depicted as beatiful, some are 'darker', and others plain whimsical. The companion book provides lots of useful and handy information for those keen on doing readings, both for themselves, and for others. There is extensive explanation on the different faerie folk cards, each explained in meticulous detail. Simply put, this is a wonderful oracle deck that will delight, enthrall & enlighten."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I love the art, I love the spirit of the deck, I love the variety, the wonder. It is exquisite."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I've had this deck for many years (since 2001). When I first looked through the cards, the images were frightening to me. I did not like most of them. I had tried to use the deck a couple of times and the results were fine, I just did not like the faces looking back at me. I decided to sell it. I wanted to put the cards in numerical order to get the set ready for selling. The cards REFUSED to go in order. They started jumping away, flying across the floor. When I finally got the majority of them together, I realized it was the same 3 cards that kept popping out of the pile. So, I \\"read\\" them. These cards were telling me that I needed to:pause to really think about what I was doing,have a clear mind & be honest with myself,and spend time exploring the faery world.Well, if these cards are powerful enough to force me to listen like that, they are worth keeping. Once I made the decision to *not* sell them, they went smoothly back together. Now it is 2010 and I have not looked at them or other cards in years. Yet for some reason, the deck is sitting on my desk and I am writing this \\"review.\\" I guess it is finally time for me to work with the faery, maybe I'm not so scared anymore, maybe I *can* handle the truth. :)I know this isn't a typical review, but I really felt the need to share my experience with these special cards. If you bought this deck and feel it's not your style, try to set them aside for a while...apparently if you own them, you are meant to and they will call you back when it's time."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"An oracle that is unlike all other card oracles, the Faerie's Oracle buzzes with fae energy. The descriptions of the fae folk adoring the cards are moving, insightful, silly and downright hilarious, but always right on the spot.Brian Froud's faery pictures are impressive - they really make the faery folk come alive. Some of them favorites (the Maiden, the cutest faery child you've ever seen), some of them familair 'pests' (the Fee Lion, O, that Gnome!) who only want to get us on the right track! Honestly! Even when they have to trip us up!Some of them are unsettling, even a little scary - but only when you've not befriended them yet. I think. Ahem.And, unlike you might expect from a faery oracle, there are cards to represent the major forces in the universe - Unity, the Masculine, the Feminine, etc.The accompanying hardcover booklet is beautiful and rich in information, the cards not too big and not too small, and easy to shuffle. The only complaint I can possibly come up with is the title font on the cards - very stylish but a little hard to read.Use them for traditional spreads, use them for meditation, set them on your desk for inspiration and guidance.Above all, enjoy them!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I bought this FaeryOracle card set simply because of my love of Faeries. Little did I know that it would become my inseparable companion.The cards themselves are stunning, featuring Brian Froud's outstanding Faery artworks. But they are not your everyday pretty Faeries, they are serious and sometimes a bit scary, following in his 'Good Faery/Bad Faery' book's footsteps.However, what really makes this set of cards incredible and addicting is Jessica MacBeth's book that comes with it. She is absolutely inspiring, bringing these cards to life with an insight into their meaning that will astonish you.Unless you already have some psychic or clairvoyant type experience, read the book before you start using the cards. And even then, when you analyze them as suggested, follow this by reading Jesa's interpretation of each card. You will find that even the cards that seem dark and scary have a brighter and hopeful side to them.But be warned, if you are a believer and get into them, you will get completely hooked!I never even had a card reading before, or seen an Oracle Card set of any kind, and I had many doubts that I could follow or interpret them. I joined Jesa's online FaeryOracle Group, and I have found it a great help in getting over my doubts.Today, only several months since buying this set, my life has completely changed, and my ability to work with the cards is incredible. I use it together with Doreen Virtue's \\"Healing with the Fairies\\" oracle cards in \`multiple deck readings', and they complement each other brilliantly.Wouldn't be without it."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I saw this deck in a bookstore and it was all I could think of for days. Finally I bought it, but was slightly dissapointed a little at first.I hadn't even cracked open the book when I tried to use the cards, but it just wouldn't work with the methods I use for my other decks of Oracle Cards. Frustrated, I left the cards on my bookshelf for a few days.I have always felt like I have had a spiritual connection with Goddesses, Faeries, Dragons, Unicorns, so I never felt too much of a need to start a new connection process with this deck. But, that was just as I needed. I followed the book's intructions on how to connect with the cards, and like the pro I was with understanding the other cards I have, I soon began to understand these as well.Once I really started to understand these fairies, I felt that the results were much better. I also have become a bit more cheerful as well. :DIf you like fairies a lot, I highly reccomend this deck. I would say this is a 15+ deck though...younger kids might not find the nudity as artistic as I did."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I picked up the Faeries' Oracle here on Amazon, and expected much due to all the wonderful reviews. The minute i opened the box i got even more than i expected. The art is beautiful, the cards are accurate, and the book is written in a way that is so simple to understand. Within 2 days of reviewing the cards, I was giving accurate and precise readings. I now have been practicing for well over a month, and a handful of the readings have already turned up true. Words cannot explain my love for these cards, and once people realize that the land of Faery is around them, they will get this unbreakable connection. I now KNOW that faery exists, and you the reader can learn how to use their advice to create a better life for yourself and others. To create a strong relationship between you and Faery just do these simple things.Acknowledge Faery creatures are with you everyday.Talk to Faery while doing readings.Accept their advice.Learn to laugh and enjoy what they are telling you.Thank Faery.AND HAVE FUN! REMEMBER THIS IS NOT TAROT!!!"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"This product is an amazing piece of work Brian Froud has done a magnificant job when it comes to the drawing on the cards. The book explains step by step how to do and work with the oracle. Ipersonally do not recommend this to beginners for they might get a little discouraged when having to do the necessary steps to understand the deck and making their own interputations for each and every card. I love this deck and would recommend it to everyone"},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I was definately drawn to this set. It is beautiful and it is REAL. But if you are new to using oracles and tarot, as I am, it will be difficult to use. I didn't know the the difference between oracles and tarot. In fact, because of nieveness I was a little shocked by them. After a bit more studing I realized that these cards were a much &quot;truer&quot; portrayal of the fae folk. I'm glad I have them, I'm just not ready for them yet."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"As soon as I bought these cards, I could read them -- though I hadn't before read divination cards. The art work is unique and brave, full of emotion and color. There's a blank card for the reader to personally illustrate, which adds a nice touch. They're not for young children or those who want only 'pretty and nicey nice art'. I do readings all the time using them and find them easy, entertaining and the fairies are adorable. A good set of beginner cards and for those art collectors who can see a tie between the earth and sexuality and natural energies."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"I began reading Tarot cards 3 years ago, and I now collect cards and books on the subject. I recently acquired this to my collection and I was pleasantly surprised by the breathtaking beauty of the artwork and decisiveness of the book. If you own only one set of divination cards, this should be it. Lovely and in hardbound too! I have been critisized and persecuted for my fascination in any religion but Christianity, but when I showed someone this delightful Tarot, they immediately loved it, no matter their faith. Highly, highly, recommended."},{"Title":"The Faerie's Oracle","review":"What I loved about these cards is the way that you are personally involved in the reading and the meanings of the cards themselves. The faeries are often very direct in what they want to tell you with this deck."},{"Title":"We Are Children Just the Same: Vedem, the Secret Magazine by the Boys of Terezin","review":"As the daughter of one of the authors I have heard all the stories of the holocaust and how the boys of room L417 found refuge in &quot;Vedem&quot; without their parents. I believe strongly that had the boys survived they would have shared a lot with the world. By simply reading a few lines of Petr Ginz's poems,art and stories you realise that he would have excelled had he had the chance which unfortunetely was cruelly torn from him. Even worse is the fact that he was not alone. Most readers do not realise that they were little boys who were taken out of their homes and away from all that they knew before the age 15 and some as young as 10.This book relates to children because it does not describe in detail the horrors but more so the small &quot;joys&quot; of the camp. Adults can relate because the work and articles emit the feelings of the citizens in hell. Therefore this book is truly a wonderful piece of work. For those who are interested: the book will be published in paperback soon."},{"Title":"We Are Children Just the Same: Vedem, the Secret Magazine by the Boys of Terezin","review":"I have toured the USA with a production of BRUNDIBAR, the children's opera from Theresienstadt, for two years and I served on the Alabama Holocaust Commission. To truly understand Theresienstadt (Terezin) and the Holocaust this is a MUST read. Here, in their own words are relfections, poetry, and day to day recollections of Hitler's &quot;model camp&quot; known as Theresienstadt through the eyes of the boys from L417 who were between 12-14 years old. The book details the beginnings of the &quot;Republic of Shkid&quot; and using photographs, poetry, and authentic works of art, the book gives the reader a truly rare and inspiring glimpse into concentration camp life.

Haven't read all of it yet but would reccommend it to others with simular interest."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"I like the way this book is organized. It places psychic development in the larger context of life, by explaining everything in terms of relationships: relationships with other people, with the planet, and with our unique spiritual essence.The tone of the book is light, friendly, and fun. The exercises are explained in simple steps. And the authors give many real world examples of how psychic work can have positive impact on everyday life.All in all, it's enjoyable reading, and gives enough material for exploration to keep a person busy for years. I've read some other books on the subject, this one's my favorite."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"This book contains a lot of great basic information and numerous exercises for expanding your psychic awareness. Also, the descriptions of the various chakras are excellent. I had no idea for example that we all have hand and feet chakras, as well as four chakras above and below us. I also discovered each person's aura is quite complex with several different layers that correspond to each chakra.The book's first chapter starts off not surprisingly with grounding exercises, running earth and cosmic energy. Always good to start with basics. The next chapter discusses the various chakras. Subsequent chapters discuss topics like distinguishing your energy from others, cords and how to &quot;dissolve&quot; them, &quot;screens,&quot; aura layers and repairing them if needed.I found the book along with all the various exercises, to be fascinating and plan to refer to it often in the future as I expand my psychic awareness."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"I have been interested in the human energy field and the process of self-healing for several years. I have read many books on this subject and tried several different healing systems.&quot;Basic Psychic Development&quot; is the book that I refer to over and over again. The dynamics of how our experiences, and the energy of others can affect us, and vice versa are simply and beautifully explained. The excercises given to explore these issues are simple, and quite fun to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who is ready to go on an adventure of self discovery and self healing."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"I found the book to give great insight into the use of one's psychic abilities. It leads the reader step-by-step into the most important aspects of psychic development. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about developing their psychic abilities. Having been a practicing psychic for over thirty years I found this to be a wonderful work of art. Using this book can help a person the beginner, and adept alike. It is filled with practical wisdom that is usable and easily understood. The language of this book is clear and concise again making it easy to use and practice. I urge my friends to buy this book, and I use it my self having remarkable results."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"The word &quot;practical&quot; easily applies to this book--much like one of John Friedlander's other books, The Practical Psychic. This book is full of down-to-earth and literally &quot;connecting to the earth&quot; advice about living in a physical world with more awareness that you ever imagined possible. Beginning exercises include grounding and running earth and cosmic energies complete with helpful diagrams and full explanations of each step. The reader quickly graduates to exercises directed at cleansing the chakras, learning easy and simple techniques to clear energy blocks, past, present and future. Next comes helpful advice for distinguishing personal energy from the energy of others. Awareness leads to the ability to cleanse the chakras of &quot;stuck&quot; energy and shed the intrusion of other's energies. Once the reader has bookmarked and practiced these exercises over and over, a sense of freedom, lightness and clarity rarely achieved in a lifetime is the expected result. The reader is ready to move on to achieving a profound place within to connect with Higher Self, your God of the Heart. With a sense of humor throughout, the reader can finally gain access to &quot;a gentle state of neutrality, one of the most powerful and effective tools for dealing with difficult situations,&quot; the core of the entire practice. Neutrality is not the absence of emotions, but rather it is &quot;an opening up to the complexity, subtlety, and multidimensionality of emotions and experience.&quot; Eventually the reader is able to find an increase in compassion, both personal and for others. This compassion leads to a state of forgiveness, both for yourself and for others, and the creation of a place of gentle acceptance of the self and the absence of blame and guilt. Add this book to your tool kit for forging a new self for practical living in the new millennium."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"First of all, let me tell you that this is book is full of very useful exercises that'll aid you in developing and clearing your charkas and aura, and THEN acquiring psychic abilities. Do not expect to get the lotto's numbers or more frivolous insights from this training. BPD provides the serious spiritual journeyman with very helpful tools to develop our often-denied spiritual side.The authors explore deeply our relation with ourselves, our close ones and our bigger self: Our true divine nature. But be warned, this book requires a lot of discipline for practicing on a constant basis the many exercises described in the book, which mainly consist in powerful meditations and visualizations that clear charkas and aura.Very informative and easy readable, this book is a must for the spiritual and psychic individual."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"I have been studying various areas of metaphysics for over 20 years and the information in &quot;Basic Psychic Development&quot; is truly some of the most useful and helpful that I have come across. And because of its simplicity, it is good for both the beginner as well as the non-beginner. The journey can be as basic and simple or as colorful and deep as each person chooses it to be. The techniques work for any level of approach. However, as the authors lightly remind you, a sense of humor is always helpful.&quot;Basic Psychic Development&quot; provides basic, useful instruction about our energy fields and centers in an easy to understand format, with a lightness that is sometimes difficult to find in books about this subject. The techniques that John and Gloria have expertly written about in this book have facilitated my psychic development, but for me, more importantly, they have helped me to clear out a lot of unwanted &quot;stuff&quot;, energetically speaking. Which often reflects on the physical level, as well.This is information that I personally wish had been available to me as a child. I recommend this book to those who would like a hands on, no mumbo jumbo approach to psychic development and clearing tools. And for the advanced practitioner, my experience is that it can only enhance whatever system one is already using.I have purchased this book for a number of people, the two most important being my own children. I feel it is a must-have for the personal library.Thanks, John and Gloria...."},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"I personally enjoyed this book. The exercises are great. They can be a bit long. After all, you have to sit in a chair and close your eyes and follow meditations that have anywhere from 4 or 16 different steps. The best advice I can give anyone is to have someone read you the meditations while you focus with eyes closed. Otherwise you'd be sitting trying to focus with a book in your hands only to have to open them to read the next step.

The author provides only one way to do each exercise and each reads more as a cooking recipe than an inspired guide to psychic and spiritual awakening. (The author literally prescribes mixing 90% cosmic energy with 10% earth energy during your meditation!)

At the time I came across the material presented in this book, I considered myself devoid of psychic ability, even while desiring it strongly. Having read the book and practiced the exercises, I realised that I did have an ability, and that what increased it was more practice. Given my strong scientific and rational upbringing and education (I write mathematical software), the basic premise of the material was exactly what I needed: stop worrying about what should make sense and explore a different direction, just to see if something new and interesting presents itself. This book makes no claim to contain the ultimate truth (I used to look specifically for that) or even verifiable facts. Instead, it proposes a system that says why this or that might be a good idea (pick and choose). The way I see it, this book contains loads of pre-information. Having processed some of those ideas and suggestions, my outlook has expanded dramatically, and yes, being psychic (just a little :) is quite useful in daily life and pretty fun !Gilbert Choudury (Gloria Hemsher's husband)"},{"Title":"Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra & Clairvoyance","review":"This isn't what I expected when I bought the book. I thought it would give general info like all the other books that I have read. This book from front to back is basically exercises that you do, to clear yourself and gain focus.

I met Gloria and found out that she offers classes. The classes (based on the book) are wonderful.

Its a great way to get introduced into using psychic tools."},{"Title":"Don't Pat the Wombat!","review":"I am sixteen years old and Australian. Don't Pat The Wombat was my favourite book when I was ten, and I recently reread it. I'd forgotton how funny and accurate it was.First, some background information about the setting. Despite what it may appear, the kids are not going to summer camp. They are going to school camp. The difference is, it happens during school time, and not during summer. The summer holidays happen over Christmas, and they only last for six weeks, so no summer camp. Edwina and Helmut are not counsellors. They are backpackers how happened to be in the area. Also, the slang is fairly accurate, if I recall primary school correctly.Don't Pat The Wombat is about a group of boys in year six, who have called themselves the Coconuts. They're the troublemakers of their class. A few weeks before camp, they become friends with a new kid named Jonah, who is from a rural area. Jonah makes enemies with Brian Cromwell, a cruel teacher that the Coconuts have nicknamed the Bomb, because he explodes. They go to camp in the bush, and have fun. Most of the book is taken up with the description of the fun, but towards the end it develops a more serious theme. Jonah starts opening up slightly, and has an encounter with the Bomb.The book has a very light hearted tone, which is why I think I loved it so much. You could count the serious bits on the fingers of one hand. The characters are believable twelve-year-olds, and act in a believable way. I was never one of the troublemakers myself, but I remember school camp, before popularity became everything and kids still listened to the teachers. And the lollies, who could forget the lollies?Elizebeth Honey has written a few other novels, of which the Stella Streets are the closest in tone to this one. I'd recomend those as well."},{"Title":"Don't Pat the Wombat!","review":"Remember summer camp in all it's wonderful, horrible glory? Elizabeth Honey does and she brings the memories back to life with this outrageous and funny tale about a group of Aussie sixth grade boys (known as the Coconuts and later, the Convicts) off to camp.Narrated by Mark (or &quot;Exclamation Mark&quot;), he gives us the tell-all tales about his friends and their antics. They befriend newcomer Jonah, who takes on the Convict's ultimate nemesis, teacher Mr. Cromwell, a.k.a. the Bomb. (&quot;Cromwell at camp is like Darth Vader at your birthday party.&quot;)This a frenetic and fun book, documenting the misadventures of outback camplife (complete with mud fights, exploring, an end-of-camp pageant and of course, wombats!Definately worth a read!"},{"Title":"Don't Pat the Wombat!","review":"It's no secret that there are thousands of fantastic unknown children's books out there. I would even go so far as to estimate that over 60% of the best kid books disappear without so much as a ripple under the waves of subsequently published literature. So this is all the more reason to appreciate a well-written unknown book when you find it. That book, such as it is, is Elizabeth Honey's \\"Don't Pat the Wombat\\". A fine frolicsome Aussie import, this tale of kids, camp, and canoes is one of the best kept secrets in fiction today. And it's freakin' hilarious.The plot follows a group of roughly ten year-old boys called The Coconuts. They named themselves that after the narrator(nickname: Exclamation Mark)'s mom drove them around singing, \\"I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts...\\" The other boys include Wormz, Nicko, Azza, Mitch, and Jonah. Jonah, to be honest, is the real hero of this tale. A calm silent boy, Jonah earns the wrath of the school's most dreaded teacher, The Bomb. When the boys head out for summer camp (an event that included not only the boys but their teachers from school and two parents) it's just their bad luck that The Bomb comes along for the ride.First of all, this book is undoubtedly one of the funniest I've read in a very long time. Funny books never get any respect, you know. Not adult funny books, nor children's funny books. This is a story where the narrator's mom plays on a basketball team called The Cellulites. The pictures, supposedly drawn by the author, are a hoot and a holler (and frighteningly similar to pictures an actual ten year-old would draw). And the storyline has the boys pulling the kind of innocent pranks you'd expect of them. I was particularly taken with a moment where the boys (after a rousing mud fight) decided to play dead to see what their German counselor Helmut would do:\\"Oh, they're dead!\\" goes Helmut. \\"What a pity, I'd better bury them,\\" and he started shoveling mud on us.It's that kind of story. On top of that, there's some interesting Australian language to grapple with. America is the kind of country that takes great pains in changing words in the Harry Potter books that appear \\"too British\\" for delicate American children's ears. Apparently, Australian slang is a completely different matter. Initially I was quite taken aback by the amount of words I either couldn't understand or couldn't pronounce. Here's a great example. It describes the teacher nicknamed Chook:\\"If something goes right, she says, \`Jolly beaut!' and if something goes wrong, she goes, \`Blinking heck!' For something amazing, she says, \`By jingo!' She wears Daisy Duck shoes\\".The book's full of this kind of thing. When a boy calls his teacher a nerd his mother patiently corrects him and says the terms he's looking for is \\"duffer\\". Slang includes words like \\"derr\\" as well. I mean, I think it's great! More books should be coming into our country with these kinds of words. But if you're not prepared for them, it's a bit of a shock.If I have any objections with this book it's that it's too darn short. Too short by far. You finally are beginning to get a little more insight into the characters and before you know it, time's up! Story's done. All in all, however, I consider this book one of the lost greats. It'd make a fantastic read-aloud to those students that are reluctant to read. The characters are likable, the plot is quick, and the photos and pictures very funny. For a sure fire crowd pleaser (if they can get past the slang) give this book a try. The funniest Australian children's book I have ever, or may ever, read."},{"Title":"Don't Pat the Wombat!","review":"Elizabeth Honey is the author of Don't Pat the Wombat has a great idea for a book.

I had the honor to speak with Mr. Kaufman and counsel with him for an hour. Talking with him was like talking with an old friend.

It is useful to anyone at any level of understanding of tarot, from the newest novice to the practitioner. The authors provide a historical understanding of the use and symbols of tarot. They then go on to show how to use the tarot to increase your self understanding or to answer questions for yourself or others. It is not a &quot;cookbook&quot;, giving quick recipes for using the cards. Instead it is a guide to using your own intuition and ability to understand the symbols on the cards. Those looking for a black/white easy answer cook book may be disappointed. But those who are looking for an easy to understand guide to learning to read tarot on their own will find this book a must for their library.

I have already learned so much from it and given myself two of the clearest, most on-target readings I've had. My ONLY criticism is that it's so much information, I wish it could have tabs or page markers so the reader can quickly access the various sections. Nothing a little dog-earing hasn't helped!

I had always looked at the Complete Idiots Guides as books for the rest of us, not lectures passed down from on high. Here was a book that I could read and see how to open up to my intuition, and trust it! Arlene and Lisa have written a readable guide, adding humor and wit to tell a true story. Each card is defined with a figure I can relate too, and given relevance to my daily life. There are a variety of methods to read Tarot in the book and each one has clear instructions on how to read them. I especially like the side bars and quotes from Arlene's Classes.

Nothing worse than getting your first tarot deck and then having to buy a book written by some &quot;tarot expert&quot; so they can tell you the meanings of every card. Unfortunately Tarot doesnt work that way. What I love the most about this book is it teaches you how to interpret each card by allowing your innate intuitive abilities to come forth and to tell you what the cards mean. The book has you work through each card in the Major and Minor Arcana one by one and allows you to paint your own portrait of what is going on in the card and what it translates to in someone's lives. There is nothing &quot;idiotic&quot; about this book. If you have always wanted to &quot;custom-make&quot; your own tarot readings and meanings, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"One of the better books on Tarot currently available. I found the descriptions of the imagery used in the Universal Waite deck to be very useful, and the spreads included were fun to use, not just the same old spreads found in every book. I did find the organization to be counter-intuitive, however, what with the court cards coming before the pips. Also, I would have appreciated it if some of the examples of readings shown were more realistic--apparently, the people the authors read for have ideal lives and nothing ahead but great things, which is not generally the case for me and those for whom I read."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"This book is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to read the tarot. I have studied tarot for a couple of years and am always looking at tarot books; this book has the most up to date, comprehensive information that I have found. It takes you through a logical path of learning and has excellent exercises to help you tune into your intuition, learn the meanings of the cards, and learn to read the story the cards are trying to tell you."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"I have a few books on Tarot, and to be honest with you, this has to be my most favorite book on the subject. The meanings are easy enough for novice, and note worthy for the experienced Tarot reader. You will get excellent descriptions of each card, both major and minor. As well as excellent interpretations of the meanings for both upright and upside down cards. I found this book to be excellent, and whenever I need references, I turn to it, as I am never disappointed. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"The book is very well written and offers many tidbits for easier understanding. It does not goes too deep into the religious meanings and heavy symbology, it goes straight to the point. I also bought another book in this same topic and it was good too but it was heavy reading sometimes needing several reads in order to get the point. With this book all it takes is one read in order to understand the meaning of the cards.I found this book very useful to crosscheck meanings with other books when I read for myself or to others. Sometimes the meanings this book gives me are easier to understand or make more sense than other books.I would recommend it to anyone starting out in Tarot."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"I always say, you can't go wrong with an Idiot's Guide, and this book is proof! The authors do a great job in not only providing card interpretations but creating a structure for the reader to expand on those interpretations and come up with their own system of divination. Each card is explored in a logical progression, with upright and reversed meanings as well as worksheets for the reader and hints on relating the card to the everyday environment. Then there's the famous Idiot's Guide hints on each page about the information covered. Tips for different spreads and for designing your own spread are also included.The additional information on different fortune telling systems seemed like an afterthought to me, but that hardly diminishes the book's usefulness."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"In a word: Thorough.

It makes Tarot accessible. Although I've been &quot;trying&quot; to read the cards for years, I'd never bothered to read more than the Little White Books that came with the decks I'd collected. THIS book showed me how much more one can get out of Tarot.The only flaw I've found so far is that they throw the Celtic Cross at you without enough preparation, before explaining what each position in the spread is all about...if I were an absolute newcomer to Tarot that would probably have intimidated me. If you have not been exposed to Tarot much before, maybe that's a section you should skip and come back to. But I must give the book 5 stars because of how much it's helped me. Don't let this be the ONLY book you read, but I do think it's a Must Read for beginners. :)"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune-Telling","review":"Hey hey -- need someone to inspire you to live a prag-magical life?

It's soul-satisfying, yet honest and sincere in its desire to tell you the truth about your personal fortune, past, present and future. If you ever want to recommend a book to someone who thinks the paranormal is baloney, this is the book for you.

Arlene, and I'm sure Lisa is to, is an amazing person to be around. Not only is this book easy to follow, it also is humerous. For each of the cards Descriptions they also include an archetype. For example Temperance's archetypes are Penelope (From Homer's, The Odysse), Aunt Em, Hillary Rodham Clinton and your dog. See what I mean?.

In Chapter 1 he describes a young family, then describes the exploits of some of the boys of the family, now grown-up, in Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5. But in Chapter 5 there is introduced a story about a schoolboy who is nothing to do with the Thorogoods, though it is quite a good story, parts of it reminding one of \\"Martin Rattler,\\" and his days at school. In Chapter 6 we are back to one of the Thorogood boys, who is a missionary in London, working among the poor. The final chapter also contains a long story about a third party, and ends with most of the family emigrating to the Rockies in North America. Here again the enwrapped short story is a good read.We must remember that in Ballantyne's usual style there are often two stories in some way running parallel with each other. In this case there are no less than six, and two of those enwrap a further story. It is really quite unusual for Ballantyne to write in such a convoluted manner.But be not afraid. The stories are very short. Ballantyne normally writes with each of his chapters nearly of the same length, but here we have 7, 6, 7, 8, 23, 9, 36 pages in the seven chapters, and it consists of at least ten exciting episodes. It is worth a read."},{"Title":"Hoping for Hope","review":"Liddy is having an extremely bad week - job loss, philandering husband, no sex in 5 years with him and suddenly pregnant. For a woman about to turn 50, Liddy's life seems like the life of a twenty something turned decidedly sour.While the book has redeeming value as a light read, Clare has used a dictionary of cliche's to come up with an over the top story. A controlling older daughter, a bulemic younger daughter and a gay son - the situation is completely predictable. The most vived characters in the book are the 90-something lesbian great-aunts Cleo and Cyn. In the mess of everything that's happened, all Liddy wants is to make things right with her husband who feels he needs to decide between her and his lover. (Honestly, would you take a cheating man back?)Although the book is very predictable, I actually enjoyed the light, simple read - I could even understand the British vocab. Not bad if you don't want something as depressing as Oprah picks."},{"Title":"Hoping for Hope","review":"Liddy Claver thinks she is going through the change. Well, in a way she is, just not what she thinks. At fifty, she is pregnant and learns that her husband is cheating on her with a friend. What's more, the baby's father is not her husband, just a much younger man she had a fling with several months ago. She is also now jobless, her adult ed class having been eliminated.Before Liddy can find the courage to tell her husband, or anyone in her family what has happened, her lesbian, very old aunt needs her to come and take care of her while she recovers from an illness. On her way back home, Liddy goes into premature labor and winds up having to stay in Cornwall a bit longer. Hope, her new child, is almost two weeks old before anyone in the family other than the aunt finds out about her.Liddy's husband is hurt and leaves her. Her grown children's reactions are varied. For their own reasons, each wants to adopt Hope. One daughter sees the baby as a way to save her flagging relationship with her male roommate. The gay son finds her the ideal solution to his and his partner's desire for a baby. The last daughter feels obligated to adopt Hope, as she is the only one with a stable home and family. While all these generous offers are touching, perhaps, Liddy feels quite capable of taking care of her daughter herself. That remains to be seen.***** Unlike most British imports, this novel does not confuse the American reader with unfamiliar terms. Liddy's situation is a unique one, and so is her family. With guts and determination, she handles a life where if it's not one thing, it's three, with grace and aplomb. Humor and tears will be replete in this too unreal not to be real book. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"Basics of Legal Document Preparation","review":"I got my item fast and in the conditions better than expected.

It is a juggling act as well, at times a conventional historical account and at times something closer to cultural studies. It is an impressive performance, and only at the end does Horten drop one of the juggling pins to the floor.With war propaganda embedded in ads and advertisements embedded in war propaganda - and both embedded in listeners' favorite programs - domestic public relations began to take a new turn. Horten writes sensitively about the interplay between different genres of programming and about the officially sponsored messages they now incorporated. Nor does he neglect the times when programs managed to undermine the official messages. The result is an excellent and multifaceted study that breaks new ground in radio history.The book's epilogue, unfortunately, moves into a new territory, plunging suddenly into the much larger topic of America's \\"privatized\\" postwar culture. In this book, the meaning of privitization is shaky; it seems to refer more to the private sphere than to the private sector, though at times even that distinction gets blurred.Why does Horten conclude an otherwise well-focused study with a broad new topic that he lacks adequate room to explore? Because one of the themes of the book is that this cultural shift, however you choose to define it, began during World War II, not afterward, and that it can be seen in the wartime alignment of private advertising and public propaganda. It is a substantial and defensible point, and I am glad he makes it, but I wish he had left it at that, reserving the larger social speculations for his next book."},{"Title":"Radio Goes to War: The Cultural Politics of Propaganda during World War II","review":"This book provides an indepth look at radio as a political and social tool for propaganda during WW11 and provides another insight into America during WW11."},{"Title":"Radio Goes to War: The Cultural Politics of Propaganda during World War II","review":"Horton makes a very useful contribution to media studies during WWII. I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is the first book within media studies to deal exclusively with radio propaganda during the war. As this was by far Americans' most important source of news and entertainment the lack of attention is curious.However, \\"Independent Review\\" in Oakland hits the nail on the head. The ending is very weak. I think the \\"discourse of privatization\\" that he identifies certainly provided ideological bullets for the fight against global communism during the 1950's, but (as \\"independent review\\" has already stated) that's another book."},{"Title":"The Everything Pregnancy Nutrition Book: What To Eat To Ensure A Healthy Pregnancy (Everything (Parenting))","review":"I found this book dated and misleading.

Hess has written a book that will replace Stewart for more than 40 years. While a master of the sources, Hess is a thoughtful military historian and a writer of a judicious narrative. I have been reading, writing and teaching about the Civil War since 1960 (and graduated from Gettysburg College) and Hess tells me things that I never knew or failed to consider. This is an essential book on the Battle of Gettysburg and one of the better military history works at the beginning of the new century."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"For many people, Pickett's July 3, 1863 charge up Cemetery Ridge is the climactic event of the Battle of Gettysburg and the defining moment of the Civil War. Earl J. Hess has written a detailed, scholarly account of Pickett's charge which draws copiously upon contemporary sources. His book is clear and easy to follow, given the subject matter, and is poignant to read. I found myself riveted to his account.I found a major virtue of the book was the manner in which Hess shifted his focus back and forth from the Confederate to the Union side of the line. The book begins with a discussion of the planning of the charge, focusing on the interactions between Lee and Longstreet. This is followed by two chapters dealing with, respectively, the disposition of the Confederate troops before the attack and the Union lines before the attack. I found this invaluable in helping me understand the events of the day and their sequence.Hess follows this discussion with a discussion of the Confederate cannonading barrage, and the Union response, that proceeded the infantry advance. Again, he shifts his focus from the Confederate side of the line, and the effect of the cannonading on the Union, to the Union response and its effect on the Confederacy. He spends a great deal of time explaining the decision of the Union artillerists to hold their fire and the disagreement this decision provoked with General Hancock. This theme pervades the book and is well-treated. Hess concludes that the cannonading was about one hour in duration before the infantry charge,(i.e. from about 1:00p.m. to 2:00p.m.) contrary to some other accounts which make it substantially longer.There are detailed discussions of the Confederate infantry advance to the Emmitsburg Road, to the Stone Fence, and, for a small number of intrepid southern soldiers, over the wall and into the Union lines. We learn about the Union artillery and infantry responses and about their effect on the charge at each stage.There is an excellent but somewhat brief chapter on the repulse of the charge and on the subsequent Confederate retreat back to Virginia. There is an excellent chapter discussing the careers of the principle protagonists of the battle following the events of July 3 through the end of the War and beyond.The book lays a great deal of emphasis on the topography of the battlefield, the hills, ridges, swales, and fences which played a major role in the fighting of July 3. But the key emphasis on the book is on the fighting men on both sides -- on their determination and their heroism. Hess argues that the activities of the troops and their immediate commanders were more important to the results of the day than the decisions of the generals.Hess has many thoughtful things to say about the attack, its planning, and about its possibilities for success. He finds the attack a long chance indeed but is able to present a convincing case about why Lee believed he needed to try. Hess is highly critical of James Longstreet for the manner in which he deployed the attacking divisions and for his failure to provide support to the attack. But he does not believe the attack would have succeeded even if Longstreet had carried out his responsibilities more aggressively. I learned a great deal from Hess's study.This book will help the reader understand the events of July 3. It shows why Pickett's charge, with its suffering, its folly, and its glory retains its hold on the imagination of many Americans."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Move over Stewart and other authors who have written about Pickett's Charge, Earl Hess is the new sheriff in town! Hess leaves the polictics and modern day views of the battle far away and gets down to just the battle itself. Hess is careful to explain Confederate positions on the morning of July 3rd with great detail. Gibbon and the First Corps, Hay's Division and other Federal Unit positions are closely written about as to time and place. The bombardment is covered from Confedarate and Union perspective which I found to be very helpful in questions that I had in understanding time and effect. Hess is careful in explaining not only Pickett's Division's crossing but also covers Pettigrew's assault completely. What is interesting is that each segment or piece of time of the battle is presented from both Union and Confederate view points. I liked reading about how Gibbon's Division prepared and fought as well as I liked reading about Pickett's men reaching the stone wall. Cadmus Wilcox's futile attempts to support Pickett along with evening accounts from both sides complete this lengthy and thorough book. Hess' exhaustive detail and care make this book an important asset to one understanding Pickett's Charge. Without a doubt it my new favorite on the subject."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"This book is about as well a researched work as I have seen in a while. That in itself is enough to gain high marks for Mr. Hess and his effort but there is more. The writing style is super. It is very hard for any writer to go into the details of a military action without the account becoming very dry. Mr. Hess does as good a job of this as I have ever seen. He does this be adding in personal stories from average soilders not just generals. At least that is how I think he does it but however he pulls it off this book is a great read. Sometimes one just can't put it down.I guess that being from Tennessee I was also happy to see that Mr. Hess gave due credit to the Tennessee and North Carolina troops involved in the attack. Hess points out that Lee simply used Pettigrew's division because it was handy even though it had been chewed up on July 1st. Still the division did well. Especially the the brigades from North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama. The only brigade to shame itself was indeed a Virginia brigade. Hess does a fine job of pointing out that almost every soilder involved on both sides answered the call of duty in fine fashion. The bravery of Union troops who could have broken and ran in the face of such an attack is often overlooked but not by Hess.Finally, Hess draws some conclusions at the end of the book with which the reader might not agree. Agree or not the book presents its case and allows the reader to decide for themselves after reading a clear argument for the conclusion.Any student of the Civil War or of Gettysburg needs this book. No matter how much a reader has learned about Gettysburg they will find new information here. Worth the price and more!"},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Earl J. Hess has written a masterful text on a topic not missed by many civil war authors. His treatment is almost minute by minute beginning with the artillery battle preceding the actual charge. Hess deals with the major players on both the confederate and union sides. I feel he is particularly accurate in his discussion about the lack of leadership exhibited by General Longstreet. While Longstreet objected to the attack, he did little to dissuade his commander. Once the attack was underway, Longstreet did little to lead as best he could. Instead he sat on a fence.Hess is also on target when he discusses the role of North Carolina and Virginian troops taking part in the attack. The Tar Heels have been maligned long enough for the actions of others.I really like the tender way in which Hess deals with the problems of the troops that made the attack. It is not widely known that some confederate soldiers may have faked heat exhaustion to avoid what they new to be a suicide attack. While Hess points this out, he avoids making judgements from the safety of nearly 140 years of separation in time.I highly recommend this book for those who have not read extensively about the battle and this charge in particular. Those that have read much on Gettysburg will appreciate the fresh approach of this author."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Mr. Hess purports to present the first tactical history of one of the most famous military actions of the Civil War. He therefore sets high expectations for himself. Mr. Hess does accomplish this forensic and encylopedic presentation, but either this approach to the subject or Hess's style is dry and emotionally unengaging. Hess does a great job in researching soldiers letters and accounts of events surrounding July 3, some of which see the light of day for the first time I have no doubt. These annecdotes are wonderful.Mr. Hess also does a good job in rebalancing the participation of Pettigrew's and Trimble's commands in the charge. Many accounts of this engagement focus on Pickett's Virginians, partly because these men appear to have left left a better aggregate record of their impressions soon after the fact, and partly as a result of post-war recollections and recriminations published by many general officers who were engaged in this battle, many of them Virginians. Partly too may be that as a group Virginians had better access to educations in the east than their western countrymen and were simply able to be more articulate.There are some gaps that are left to the imagination. A Confederate account of immediate post-charge impressions is thin. Is it due to lack of sources or just lack of presentation? Does Mr. Hess credit the account found in many histories that Lee lets loose his despair that night telling John Imboden, \\"Too bad, too bad, Oh too bad.\\" Did that happen? Is it post-war hyperbole? The account is extant but Hess is silent about what he knows about it. You are begging for a glimpse of Longstreet's post-charge movements that night or over the next few days. Who did he talk to? What was he thinking? Did Lee and Longstreet meet within the days following the attack? If Hess doesn't report it you are left to conclude it didn't happen, but is that an accurate conclusion? The Imboden encounter leaves a little doubt about how thorough the author could have been. If Mr. Hess sets himself such high expectations the reader has the obligation to raise an alert it if he seems to fall short."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Earl J. Hess has written one of the best researched accounts of Pickett's charge ever written. Working from primary sources with some secondary sources thrown in, Hess takes the reader through a step by step account of what happened on July 3, 1863. The author provides the reader with everything they need to understand the place this event holds in the battle of Gettysburg specifically, but also in the course of the war generally. The major actors; Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Pettigrew and others are revealed in detail. Hess also introduces voices often overlooked. In this case the foot soldier who made history. Enlisted and commissioned remembrances are used and both confederate and union participants are included. Due homeage is paid to the bravery of the confederates. However the author also reveals the courage of the union forces that repulsed the attack.For civil war buffs this is a must read."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Definitive study of Pickett's ChargeEarl Hess's well researched Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg is the definitive study of Gettysburg's final bloody battle on July 3, 1863. Hess spares no investigative resource in his exhaustive examination of all aspects of this crucial doomed attack. He breaks the attack down along chronological stages while examining all personal and logistical aspects. Mr. Hess further examines all tactical and strategic components of the doomed attack while comparing pros and cons of the event's reality in conjunction with other various possible outcomes. Could Pickett's Charge have worked? What if Pickett's Charge had broken the Union's center, what then? These and a myriad of other cogent questions were both asked and answered by Mr. Hess. Yes, the book is mind-numbing in its exhaustive detail but that is the beauty of this definitive history. Reading it I found myself totally immersed in the events of that hot July day when Marse Robert sent his wonderful boys to assault the unassailable, knowing that the possibility of victory was slight but still doing their duty in light of the most difficult of odds. Could success have been achieved? Yes, but everything had to go perfectly--IT DIDN'T. Mr. Hess's up close and personal examination of this horrific event was both illuminating and instructive. 5+ stars for a very well done historical monograph of the first order.Excellent in-depth analysis of not only the attack but also of the individuals involved. I liked how Mr. Hess informed the reader what happened to the various players after Gettysburg. I also liked how Mr. Hess discussed the insider bickering that follows every major historical event. Nothing ends with the last shot, there are always loose ends, blame, intrigue, what-ifs, dissembling, parsing, misinformation and yes even disinformation. History is written by the victors. Further, history is not what happened per se but rather what was /is written down. Mr. Hess cuts through the fog of Pickett's Charge to present an accurate portrayal of those most difficult hours on a very hot July 3rd afternoon. Good use of maps to keep the reader orientated and wonderful presentation of photographs to give the reader a personal connection to the men involved. Abundant facts and statistics that gives depth to the author's assertions and What If scenarios. I liked that Mr. Hess did NOT write from the typical POST analysis \\"the-attack-was-doomed\\" view. Rather, he presented the facts with clarity and critical analysis, and viewed the event from the perspective of the historical times involved. Mr. Hess is not a revisionist, but rather a critical chronicler of the event-A historical objectivist if you will. Most refreshing compared to the plethora of nuanced, subjective, historical relativism that dominates so many \\"sophisticated\\" histories today.Still, as I read Hess's account of Pickett's, Pettigrew's, and Trimble's men stepping off into glory I couldn't help but think of the immortal words of William Faulkner from his novel Intruder in the Dust, \\"....This Time. Maybe This Time...\\"Must read for Civil War history buffs. This is the definitive study of Pickett's Charge and will only gain in historical stature. Well done Earl Hess."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"As a Civil War historian myself, I'm only to pleases to recommend this and all of Earl Hess' other fine works. One of the best tactical studies to appear in a long while"},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Hess has written what probably is and will be for some time the definitive account of Pickett's/Pettigrew's/Trimble's/whatever charge.Hess presents the Union and Confederate (officer and enlisted) accounts of the charge and includes many details of what the men of both sides experienced. The narrative is engaging and keeps the reader's interest throughout the book.The main problem I had with the book was the maps - there simply are not enough. While the maps are of high quality and detailed, there are not nearly enough to correlate with Hess' intricate descriptions of the troop movements during the charge. Admittingly, I have found this to be a common problem in Civil War books. I am not a military historian or expert, I simply enjoy learning more about what sacrifices were made for our great country during the Civil War by men of both sides. On many occasions I had to flip back several pages to a map to better understand the descriptions of troop movements during the charge. Having about 10 more maps would have made this less frustrating and much easier to follow.Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as the definitive account of \\"The Charge\\". Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"Mr. Hess clears up the much muddled defense of the Bloody Angle on July 3, 1862. Layers of credit from many authors and looming statue of the 72nd Pennsylvania Fire Zouave at the Angle have stamped the impression that the 72nd Pennsylvania was the heroic defender of the Army of the Potomac.Mr. Hess, through meticulous research, establishes the little known fact that the 69th Pennsylvania was indeed the Union unitthat made the difference. Mr. Hess' book will be the standard work on Pickett's Charge for many decades in the future"},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"I am so happy with this book,i saw it in a library and wanted my own copy and am thrilled i now have one of my own.its in perfect condition thankyou for making it available."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"I can see that I am not in agreement with the few reviews that have been posted here before mine. Being a serious student of history whose focus is the Civil War, I can't say that I particularly liked this book. Normally, I like detail, but Hess goes into such minute detail in the first three chapters that it almost made my head hurt. For example, when he mentions and officer, he then digresses into a long dialog starting with that officer's past but then he often gets side-tracked on other officers as well. We often read about their childhood, schooling, and who their relatives were. Sometimes when he writes about the officers military record, it's difficult to tell if he is talking about the Civil War or the Mexican War. Unfortunately, that is likely to get him on yet another side-track. I am a detail person but Hess totally lost me in those chapters and I found my mind wandering. In fact, I almost stopped reading the book entirely which is something I rarely do. There was so much side-tracking, digression, and minute detail that I found it simply too confusing and, well - boring. But if you are the type of person who wants to know what General Jones's great grandmother ate for breakfast during the Revolutionary War (that's an exaggeration, of course, but not by much) then this book is for you. In my opinion, Hess really needs to trim the underbrush away so that the important points become more visible. That said, such information may be useful to someone working as a Gettysburg Park Service Ranger who leads tours of the battlefield but, even then, I can't imagine what such a person would want with all that detail. It is so loaded with detail that it fogs up the main topic like the artillery smoke during the bombardment did for the engaged troops before Pickett's Charge.I was going to stop reading the book when I decided to give it one more chance. Fortunately, chapter four switches to a more narrative style that tells the story in a way makes the subject emerge more clearly. It is loaded with details too but at a level that can be useful to the serious student of Gettysburg and it is organized better than Chapters 1 through 3. From chapter 4 on, there is less skipping around in time and side-tracking. In any case, this book is probably not for someone with a casual interest in Pickett's Charge or even a mildly serious interest, for that matter. There are much better books to serve those purposes. Much of this book reads as though it is a doctoral thesis, putting more emphasis on minute detail but losing sight of the real importance of Pickett's Charge.In the preface to the book, Hess tries to describe what he wants to accomplish with the book that other authors have not accomplished. The problem is that he spends more time criticizing others who have written about Pickett's Charge and not enough time explaining how his book is different from those efforts. In fact, after reading parts of the preface twice, I still have no idea what Hess's goal was. He explains what he is NOT going to try to accomplish but is not clear about what he IS going to strive for. That seems to be the problem that runs through this book - a lack of clarity. However, Hess can be forgiven because there apparently are people who want to know what General Jones's mother ate for breakfast during the Revolutionary War.I will add this book to my rather large Civil War collection but I don't think I would have purchased it if I had known what it was like beforehand. In the end, I don't think I learned a single important thing about Pickett's Charge that has not been covered many times before. On the other hand, Hess is to be commended for compiling such a detailed account of Pickett's Charge which should be useful to scholars on the subject. So it really comes down to how much detail one wants. If you are one who is already an expert on the subject but want to know extremely fine details about Pickett's Charge, this book is for you. There is no doubt that Hess did a fine job to that end. Even so, I think he could have organized the book better."},{"Title":"Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"I agree that the Battle of Gettysburg and Pickett's charge were actual events; However the rest of this book is fiction.General Lee is the one who ordered Picketts Charge, not General Longstreet.

I'm surprised this book made it to print. I'm even more surprised that the author can call herself a &quot;Security Expert&quot; and &quot;White-Hat Hacker&quot; with a straight face.Carolyn Meinel has the audacity to equate hacking with everything from altering your Windows start up screen to display (and I quote) &quot;elite haxor graphics&quot; to using telnet and writing email. Her writing style is severely lacking, unless you count spelling and grammatical errors (approx. 1 per page) and her apparent inability to articulate a coherent thought as style. Aside from that, technical errors, numerous contradictions and a general lack of knowledge abound. She's most obviously not the &quot;expert&quot; she claims.Even if you were able to read past the grammatical errors, spelling errors (can't elite hacker types use spellcheck?), inconsistancies and technical inaccuracies, you'd learn just enough to get a knock on the door from the FBI, possible jail time and the ridicule of real hackers everywhere.To sum it up, if you're an AOL warrior and need a step by step guide to changing your Windows background, or a spammer who wants outdated and incomplete tips on forging email, but can't be bothered to look it up on the Web, this book is for you.If you're truly interested in hacking and computer security, however, stay away from this book. You'll be sorely disappointed. Instead consider picking up _The_New_Hacker's_Dictionary_ by Eric S. Raymond, _The_Hacker_Crackdown_ by Bruce Sterling, and consider books on Unix, Linux, TCP/IP, networking, C/C++, Perl, HTML, or JavaScript, because what you want is *not* in _The_Happy_Hacker_."},{"Title":"The Happy Hacker: A Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Computer Hacking","review":"This has got to be the worst book in my library.

I am a nice girl with secret dreams of hackerdom, and as such, I found this book educational and enjoyable. After reading halfway through it, I've already learned many useful things about computers, and discovered some nifty tricks to impress my less technologically literate friends. No, it didn't teach me anything really complex, or anything I couldn't have found on the Internet, but that's alright. It was useful to have all the information available in one, easily understandable and locatable source, and nice to have it in a form that I could read during lunch or in bed. Although it's definitely aimed at newbies like me, it isn't nearly as simplistic or stupid as other reviewers have made it out to be (I have to wonder whether they've actually read it . . .).

After the first five pages of this monstrosity I was already on my mad-dash for the toilet. This is -not- a 'guide to hacking' as the title may imply, it is a series of inaccurate, typo-ridden, paranoid, rants. Any information that could possibly have been useful is out of date and widely available on the net for free anyways. The entire book is one big play off of the media's 'hacker hysteria', and definetly not worth the thirty bucks you could be spending on something useful, such as an informative (and often inexpensive, atleast compared to 'The Happy Hacker') Linux manual."},{"Title":"The Happy Hacker: A Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Computer Hacking","review":"This is a most unusual book, in that it's written in the tone and spirit of computer books from the mid-70's hobbyist days.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's useful and entertaining, and presents a viewpoint almost never seen in this macho arena. Someone has to teach the old-school basics, and I'm glad it's Carolyn."},{"Title":"The Happy Hacker: A Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Computer Hacking","review":"The book's price is misleading. The price leads you to believe that you will actually gleen something from the chapters within. How could someone possibly ask for, and get 30+ dollars for a paperback book with no value? Well, Carolyn Meinel pulls it off. If you already know about shell accounts and how hard to get, and mostly worthless they are nowadays, then you do not need this book. If you know what a mail header is, then you do not need this book. If you know that you can try to telnet into any open port on a server, then you do not need this book. Meinel rarely explains how to protect yourself from these 'hacks', which would be ok if she ever explained one of the 'hacks' fully (or at all). This book is not about hacking, and should be called 'Hacking for dummies' (If you don't understand what an oxymoron that title would be, then this book may be for you).This book is of absolutely no value to the security professional. In it's stead, I would recommend 'Hacking Exposed' by McClure, Scambray, and Kurtz.I gave the book a second star because there is some humorous reading near the back. Although, I don't believe it was written by Meinel. And if you can get through her personal 'hacking poem', let me know, I have yet to meet someone with that much intestinal fortitude.In short, if you are intrigued by someone that calls people 'haxors', or considers changing logo.sys in windows 'hacking', someone that gloats about the many 'hacker wars' she has been involved in (endlessly droning on about how great she was, or how she used so much self-restraint, but never telling you, the reader, what happened.), then this book MAY be for you. But I must say, I was not heart broken when my 2 year old son threw this one in the toilet."},{"Title":"The Happy Hacker: A Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Computer Hacking","review":"Carolyn P. Menial is a perfect example of what, in the terminology, is referred to as a wannabe, a lamer, or an AOL kiddie. Unfortunately, it often happens nowadays that people write books with no clue on the subject they are writing about. The sad thing is that there are dozens of even less-educated kiddies who will buy it. And they have, as Carolyn P. Menial's case proves. However, one thing amazed me: Carolyn P. Menial has of course no idea on any subjects concerning hacking, or, for that matter, on anything that concerns computer. Yet her command of what supposedly is her native language is even worse. Here we have an illiterate who at the same time is a lamer. And she writes books - and sells them! O tempora, o mores...To Carolyn P.

That information was more enjoyable than anything else included in the book.If you're a newbie this might not be a bad place to start.Good start with TCP/IP, Unix adminstration and programming.These are all things you'd need to be a successful hacker anyways.Like I said, some of the information is dated.

Aquiring strong hacking skills require knowing the in-depths of the systems that compose networks and computers, so start reading now and expect much, much more than a 400 pages book which'll teach you tricks without you really understanding why those tricks work. Remember there are the people who vulnerabilities and those who discover them. This is the very thing that differenciates the 'script kiddies' and the real 'hacker'.Carolyn Meinel has nothing of an 'elite' or even a skilled hacker, on the other hand she has enough knowledge of the subject to provide someone with lower technical skills with a few interesting tricks.. and who knows, maybe give one the motivation to go further, where it really begins."},{"Title":"The Happy Hacker: A Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Computer Hacking","review":"This book is not just about hacking and doing harm.

If you are trying to learn how to hack the US airforce, or studying up for your sys admin job then obviously you don't want to buy a newbie book about harmless hacking and how to have fun with your computer. So don't. The basic level of some of the hacking you learn to do helps build your confidence and gives you an immediate sense of acheivement. You also absorb some of the hacker and computer jargon so you have a better understanding of the more complex computer books. Many pathetic attempts are made to insult Ms Meinel or are simply a joke.

Then end your session. Now you're really advancing. Programming is *so* easy. Who would have guessed that printf() is an output statement? Of course that's all you need to know to become proficient in C. Type 'man' for the rest.4) study the methods involved in faking email paths and sources- particularly those that don't work. Shoot yourself in the foot and say they don't work, but write a couple of hundred Kb files about the techniques anyhow.5) As you discover random oddities about computing, stand up on a podium and preach about your enlightenment.

Meinel's prose is abysmal; sentence fragments, logical inconsistencies, and typos (an average of one per page) abound. The content is even worse, if such a thing is possible: she never defines &quot;hacking,&quot; but prefers instead to use the term to describe anything from a passing familiarity with graphics to using &quot;finger&quot; on an email account. Fully half the book is devoted to either a great deal of trivial information regarding Windows 95 graphics or paranoid and immature rantings about &quot;elite super-duper hackers&quot; (p. 15) who she feels despise her. The latter makes Meinel appear painfully immature and insecure; it's difficult to take anything she says seriously after reading statements such as &quot;This newbie note is my flame against those flamers to whom I am sooooo superior&quot; (p. 67). The remainder appears to be aimed at inept--or perhaps retarded--thirteen- year-olds, as chapter sections like &quot;How to Break into Absolutely any School Computer&quot; indicate. Overall, reading &quot;The Happy Hacker&quot; is genuinely painful for anyone with the vaguest familiarity with either hackers or the English language.

Compared to a story book, it would be like reading the same book twice ( why bother). As far as outdated goes, I can pull books off the shelf from late 99 and their outdated already. The world of computers change at an extremely fast pace. There are some things that generally stay the same and I think this book does a good job of teaching these things. I want some of these reviewers to think back to when they decided to go beyond average everyday computer use. Now imagine asking a question like \\"how do I port scan\\" what type of response would you get, not a good one. You are the same as those people that flamed you when you ask those now seemingly slow questions, why, because you only have to learn once After that you think you gain this privilege of looking down upon people that don't know what you do. Trust me this book will not teach you how to \\"hack\\", it will only point you in the right direction. I've advanced to the point of being able to penetrate systems with an uncanny ease. I don't consider myself a hacker because I have an utmost repect for the title. These people who are reviewing her book are probably no more than script kiddies keeping themselves up dated on the work of the true hackers (if even that much credit should be merited).

The cover is a perfect example of my problem with the book. Take notice of the subtitle, &quot;A Portrait of the Ultimate Road Trip&quot;. Now notice the picture of the highway to the left, and a seperate picture of a brown bear to the right. For a book about something as visually exciting as the Alaska Highway and it's surroundings, I counted only 3 pictures that actually included beautiful scenery with the actual Alaska Highway. No pictures of wildlife and the highway. How about a picture of a brown bear crossing the road or a beautiful sunset blanketing the highway with golden rays of sunlight. If that is what you expected, you won't find it here.In several instances the words describe how often one will encounter bison heards, grizzly bears, caribou, and moose crossing the highway, but not once is there an image of any of these creatures near anything remotely resembling asphalt. There are great pictures of these animals by themselves, but they could be stock photography from who know's where. The author's describe a mountain range coming into view as a beautiful backdrop to the Alaska Highway, so then why do they not show me a picture of the highway backdropped by this awesome mountian range? Instead they show me a picture of a lynx!?Maybe my expectations of this book were too literal, and I expected too much from it. I mean I love dogs, but when I buy a book on the Alaska Highway I want to see it, not close ups of people's cute dogs. I counted 5 dog pictures, compared to the 3 pictures of the actual Alaska Highway. I think this book should be renamed; &quot;The Alaska Highway and the Dogs That Live Off to the Side&quot;.I must say that this book did make me more interested in the Alaska Highway, but not for anything it did, but for what it didn't do. It described the most beautiful images, but left your imagination to paint the picture. Disappointing.....unless you like dogs."},{"Title":"The Alaska Highway: A Portrait of the Ultimate Road Trip","review":"A delightful little book showing mostly native wildlife and scenics, as well as people and sights and signs along the Alaska Highway. Almost all the photographs have captions that tell the locations along the highway where they were taken, and the text gives an entertaining general narrative describing the highway from start to finish.This is not a travel or wildlife field guide, but an inspiring pictorial book for a photographer or nature lover, showing and describing areas where many of the wild animals and interesting sights may be found. Erwin and Peggy Bauer, who both passed away this past year, were outstanding partners in a wildlife photography career spanning many many years.I plan to travel the Alaska Highway this summer by RV and definitely will be taking this little book with me."},{"Title":"The Alaska Highway: A Portrait of the Ultimate Road Trip","review":"Bought this book for my dad who was going to take a trip down the Alcan highway!

Leaden and nonsensical dialog. Characters that would have more dimension if they were cut from tracing paper.But at least the reader can indulge in an entertaining game of Find The Typos. Their all-too-numerous presence indicates that everyone involved in this..., from the author to the shipping clerks at the publishing house, deserve to be proscribed from so much as touching paper not to mention ink again.Frankly, I should have put the thing down after reading the dedication in which former dress designer and TV chef Cawley thanks two psychics and a street gypsy for encouraging him to write this so-called novel.You, however, still have the chance to walk away."},{"Title":"The Butterfly Boy","review":"I rather liked this book; I found it to be very much in the same vein as books of Ann Patchett's - that slow movement of story along with a lot of subtle underlying thought. Cawley shows well the potentially destroying nature of obsessive relationships, while showing also how possible it is to become enthralled in such. His description of the relationships within the book is simplistic in a way which does not require elaboration, it shows the nature of the relationship between the two main characters without needing to elaborate, explain or justify.I enjoyed this very much."},{"Title":"Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Official Strategy Guide","review":"The internet has pretty much led to the death of the need for a strategy guide. With a few simple clicks, you can get every code, learn secrets to every boss, find out item locations, so on and so forth. However, some games are just....better with a strategy guide. Castlevania DS is a prime example of this. Sure, you could get an FAQ of the game, but pictures are worth a thousand words. It's much easier to look at a detailed map, read detailed descriptions of enemies to learn their weakness, items, and soul ability then it is to just read it online. This book will probably be a collectors item, with beautiful art work and a nice, thick, compact design. Tons of hints, tips, and secrets lay within the many pages of this quality strategy guide. I purchased this strategy guide after have 99.1% soul completion and 98.3% game completion. I just wanted to buy it for the sheer beauty of it. A great strategy guide and collectors item for Castlevania fans, don't let this book slip away!"},{"Title":"Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Official Strategy Guide","review":"Never has a Castlevania guide been so honest, clear, and to the point. With the Double jump Books Official Strategy Guide to Castlevania Dawn of Souls you'll conquer more than you could possibly imagine! This comprehensive guide gives you everything you need in a user friendly way, without holding your hand, and keeping you informed every step of the way!The guide begins with a run down of the basics. Character Bios and all the mechanics you need to get started. If you're like me you hate instruction manuels because they're too vague. This guide is not vague, and if you're new to Castlevania, this helps any gamer out.Onward we get details on more how-to details. This time talking about synthesizing and giving hints on what to buy and why sometimes buying from Hammer (the shopkeep) is a bad idea.The walkthrough is astonishing! Never has a walkthrough for Castlevania been so easy to use. Each section begins with a map and a number. Thanks to the DS's Duel Screen, the map is ALWAYS displayed, and therefore can ALWAYS be used with this guide. Don't want it to hold your hand? No big deal. The map has a number, and if you get stuck you can just find the number that coresponds on the map. They give you a short, brief and very indepth explanation on what to do. No more reading useless paragraphs of things that don't relate to what needs to be done in certain areas (if you read the Lament of Innocence Guide by BradyGAMES you know exactly what I'm talking about).Crystal clear screenshots, and a huge detailed fold out map are perhaps your best companions. Don't assume there are no maps in the guide, there are. The fold out map just makes getting around all around easier. Yes, this guide has just about all you could want. The boss strategies are perhaps the best part of the detail. Each boss strategy tells you a precise pattern (with screenshots along the way) and just what to do to combat them. Excellent. No longer will you be plauged by some bosses because you don't know what their pattern is. This guide is straight-forward and to the point.All the details on Hard Mode, every key difference is explained in full detail. Plus, a nifty trick to level up Soma, and even a checklist of everything that needs to be done to master the game!Then we go on to all the items list, the monster list, soul list and whatnot. Each of which is expertly detailed and easy t0 use. Nothing should confuse you.Then we move on to the extras like the Enemy Set Mode and Boss Rank Mode. Each area is, you guessed it, detailed to the fullest extent of a gaming guide.Perhaps the most perplexing thing is when you get to the spoilers. If you were fortunate enough to get a hold of the Double Jump Books \\"Phantom Brave\\" guide, then you know the secrets and spoilers section is upside down. This is done purposely to keep readers from ruining the meat and experience of the game. Things like, story plots and whatnot. Don't want it to be ruined, by the time you flip there it's upside down so you KNOW you shouldn't be looking just yet.And finally, we're treated to an interview with the creators of the game. This is one hefty interview where you can learn about not just Dawn of Souls, but the other games as well. Learn about the History.What is execellent about this guide besides all that I said above, is how it doesn't hold your hand. How not every little thing is explained to you as if you're a six year old. It makes the guide easier to use, and it helps it get to the point faster. This guide is crafted for experts and beginners alike!Don't use any other guide, use Double Jump Books. No guide is more detailed, or informative."},{"Title":"Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Official Strategy Guide","review":"Awesome game> If you are a fan of Castlevania then this is a must have game.

Thank you.If you get stuck on games like the average person this will help you get through the rough spots. I found it very helpful, easy to read, and well put together for the most part. My only complaint is all the secrets and bonus stuff is in the back of the book. I feel it should be in the walkthrough so you don't have to go back and forth to see if you missed something. or get an item so late that it is irrelevant anymore because you got it so late its too weak.

So unlike most (if not all) reviewers I am by no means a skilled player but rely on beginner's luck and sound instinct. DoS is my first Castlevania game ever; its highly entertaining rendition impressed me so much that I bought a strategy guide - something I never did before. Thank goodness I picked the right one, as this book is teeming with precious trivia, tipps and tricks. Without it, I'd certainly still be stuck in the Garden of Madness, fighting screaming carrots and heavily armor'd cattle.Especially the Labyrinth part proved to be a gem, and even the Boss fights lost their primary terror once I learned how to handle the guys. Apart from the detailed description of friends, foes, weapons, souls etc., another big asset of the book are the screenshots. Occasionally there are minor flaws - like a Dungeon room that is described as being located in the Chapel - but they are easy to detect, and absolutely negligible.I whole-heartedly recommend this strategy guide to every DoS fan, be they on level 01 or 1.000!"},{"Title":"Odyssey","review":"Odyssey is a joy of a book.First of all, it's not a novel and it's not a collection of short stories; it contains \`Galactic Odyssey' and \`Dinosaur Beach', both older, shorter novels; \`Once there was a Giant', tipping the scales at a novella; and four significant shorter stories: \`A Trip to the City', \`Hybrid', \`Combat Unit', and \`the King of the City'.I wouldn't mind owning any of the longer books just for itself and the combination of short stories is also attractive. Having all of them together in one package is very convenient - I don't have to worry that somewhere down the line I will pick up the book to re-read my favorite story and continue reading and waste my time with a stinker. There is no stinker in this collection.What do you get with the collection? Here are my summaries of each story. I recommend every one of them.Galactic Odyssey is the prototypical \`man kidnapped from Earth who meets the space girl, loses her, and spends many episodes trying to rescue her'. However, it's more than cheap space opera - the writing is smooth and transparent, so that when Laumer introduces little futurisms like \`a dreamer and a supply of tapes' to explain Our Hero's further education you nod and go on. The characters are all interesting, the dialog is quirky rather than dated, and the story is still completely believable - something hard to get from a plain old space opera first published in 1967.A Trip to the City presents another idea that has been explored many times - what if part of the world we live in is a stage set that has been set up by aliens for reasons of their own? Laumer's hayseed Brett, with his open mind and disdain for pretense, is the perfect man to deal with the situation.Hybrid throws together the big, tough bully, the nerdy biologist who knows a lot but isn't listened to, and a giant alien tree with a very strange method of reproduction. The story is just the right length for the idea and one to come back to again.Combat Unit is a Bolo story in all but name. (I checked and the word \`bolo' is not used in the story.) Those of us who enjoy these giant robotic tanks will also enjoy this story of an big intelligent weapon that wakes up in a room in bad shape but determined to carry out its mission - if it can figure out what its situation is and remember its mission.The King of the City starts off with the hero signing on as a driver for a transportation company in a post-apocalyptic Greater New York - but since this isn't a movie the point isn't just to shoot the gangsters up or exact revenge on some bad guy. Laumer reminds us that real heroes have a purpose in mind when they wade in.Once There was a Giant stars an antihero, a civilized contract killer who \`always made a point to accept contracts only on marks that I agreed needed killing'. Of course he gets framed into taking on a job he wouldn't necessarily want to take. Through the clever device of trying to make murder look like an unfortunate accident, our assassin's murder weapon is attempting to run his victim into the ground by having him help rescue a crashed ship's container full of medical patients just too far away from to get to in deadly territory. Our hero spends plenty of time getting to know the Giant, long enough that he (and we readers) gets to know what really makes a great man.Dinosaur Beach is the last story and bookends the collection with another novel-length story. This is one heck of a convoluted time-travel story. What if time travel not only exists, but it's poking holes in time, and an agency has been created to go back and fix things messed up by earlier time travelers? Not only that, but a 2nd, then a 3rd agency have come along whose missions are to fix the messes created by the earlier agencies? And what if our hero has not only been planted at some moment in time with the tools to do his job but also conditioned not to realize that he's a time agent or that he has certain skills until he needs to know his job or use his skills? And while we're at it, how many times and ways can this guy interact with the same-but-different girl? If you think an author can't tie up all the possibilities in such a mess - read the story, Laumer did it.That's it, a fine collection of work by a great science fiction author. Recommended for any decent SF collection."},{"Title":"Odyssey","review":"This collection includes some of Laumer's best work.

What \\"The 13 Clocks\\" is isn't very clear, but what is clear is that it definitely is. It has many things one would expect from a fairy tale, but none you would expect from a tale-telling fairy. The quirks will make you smirk and Thurber's literary winks will make you think, but there's one thing for certain and one thing for uncertain: it's probably most possibly most impossibly the most impossibly possibly fun and imagination-unlocking book you may or may not ever read."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"The 13 Clocks is a fun fairy tale.

Somehow, attempts at a modern faiy tale by more modern writers would seem frivolous or contrived. One can tell that Thurber has been properly informed by literary tradition, as explained by T.S. Eliot in his essay \\"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\\" Writers can do nothing on their own, cut away from tradition, and purely as individuals. This is the flaw of much of our modern writers who have not read the classics and merely focus on themselves.13 Clocks is witty and non-chalantly sarcastic. It is down to earth enough to be a fairy tale, a real fairy tale.There is, in a sense, a sense of Odysseus in Circe's forest at one point and another, a Shakespearean minstrel, and a bit of old Disney, with prose that combines Dr. Seuss and The Brothers Grimm.This book would make a clever gift for a clever child."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I found this book in my school library in 5th grade, and it is one of the few books from my childhood that I never forgot.

(Aged 11 years, 3 months.)"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"\\"The Thirteen Clocks\\"by James Thurberillustrated by Marc Simont---------------------------------------------This is an utterly delicious, deliciously wicked satire of good, old-fashioned fairytales in which gallant princes rescue hapless damsels from unreasonably wicked villains. Like all great adventures, this story gets its biggest kick from the bad guy, and prose stylist James Thurber goes all-out in constructing the meanest, wickedest, most dastardly baddie of them all, a fellow who is so evil he tortures small birds for fun and wears not only an eye patch, but a monocle, too. Thurber gleefully piles on the fairytale cliches and blithely pokes holes through each one. The real joy of this book is in reading it aloud and sharing it with others: you can'y help but get caught up in the rhythm of the writing, or laughing out loud when Thurber delivers a real whopper. The story is also quite inventive, introducing magical creatures unlike any seen before, as mysterious and unpredictable as they are enchanting and bizarre.This is one of the last books Thurber wrote -- dictated and scrawled down as he was losing his sight, and wonderfully illustrated by Thurber's collegue and friend, Marc Simont. Out of print for years, this book is a delight waiting to be discovered by both Thurber fans and folks who like good, creative children's fiction. Highly recommended!

It is a fairy tale, and yet not and it seems like a children's book, but it felt very adult in parts. It is written in a very poetic way that I immedietely liked, even rhyming at times. It features a prince and a princess and an evil Duke and charcters called Whisper and Listen and a woman who weeps jewels and I just found the whole thing clever and witty.The book is very short, but as the man who wrote the introduction stated: Just short enought. I read it in about half an hour. There are pictures on almost every page and the illustrations are beautiful. They remind me of the time of Sleeping Beauty and The Sword in the Stone. I have not seen many drawings like that in this time and age, which is very unfortunate.The book was written in 1950, which I had not known going into it, but does not feel dated. Children will certainly love it and I hope this little book will become as popular as many of the other modern children's tales.

And it only gets better from there.The New York Review has just reissued Thurber's classic, paired with the illustrations by Marc Simont, with a new introduction by Neil Gaiman.The 13 Clocks is as full of fairy tale as you can get, with a Princess, the evil Duke, and, of course, a Prince.

No the best part, as far as I'm concerned is the words that make up the story itself and the poetical way Thurber weaves them together. It's not really poetry, yet, at the same time, it is. This story, like poems, uses those glittery, evocative, slippery wonderful words -- like \\"brambles and thorns and \\"bonged the gongs of a throng of frogs, all green and vivid on their lily pads.\\" Words like \\"gleep\\" and \\"made of lip\\" and \\"impudence\\" and \\"savage clash of swords.\\" -- that together imbue the tale with feeling and delight.+This is truly a wonderful story and one that simply begs to be read aloud."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"First I have to say I'm not a \\"young reader\\".

I had fallen in love with one of Thurber's other books that I had read (The Owl in the Attic and Other Perplexities) and decided to see if this was any good. That night I read it through, 3 times and another 2 the following morning. It just seemed all so wonderful to me I couldent get enough of it. A classic story with a handsom prince, an evil duke, and a beautiful princess, and the seemingly impossable tasks the prince had to do to win the princess's hand. I hope that all around the world people enjoy this book, for years to come."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"For those of you who have read The Wonderful O by James Thurber, this book is very similar. It is a very short story of a prince who dresses up as a minstrel and an icy-hearted duke who keeps a princess locked up. Our prince gets it into his head to rescue the princess, so he goes to the duke and is told to collect a thousand gems in 99 hours and then restart all of the clocks in the castle (Time is frozen there). With a little help from a mysterious creature called the Golum, he finds his way to a lonely woman who is said to cry jewels instead of tears. However, when they arrive, she no longer cries about anything, because she has used all of her tears up. However she can make jewels by laughing but they don't last longer that 20 days. She manages to laugh enough jewels for them, and they hurry back to the Duke. It all works out happily in the end, the Duke is left with no jewels and the prince and princess ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after.This is a great book for kids as well as adults. The book is filled with wordplay and rhymes and is short and sweet, which is refreshing."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I first ran into &quot;The 13 Clocks&quot; when I was sick as a child. I had the radio on, and heard Boris Karloff reading it. I've loved it for 50 years.&quot;The Duke wore a velvet patch over one eye; the other glittered at you through a monacle. When he was young, he had enjoyed turning over rocks and sticks in search of small creatures to maul. One day a mother shrike had mauled him first.&quot;"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I was introduced to this marvelous fantasy in junior high and despite the passing of decades and the reading of hundreds of Young Adult books and dozens of Children's Classics I still recall this tale with fondness. Known for his droll and irreverent Midwestern sense of humor Thurber is generally known for his outrageous short stories like, \\"The Night the Bed Fell\\" and \\"The Night the Ghost Got In,\\" the Ohio journalist let out all the literary stops when he took pen in hand (or was it just an old Royal typewriter?) to decant a fairy tale of 50's vintage.Also a pen and ink artist, whose spare cartoons are more charica- tures of people and animals, Thurber easily captured the traditional elements of a fairy tale: a beautiful princess, her evil guardian who fiendishly discourages all suitors with impossible quests, a prince with an unusual name, and a \\"pet\\" monster whose loyalty is casual at best.But it is Thurber's use/invention of Words which boggles readers of all ages; his vocabulary is from out of this galaxy and his descriptive expressions are beyond creative--brainchildren of his darkly satirical genius. Today's young readers--trained in video games of fantasy--are remarkably resilient, and will handle the physical violence verbally unscathed. Gleep! Is that the ubiquitous Todal slurking off in disregust, because the 13 clocks risk being ungefrozen as a result of human happiness? This short book should be considered a kids' klassik--no shame to adults who rejoice in their inner kiddom."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I was unaware that Thurber had written children's books until my daughter (English Teacher) made me aware. I bought it for my grand daughter for Christmas. Although it is advance for her, it is a great learning tool and a wonderful story........"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This delightful little book charms me every time I pick it up. Our family has read it aloud a number of times. Thurber's wit and ability with words inspire me as an author and tickle my fancy as a reader."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"Anyone who loves language and wordplay will have enormous fun diving into Thurber's thicket of words and bad guys surrounding the beautiful maiden who wants to leave her dire situation and cannot say so. The quixotic Gollux is a marvel of dubiety, leaving the hero uncertain if he is of help or harm to our hero's goals. The enjoyment any adult reader will have reading this aloud will thrill their young audience (although you may have to pause in the narrative to laugh). As in all fairytales, nastiness defines the villain and his vile deeds let the youngest hearer know that this villain is evil and also that such doings are not likely in our town."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"It's hard to categorize \\"The Thirteen Clocks\\" -- is it a children's fairy tale? a book for grown-ups? Who cares? Readers from 5 to 95 will enjoy this wonderful book; the kids for the story and the adults for Thurber's marvelous way with words. It's a simple little fantasy tale of an abducted princess, a murderous duke, and the prince who comes to her rescue. And it starts off as all fairy tales should, with \\"Once upon a time...\\"Thurber brings us the beautiful Princess Saralinda, the Duke of Coffin Castle who was so cold that he managed to stop time one snowy night when all thirteen clocks in the castle stopped at ten minutes to five and never started again, and Prince Zorn of Zorna, who called himself Xingu, the prince whose name begins with X and doesn't, who is the one man who can defeat the duke's evil plans and rescue Saralinda. But Thurber's best invention by far is the Golux, a spaced-out wizard whose spells have a way of backfiring from time to time, who assists Zorn in his quest to save the princess. And there is a deliciously spooky, never-seen monster called the Todal, that \\"smells of old, unopened rooms and sounds like rabbits screaming\\", who is the cold duke's infernal weapon, and, ultimately, his nemesis.Thurber's way with words will leave you boggle-eyed. This is the quintessential read-aloud book and the kids love it. On the second or third reading they'll be chanting along with sentences like these: \\"The brambles and the thorns grew thick and thicker in a ticking thicket of bickering crickets...\\" And Thurber goes hogwild in making up all kinds of words that somehow managed to portray what he want to get across. When he tells us that the duke slits open his victims from their guggles to their zatches, you may not know exactly what is a guggle and what is a zatch, but you get the idea. And when the Todal gleeps while devouring a victim, we know just what Thurber is talking about. (Try going \\"gleep\\" way at the back of your throat and you'll see what I mean.)\\"The Thirteen Clocks\\" is full of dark humor and the illustrations by Marc Simont are right in character -- dark, haunting and yet comical at the same time. The book is a great mix of a good story, good characters, good writing, and just plain good fun.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"Thurber's &quot;The Thirteen Clocks&quot; is one of the best books ever written. The fairy-tale plot line appeals to both the young and the young at heart. No matter your age, after reading this book you will come away feeling like the world is not as rough of a place as it seemed about a half an hour ago. This book is also great to read to young children. While it doesn't have a poetic meter, the dialogue and narration progress in an almost sing-songy way that will hold the attention of even the most restless child."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"...the writing is so lyrical, the characters so funny, and characteristic of thurber, frought with human flaws while still being heroes, and each adventure solved, in the end, by wit and ingenuity. the prose is beautifully tight. it is written, like E.B. White, for the inner ear -- sonorous, and full of Thurber mischief. &quot;I am the Golux, the one and only Golux -- and not a mere device.&quot; My eight-year old loves the rhythm. My 11 year old loves the humor, and I love thurber's wink to me about literary devices...for us, this book is always at hand for the sheer joy of reading it aloud."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"In summary form, \\"The Thirteen Clocks\\" will almost certainly come across as a clever but fairly conventional fairy tale, populated by amusing variants of the archetypal beautiful princess, wicked Duke, and poor-hero-who-isn't-what-he-seems. This is unfortunate, because while all of these characters are great fun, the real hero of this little book is the English language. Few authors are as skilled as Thurber when it comes to playing with words, and in \\"The Thirteen Clocks,\\" verbal gems pop out of almost every page. Moreover, when it comes to making up new words for comedic or literary effect, only Lewis Carroll's \\"Jabberwocky\\" does it better - you'll not find \\"guggle\\" or \\"zatch\\" in an anatomy textbook, but in the context of the tale, their meaning is both perfectly clear and perfectly hilarious (also perfectly clean - this is definitely an all-ages book). I'd offer more examples, but that would deprive you of the joy of discovering them for yourself - and not even a Todal in full gleep could make me do that."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"&quot;The Thirteen Clocks&quot; is book like a song or a tapestry, weaving bits of alliteration, near-poetic description, and humor-- all in the process of telling a darn good tale. The characters are each like separate jewels, ranging from the evil duke with one leg longer than the other due to kicking so many puppies when he was young, to the whimsical Gollux, a half-magical little man with an indescribable hat. Young-at-heart readers will appreciate the wonderful pictures of Marc Simont and the straight fairy-tale type story in which a wandering prince must rescue the princess from the designs of the evil duke, and other readers will appreciate the sheer craft with which the story was put together."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"The Thirteen Clocks, by James Thurber, is a perfect book. The only way it could be better would be by being longer. The story is classic in its simplicity, so elemental that anyone can easily find a way inside. The big setting - a castle - the big players - a Prince, Princess, and wicked Duke (very wicked) - the big themes - courage, redemption, selfless sacrifice, and just a whiff of magic. Best of all, the big problem - time is frozen. Our enterprising Prince must do the impossible to win the hand of Princess Saralinda. This is road-tested material but Thurber breathes new life into it, making it fresh and irresistible. The musicality of his language is delightful, there is so much joy and play in the words, they giggle and dance like water gliding over stones in a stream. His rogue's gallery of secondary characters is just too good; each is slightly more improbable and splendidly cracked than the last. Most of all, this story ends exactly as it should, the resolution is not forced, it's simply correct. The Thirteen Clocks is a slice of heaven that can be enjoyed by anyone able to read. Thurber, it turns out, really was as good as he claimed. This lasting jewel proves it."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This is a cute, very short fantasy book full of a weird mix of prose and poetry. The back of my old paperback proclaims &quot;Everyone has always wanted to love a princess/Everyone has always wanted to be a prince/Everyone has always wanted the wicked duke to be punished/Everyone has always wanted to live happily ever after.&quot; While I've never wanted to love a princess or be a prince, I am always entranced by the characters.It follows a mysterious young man who wishes to marry the beautiful Princess Saralinda. But Saralinda is kept in a castle without time, by a sinister Duke who claims to be her uncle. The young man (whom we find is a prince himself, Zorn of Zorna) is given an impossible task, and his only ally is the bizarre Golux, &quot;the only Golux in the world, and not a mere Device.&quot; Together they venture through a shadowy world of jewel-weeping women, things without heads, and mediocre witches...The storyline and plotting are straightforward, without detours or side-quests. Characters go from point A to point B without wandering off to do things. Zorn and Saralinda are a fairly ordinary prince and princess, and the Duke rolls and revels in his sheer badness; it's the Golux who really makes this tale. The son of a mediocre witch and an alcoholic wizard, he is quirky and sometimes gets things wrong.The prose is sprinkled through with poetry, as often a sentence will fall into rhyme, without benefit of stanzas. Thurber's description of things is casual: he doesn't dwell forever on weird things, but treats them as part of the experience.This is a wonderful book, well worth the hunt it will take to find it."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I first heard this enchantingly wonderful book on cassette tape when i was at art lessons. I would wait impatiently till the next week so I could hear more~ more about the Golux (who resembles only half the things he says he doesn't) and about Princess Saralinda and the Prince whose name begins with X... and doesn't. This book is full of whimsical wonderful wordplay and contains almost all of my favorite quotations of all time. It isn't very long, but every sentence is filled with some little quips or verbal oddities that, quite literally, made me laugh aloud. This book is without question one of my favorites of all time, a truly wonderful tale that can be read over and over again without ever growing old. Really classique. I mean, the book that's given me my tagline HAS to be great: &quot;We all have flaws and mine is being evil.&quot;"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This is one of the few books that both children & adults can enjoy. Other reviews have gone into more detail on what this book is about, but for me, the key point is this: too many kids' books are uninteresting to adults, and vice versa, but this is one that you will enjoy reading to your child or having your child read to you!"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"If you liked The Princess Bride, you will love this book. Sadly, Thurber is not as well known as many of the 20th Century 'Greats' such as C.S. Lewis, O. Henry, and Dorothy Parker. Perhaps this is because he is in a class to himself, and it's difficult to even compare. He is far from boring, everything is delivered in a fast-paced, fresh tongue-in-cheek style. You find yourself at the end, wishing there were more. Too bad there aren't more authors like Thurber. This should be required reading in all middle schools - but perhaps it's simply too entertaining. This marvellous little tale is both entertaining and enlightening. This is a 'MUST' read!"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I loved this book. The plot is skillfully woven, the characters amazingly creative and unique, and the description vivid and poetic. This is a fantastic and fascinating book."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"The 13 Clocks is essential reading for anyone who loves either the Bros. Grimm in a less grim form or The Princess Bride, or James Thurber at his best. It is wonderful reading for adults or independent readers, and makes wonderful reading-to material for a savvy young one who longs for something more than Barney et al. It is the perfect gift for someone who has learned through the Carnival, etc., to love Thurber. That it is not readily available is both heart breaking and incomprehensible."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"Read it aloud to your children, or you'll miss half the fun! Better yet, give each child a character's part to read. Who could resist with lines like &quot;You may frighten Octopi to death, but not the Duke of Coffin Castle! En Garde, you Musty Sofa!&quot;?"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"If you love fairy tales, poems, and parables, you'll love this. James Thurber takes all of these and rolls it up into one great book. It is a hillarious book about a young prince trying to rescue a young princess. This princess was kidnapped at a young age by a Duke. He has many prisoners. One of them is a Golux. He is the funniest Golux around. He has the talent to make people laugh and cry for jewels. If you love other books by Thurber, you'll love this."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This book is immortal. I'd never even heard of it untilI got to college. It must be wonderful to read as achild, but it is an absolute joy to read as an adult.It should be in everyone's personal library."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"Be warned that this edition does not have the 1960s illustrations by Ronald Searle, which are masterpieces of children's illustration. Alone, \\"The 13 Clocks\\" is five stars.(The edition with Searle has the Duke on the cover, standing with his sword on a blue and white harlequin floor.)The publishers chose to reissue the book with the original illustrations. Unfortunately, James Thurber was blind by the time \\"The 13 Clocks\\" was illustrated, so he had a friend, Marc Simont, do them. Although Simont is an award-winning artist, he is rather conventional. It's Searle who did the really extraordinary, detailed illustrations matching the mood of the book.Obviously this is partly a matter of taste (or of which version you read first!), but I bet 4 out of 5 preteens would prefer Searle. As an adult, I have multiple illustrated versions of some of my favorite books. Suffice it to say I don't have Simont's version."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"Predictable, but still a wonderful story. The pictures are an especially nice touch. Lighthearted, fun and funny. Should be more available."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"The 13 Clocks is a wonderful and witty story, but on rereading it I realize that it contains so much physical violence that it hardly qualifies as a children's book. Very enjoyable, like most of Thurber's works, but you wouldn't read it to a six-year old."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"'The Thirteen Clocks and the Wonderful O' is one of the childhood books my brother and I still fight over, even aged in our mid to late thirties. It is a perfect combination of stories about princesses, goodies, baddies and above all about what language means. The two books I connect it with in my mind (and I've no idea why the first, some idea about the second) are 'The Phantom Tollbooth' (forgotten the author) and Haroun and the Sea of Stories (Salman Rushdie) which has the same glorious connections between words and metaphor"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This is a story that is so simple, yet incredibly complex. You don't quite now whats going on unless you think about it. It's a doorway to discover all kinds of interesting about yourself and life. This is just an all-around great book."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I feel the book itself is reviewed ably here by other reviewers, so I'll stick to the point that makes this edition so interesting to me. The new introduction by Neil Gaiman makes this edition a must-have for a well-stocked library. This book has clearly had an enormous on Gaiman's own storytelling, to the point that he even tips his hat to it in The Sandman. There is no author better suited to introduce Thurber's masterpiece, and having Thurber and Gaiman in one place makes this edition a joy to own."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I had not heard of James Thurber (I'm not from Northern America :)) until one of my friends on a study abroad program brought this book to our apartment and we started reading it out loud to each other. I loved it so much that I've read it three times already. Thurber's playing with the language is so amazing, cute and fascinating that it makes you speak \\"his way\\" after you read the book. :) And all his ideas are wonderful! This all makes the book one of a kind, really."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I really do like this book. I like fairy tales, especially the kind like Ella Enchanted and Fairest by Gail Carson Levine. In the pictures the wicked duke looks so hilarilously silly! The prince is handsome and the princess pretty, of course! The Golux's hat is indeed indescribable and the woman Hagga cries jewels instead of tears. He! He! He!"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"A few particularly creepy illustrations might scare off the discerning parent, but the text is not threatening.This was a favorite family story to read aloud over a few nights' time.Sensitive kids need not be shown all the book's pictures, but I must say that videos nowadays are a lot more horrifying. This classic is quite funny and not lacking in sophistication. Ages 8 through 108 can enjoy this finely crafted, humorous story with a gothic setting."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"the plot is, well, it's a good plot. However, it's not the plot that reaches out and grabs you in. It's the characters (especially the golux and his unique way of looking at the world) but more it's the words that are almost poetry and are written in a way that makes you wonder what worlds could be around you if you just opened up your eyes."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"When my daughters were young, I would read this to them ... over and over and over again.Somehow, in the years gone by, I lost our copy of it.Now, my eldest daughter (who lives in Jamaica, WI) wants us to both get a copy so I can read it over Skype to my twin 6 year old grand children.Man, am I looking forward to that!If you've never read it to children or if your 6-9 year olds have never read it ... GET IT!!!"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I own two copies of the original edition of this classic, and have since I was a child in 1950, and it was first read to me...........over and over again....A few comments:1) Thurber's genius for word play/word construction is the fable's genius;2) Mark Simont's illustrations, commissioned by his friend Thurber (due to his own blindness and the loss of his own genius as a cartoonist) are an inseparable part of the book; another \\"reviewer\\" completely misses the mark in asserting that a later Edition's illustrations by Ronald Searle are superior: they are NOT at all equal to Simont's (indeed, I am, however, a huge fan of Ronald Searle and have several of his commercial art pieces framed at my home: 2 for Clos du Val, the winery; one he did for an industrial client/product in the 70's........Searle [who died this Spring] is not, in this context, even close to Marc Simont's genius and its inseparability to Thurber's poetry);3) a very positive review for Amazon from a gentlemen from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, inadvertently echoes Thurber's genius for word-creation by using the misspelled term \\"frought\\" (it is, of course, properly spelled \\"fraught\\";4) to put it another way, enjoying \\"Alice...\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" without John Tenniel's engravings is an oxymoron (I have seen editions of both with other artists' illustrations and the discrepancy ruins the enjoyment).Regardless of these quibbles (sic.), \\"The Thirteen Clocks\\" is equalled only by Lewis Carroll in the lexicon (sic.) of English language children/adult fairy tales. \\"Five stars\\" is a few too few..........."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"\\"Once upon a time, in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill, where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn't go, there lived a cold, aggressive Duke, and his niece, the Princess Saralinda...\\"This was a fast and fun romp. One part wicked to two parts whimsy, it's a book to delight all ages. Children will love the story, and adults will enjoy the more sophisticated humor and word play. If you know anything about James Thurber, (or maybe even if you don't), you'll appreciate how much fun he had writing this story. In the Foreword he explains that he wrote The Thirteen Clocks when he was supposed to be working on another book. He called this \\"an example of escapism and self-indulgence.\\" Sixty years later, it served the same purpose for me.The funky and stylized artwork is entertaining, too. When Zorn of Zorna dons his princely raiment, he looks like he's wearing a frilly tablecloth. But it's a welcome change from the uniformity of today's computerized graphics."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"If you've been reading and looking at lots of children's and YA books recently, you've probably been suckered a few times by mega-hype from respectable names for books that have turned out to be not all that wonderful. I certainly look at books by celebrity authors with care, and I've been disappointed by a few classics and, worse, \\"instant classics\\". So then you look at this book and see monster blurbs from Daniel Pinkwater and Neil Gaiman, who are sort of the yin and yang of children's and YA lit. What to think?Well, I've never been totally in love with Thurber, partly because I don't think he's that hilariously funny and mostly because I feel bullied by all the critics and reviewers who promote him constantly. He represents a certain dry, vaguely dated, cocktails at 5:00 urban style that works best in small doses. That said, this book is a small dose and it benefits from that style. So, it is a fine and admirable choice and very entertaining if you go into it without expecting to be transformed, and with a willingness to not be disappointed if your little reader/listener doesn't love it after all."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"But before I did, I noticed it was written by James Thurber of humor fame. I must have picked up this book at a flea market or thrift store before I began noting the date/place I bought it. It was a discard from an area junior high school. The last date someone checked it out was in the late 1970s (the ink was smeared).The book sat in my loaded bookshelves for lo these many years.Before I put it in the give-away box, I decided to read it. Now, I WILL NOT give it away! The dust jacket is still attached and a plastic sleeve (torn, but still...)protects it even more. It is the Simont edition. Being a Janie-come-lately writer, I loved the poetic devices that other reviewers have mentioned. I agree that it's too intense for all children, but for the fantasy readers, it will be exciting. I may read it again--aloud--to my cats. I wonder if they would go to sleep before I finished?I'll go to Ever After with this book clasped in my cold, ungloved hands."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I have loved the book for over 50 years. It is physically beautiful, too. Isn't it a shame that the Golux is the only one there ever wa s (and nota mere device)?"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"My parents read this James Thurber fairy tale aloud when I was growing up. The story is great. I still read it regularly. The illustrations are simple and lovely. The language is silly, descriptive, and amazing! The princess Saralinda has the only warm hands in the castle.

It is definitely a children's chapter book; it took me maybe 20 minutes to read. Overall though it was a very good read.This book tells the somewhat classic tale of a princess locked up by her evil father. Any price who comes to woo the princess is given an impossible task to perform, in order to win her hand in marriage. That is until a minstrel comes along and with the help of an elven/dwarfish prankster, tricks the old king in his own game.This was a great classic fairy tale with some humorous quirks thrown. It is cleverly written and would sound wonderful read out-loud. The characters are a bit stereo-typed but each have their own unique quirks. There is a sharp sense of humor throughout the book. The pictures throughout are down in a dark medieval style that somehow still has a bit of humor in it.Overall I think everyone would enjoy this book; no matter what your age. Kids will enjoy the castles, knights, and general fairy tale aspects of it; adults will enjoy the clever word play and interesting plot. I am glad I read it and it is a book that I will keep on my shelf to read to my son when he gets old enough to sit still for 30 minutes at a time :-)"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"13 Clocks is a classic tale of good and evil written in a very creative and entertaing fashion.

I have read it out loud to many children, and hope to read it to future grandchildren. My copy, from 1950, sits with Darwin's Origin of Species, Ulysses, and the complete full size edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, and I consider The 13 Clocks to hold its own against these masterpieces. I must have been about 6 when my father first read it to me, and it inspired me to learn to read myself. I named my doll Saralinda, but I have not had the courage to name a pet The Golux because it would be too important, almost a sacrilege.In this new era, when I see small children using iPhones and plugged into video games, I hope that this new issue of Thurber's masterpiece and the publicity it has garnered will help at least a few parents to unplug the electronics, and just sit down to read out loud to their children. This book can be read to toddlers - the poetry and rhymes are like Seuss. It can be read to older, wiser 8-10 year olds because it is scary and melodious. And I have read parts of it out loud to 50 year olds, especially those with compassion fatigue, as there is no more clear literary example of burnout than Hagga, who went from crying diamonds to crying costume jewelry and rhinestones.I am glad that others remember Thurber, and that a new generation can now appreciate what I consider to be the best children's book ever written."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I first heard this enchantingly wonderful book on cassette tape when i was at art lessons.

This book is full of whimsical wonderful wordplay and contains almost all of my favorite quotes of all time. It isn't very long, but every sentence is filled with some little quips or verbal oddities that, quite literally, made me smile and laugh while reading (a funny sight XD). This book is without question one of my favorites of all time~ a truly wonderful tale that can be read over and over again without ever growing old. Truly classique. I mean, the book that's given me my tagline HAS to be great: &quot;We all have flaws and mine is being evil.&quot;"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I first bought this book at a school book fair when I was eight. My mother was rushing me out, and the cover looked interesting, and nothing else appealed to me, so I grabbed it. I'm sixteen now, and I still read this book regularly. The language is rich, and deep. The characters are very well crafted, and again, their language is lyrical. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This has been one of my favourites ever since my sister gave it to me on my 11th birthday and introduced me to Thurber's delightful sideways view of the world. Like 'Rocky and Bullwinkle,' it's ostensibly intended for younger audiences but a joy full of gentle humour for adults as well.Rated 'G' for 'great fun!'"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This book is amazing. The lyricism is cleverly hidden behind a dark children's tale. I really just now realized how well written this book is, but that's 'cause I hadn't looked at it since I was 10 because a few of the panels scared the living hell out of me. Not for very young kids, but probably one of the finest modern fairy tales ever written."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I wish I'd found this book long before I was 53 years old, but I am having a wonderful time reading it with my son. I own a book store and I'm going to be hand-selling this like mad, to kids who think that Harry Potter is literature.I am also a writer, and the writing is literally amazing. Reading it aloud is the most fun I've had in a long time. I was really unhappy that my son fell asleep, I wanted to keep reading it aloud to myself. (I did finish the chapter while he snored.)I agree with the man who wrote the introduction, and other reviewers here. This may well be the best book ever written. It is definitely my new baby shower and birthday party gift. It's an absolute treasure.I wish I could give it more than five stars."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"When I was 4 years old, I learned to read - from James Thurber's \\"The Thirteen Clocks\\". It totally enchanted and captivated me then, and it has remained my favorite book for more than 50 years. I was so pleased to discover it was again in print, that I ordered 5 copies. And now I'm wondering if I should have ordered more, because I know one precocious 4 year old and several \\"oldsters\\" (with a strong inner child) who would love and treasure this book."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"A tremendous piece of literature I was lucky enough to read at age 8. I'm still re-reading it today as an adult and continue to find it imaginitive, without being syrupy or preachy. Our protagonist, the minstral-turned-Prince, must save the Princess Saralinda before the coniving Duke forces her to marry him. The Duke sets out an impossible task for the Prince, hoping that he will perish before he weds Saralinda on her 21st Birthday.What is so amazing about this story is that each character has so much more dimension than the average fairy tale character. At times the Duke is almost likable and the Prince can be frustratingly unheroic. Even Saralinda escapes from the cotton candy persona of most heroines. Sure, she's beautiful, but she has an assumed cleverness that is presented as normal rather than over-emphasized in a Disney-like way.I would highly recommend this book to children and adults alike. A note to eight-year-olds: Look up the hard words. It's worth the time. Trust me"},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"I thought that this book was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read great fairy tale. A tale with Princes, Princess and an evil Duke. I couldn't put the book down. It was short and sweet. There is a simple plot and characters that are easy to relate to. There were many descriptive sentences that painted detailed pictures in your head. I also enjoyed the pictures in the book and found them very amusing. This book as some surprising twists in it that you would never guess. Again I would highly recommend this book for anyone of all ages that just want to read something that is good and it doesn't take him or her days to read. It is just an awesome book to read. I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The 13 Clocks","review":"This has been my favorite children's book since I was 10. I give it to a lot of children. It is meant to be read aloud at least once.

Our twelve year son old enjoys them now, and I expect that our eight year old will enjoy them in the future. They're a good alternative to Harry Potter, where magic and power over grownups plays the dominant role (the Hardy Boys more or less compete in skill with their father as detectives, although parents rarely appear in the stories). The Carolyn Keene mystery stories (Nancy Drew) are also equally good for both boys and girls, and could have been written by the same author! Even better, if you can find them: Ellery Queen Jr.'s mysteries (The Brown Fox Mystery, The Red Chipmunk Mystery, and three others).How I got onto these books: my mother ordered and sold them from our office equipment business in a small Kentucky town in the fifties."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"I choose Tower Treasure because my teacher recommended it because I told her I was interested in mystery books,and it was a good choice.This book is about two young teenage boys who want to be detectives like their father.They are out to solve a mystery of stolen jewels.This is a mystery they want to solve quick to clear a friend's father who is innocent.During their journey they find many clues,but to find out the amazing ending you'll have to read it.I would recommend this book for readers who enjoy mystery books.It is exciting as you near the end,but you have to give it a chance in the beginning.I'm sure you'll enjoy this mystery book."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"When I was a young boy I had all the Hardy Boys books from The Tower Treasure to The Mystery of the Chinese Junk.

Big fans of vintage mystery series like Nancy Drew or Tom Swift or The Happy Hollisters, should have no trouble opening up and letting the Hardy Boys in too. The Tower Treasure is a great opener for the series and introduces Frank and Joe and their friends and family. It's a great story and good on a rainy day. I'm about half way through the whole series right now - there are a lot more Hardy Boys than the original Nancy Drews - and I am enjoying it almost as much as I do Nancy."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"When the Hardys' neighbor is robbed, Frank and Joe's father enlists their help in solving the case. It's The Hardy Boys mystery that started it all!"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This is the book that started the Hardy Boys genre. It starts when they are almost run over by a speeding motorist and then they learn that the car of their friend, Chet Morton has been stolen. The major crime occurs when jewels and bonds are stolen from the mansion of Hurd Applegate. It appears to have been an inside job, so the father of one of their friends, who works for Applegate, is suspected and arrested. Fenton Hardy, the father of Frank and Joe, is a famous detective and tracks down the real thief. The thief flees and is severely injured in the chase. On his deathbed, he tells Fenton where the loot is hidden. Unfortunately, everyone misunderstands his statement and the loot is not found. Finally, Frank and Joe solve the problem, recover the material and receive a reward. The action is fast-paced, just right for the adolescent child.In this book, nearly all of the major characters of the genre are introduced. The Hardy family, Chet and Iola Morton, Callie Shaw, Tony Prito, Biff Hooper, Police Chief Collig, Detective Smuff, and Patrolman Con Riley are all described. The three police officers are characterized as buffoons and in later issues they were portrayed as much more intelligent. With the exception of Chet, we learn very little about the other friends of the Hardy's.This review is based on the original version published in 1927 and the book is very dated. From the wording and some of the situations, it is clear why those who hold the copyright decided to have it rewritten. Phrases such as \\"chums\\" for friends and my favorite, \\"gay-looking speed-wagon\\" for a nice looking car are incomprehensible to modern young people. There is a horse-drawn wagon, excitable Italians and simple-minded farmers in the story.While there are some obvious weaknesses in the plot and many of the characters are not well developed, much of that is corrected in later books in the series. Generations of young boys like myself grew up wanting to be detectives, and that desire was generated by the books in the Hardy Boys series."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"The first Hardy Boys book I read was the Tower Treasure. The main characters are Frank and Joe. Frank is careful and Joe is curious. Ending each chapter would tempt you to read more because it ends with something you want to find out.

The mystery is a thief is on the loose and he stole a jalopy and stole the loot from the tower. The boys try to find the jalopy. Frank and Joe found one clue and a threat. The clue was a tire and the threat was \\"You'll never get your jalopy back. And if you don't lay off trying to find me or your car, you're going to get hurt!

There is enough to keep the young readers attention and expand their minds in realistic situations NOT FANTASY. You always feel part of the mystery itself without feeling personaly threatened or scared.In the background the young reader gets to know the Hardy family well. A family where two young boys obey and look up to their father, a father who loves and respects his wife and children, a mother who loves, cares and provides for her husband and children and a family that is revered in the community because of their character.

It also serves as a great summer read for school-age kids, because there are so many and once you get started you'll want to read all the books. THE TOWER TREASURE followes the adventures of &quot;America's favorite detective duo&quot;, Frank and Joe Hardy, as they solve their very first mystery. The &quot;few flaws&quot; refurred to in the title of this review aren't major, so I do suggest that you read at least this (if not more) Hardy Boys mysteries. First of all, there aren't many girls in these. I know girls are meant for NANCY DREW, but there should be more females featured in HARDY BOYS. Second, it bothers me that the boys relied on their father (who is a detective by perfession) too much for assistance in the mystery-solving and theif-tracking. I would like to see them grow more independent in future books. Then again, I have a special liking for THE BOXCAR CHILDREN by Gurtrude Chandler Warner. Those are nineteen orginal mysteries featuring four very independent children--Henery, Jessie, Violet, and Benny Alden. Their grandfather (whom they live with) has no special sluthing skills, and they don't turn to him as often as Frank and Joe turn to their father. That's one of the things I like about it. But The Hardys have their own ways of bringing criminals to justice, and the book was always fun to read. I can't wait to read about the adventures of the Hardy Boys at THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF! A very enjoyable novel. (Highly reccomended.)"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve years and it was one of the first of many Hardy Boys I read. Unfortunately, in my youth I read the 1960's version, but this version, written in the 1920's, is much much better (I'm 39 now and read it to my son).I think the most interesting thing about this book is that a lot of the problems that today's parents/teachers/politicians complain about are the main topic in this story. Without giving away the storyline, it has car jacking, crime, violence, false judgments of youths, neglected children and murder. I guess it just goes to show that the good old days weren't always what they seem to be.Briefly the storyline is as follows. A rich person house is broken into and jewelry, money, and bonds are stolen. The Hardy boys investigate and find out that this burglary is related other things going on in town. Eventually, the boys with the help of their father solve the mystery.A nice bonus for this book is that for those of you who always wanted to know about Franklin W. Dixon, a very brief biography is presented."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"\\"Someone stole my jewels and security. I bet Robinson did it!\\" Franklin W.

Mr. Applegates put a $1000 reward. It is up to the Hardy Boys to solve the mystery. The Hardy boys' friend Chet Morton's car is missing. Now they have two mysteries to solve.I like this writing style because it is a mystery but fiction. Each sentence is very colorful and filled with descriptive words.

Also, the old tower seems interesting, and I'd like to visit it. But the other parts of this book were as good as the ones mentioned. So if you're 8-11, read this exciting first book by the best mystery author, Franklin W. Dixon."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"Written by Leslie McFarlane from an outline by publisher Edward Stratemeyer, THE TOWER TREASURE was first published in 1927--and the Hardy Boys series was born. They, along with similar Stratemeyer creation Nancy Drew, would have a remarkable durable career: the original series would generate fifty-nine titles between 1927 and 1979, and the characters remain current in newly conceived series to this day.In the late 1950s the earliest novels in the series were re-written in to make the characters more consistent and keep the books contemporary; even so, this is 1950s contemporary, and readers will not find computers, cell phones, and the like in the original series. The characters are also very distinctly of their era, with Frank and Joe Hardy, their friends, and their parents reflecting then popular ideas about gender roles and good vs. bad. The result is occasionally a bit \\"goody goody\\" in a white-bread sort of way, but on the whole the books remain entertaining to this day.This particular title finds Frank and Joe, with nudges from their famous detective father Fenton Hardy, investigating the theft of friend Chet's car--an investigation that soon leads the brothers into investigation of the a major theft from the Applegate mansion. They are here opposed by a local detective with the unlikely name of Smuff, who seeks to solve the case and claim the substantial award for himself.No one would accuse the Hardy Boys books of being great literature. They are distinctly formula in both plot and style. Even so, the books are brightly written and never talk down to their target audience--and older readers who enjoyed them in their childhood will find it a pleasing bit of nostalgia. I do not think THE TOWER TREASURE is among the best of the series, but it is entertaining, mindless fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This review concerns the revised 1959 edition. Frank and Joe try to prove to their father that they are good detectives by helping their friend, Chet Morton, find his stolen car and later by helping to clear another friend's father of robbery charges. This book is not the most thrilling mystery; however, that is understandable given that it was to be Frank and Joe's first case and considering that it wasn't that bad. Nonetheless, I would recommend reading the original version; the plot of both versions is identical and the events are mostly the same (some events where deleted in the revised edition and others slightly changed), but the revised edition has been drained of all of the rich language and strong characterization found in the original. The revised edition is still a good book, but if you have the option, I suggest reading the original because you will probably enjoy it more."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"As with many of the reviewers of this book, well beyond the ages it was originally intended for, it is a trip down nostalgic lane. My story is not unlike the others. My first introduction to the Hardy Boys were books given to me every birthday and Christmas. On occasion my parents would read them to me and even now, re-reading The Tower Treasure, I can still hear my dads voice saying the words. I have carried this set of books with me my entire life and never once thought about selling them. In actuality, I have read very few of them in their entirety and have decided to embark on reading the entire series. What a keen idea!The Tower Treasure introduces us to the Frank and Joe Hardy (The Hardy Boys), their detective father Fenton, their mother Laura, friends: Callie Shaw, Chet Morton and his sister Iola, along with numerous secondary characters. While running an errand for their father, the boys are nearly run off the road by a hazardous driver. This driver becomes responsible for many of the goings on throughout the rest of the story though we really never run into him again. The Hardy Boys search for stolen cars and try to recover stolen treasure along with their most important goal, to clear the name of their friend's dad.The real delight of a book of this nature is that everything in it is positive. Everyone is looking toward the brighter side of humanity and no one gives up hope. Teamwork plays a big part throughout the story as well. Rules to live by that perhaps have been forgotten and should be thought about once again. The 180 pages is a quick, as well as smooth, read."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"in this book you will find a stolen car, a treature worth a lot of money and a friend in danger. if you like mysterys like i do than the tower treasure is the book for you. trust me you should get this book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This book I found a lot of action and mystery in it.

They're a sounding voice that's yet to be stopped, even though they've been going for over 80 years now. Do they deserve this literary praise? Most definitely. Frank and Joe Hardy definitely set the standards for what makes a good teen detective. They're strong, smart, and work together as a team to solve their cases. They're a great example of what brotherhood and friendship should be like, and serve as great role models.I admit - this book isn't anything that's so deep it belongs on Sparknotes - but it's a great read for boys who're just starting to read \\"big kid\\" books. The story and vocabulary are easy to follow along, making it ideal as a book for those who're still perfecting their reading skills, but it's also great for those who're avid advanced readers. The plot will appeal to both.This book was very exciting, and I really did wonder just how it'd all turn out in the end. It was hooking from the time Frank and Joe came across a grand theft auto case in the beginning, and hard to put down as what started off with a stolen car continued to become something much larger and unexpected. Things grew especially tense within the middle of the book, and definitely raised the intensity and emotional level of the book far beyond what I was expecting... I'll admit that the ending was a bit abrupt, but overall, the story was fantastic. I can't complain much, but I can praise much.Overall, this is a great book that should not only be read by young boys, but by all. Who says only boys have to like The Hardy Boys? I'm male, and I love Nancy Drew just as much. They both set standards and make wonderful role models for boys and girls alike. Join them on all of their cases, if you can! :)"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"These books take me backs 50 years ago, when my younger brother and I, shared a lot adventures together.

The caretaker is arrested, but the boys don't believe he's guilty.I read the original 1927 edition and it is quite a trip back in time. By today's standards, the language is antiseptic and bland (\\"No slang please, not in Tower Mansion!\\"), but it's perfect for boys aged 8-10 who are just beginning to read chapter books. There's no danger, violence, or even much action to speak of; the emphasis is on the boys' resourcefulness and determination. Joe and Frank Hardy are relentlessly optimistic and straight-arrow good guys; in fact everyone in the story is wholesome and uncomplicated. Although the Hardys clearly obstruct justice by hiding clues from the police (who are portrayed as bumbling idiots), they emerge as real teen heroes.The story was serialized (and made more exciting) on TV in the fifties inThe Hardy Boys.

The main point the book gets is that this book is a page turner. No matter what happens or how much sheer stupidity is displayed the book always had me turning the page anxious to figure out the mystery behind the the Tower Mansion robbery. The criminal is also one of the smarter ones out there. By altering his apperance with many diffirent disguises the reader is never sure when what Frank and Joe see of him is actually him or just another clever disguise. That said when one of the disguises is actually found it leads to clever and romp in New York ans the boys along with their father track down clues and ultimately discover the secret behind the robbery. When the criminal finaly confesses, but can only get out a few words about the stolen goods whereabouts before he dies the book's action is pushed up a notch and many twists and turns happen before they realize the true meaning of the words the criminal said. The connection between the robbery and the hold up is very likely since most criminals do the same thing. The wannabe police oficer was also a welcome addition to the book and provided the comic relief. That here is what the book gets right.The Bad News:One of the main cripes I have with this book is that after the Tower Mansion is robbed Perry Robinson's father is accused of the crime and is arrested. Since we the reader knows that Perry's father is indeed innocent, but the bonehead authorites don't we should feel the need to get this case closed quickly so Mr. Robinson's name will be cleared, but we don't because the point is nobody cares. There is no charater developemnent into the Robinson family to make the reader feel the families plight and we could care less if he was accused of the crime. Also the book could have taken many diffirent turns then is has now that would've added to the excitement of the book, but the writer chose to just keep it straight forward. Besides the twist at the end of the book the story is played straight forward and the book almost becomes predictable which counts against the book. On another note the clues found while they do lead to some great chapters and pages the clues border on sheer stupidity that they would be there in the first place. Lastly the book shows its age with words like swell which just brings the book down lower.Yes or No?:Yes, I recommened buying this book. It's the first book in a long series that would follow and the book has redeeming values which make it readable."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This book is about Frank and Joe Hardy 18 and 17.They learn that an old tower may concease a fortune of stocks and jewelry.

Jackley confessed because the police had him on the run, he was fatally injured in a train accident and about to die.

He's the old eccentric who lives at the edge of town in a dark, spooky mansion with menacing towers standing at each end. WHODUNIT?

Frank and Joe Hardy are determined to prove to their father that they are ready to become detectives just like he is, so when Tower Mansion is robbed, Frank and Joe try to track down not only the thief, but also the loot. This mystery is not nearly as complex or as dangerous as the mysteries in other volumes, but that is understandable given that this was to be Frank and Joe's first case to solve. I found that any loss of excitement from not having a dangerous mystery was made up for with the writing. The richly described scenes and humor, which are sorely lacking in most of the later volumes, along with the glimpses of life at that time, make this a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"The Book is very good.

When I picked it back up at 12 years of age, I liked it so much I read about sixty other books in the series.This series lacks a lot of things when measured up against its competitors. It has no magic, very little humor (and even less funny humor), and the characters all sound like they walked out of Pleasantville. The Hardys are so square they make the Scooby Doo gang look like P. Diddy's posse. The world of the Hardy boys is free from dysfunction; they're never even tempted to do anything immoral, and a vast gulf separates them from any modern child who might try reading them.Despite all this, the series has a certain charm to it. The gee whizzes and oh gollies are funny without meaning to be, and the earnestness with which the Hardys set out to solve mysteries is refreshing in its simplicity. Each mystery is presented in such a way that the reader can have fun trying to second-guess the characters, and the methods that they use to solve the case should appeal to the logic-minded reader.This book is fairly short and easy to read. I suggest that you give it a shot, because if it appeals to you, you'll have hundreds of hours of enjoyment ahead of you."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"I loved this Book at first I didn't think I'd like the hardy boys, but I was wrong.

A highly readable Hardy Boys adventure story that has some ingredients that later books won't. Some of these include a much higher profile of Mrs. Fenton Hardy, who is largely replaced by Aunt Gertrude later on, and the death of an actual criminal the boys are after. The level of violence generally doesn't go this far. But the boys' chums are all introduced and some interesting other characters who will largely disappear from the series (Oscar Smurf comes to mind) make their chameos. One can easily see how this adventure story enthusiastically preceded so many more!"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"The original Hardy Boys series is a set of formula mysteries written during a time when most authors and publishers did not take children's literature as seriously as they do today. Franklin W. Dixon is not a real author, but rather a name coined to disguise a slew of ghost writers hired by publishing mogul Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) and his syndicate.The Tower Treasure is a fine introduction to this series. The writer introduces amateur detectives Frank and Joe Hardy in a story that sets the tone for many other books.I and millions of others grew up on these books. They are passable entertainment for younger children, but kids who are interested in reading should be encouraged to pursue better writing."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"I liked this book because it had a very decriptive story. It had scenes that made you feel like you were there. It also taught you how the boys started out in becoming detectives. This was a very good book.The best part of the book was the begining. The boys are taking a letter to town. A man in a car came flying up behind the them. They had to get off there motorcycles and press up against the wall. This was a good part.The climax and the setting were hard for me to understand. I did not understand where the best point was. I did not understand the setting either.

THE END"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"I remember the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew from my grade school days as the books I took out of the library over and over again. My 7 year old is a great reader. For his 8th Birthday I decided to spend part of his gift money on the Starter Set. We read The Tower Treasure together mostly, at least four chapters he read on his own, and in three days of his continual prompting, the mystery was solved. Great Book! Great Introduction into mystery novels for his age! The best benefit is that right away, he picked up the next book, The House On The Cliff and began reading it all by himself. In two hours he had read 8 chapters and couldn't wait until the next day to read some more. Though many words used are not the vocabulary of an 8 year old. With the first book, we gave him a yellow highlighter to signal out any words he didn't understand so that we can discuss them during the next days home-schooling session. The result was an instant vocabulary increase. Of course, no one talks or writes the way this book is formatted. I mean, the families actually speak nicely to one another (like in our family) and good children's authors and story's are rare (my opinion) but there is no greater benefit than having a good reader who still likes the Berenstain Bears and is engrossed in a non-picture book mystery his parents can trust (though we'll read them too, when he lets us. lol)"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This is a great book to read if you like mystery and suspence!!!"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"The first book in the Hardy Boys series, the book is a classic and a good introduction to the characters. With non stop adventure, it moves quickly and has several plot twists that one would expect from a goood mystery. Obviously, (first published in the early 1950's) the language is dated adding a quirky flavor to the book."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"Those cassettes came in really good condition, and I enjoyed listening to them very much."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"Hopefully, the reader will not mind if I wax nostalgic for a paragraph, but The Hardy Boys were an important part of my childhood. I got one book on the holidays and one for my birthday for some 5 years straight, and these were my entire personal library for some time. I owe all the thousands of books I have come to enjoy to a royal elephant, a detective pig, and Frank and Joe, the two inquisitive sons of Fenton Hardy. Now it is forty-some years later, and the temptation to see if I could go back again is simply too strong.'The Tower Treasure' is the very first, in which Frank and Joe start out trying to track down a stolen car for a friend, and suddenly find themselves embroiled in a jewel theft at the Tower Mansion. The father of another of their friends is a suspect, and the boys join with their father in the effort to bring the right man to justice.What makes these books work is that, while the plots are not particularly convolute, the books are peopled with many delightful characters and narrative. Adventures are had, wonderful secrets are divulged, the bad are punished and the good rewarded. In this day and age of equivocal messages, the clean, straightforward approach to life of Frank and Joe Hardy is like a breath of fresh air.I found the book quite engaging, even after all these years. I was quite envious of the Hardys, who even had their own motorcycles, and I find flickers of the same feelings even today. After all, I still don't have a motorcycle. I wish I could have grown up solving mysteries and adventuring with my sibling and father, but books like 'The Tower Treasure' turned out to be the next think. I learned a lot from Frank and Joe, and I think those values are still worth promoting."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"Although my 9-year-old son is willing to read when he has to, reading is pretty far down on his list of desirable leisure activities, below TV, video games, computer, Hot Wheels, and so on. However, this book, dated though it may be, changed all that. He stayed up late to read it, carried it to school with him, read it in the car, while he was eating... you get the picture. He hardly put it down until he was finished. I have already ordered the next 5 in the series. (Get the starter set, it's cheaper.) Yes, the characters are dated, the language is stilted, the plot is contrived and the details are unrealistic, especially to an adult jaded by \\"Law & Order\\" and \\"CSI.\\" But the characters demonstrate independent problem-solving; they're respectful to their parents, other adults, and the girls they date; there's no inappropriate language or toilet humor; and best of all, the kid loved it. Three cheers for the Hardy Boys!"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"Kudos to Applewood books for re-issuing this original text Hardy Boys book that started a line- up of great stories for youth that are still being published today. Most younger baby-boomers will not remember this story in its original form, as the text was substantially revised in the latter 1950's. This earlier, more hearty (no pun intended) story makes the revision pale by comparison. Applewood's reissue of Tower Treasure puts the series in its proper context. This story is truly the reader's introduction to Frank and Joe Hardy, and their mysteries. More than just nostalgia, this book is fun to read. If you read it to your children, you may have to put some of it in proper historical context, but that's part of the fun. I have found all of the original-text stories much more entertaining and substantial than the revised editions. Applewood has released six original-text Hardy's so far. I own them all, and highly recommend each one. In fact, I plan to purchase any of the original text Hardy stories Applewood will issue."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"Starting in the mid-1960s, the publisher of this series started to rewrite these books.In part, of course, this was to spike sales. The publishers were sure that sagging sales in the 60s were due to obsolete slang terms, and that spiffing the language up would help. So, \\"roadster\\" becomes \\"hot rod,\\" \\"bowler\\" becomes \\"hat,\\" and \\"hip flask\\" becomes \\"stash.\\"If only this was the end of it, though. In 1927, it was just fine to use ethnic stereotypes and labels. The white people in the book casually used shocking terms to describe women, Mexicans and African Americans.I won't repeat them here, in deference to today's well-placed sensibilities. But Franklin W. Dixon also rendered ethnic speech in a literal sense not seen today, and this, too, fell victim to the revisionist sensibilities that informed the editing job. Art is lost.Given the opportunity, the \\"rewriters\\" also could have resolved several unsolved problems in the 1927 original. These issues remain a mystery, even eighty years later:1. How did Chet actually recover his yellow roadster?2. It seems, on page 67 of the original, that Frank and Joe actually trade identities. Did they ever revert to their actual selves before the end?3. Who's Peggy?4. The purpose for which the Tower was built is never established.If you can get a hold of any copy of the rare 1927 original, you'll like it better. Well, in any event, this is a fun read, even as deconstructed."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This review is of the 1959 Revised Version of \\"The Tower Treasure\\". The first 38 titles in the series were revised over the course of 15 years (some with minor changes, others were completely re-written). \\"The Tower Treasure\\" is the first Hardy Boys mystery.Starting out with Frank and Joe trying to track down the thief who stole the beloved yellow \\"hot rod\\" of their friend Chet Morton, the Hardy brothers find themselves in the midst of their first real mystery to investigate. The brothers discover the disguise the thief must have used. This leads them to seek help from their father, the famous investigator Fenton Hardy. Fenton and the boys suspect that there may be a connection to the recent robbery at the Tower mansion where the only suspect is the father of their friend, Slim. Neither Frank nor Joe believes that Slim's father could have possibly committed the crime and they are committed to clear his name before Slim's family is ruined.I remember when I was much younger and was the age of the target audience of this novel. I could not get enough of the Hardy Boys and read each of the books several times over. Reading them a decade and a half later, I can still easily understand my obsession with the stories. \\"The Tower Treasure\\" is fast paced, interesting, and has a mystery that is begging to be solved (though this is one that can't necessarily be solved by the reader before the brothers solve it). It is fun to read through the Hardy Boys, and this is a good, clean, young adult adventure story (the series is more adventure than young adult). I can only hope that when I have children that they will enjoy the Hardy Boys as much as I did.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This review is about the Applewood reprint edition of the Tower Treasure. Revision of the Hardy Boys mysteries began in 1959 with the revision of Tower Treasure and a few other titles. We are very fortunate that Applewood has published the original text of the first 15 Hardy Boys stories. This is the first time readers have had the chance to read the original text of The Tower Treasure in 40+ years. This original text story is richer than the revised text version. Most notable is the inclusion of humor, but character development is also more in depth than the more modern stories. Subplots are also used more freely. This is an enjoyable read. Adults under 50 have probably not read this version of Tower Treasure, so it will be a revelation."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"The Hardy Boys were originally written decades ago, and even through at least two updates their age shows. Yet, as recently as the 1960s I read the Hardy Boys books with great interest, and felt as comfortable with them as with most children's television shows of that time. The only problem with the Hardy Boys is that there are far more challenging and exciting things for children to do today other than read about two boys who live in a land of make-believe that likely did not exist in their own original time, and certainly does not exist today.In this introduction to the Hardy Boys series, bonds and jewels have been stolen from Mr. Hurd Applegate. Mr. Applegate thinks it is Mr. Robinson, the gardener and general handyman. Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, Frank and Joe Hardy and all their friends do not believe that Mr. Robinson had anything to do with the robbery. The Hardy Boys begin their very first case!After a series of events, including the recovery of Chet Morton's stolen car, one of the boys nearly plunging to his death in Mr. Applegate's house, and the actual death of a criminal, the boys suddenly realize where the jewels and bonds might be found. Along the path to finding the bonds they also encounter would-be detective Oscar Smuff and a hobo who would challenge them for the treasure.While the Hardy Boys have not aged well, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Tower Treasure (The Hardy Boys, No. 1)","review":"This is a very good book.If you read it you will notice that you will never know whats going to happen next.I recommend that you should read this book if you like mystery books because this a very good book!
