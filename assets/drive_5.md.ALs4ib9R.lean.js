Great for any age!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have started reading the books. I just bought the complete collection and look forward to reading the rest of the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As I flew on my broomstick through the magical mind of Harry Potter I noticed that not only had it taken mind off of where I was and was happening around me, but that I was taking a journey that no other book has taken me on before. Harry Potter is a book not only about magic and spells, but it also shows the true beauty that authors can show through their unbelievable talents. If I had the power to speak to whoever reads this and personally convice them that this book is full of wonders and morals that they must uncover, I most definetly would without a moment's hesitation. While I read about magic, spells, and charms, I felt J.K. Rowling put a spell on this book to make her writing so unique yet breath taking. In all the books I have read, most of them seem like the author was losing his or her talents towards the end of the book. J.K. Rowling never left me bored or wanting to put the book down. In most books I count the pages I have left until the book is finished. In Harry Potter I counted the pages I read, never wanting it to end. J.K. Rpowling's writing style never failed to amaze me throughout the whole book. No matter what chapter I was on, I kept telling myself, I wish all the children in the world could read this book just to show that books can tell you the true beauty of friendship, courage, anmd kindness. This story, I guarantee, will sweep you off your feet and into a world of enchantment."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a Grandmother of a seven year old and a nine year old who have thoroughly enjoyed discovering Harry Potter, I decided to meet him also. What a treat. Not only is the writing great but there is a real moral thread throughout. Responsibility and loyalty are just two of the character traits demonstrated in a very entertaining manner. My only reservation is that some younger children might find the evil scenes overwhelming. Parents might want to preview the book before reading it to their little ones."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Before you start thinking that this is just a book for kids think again. If you have any kind of an imagination whatsoever you will love this book - whether you are 7 or 70. Fact - there are no wild romances here, you will not discover the meaning of life nor will you find a solution to stavation in bi-africa but you will have an absolutely marvelous time accompanying Harry Potter to Hogswort school for Witches and Wizards. Obviously, if you believe that reading about magic, dragons, giants and ghosts will send you straight to hell then don't buy this book. This book gets a big &quot;Thumb's Up&quot; from me! Do yourself and the kid inside you a favour and read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone is an excellent book. If you can get students to read, male and female student's, to read the same book and get so hooked, that is a great book. There is adventure to it, mystery, friendship, family, and much more. It even leaves room for the next book at the end and makes you want to read the next one as soon as you can! Harry Potter goes through many challenges and learns about himself and his friends in the process of it all. You get so hooked by the new language, new sport and magic in the book. It's a great book and I would recommend it to everyone, kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"ABSOLUTELY!!!Let me begin by stating that I am unquestionably a Conservative Christian. Many who share my other beliefs have attacked this book (and the movie based upon in) without having read it. So, this review is directed to those types and anyone who wishes to discuss the issue intelligently with someone who claims religious objections to this book and the rest of the series.The primary objection that is raised is the use of magic in the book. Afterall, the book is about a school of wizardry and witchcraft. Well, hold the phone! If the use of magic as a plot device makes a book inherently unsuitable for Christians, then let us gather at the river and throw away our beloved Chronicles of Narnia and Ring Triology. To be fair, some of Potter's critics do object to Lewis's and Tolkien's works as well, but the vast majority of the Conservative Christian world embraces those authors with no reservations.So, this leads to another possible basis for objection to the Harry Potter series: the books don't promote an explicitly Christian worldview. Well, back the bus up!! If that's our standard, then to be consistent, we would have to object to John Steinbeck, Herman Melville, Ernest Hemingway, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, Pat Conroy, . . . well, you get my point.Okay, so maybe the Potter books really do teach bad lessons. Ummmm . . . NOPE! The books are classic Good vs. Evil stories. Yes, Potter, Ron, & Hermione don't always show proper respect for their elders, but in this book they are only 11 years old, so for the most part, that's realistic. Plus, in the books, there is usually some negative consequence to the characters' \\"bad\\" actions.Now, onto this book itself. The plot twists in this book were not terribly difficult to see coming, but then again, I'm a voracious reader, and I'm 33 years old and an attorney. To the target audience, I would wager that the developments of the story were not nearly so transparent.Putting that aside, this book was still a \\"page-turner.\\" I finished it in two evenings of reading (actually, 2 late nights of reading).My recommendation: Buy this book for your kids, and read it yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heard alot about this book from both friends and TV. I bought the book as a birthday gift for my nephew. I read the book myself and loved it. I am much older than the age group the book was written for. I found the characters very interesting and the book difficult to set down. I read the book in less than two days. I would recommend this book for anyone who has an imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book aloud to my 9-yr-old son, who was resistant to the idea at first. We read a chapter a night (well, most nights - some nights we read 2 chapters!) and I could see his skepticism change to curiosity, then to outright enthusiasm. By the time we were on Chapter 14, he was begging me to buy the sequels immediately. The experience of reading like this was new to both of us, and wonderful! We will definitely read more books this way, starting with the next Harry Potter, which arrived the same day we read the last chapter of this book. The book itself was magic. It was funny and touching and scary (well, to a 9-yr-old!) and great fun! My son really identified with Harry, too. He liked Harry's friends, disliked his enemies and rooted for Gryffindor House as if it were his own. Buy or borrow this book! Your kids will love the book and you'll love sharing it with them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First, I liked the book. It was a good read, and it had some unpredictable twists and turns which surprised me. The mean characters did not bother me, they may seem cruel but not unusually more so than any other fantasy or children's bad-guy, (altho I do see the point that it is a little more graphic and real life possibility, so some may find that disturbing). HOWEVER. I don't understand the hype: what have you parents been feeding to your children for books? I have grown up reading comparable sci-fi fantasy books all my life, this one does not Stand Out. I mean, anything to get kids interested in reading, but haven't you read the classics? Books by Piers Anthony (Xanth, etc), Roald Dahl (Witches, Matilda), C.S. Lewis (Narnia), for younger kids Ruth Chew (lots of Witch &amp; Magic stories), Lloyd Alexander (Book of Three), Madeliene L'Engle (Wrinkle in Time), and for older teens and adults, JRR Tolkein (Lord of the Rings). All good books, and I'll be glad to add Harry Potter to the list of good sci-fi fantasy, but not above them. Good books have been around for a long time; Harry Potter isn't the first and won't be the last."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There is little more I can add to the coverage and discussion around Rowling's first book of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, nor do I think I could be terribly objective because they mean so much to me personally. However, I did receive the 10th Anniversary Edition as a gift and wanted to mention a few things. First, this edition is bound in red cloth with embossed stars (very fun to carry if you, like me, do not want to damage the dust jacket and remove it while reading). Second, this book includes a full-color illustration of Hagrid approaching Hogwarts in the boats for first years. Finally, we get an early drawing of Professor Snape done by Rowling herself. Nothing else about this edition is dramatically different, except for the new drawing and dust jacket. The average reader will not need to go out and buy a copy of this edition, but if you are a Harry Potter enthusiast, you may want a copy to sit alongside your series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I believe, as a teenager, that this is one of the best fantasy books that has ever been written. Not only, is it creative and imaginitive, but also everyone can get something out of the moral, even adults who thought that they were too old for fantasy.It's about a boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and soon finds out that he is a wizard and is suddenly taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he is famous for something he doesn't even remember. There he meets friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Then Harry must save the world (muggles and wizards alike) and try to stop the wizard that killed his parents and tried to kill him from coming back to power.This famous and beloved book goes beyond just a story about witchcraft and magic. This is NOT the whole point of the book, believe it or not. J.K. Rowling uses morals such as friendship and trust to create a wonderful story that has made her famous, and for a good reason."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a teacher. I work with third graders. I bought this book after attending a workshop about the new books from 1999. I began reading and decided I must read it aloud to my students. As we were reading, the children would beg for me to read more. Five of the children bought the book as we were reading it and finished it on their own. They were so enthralled with the suspense and intrigue of the story. When we finished, one of our parents got on-line and ordered the second story from England so we could read it even before it was released in the U.S. I now own both hard copies and cannot wait for the third and the rest. J.K. Rowling has truly captured the hearts of children. My original Harry Potter has been loved by over ten adults so far also. I applaud her wonderful writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone. It was full of suspense and action. I felt that I was right there with Harry when everything happened."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just finished this marvelous book. It will be a read-aloud for my sixth grade class in the fall. It's so important that one of the main characters is a strong female with her own ideals about how to succceed in life. The book truly lets you use your imagination conjuring up what flying a broomstick is like and what it would entail to raise a baby dragon. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When going on a two week vacation with a 7 &amp; 9 year old you must find something to entertain them when they get bored, my solution: Harry Potter and the sorcerer's Stone!

I'm thirteen and the book was my 11-year-old sister's, but I LOVE it!!! I was so worried that J.K. Rowling wouldn't write anymore after the Chamber of Secrets.

I definatly reccomend this book to all people!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good book and kept us craving for more. Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. The quality of writing was excellent and I love the way J.K.

I started off suspecting the wrong guy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 12 years old and I LOVED this book! I never really thought of a witch as being good untill I read this book. The whole thing was great but my favorite part would have to be when he finds out he is a wizard. I read it in a about 2 days and then loaned it to my friend Cara who read it in half a day. Now my Aunt is half done with it and can't put it down! I recommend it to everyone no matter what age!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When my 4th grade son asked for this hardbound book and then the &quot;sequel&quot;...I thought what is so &quot;entrancing&quot; with the Harry Potter books??I read through the first book (Sorcerer's Stone) and &quot;stole&quot; his copy of the next book (Chamber of Secrets) and can't wait to read the 3rd book.The story moves quickly and keeps you wanting more. This is a children's story but adults can enjoy the wizardry and fun with the &quot;muggles&quot; and Harry Potter.We have great discussions about the pronunication of the characters' names to what we think will happen to Harry next!!Truly a book that crosses the generations. What fun!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After reading all of the hype over Harry Potter and his somewhat mysterious stone, I had to read the book to see if it lived up to all of the excitement. I purchased the book from Amazon and waited until last month to savor it. Upon completion, I have to admit that Harry Potter was worth all the money I paid and more. As an adult, and a teacher, I must say that this book was some of the most enjoyable summer reading I have done in many years! While the style of writing may have been a little difficult for 9 and 10 year olds, it still would make a great read-aloud for parents and children to enjoy together. Parents may want to preview the book beforehand since the book does deal with some wizardry, and magic (which may be objectionable to some); although I must say that Rowling does present the magic aspect in an inocent and creative way. Rowling's characters are very detailed and the author does a wonderful job of bringing out the fears and excitement all children feel when entering new schools and meeting new friends. I highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the second installment (which I already ordered, by the way). Do yourself a favor and pick this book up if you haven't already! Life is too short not to treat yourself with some great, fun reading like this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that the book was very good. It is good for all ages, especially 10 year olds, like me. I especially liked the funny parts, like the three-headed dog's name, &quot;Fluffy&quot;, vicious little guy, isn't she.

Each one gets better and better and they all interconnect so smoothly. Does it take time to power through all seven books? Of course... but it's completely worth it.The series provides the ultimate in good vs. evil stories because it is so deep and engaging. I finished the series in 2007 shortly after the last book was published and have since reread the entire series three times. Each time in preparation for the final three movies. Each time has been better than the last and I learn and pick up on so many new things that I never even began to think about before. In turn, this has enhanced the movie watching experience as well. Each book provides a different piece to the puzzle and no book should be skipped or skimmed. Each is equally important and that's the beauty of the series.I've read and enjoyed nearly 100 different books and series in my lifetime, and no book series has ever come close to the Harry Potter series. No book have I ever been extremely thrilled about rereading or experiencing than the Harry Potter series. Once you've began reading, you won't easily stop. My father who only reads things that pertain to his job, has begun reading the series and wishes that he was reading them when the movies were coming out because he's been enticed that much.So... basically, what I'm getting at is that you should definitely buy THE ENTIRE SERIES, you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Revisiting Harry whilst suffering from the flu. still a fun read.

When Harry Potter first came out and ALL my friends were raving about it, I couldn't have cared less and reminded myself this was probably another &quot;Pokemon&quot; craze. However, when the movie was released, I thought I would see what made everyone glassy-eyed over an 11-year-old wizard boy. All I have to say is that the movie DID inspire me enough to read the book. The book is amazing, or should I say \\"wicked\\"! The plot was so captivating that I couldn't even put the book down until I realized it was 2AM! The characters, Harry Potter, Ron Weasly, Hermoine Granger etc. are so absorbing that you just want to know more about everything! Heck, even my sister (11 years old) who HATES books (She thinks Enid Blyton stories give her a headache) loved the book! My sister has NEVER read a book longer than 100 pages. She, however, is hooked onto these books and is even willing to read the 4th book that she referred to as a dictionary! Harry Potter gave us, kids and teens, something.

I recently began a job an hour's drive away from my home and decided to get the book on tape to ease the long drive.I was pleasantly surprised as I began to look forward to my drive time so I could continue with Harry's adventures. The story is engrossing with it's attention to detail. The reader infuses the story with modulated tones and an interesting vocal quality.I have so enjoyed these tapes that I went straight out and bought the &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When i first saw this book i thought it would be stupid and boaring, but by the time i read the first and second chapters i didn't want to put it down. I thought it was a neat book and I learned about how miricles can happen when Harry was taken to the wizard school by Hagrid and then later found out that his auntie and uncle knew that he was a wizard and never told him. (...) From this book I learned that you shouldn't judge somebody by there looks but by the information you gain about them and that is why i recomend this book to every one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If anyone had said to me I'd be a fan of Harry's a month ago, my one word response would have been 'Bleugh!' &lt;Okay, so it's not technically a word, but still...&gt; That all changed a few weeks ago when I took a trip to the cinema and was given the option of waiting two hours for another film, or watch Harry. (In case you didn't know, patience isn't one of my virtues) I found myself pleasantly surprised, not to mention amazed at how much I was enjoying it; meeting Harry and sympathising with him for his unpleasant relatives, the Dursleys, laughing to myself at the deluge of 'invitation letters' pouring down the chimmney, staring in open mouthed wonder at Diagon alley and Hogwarts school and hanging on the edge of my seat during the Quidditch tournament. Afterwards, I went out to get my own copy of the book, followed by the three others, and found myself, once again amazed, not only by how good the book is, but how close to it the film had been. Understandably, there was more dialogue to the book, some of the plot details were more noticeable here and there, but perhaps that was because you can always re-read a page in case you missed something. I can definitely see now, why these books are so popular with almost everyone who reads them, and especially why the film has done so well; because, magic aside, they are simply about a young boy in an unpleasant situation, who finds a way out of it through his new school, friends and teachers, etc. That may be oversimplifying a bit, but that doesn't make it any less true. And to all those people who think this series of books might promote witchcraft or the occult or something. &lt;?&gt; Did these people complain about the Jedi in Star Wars? or even the witches on Buffy and Sabrina? Incidentally, I've read the four HP books so far and seen the film twice, I don't have any inkling to... mix up potions, run around on a broomstick making 'whooshy noises' or even waving a wooden stick at people, whilst talking gibberish. Another point I have is one of confusion really, I simply cannot fathom why the title was changed. (To Sorceror's stone from Philosopher's stone?) For now though, I only have two worries, firstly, that the next book won't be out until about April next year, and if a relatively small book like this one made a two and a half hour movie, will I need an overnight bag when 'The Goblet of fire' is eventually made?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Its a great reading pleasure! Im brought back to the childhood days of fantasies.... It reminds me of the great books written by Enid Blyton like The Wishing Chair, The Faraway Trees series that really captivates the young readers' hearts.

Actually he is a very famous wizard, much like his parents. His parents died when he was a very young boy. They were killed by a wizard gone bad named Voldemort. He now has to go to Hogwarts the school or witches. He finds himself being very good at a sport called Quiddich. Many things happen while he is there.

He didn't believe it until the messanger used magic against Harry's uncle which was refusing to let Harry go.So Harry goes off to school and makes some friends that help him learn things about the magic world, since his aunt and uncle never told him a thing about magic and that he was a wizard.

I remember seeing amazing things in my mind and heart as I read the wondrous works of authors like J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, I. Asimov and A.C. Clarke.Now again, I feel that warm glow. I am a grown man, but that thrilling sense of adventure has returned. It was a place where I discovered something new around every corner, where as a child I had to learn how to deal with the world.J.K. Rowling has reached the stellar heights of previous literary giants before her, who have taken the souls and minds of their readers and launched them to dizzying heights.Harry Potter is not overrated; it does comfort you with the knowledge that when the world seems darkest and most terrifying, some forces will see us through. Those forces are friendship, honor, love, mercy, kindness and courage.In the larger scope, I look forward with anticipation as these remarkable kids grow up (Harry, Hermione and Ron). In a sense I want to be there every step of the way as they make the amazing journey to adulthood in book 7 and beyond. And as I go along with them, my imagination is rekindled and my trust in the human spirit of mutual compassion and mercy is revitalized.For those who would submit &quot;You are reading too much out of a children's book,&quot; I would reply that they should take note of what the Headmaster of Hogwart's says to Harry towards the end of the book; something about an &quot;organized mind.&quot; I challenge the cynic to claim such a phrase belongs in a children's book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There's not much original praise to heap on this book, but I wanted to advise those who haven't yet heeded Harry's call-don't wait any longer!I've had the first two Potter books sitting on my bookshelf for a couple of years, and finally felt compelled to read Book One, \`cause I wanted to read the book before seeing the film. What was I waiting for?! This book is pure, unadulterated, exhilarating fun. I felt like I was eleven years old again. Can't wait to see the movie, and to read books two through four."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has been the rave for some time, and I tend to avoid top sellers, because the few times I have broken down and tried to read one, I have been burned.Harry Potter has blown me away.They are not a difficult read, but they are a good read. It is a simple story, and reads in a similar style to such books as, &quot;BFG&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot; and &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;.It is a rare childrens book that does not over simplify it's language or ideas for children. And this is one such book.I think it is very appropriate for children of all ages, (including us over sized ones). It is Ideal for a bedtime story, because the parents should get as much enjoyment as the children.So I say, Harry Potter impressed me, despite my misgivings."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've been reading this book to my kids - and we all are enjoying it very much. I've heard all the negative comments about the 'evil' side of the story. Think about it - many children's stories have evil characters - Aladdin, Little Mermaid, gosh, even Bambi! The 'bad guy' shows up all the time. I think the Harry Potter books are delightful and imaginative. They get kids to read and love reading. (Also, a quick recommendation for some great books on parenting - check out these: Kid Cooperation, The 10 Greatest Gifts I Give My Children, and Perfect Parenting"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got the book for my 7 year old son. I have been reading it aloud for him every night and now my 4 year old daughter is joining us. I wish my throat could stand reading aloud for longer intervals. I am enjoying it as much or more as my kids. It's a great book that besides engaging a child's imagination, teaches about being nice to others, even if they are different.I definitely recommend it. And of course, I will be reading the next two."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a funny, imaginative book. This book is full of laugh-out-loud escapades as well as more serioius episodes. I am a college student, and I absolutely loved it. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Had I stopped to read the book one chapter to the end, I would have probably given 3 stars; but the book is not what it seems to be, it is a thriller disguised as a fairy tale. One of the few books that managed to surprise me. Although I think children will enjoy reading it, grownups will appreciate it more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"JK Rowling in this exceptionally creative and humorous book, takes the reader on a grand adventure. As our family reads this book together we are all on a vacation for the mind...and what a fantastic journey it has been without even leaving our livingroom! A BIG thank you to the Author for captivating us from page one and holding us spellbound ever since. We anxiously look forward to reading the rest of this series...what a great keepsake to give our children, that they in turn can give to theirs."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book and so does my brother.I think everyone should read this WONDERFUL book. some people say &quot;It has to much violence&quot; or &quot;It teaches kids it's okay to do something wrong. Well, I have only one thing to say to them: HELLO! Practicly everything today has violence and teaches kids bad stuff, but.... kids need at least some imagination and if we can't have that I'd rather not be apart of this cruel world!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved it. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ! Harry and his friends are just what friends should be. They stick together in bad times. That's what my friends and me do. My mom read it and thought it was great! I even did a book report on it! Like I said if you haven't read it yet you just have to! ~"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a very powerful, and moving book. I reccomend this book to any readre who wants to read about adventure, fiction, and fun. EVERYONE READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is soo cool. The Harry Potter books are the only ones which I have read 5 times each in one week"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a fun book to read! I'm delighted to see that someone is finally writing books that children love to read. These books have it all: excitement, good, evil, friendship, loyalty, and adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am in my early 30's and have to first say that this was an usual read for me. I purchased the book after the movie came out (still have not seen it) - because of all the hype that was centered around the series. I have to say once I started reading I was hooked. JK Rowling has captured the imagination in a way that I haven't seen since I was a child. From chapter to chapter she leaves you wanting more. I can't wait to get started on the next book, and I strongly recommend this book for any age!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter, not your typical, average kid you might have thought him to be. Harry lives with his aunt and uncle, who mistreat him very harshly, after his parents were killed. Harry's bedroom is under the stairs. He is almost like a house servant to his aunt, uncle, and pig-like cousin, but all that changes when letters arrive for Harry to take him to a mystical new place. Harry was made to think he was nothing but it turns out he is a big somebody. The new school he goes to, Hogswarts,is the part of the book where the magic starts. He finds out how his parents died, who did it, and finds the sorcerer's stone!This book is one I highly recommend. It's for people of all ages. Harry Potter takes you through an original, suspenseful, and entertaining journey. I haven't seen the movie yet but when I do I'll certainly compare it to the excellent book of wonders."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book that everyone will love. I really enjoyed this book because it pulled you into it and you had to keep on reading. I finished this book in 2 days because the details of the story line were so interesting I couldn't put it down.J.K. Rowling is everything that people make her to be. She really has a huge imagination. I like how the book is clear and how she describes each and every character with the tiniest details. This gives you a perfect image of how each character acts and looks.One of my favorite parts of these books is the Quidditch match. I like how you get involved with the game and wish that it were a real sport so could play it too. In fact, during this story, I got almost jealous of those characters. I wanted to be able to do the spells like Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Those 3 get themselves caught in many predicaments throughout this book and somehow they always find a way out.One suggestion I do have is to read the series in order. Things might not make sense to you otherwise. Try to avoid skipping books and chapters because every sentence in it is important. I read the books out of order starting at 2, then reading 3,4, and lastly, 1. Pieces are going back into the puzzle, but a lot less confusion would have taken place if I read them in order.Over all, this series is not a waste of your time, read it and don't miss out. To answer my opening question, yes, this series is named number one because it is the best."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this first book in the Harry Potter series mostly to see what all the fuss was about over on Beliefnet. I was pleasantly surprised - this book transported me back to my own childhood long since past, and I was completely absorbed in this little fantasy for the day or two that it occupied my time and attention. The characters were well developed, and I couldn't help feeling one way or another about each of them. I gave the book to my daughter-in-law once I was finished with it, and she also devoured it in a couple of days - after which she loaned it to my other daughter-in-law. Since then, we've all read the 2nd and 3rd books, and are eagerly awaiting the paperback edition of the 4th book in the series. I highly recommend it, regardless of your age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter, written by J.K Rowling, is one of the best books that I have read. The mystery of the mystical magic is one of the best parts about this book. I like the way the characters go through the dangerous and magical journeys. The book made me feel like I was there. It felt like I was following Harry everywhere he went. For somebody who doesn't like books, I really like this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I didn't let myself read this book for the longest time. All the hype made me wary, but I finally picked it up so I could see what all the fuss was about. I'm 19 years old and absolutely love this book. I won't say that the idea behind the book is a new one - I've read several books where the main character is a kid who's discovered that there's something special about him/her and is going to a school where that specialness can be nutured (Arrows of the Queen by Mercedes Lackey comes to mind; it's also an excellent book, and I recommend it if you like this one). However, I like that kind of story, and J. K. Rowling's writing style is enjoyable to read. It's easy to see that she's got the details of her world figured out; it's makes rereading fun, because you can catch all sorts of things that you might've missed that she brings up later in the book or even later in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who hates you. Then, in a weird, magical way of luck, you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoeniz-feath wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including stawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you find out that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to Harry Potter in J.K Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the nonmagic human world-- the world of \\"Muggles\\"-- Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who were made to take care of him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, and a bunch of powers to remind him that he's different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. After watching the movie, I knew I had to read the book once more and write a review on it.My favorite part of his book was the part when Harry Potter ahd to learn how to play Quidditch. He had to learn the basic rules of the game and how to play while balancing on a broomstick. He had to adjust to the game for it was his first time playing it. Even though his broom was jinxed, I would say he played a good game even thoguth the other team cheated and won. He learns the regulations of the game and is filled with knowledge on the game after playing it.I think this book is great for everyone of every age to enjoy at any time. This book is for the whole family to enjoy. YOu can never predict what will happen next. There is always a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, which is my favorite thing about a book. I believe taht J.K. Rowling is a wonderful author and has a bright future way ahead of her."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who hates you.

I recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must start by saying that of the four books in this series published to date, The Sorcerer's Stone is the weakest. It is, however, an excellent start for an excellent author. Without the three succeeding books, it would not warrant five stars, but every story must have its beginning. So, before you open the cover of this one, I suggest you purchase the next three, as once you start, you won't want to stop...

This J.K. Rowling piece is easy to comprehend and at the same time grabs you into this imaginary world of the wizards and goblins. While reading this book Rowling brings out different emotions for a drama and plenty of action for an adventure. In the story Harry's curiosity of the eerie realm makes you believe the story of non-fiction. The story line of this book expands to different scenarios, to make it great for an anthology. The magic and fantasy thats created by Rowling is captivating to the imagination and would make anyone believe in mystifying make-belive. This book is perfect for the child or even adult that is still searching for that adventure in life. Follow Harry Potter's life's path, and go through his calamities and adversities he overcomes. Experience his great destiny, but and his encounter he must survive throughout the story.

It was full of suspence in every chapter. It was a little boring at first but then it started to get really good. It took a while to read because it was a long book but i read the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; and the &quot;Prisonor of Azkaban&quot; and they were also extrordinarily written."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have you ever woken up as a baby, on someone's doorstep? This is what happened to Harry Potter.When he was just a baby, an evil wizard killed his parents. Harry defeated the wizard, but he got a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt.He became famous for this event, but strange things were happening to him. Harry is a troubled boy. I like how whenever he gets mad, something bad happens. It is weird. He was running away from Dudley's friends when he came to a dead end and ended up on the roof. Then he found he was a wizard. He was told to go to the train station, to platform #9 . His uncle just dropped him off and he left! That was cruel. Harry asked the lady where the platform was. She said her sons would show him how to go through. Then a boy started running right at the wall! He went right through! I thought that was cool. Harry made it through okay. I thought this scene was cool because no ordinary human could do that.Harry is tall, he wears glasses, and he has black hair. He also has a star on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. He is very good at magic. He also is very smart. Harry meets a professor named Snape. He is as sly as a fox. His is very mean to Harry. Harry is a good boy. He always has his homework done. I think he is a nice person, but sometimes he is mean. I think that Harry has a lot to deal with, like his homework, and everyone mauling him all over the school. He also gets yelled at by Snape.If you want to find out more about Harry, read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book takes you on a Journey to a land faraway.

My feelings about each bookSorcerer's stone: Great for the opening, quite good at setting up the basic elements of the book and pushing an open path for the other books.Chamber of Secrets: BEst! iT IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER, FEAR AND DARKNESS. Yet the parts about Lockhart are really fun. It has so much adventure and has so much action, with such vivid descriptions.Prisoner of Azkaban: Deeply moving, how Harry feels about his dead parents and brings his father to life within himself, the horrible characteristics of the Dementors. This one has the ability to play on and connect to your emotions, producing the deepest impact.Goblet of Fire: Good all around, exciting new plot, great work at showing character in people.Keep it up J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is my faviot book. It's filled with exciting instresting and funny suff. It is about a boy named Harry who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cusuin They are the biggest muggles (non magic people) The world has ever seen. They hate anything to do with magic. Harry has lived with them of 10 years becues his parents died in in a car crash, so he thought, until he started getting letters and a person named Hagrid enters the story and told him he was a wizzird and his prents were killed by the lord voldmort. Harry starts at a wizzards school name hogwarts were he meets Ron and Herimonie.

I like how J.K.Rowling started with the Dursleys and the way J.K.Rowling made me think that they were very hard to live with and it made me feel sorry for Harry and what he had to go through. I also liked the way how J.K.Rowling didn't straight away tell you about why Harry had to live with the Dursleys and what happened to his parents. And then the Petunia tells him that they were in a car crash but I had this feeling that she wasn't telling him the truth because she didn't tell him that he isn't a mortal.

A wondrous, easy to read book that is delightful for third graders and adults. My son, who, for some reason, did not want to read the book, could not put the book down and finished it before me. A great family book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I may be among the last 12 people on Earth to read \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" so some might question the need for me to write a review. OK, so let's not call this a review - here are just some thoughts I had after finishing the book.I was surprised that \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" started so slowly. For the first 40 or 50 pages, it really seemed to plod along. If I had not been told by, oh, about a million people that the book was worth sticking with, I might have given up. I guess we're lucky that some early readers did stay with the book and spread the word of its charms, or the whole Harry Potter franchise may have died an early death without Voldemort even getting involved.Indeed, after the slow start, the book does get better and author J.K. Rowling really shows her, ahem, magic. There are lot of reasons this book works: An inventive story; likeable main characters; an intriguing mystery. Another reason are the imaginative little elements Rowling sprinkles through the book. Here are some of my favorites:1. Great names. Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Draco Malfoy, the Weasley brothers, Professor McGonagall, Hagrid. These names roll snappily off the tongue and seem to hint, even if you knew nothing else about them, at their personalities. The same applies to the names of the four houses of Hogwarts: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravensclaw, and Slytherin. Is there any doubt that the slimiest students will be found in Slytherin?2. Clever use of animals. Rowling could have had the students simply send and receive letters, but instead they get owls. They fear a giant three-headed dog named ... Fluffy. And they help care for a baby dragon that doesn't breath fire, but is fearsome in its eating habits. Nice touches.3. Quidditch. Rowling takes the witches-on-a-broom image and turns it into exciting game. And you can't just use any old broom - you gotta have a Nimbus Two Thousand!4. Animating the inanimate. Rowling could have simply divided the student wizards into different houses with barely a mention of the process, but instead she brings a hat - the Sorting Hat - to life to do the job. Elsewhere in the book, characters in paintings move and talk, chess pieces come to life, and keys fly around.To be honest, the book never reached that can't-put-it-down feeling for me, but there were so many imaginative touches that it was a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Great book. Some differences than movie. But still a fantastic book. Would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book that got me interested in reading. Something you just can't put down for too long and without wanting to finish the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The characters are very believable, but what they do is not. My characters do not change throughout the book, although their attitudes change. Hermione has a very bad temper, Ronald is scared of everything (I mean everything), and Harry pretty much does what he needs to do.The conflict in this book centers around the red sorcerer's stone. Harry, Hermione, and Ronald embark on a great adventure to find the sorcerer's stone before the dreaded Voldemort comes back to Hogwarts and terrorizes the school of witchcraft and wizardry. But on their adventure, Ronald, Harry, and Hermione become very close even though They often disagree about many things. But when things start looking bad they put their heads together. will they find the sorcerer's stone?????? Read and find out, it will be worth your time to read about the three of them on their amazing adventure.What made me want to read this book were the awesome movies. I saw the first and second movies and had to read the books. The reason I had to read the books is because I have always been told the books are better than the movie. So I did, and they blew me away.I would definitely recommend the Harry Potter series to anyone who likes fantasy books. The reason I feel this is way because I absolutely loved this book. But this book is on a 7th or 8th grade reading level, so for me it was easy to read, but for others, it may not be that easy. The ending could have been better. You'll know what I mean when you read this book. But I was very satisfied with the resolution of the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I finally broke down and read the first book of the Harry Potter series. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and complexity of \\"Sorceror's Stone\\", and feel it is the quintessential book for all ages.The opening sequence is a great introduction to the world of \\"witches\\" and \\"muggles\\". Uncle Vernon is a somewhat sympathetic lug who is overwhelmed by the unknown and his spoiled son. The hero Harry Potter is the classic underdog, who after living with nothing now discovers a new world with new acceptance and challenges. J.K. Rowling does design Potter well, making him believable but not too pathetic.A great cast of characters are introduced, along with the magical Hogwarts school. Ron Weasley is the perfect sidekick and Hermoine is great as the sensible and flustered female friend. As an adult, you pretty much knew Snape wasn't as bad as advertised, but as children do find out, some who look out for you aren't always the most sugary lot.There is alot of action and intrigue in this book. It is a quick and exciting read and I think just about anyone would enjoy it. I will definitely read more. One question: at a school for witchcraft, why would you celebrate Christmas?Sometimes the dialogue gets too detailed and there are just a few too many plotlines. Still, this is a good read so pick up your broomstick now and get it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"when this came out i had instantly fallen in love with the book, being the age as an up and becoming wizard you cant help but wonder if on your eleventh birthday a giant will come take you away, you find yourself fantasizing about different creatures and powers that you wish you had, truly mesmorizing for a first time author"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit that I only read the Harry Potter books in 2005 -- after swearing for years that I would never, under any circumstances ever read them. And now I have to eat my words. If you are an adult, I think these books are just as much fun for you as they are for kids. If you want to lose yourself in a good book, these are nothing short of addictive.I borrowed the set that I read, but I immediately ordered the whole set, and I can't wait to read them again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After seeing the first three films and with all the fanfare surrounding the latest release, I finally decided to pick up the first book in the \\"Harry Potter\\" series. I won't waste any time on describing the plot of the book, since most folks already know the gist of the whole thing thanks to the films.What I want to address is the fact that this really is a wonderful book for kids to pick up. It's full of adventure and fantasy that's sure to spark any young mind into the wonderful world of reading. That's a good thing. Don't let the naysayers who claim that this book and the movie based on it, as well as all of the books and flicks that follow, is Satanic or evil. It's make believe. Granted, if your child attempts to conjure the spirit of a long dead uncle or tries to cast a spell on their little brother, seek help and put Potter on the backburner. Otherwise, let your kids enjoy themselves. Use this book as a springboard into other wonderful children's tales such as the works of Madeleine L'Engle (\\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" and its sequels), and C.S. Lewis (the \\"Narnia\\" saga). Eventually, your child will pick up books on REAL biology, astronomy, math, English, etc. and they'll be all the better for it.Let your kids enjoy being a kid. Harry and his friends help make that possible."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have heard of Harry Potter books for the longest time but didn't start reading them until this year. i have only finished the first one so far, and I LOVED IT! i am now reading the 2nd one and love it just as much so far! i have some advice....don't see the movies until you read the books. this way you can picture the plot your own way and not the moviemaker's way. also you can get the whole story because sometimes the movies don't have everything the books have.

The reader, Jim Dale, is amazing. He creates different character voices and really makes the story come alive. If you don't have time to read the book, I highly recommend the audio books. I am completely hooked...and I haven't had an ounce of road rage since!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The brilliant opening to J.K. Rowling's phenomenal Harry Potter series is an effortlessly magical, charming, exciting, and completely immersive experience. It is incredibly rare to be as drawn into the world of a fantasy novel as much as one is in the terrifying, hilarious, and sometimes unsettling world that Rowling has created.Another commendation on Rowling's behalf is that she manages to make real, believable, and complex characters with strengths and weaknesses in equal measure. Eight years after the book's initial publication in the UK, sitting down to read this book is like having a cup of tea with old friends. It's a beautiful novel, it really is.How interesting that both the Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer series started in 1997, each revitalizing the fantasy genre and creating some of the most realistic and complicated characters in the genre's history. 'Twas a good year for make-believe."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Until the last two books came out, this was my favorite!!! The focus on Dursley's was amusing.

I had heard so many opinions on the \\"magic\\" issue that I wasn't sure what to think. Then I saw the movie and I decided to give the book a try. It took me a while to get into it (more due to my own schedule than the book), but when I did I was completely swept away. Yes, for those of you out there ready to have an exorcism, there is magic in this book. But it is no where even close to what I was hearing about. This is a great book! High quality, and well written. J.K. Rowling has a true gift, and can truly make her characters come alive. When all is said and done I found the most powerful magic in this book and the series to be the magic of loyal friendship and unconditional love. Even Voldemort could not stand up against that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"harrry potter and the sorcerer's stone is an amazing book to read the movies caught my attention so i had to read the book.

This book is a thrilling story about a famous wizard that has no idea what he is. He will then go to new and exciting places that he had yet to discover. Some of these places are stores, and some are castles. Threw his adventures he meets many new friends, and a few enemies. Ms. Rowling dues an amazing job of creating the plot. This very well created plot makes the land that Ms. Rowling creates very easily imagined. In fact her creation is so believable that if I didn't know better I would believe that it exists. Out of all the books I have read I rate this book as 99/100 because of its plot its story line and the feelings and emotion that are expressed in such away that I could relate. To any one that hasn't read any of the Harry Potter books I recommend this strongly to those of u that like books with action, adventure, with a slight twist of romance.

At times Harry Potter is shown as too much of a \\"perfect boy\\" but it is his flaws that really make him someone special.Nowhere near as long as the later books in the series, a great book to dip your toe into the Harry Potter world.

Once you start this book it is very hard to put it down because after the first 20 or so pages you know that this story has what it takes to be a long and involving epic. Author J.K Rowling slowly unravels one mystery after another about our main character Harry Potter. Plus there are all sorts of wonderful and interesting characters that everyone will enjoy.The themes in this book are good for kids and adults. For kids, it will relate to them because it illustrates what it's like to grow up and how hard it can be to fit in. For adults, there are slightly deeper themes, and it will remind you of being young again. But in any case this is a story for the young at heart.Bottom line: Anyone with an imagination will fall into this story.

What I will say is: thisis not just a child's book, but a book for people at any age.You should be impressed by the courage of Harry, Ron's faith to friends and Hermione's cleverness. The main characters are not perfect. Harry does lost once in his desire to see his dead parents. Hermione is an annoying character at the beginning, but becomes such a nice girl eventually. Ron is shy before and becomes brave after he becomes real friends with Harry. The book emphasizes love, friendship and team work which refreshing all city people's mind when we are lost in the society emphasizing personal achievement and competition. Through the adventures, you see how our little heroes/heroines changes into more mature models and that makes the story more vivid and fun to read. Harry, Ron and Hermione seems to be my friends now.

I am a Christian and was unsure of the witchcraft themes. But I got this book from the library, and saw little or nothing wrong with it. In fact, I found it very similar to &quot;Matilda&quot; by Roald Dahl, a favorite book of mine. In fact, I was more upset with the small (verbal, not magic) curse uttered by Mr. Dursley early on in the book than any of the magic. I personally think that even minor curses have no part in children's books. But I like the fact that Harry Potter doesn't curse. Just the bad guys. But, back to magic, I think that the witchcraft in this book is not overly dark or satanic. The second and third books do get &quot;darker&quot; (I still read them, though, and am not against them). That's why this book is my favorite. Harry Potter is merely a friendly, likeable kid who happens to be a wizard, not a dark, menacing sorcerer who happens to be a kid. And the pay-attention-or-you'll-miss-the-clues type reading makes me pay more attention to all the books I read. All in all, I think Harry's great. He makes kids read! That's hardly something you can argue with, now, is it?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 16 and I borrowed this book from my little brother when so many people told me how good it was! I was not dissapointed I loved the humour and the magic the twist etc etc. I don't want to give any story away but I like how a poor unfortunate boy finds out he is not as poor and unfortunate any more...it makes me smile!

I've seen it ensnare several people that don't like to read and/or don't like the genre. My mother reads James Michner, my wife reads Fabio, both LOVED this book (and all the rest).Any book that gets kids reading is a good book, IMHO, and these are getting kids reading. As an adult that has read some of the better fantasy books around, I find Harry Potter to be pretty light in most areas. But, I remind myself, this is supposed to be a childrens book.I've been a supporter of this series since I first heard the goofballs crying that these books encouraged witchcraft (I'm a practicing Druid with a Wiccan background) but I hadn't read them until now.I appreciate witches and wizards getting a good rap for a change, but they celebrate Christmas at the school (Hogwarts? something like that) and I have yet to see any hint of paganism in the books, so the fundamentalists are over-reacting again (surprise)Anyway, I'm pretty sure I'll end up reading them all but I don't think they are going to take the place of David Eddings, Terry Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, etc. This one is worth buying so you can see what all the hubbub is about and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"An amazing book! It keeps you hooked through the last page! Makes you want to read the rest of the books as you follow Harry, Ron and Hermione through their fist year at Hogwarts. A suprise ending keeps you wondering how Rowling got her ideas."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is not a review about the Books.This is about the digital store \\"Pottermore\\".I thought it would be great to put the Harry Potter series onto my daughters new Kindle. Amazon does not sell them on their site but redirects you to a site called Pottermore. It looks like once you purchase the books you can have them available for download on your Amazon Kindle list. You need to create an account with Pottermore which is OK but you've got to get your credit card, input all your info, create a password, etc. Who isn't tired of that process? (I love Amazon's oneclick). After I selected the books to purchase and input all the data, the transaction did not go through. I tried several times but no go. Turns out my bank blocks transactions to certain countries due to fraud issues. I requested that my bank temporarily remove the block to the UK so I could purchase the books. My bank did so but the transaction was denied again. My bank said it must not be coming out of the UK. Nowhere on the site (that I could find) does it list the address of this shop. In the end it worked out well. The libray had tons of Harry Potter books, I paid nothing (as opposed to 57 for the series) and my Daughter is happily reading her first in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A modest, undemanding fantasy suitable for children and others in the 8-12 age range, this should do well. Readers who are unaccountably put off by derivative plot, wooden narrative and tin-eared dialog may prefer the mature oeuvre of Enid Blyton. Other authorities recommend the 'Narnia' cycle of C.S. Lewis and the 'Once and Future King' of T.H. White as some measure of preparation for Tolkien (or, for those who can cope with the wordplay and literary allusions, Terry Pratchett). But none of these authors - not even Pratchett, who is still alive - is so pretty."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After all of the ranting and raving about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, I decided to give the first book a try. To tell you the truth, although I'm in my early twenties, and maybe a little too old to enjoy this type of stuff, I really can't understand what the big deal is about Harry Potter. The story moves fairly fast, and centers on a teenage boy (Harry) whose parents are dead, and who is being raised by his horrible aunt and uncle, along with his bratty cousin. One day, after Harry learns that his parents had been &quot;wizards,&quot; he is invited to attend a special school for wizards-in-the-training. Harry has also learned that he is very special, and has unique powers. When he arrives at the school, it is accidentally revealed to him that there is something special being stored in the school basement, that could affect his life. He finds himself getting into all sorts of trouble, as he decides to uncover what is being stored. Although the story was different than what you'll usually find in books, and not that bad, I still felt that this book was overrated."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read this book and started the second one. I have always loved fairy tales and read the works of J. R. R. Tolkien to my daughter before she was 7 years old. While J.K. Rowling's imagination is wonderful, and the books are very entertaining, I agree with [other's] view in terms of how appropriate they are for young children., When the hero and his friends are encouraged to lie, fight, and express hatred for those who oppose them, there is a significant negative message that young children DO pick up on. Too many of the characters in these stories are mean spirited, from the parents to the kids, to the teachers. Even the &quot;nice&quot; father of Harry's best friend gets into what amounts to a street brawl with the father of Malfoy in the second book. The message in these books simply reinforces violence and intense competition as the way to get ahead in the world. As if we don't get enough of that already. It's too bad that such terrific fantasy and imagination has to include such unrelenting nasty behavior for so many of the main characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can quickly name five to ten other far superior children's fantasy series. Credit should go to the publisher and publicist for selling this book. The language is flat. The characters very predictable. Where's the tension, emotion? I was relieved to see the abridged version of this and the two sequels for sale on CD. Clearly this shows that people really don't enjoy reading these books and are too afraid to speak up. If they listen to the CD's they will know enough about the characters, plot,etc to converse with others so they don't seem so of the loop. Has Ms. Rowling ever developed a paragraph longer than 6 sentences? Perfect for today's short attention span."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I JUST had to read this book. I cannot believe it has caused to much controversy in our small-minded community. This is a wonderfully written book! It has so many good values that everyone can learn from.

I have proff my next door neighboor who is 5 years old enjoyed this book and rated it the best book that her mother had ever read her. And that is pretty good because her mother has read her a lot of interesting and odd books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This story takes place in a place in a place where wizards, witches, ghost, goblins, and giants exist at a school named Hogwarts. This place is important because this is the school Harry Potter will learn his ways in using magic. He will also about his past in this place.This book is mostly about Harry Potter as one of the main characters of the story showing him about his past and how he learns and the games he plays at Hogwarts. Two other characters are Harry's friends which help him get through the year, as well as Harry helping them get through the year.In my opinoin I think Harry Potter must of been real famous because everyone knew of him. The book is interesting because of the way they learn magic and how sometimes messed up. I gave the book 2.5 stars because sometimes it got intresting and sometimes boring. I would recommend this story because it is funny and interesting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"To evrione who like adventure and magic humer and happy ending this book is highly recomended . And to the ones of u that r sceticul check if u still bealives in magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm so weary of \\"Rowling Can Do No Wrong\\" reviews. Whether you liked it or not, you must admit that the names Muggles and Harry Potter were found originally in the works of \\"The Legend Of RAH And The Muggles\\" and other works by Nancy K Stouffer. I haven't read her book yet, but feel it necessary to share this because of the censorship of truth by those in power. I have no axe to grind, just a desire for truth.I've read this book and seen the movie. If you like violence perpetrated to and by children, you'll especially love the film version. When Harry kills his teacher, (or was that the love of Harry's mum that killed him?) the death is reminiscent of the Mummy flick with Brandon Frazier. Also look for the Star Wars Chess set adapted for this story.The story isn't half bad. It's about a kid named Harry (not Larry) Potter who leaves his.. um.. muggle (tm) family (who are very evil and mean and don't practice or believe in witchcraft) and goes to school to study witchcraft and the occult to develop his skills. This school of witchcraft becomes his new nice family though many would like to see him dead there too. Nearly everyone in the story has some kind of magical powers, at least once you leave the train station. After that it becomes kind of a quest story.It's also another story about faithful friendship which is a good message. It also has one good profound moment involving the Mirror of Erised. If you view either the film or the book, I recommend the book because the violence wasn't nearly as graphic in my mind, and the book doesn't seem as long. They don't leave out much detail that I could think of. They even included the part where wots-his-name takes the blood of the unicorn to sustain his life.If you like fantasy, you might choose to read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" by C.S. Lewis, or any of the Chronicles of Narnia. This hasn't been promoted by the public schools or by big companies. At least not in my lifetime. But every page is full of beauty and truth and it's a real work of art. Forgive my descenting view, but I've never been one for following the masses.CC"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Once in a great while a writer will create a work that is truly captivating to most who read. The Harry Potter series is a magnificent blend of action, drama, suspense, and suprise. I loved every minute spent reading the three novels. It is important to note, however, that if you are a very concrete person, have a difficult time separating fantasy from reality, or are devoutly religous then you probably will not like this series. Otherwise, please give them a read to encourage more quality works of fantasy literature to be published for parents and children to share in."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a really good book.

Destined to become a classic, this is one of those marvelous tales that are a delight for children of all ages (including those of us over 21). Harry Potter is an orphan, living with his horrible Aunt and Uncle, and his equally horrible cousin. On his 11th birthday, his life is changed forver by a series of mysterious messages, which gradually reveal his true identity. Harry, it seems, is a wizard, and a very powerful one at that. Of course, in order to learn how to use this power, he has to go to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft And Wizardry. Once there he is quickly embroiled in the search for the Sorcerer's Stone, and in defeating the evil Voldemort. The scary stuff is done with a light touch for the little ones, and with some rather sophisticated humor for the adults (some of the punnish nomenclature left me in tears of laughter). This is the first in a series of three so far, and I recommend them all. This was the first book that my 8 year old wanted to read all by himself, just for fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is one of the main characters who always gets in trouble with his uncle and aunt. Harry had to live in a cupboard below the staircase. Harry has to live with his aunt, uncle, and the spoiled brat Dudley. The only reason he has to live with his aunt and uncle is because his mom and dad died in a car accident. Then Harry goes to this magic school. Harry had to deal with the absents of his mom and dad, he also had to deal with his aunt, uncle, and the spoiled brat Dudley. The reason I like this book is because its adventurous."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a very funny, mysterious, and suspenseful book. The book started off at the Dursley's house. The Dursley's were Harry's aunt and uncle. When Harry was just a baby someone delivered Harry to the Dursley's house. While Harry was there Harry never recieved anything for birthdays or any holidays. The Dursley's hated Harry for some odd reason. One day Harry recieved a letter and found out that he was a wizard. Now, all Harry had to do was get to the train station and find platform nine and three-quarters. Then, he had to get to the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The name of the school was Hogworts. I don't want to tell you any more because I might ruin it for you if you decide to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has never played a sport while riding on a broomstick. He's never worn a cloak that makes you invisible, made friends with a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All he knows is a miserable life with Dursley's, his horrible aunt and uncle and their son Dudley. But everything changes when Harry gets a letter inviting him to a school he never dreamed existed. There he finds friends, aerial sports, magic, and a great destiny for him... if he can survive the encounter. I liked the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The suspense is really wonderful along with the whole magical world that J.K. Rowling created. This book has just the right amount of humor along with mystery and suspense. It's also fun to see how the characters act. This book is very well written. I advise you to read it if you haven't already. I also suggest that if you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and liked it, you should read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow, It took me just a week to read a first book. The second one was finished in three days. I am reading the third one right now, and eagerly looking forward when the story will continue. It has been ages since I have read such a wonderful tales. By the way, the book is not for kids only. Anyone, who likes reading magical novels, will enjoy this one. It is very much like reading Goffman's tales."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling has written so cleanly, so vividly and with such simple imagination that each character has his/her own voice and personality solidly etched in your mind every time you meet them. These impressions only get stronger as you graduate from book to book, year to year at Hogwarts. It is definately Hobbit comparable, which is one of the highest compliments you could get as a story teller. Read this set of books with your children. You and your children will remember the experience all your lives."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was shocked when I read the first pages of this book. I got it for Christmas and I thought about giving it to my brother because I thought it was below my reading level. I skimmed it first to see what it was like and I was blown away. I couldn't put it down! I recommend it for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've kept myself in a vacuum from much of the Harry Potter phenomenon. I don't care much for fantasy. Or YA fiction. A lot of it is not very well-written so I lumped it in with those. I'm quite happy to say that's not the case. This was an excellent book.Before reading \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" I'd never seen any of the movies. I knew the characters (it's hard to miss them) and a few of the more controversial story elements. My son, who's five, has recently watched the first movie; and since I've had the entire set of books for some time now, I finally decided to give it a read.Harry borrows heavily from an established hero archetype -- the kid who's the \\"chosen one\\" and doesn't know it -- the same trope that made Star Wars so wildly successful. Rowling does a great job of targeting the story for tweens, the years when no one really feels like they fit in. When your family doesn't understand you or you're not getting along with your siblings. And it works for boys and girls alike.The characters are extremely well developed and unique with the exception of Harry's aunt/uncle/cousin (which I feel was done on purpose and to great effect, given how it makes the reader root for Harry). The dialogue makes even the minor characters quite memorable. And all this ~before~ he gets to Hogwarts.Early in the book, Rowling sets up the entire series, which is important in any lengthy novel series. I don't often pick up anything longer than a trilogy because authors can get too enamored with the characters and lose their way (especially if the series is very successful). So it's a concern I have with the Harry Potter books, but it doesn't affect my opinion of this one.The plot of the story was a bit slow to start, but I liked how it was built into the book. Great pacing toward the end, I definitely enjoyed it. An all-around great novel for all ages. A fun read. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With the release of the last film in the series, I thought this was probably a good time to begin re-reading the series. I read the first one ten years ago, just before the first film. Upon second reading, I'm struck by the fact that this novel doesn't seem like a children's book, even though it has the cover, the illustrations and all the other window dressing of one. It's no more a children's book than Tolkien's Hobbit or Lord of the Rings and, in fact, it seems Dickensian in its wealth of characters seen through the perspective of a main character that is a child, like Oliver Twist or the early portions of David Copperfield. In fact, if Charles Dickens were magically transported into the late 20th/early 21st century and somehow chose to write fantasy, this is what it would look like. Actually, Harry, Hermione and Ron sound much older than eleven years at this point; they're certainly dealing with more imminent danger than most eleven year olds, and throughout the series the stakes will rise higher and the danger will become more intense. Harry, in particular, experiences all the growing pains of adolescence PLUS the ever present portents of his fate, which was established almost from his birth. Almost all of the characteristics of the archetypal hero's journey are present here and they're all presented in the guise of a book that millions of children world wide have devoured. I wonder if, at some point, some sociological/anthropological study might be made of the impact of this series on the generation that was the exact chronological counterpart to Harry and his friends. In what ways has it influenced their outlooks and the decisions they've made. Since this series has probably been the most widely read 'children's' series that was also embraced by the general reading public I would think the impact would be even greater than previous enormously popular series. This first book remains a powerful beginning to a series that gets more imaginative, denser, darker and profound as it progresses."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have loved HP since the books first came out. I love being able to listen WITH my kids, instead of reading TO them.

Although he had no idea about it until he was 11. Harry James Potter was raised by the Dursleys, his aunt Petunia and her awful husband Vernon, after his parents died. They had a son, Dudley, who was the same age as Harry, but they never got along really well.On Harry's 11th birthday, though, everything has changed. He found out he was a wizard, his parents died to protect him and nobody knew how he could have stopped the dark wizard--and he couldn't know less than them, after all, he couldn't even know how to make any kind of magic. Harry went to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he would be trained for seven years, learning how to use magic and everything about the magical world.On his way to the school, he met Ron Weasley, the sixth of the seven Weasley children, who became quickly his best friend. They also met Hermione Granger, daughter of dentists, a girl they didn't like at first sign, but also became their friends. I wonder if they would do all again if they knew what was waiting for them when they first met on that first trip they made to Hogwarts...Harry Potter is a classic. I can't remember how many times I read this book already--but I remember why I fell in love with this series every single time I read it. It's a fantastic adventure, full of details that make you wish you'd had received an owl from Hogwarts once you turned 11. It's a story about finding who you are--despite what people think you are--, and what you're capable of. It's, overall, a story about love and growing up.Some people have asked me what does't it take for a book to make me give it \\"5 books\\" on our rating--something I've never done before on my reviews here. Well, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a 5 books for me, because I finished rereading for the unkown time and I'd do it all over again: it's a book I won't get tired of, no matter how many times I reread."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am reading this to my 6 & 8 year old kids.

I wouldn't recommend letting them read it alone, but it is a great read w/ a parent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think the Sorcerer's stone was a well written book, with lots of interesting fantasy scenarios, like Hogwarts, the forbidden forest, and the train that transported young wizards and witches to Hogwarts. Today, many books are boring and have no creativity, and fantasy. J.K.Rowling is one of the creative authors, and had a very imaginative mind. The amazing part was that she was able to write the first 10 chapters by hand, on napkins from a coffee shop. In the scenario she was in, struggling to pay her bills, she almost has an emotional relationship with Harry, because both of them were in bad situations at first, but were able to improve their lives, Harry going to Hogwarts, and J.K. Rowling completing one of the best books of today, and certainly the best book I have ever read. The book had many settings, like Privet drive, the house on the ocean, the forbidden forest, 9 1/2, and Diagon alley, which gave the book a lot of detail. Personally, my favorite event was when Harry killed Proffessor Quirril, because of Harry's scar, which was from Voldemort, who was sharing Quirril's body right then. This was because Voldemort gave him the scar on his forehead, from a spell which bounced off of Harry back to Voldemort leaving only the scar. Voldemort had a part of Harry inside of him, and Harry had a part of Voldemort inside of him, which almost gave them a symbolic connection. It makes more sense, if you read the book. The problem was that Voldemort was out to get the Sorcerer's Stone, which would give him the power to live forever. If he had it he could cause complete caos to the entire earth. Even when we wasn't trying to get it, he killed thousands and thousands of people, and had a complete army of followers. Think what would happen if he became invinsible. Luckily Harry killed Quirril, and destroyed the stone, so no one could ever use it's power. Overall, the book was written very very well, and had an amazing story to it. I would recommmend this to any person who can read a book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was a freshman in high school when this book came out. I was also one of the unfortunate teenagers that wasn't allowed to read this book because it was banned for 'witchcraft' and my parents were trying to do the right thing. I am 29 years old now, and I finally read it. I have read a lot of teen/young adult, vampire, teen angst, bad teen poetry since then, and this book was like a breath of fresh air. It was super suspensful and highly engaging. I could hear the dialogue in my head, it was like I was watching a movie as I was reading the book. I completely understand why it was as popular as it was, but one thing I don't understand is why it was so controversial. I was forced to read books in school that had flat out violence and sexual situations, but when a book that was based on magic and wizardry I wasn't allowed to read it. What about all the children's books with magic in them? Where the Wild Things Are, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, those are all imaginary situations... Kind of like Harry Potter. It is rediculous, and I am a little peeved that I was denied this book when I was younger. Censorship is stupid and I promise never to ever not allow my children to read something. I gave the book 4 stars only because like I said before I have read a lot of teen/young adult books and I am a bit jaded. Maybe if I had read it when I was 15 or 16 I would have given it a better score."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While this isn't the correct edition of the book I own (I couldn't find the right one here), I wanted to write a review anyway.

He's never been an eager reader, though he'll read with us when we ask. Once we told him about the book, he's been begging to read.

Thus it was with Star Wars, it is the same with Harry Potter.I read the book with great relish, having been a fan of Enid Blyton in my younger days, I recognised many of the characters appearing in the story having parallels to other such school days stories written nearly a century before. There would be bullies, there would be those who lack confidence, there would be the smug, the wastrel, the showoff etc., and almost as many varieties of the faculty. The magic was merely a tool, a decor, a setting, and another of making the readers to cease taking things for granted.Rowling had probably borrowed ideas not only from Blyton's stories, but also from R Dahl, notice the various goody treats the students can get and compare them with Charlie and the chocolate factory.Being able to cast spells is no big deal if every other person can learn to do so too. Pranksters in the real world learnt to do the same using knowledge gained from chemistry classes, physics class and just a lot of imagination. In fact, in Enid Blyton's school stories, the students had access to devices not available to their teachers, which is not the same in Hogswart.There are dark elements in the story, instances of bloodiness etc, but these serve to warn that magic, even in fiction, is not without terrible consequences.Ultimately, the book is just pure fun to read. It is certainly not meant to be a Christian message, but it does not deserve more blame for leading children astray any more than superhero comics or star wars movies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a young boy who discovers he is a wizard and the responsibilities and adventures that come along with it.

His parents died when he was very young and he has only recently found out his history. Harry's life starts to change when he is invited to a wonderful place that he could only dream of, Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry, being the only wizard to survive the evil powers of Voldemort, is marked with a lightning scar on his forehead. He is known by all wizards and possesses extraordinary gifts. At Hogwarts he discovers not only his amazing magical powers, but also the power of friendship. He is encountered with a challenge that has been waiting for him in this strange and exciting place.The vivid way J.K. Rowling tells the story and how she makes the characters come to life made me feel like I knew them personally. Rowling expresses a continuous theme of good overcoming evil with many other literary elements intertwined throughout the novel. She includes imagery, personification, and similes to make her writing more exciting and imaginative. Rowling's clever writing style was very appealing and brought humor to the story.I disagree with the belief of some \\"religious\\" people who condone this novel because of its use of magic. There is no talk of Satan or use of magic for evil doings. I find nothing wrong in letting children read harmless fantasies. If anything it will improve their imagination.This was one of the most exciting, clever, and imaginative books I've ever read and I enjoyed every second of it. I would recommend this book to anyone.

Reluctantly they take him in. The Dursley's, who are in fact his close relatives, seem to be very bothered by Harry's presence in their house. They force him to do all of the household chores, and he sleeps under the staircase in a small closet. But after ten long years of misery, Harry begins to receive lots of mysterious letters. Uncle Vernon tries his hardest to keep the letters from Harry, but soon enough he is able to read one of them. He learns that he has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Whether or not he knew it at the time, Harry was about to embark on the most thrilling journey of his life as he began his quest to becoming a wizard. At school, Harry Potter quickly becomes acquainted with the teachers and students. He develops close friendships with fellow students Ron and Hermione who later on accompany him in some of his daring adventures. As the book progresses on Harry and his friends begin to notice strange happenings around the campus. In their curiosity they search for answers to the odd occurrences, and before long the three are stuck right in the middle of a Hogwarts crisis. Harry and his pals show extreme courage and bravery as they battle the evil that dwells near Hogwarts and even risk their lives for the good of their school's future. At this point in the novel, it is just getting interesting and I would hate to spoil the ending; therefore, I strongly encourage everyone to take some time and read J.K. Rowling's &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;.I thought that the book was interesting, suspenseful and very entertaining. Personally, I enjoy fantasies about mysterious worlds, strange creatures and especially magic. I liked how the book revolved around three kids' lives in an odd and creepy school. I also liked how the author focused on Harry's determination to meet his own personal goals. Lastly, I thought it was cool how the author allowed the kids' to fight the evil and save everyone. Often in fantasy stories, children are unheard of, and I just thought it was interesting how J.K. Rowling placed so much emphasis on the children's abilities.I loved reading about the magical world of Harry Potter, and I could hardly put the book down. I think that it is a book for people of all ages and that everyone should take some time to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really really liked the book. With that said, I think this book is the best book in the serious as originality of the first book is lost in the subsequent ones. Well, I haven't read the fourth one yet."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What kind of life is being stuck in a cupboard all day and be treated like a piece of dirt? Harry doesn't like it and he wishes he would move for internity. So one day Harry gets a letter telling him he has been accepted to Hogwarts,School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The rest is &quot;secret&quot; with Fluffy (the three headed dog) and spells with potions and other magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In this brilliant work of fiction by J.K. Rowling, we are taken into a world of magic and adventure full of excitement and curiosity, all seen through the eyes of a young boy named Harry Potter. Harry has recently discovered that he is one of the most famous figures in the magic world. He himself is a wizard whose parents were mysteriously killed by an evil sorcerer known as Voldemort. As the reader follows Harry from making friends to getting into mischief, we are introduced to new characters and new conflicts as Harry tries to uncover the truth about his past. The book is filled with a perfect mixture of excitement, laughter, sadness, and all around mystery. Fit for young and old alike, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is certainly a book you will not want to put down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The amazing popularity of Harry Potter has spread across the country in just months. Now almost everyone, young and old, know about Diagon Alley, the Leaky Cauldron, and Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and wizardry. By just reading the book, Harry Potter and The Sorcere's Stone , Harry's world comes alive with J.K. Rowling's brilliantly imagined and beautifully written fiction work. Orphaned in infancy, Harry Potter is raised by his odious relatives, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. Harry's life goes from bad to awful until, with the approach of his eleventh birthday, mysterious letters begin arriving addressed to him. His aunt and uncle manage to keep these away from Harry until a giant named Hagrid delivers one in person, and much to his surprise, Harry learns that he is a wizard and has been accepted as a student at Hogwort's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. To add to the startling news; it turns out that Harry's parents were killed by an evil wizard, Voldermort. Somehow, though, Harry survived Voldermort's attempt to kill him, leaving him with a lighting-shaped scar on his forehead. This made Harry an enormous celebrity in the world of magic, because Voldermort disappeared after his attempt to kill Harry. Rowling's incredible imagination, creations like the game of Quidditch, a sort of mid-air soccer game, makes for a very enjoyable read. With the help of his new friends Hermione and Ron, Harry solves a mystery involving a sorcerer's stone that ultimately takes him to Voldemort. This engaging fantasy is filled with imaginative details, from dragons' eggs hatched on the hearth to oddly flavored jelly beans. This book refreshed me and reminded me that I am still young. It took me away from the stressful world that I live in. J. K. Rowling had me immersed from the first page. There was an endless excitement that kept me from putting the book down."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is a great fiction book that should be recommended to children of all ages. Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a hard life with the Dursley's, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their son Dudley, where he is forced to live in a tiny room at the foot of the stairs. A mysterious letter arrives by an owl messenger, inviting him to an incredible place that he has never heard of before. It is there that he finds not only many friends, his talent in the game of Quidditch, and magic in everything, but a great destiny that has been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter. J.K. Rowling uses a very historical and fantisizing style of writing in this work of fiction, and he really provides the reader with much suspense and tension of what is going to come next. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a very interesting and entertaining book. It provided the reader with much comedy and it allowed for them to really expand their imagination while trying to fantasize about the many occurences. It also kept the reader on their toes about what event was going to happen next. This book has really altered the way I look at a fiction and fantasy book. It really showed the importance of fiction and fantasy that is present in a book by presenting it in a very interesting matter. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was really a very entertaining and fascinating book that will be of great memory to me forever. It really allowed for me to expand my imagination to great heights and to see fiction and fantasy in a totaly different way."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter: And The Sorcerers StoneHarry Potter wasn't a normal boy. He grew up with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and his cousin Dudley. Harry didn't get the respect, or even love, just because he wasn't a \\"normal\\" child. The Dudley's were mean, greedy people that didn't care for anything but themselves. Harry mother was normal with no magical powers but she married a guy with them.The story starts out with Harry being born. After he was born, a \\"warlock\\", who is referred to as \\"you-know-who\\" tried to kill Harry but mysteriously couldn't even though he was a master the dark arts. In that process, he got a scar on his forehead shaped as a bolt of lightening. From then on, he was the most popular baby in the magical world. He was taken to his aunt and uncles house to live with them. His aunt didn't want any \\"abnormal\\" people around them but it didn't work. When he turned 11, he got tons of letters from a school and his uncle refused to give them to Harry.It is a book of mystery, fantasy, and bone thrilling events.

However I absolutely love the movies and had to read the books.This review is going to be a lot different due to the movies already out and finished and same with this book series.I was amazed by how much they combined in the movies. The scenes that are over ten pages in the book were fitted into just ten minutes onto a movie screen. Yes, I know this is two make sure the film does not go to over 5 hours in length and so on. What I love about the book was the detail. Especially the beginning of the book where we are introduced to Harry's uncle prior to actually knowing anything about Harry. Then just the little detail the were changed in the movie. The book answer so many little questions that I never realized were actually missing during the film.I am so glad that I read the book because it has so much more information and trouble they get into in the books. I highly recommend reading this book. I will let you know in my next review how the series progess in the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I LOVE THE HARRY POTTER SERIES, THAT INCLUDES THIS ONE: NOW FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE HARRY POTTER I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO SAY: 1.

This book is EXCELLENT. I don't know how JK did it (author). Many people in our society say it is a \\"devil influencing book, should not be read by children.\\" This is very false. First of all, it does not even MENTION the devil. Other people say the wizardry is a bad influence on young children. Come on people! Children have got to know what's real and what's not! If they don't, it doesn't hurt them. I mean, your listening from a person who thought Sesame Street was going to take over the world. Imagination is good for children! This book is awesome. It gets in depth. You couldn't find a better one except the rest of the series! (The 4th book really takes the house down). Get this book, you won't regret it!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In terms of H. Potter, I'm in love. I began it last night, and spent my entire day today reading the first book. I have only a chapter or so left, and plan on replying to all my e-mail as quickly as possible so as to be able to return to H. Potter and find out about the Sorcerer's Stone. (Interesting note for the American edition ): The Sorcerer's Stone is not historically accurate. The alchemist stone/myth was known as the Philosopher's Stone, and did not necessarilly produce the elixir of life. That was another alchemist invention/dream. J.K.Rowling, being totally correct, must have thought that &quot;Philosopher&quot; does not convey both the sense of mystery and of witchcraft adequate for such an establishment as Hogwart. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was a better choice, despite the slight artistic freedom she took with it.) My strong affection for the book stems from two primary sources: 1) I was looking for exactly such a book. I was ready for some reading which requires no analysis, yet liberates and stimulates my imaginative senses. This leas to source 2) I feel like a kid again when I read it. I have willfully suspended all belief in reality for an alternative reality, which is so fantastic in every sense, to the point at which shivers race through my body as I read. There is nothing more pleasurable than a book which makes you laugh, makes you angry and stimulates your imagination all at once. The other part of the book I enjoy because, on one level, I fell as though I can relate. Strip the book of all it's potions and fantastical make-believe and what you have is the story of the underdog not only overcoming all, but by having the fantasies he dare not dream be fulfilled. What kid, as they are feeling the brunt of some bully, or of some stress, doesn't dream he could perform magic? What kid doesn't at some point look at something and try to make it move? What kid has not felt the emotional brunt of the world and wished to be liberated? Wished to be a kid? Harry embodies all of this. Through him, not only I, but everyone who has read it and liked it, has found a little piece of what the dreamed fulfilled within it's pages. To put it simply, Harry Potter is so wonderful becuase a little bit of him exists within us all. We all dream, we all imagine. For him, it's merely his reality."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is great for all ages. Many kids read it in their elementary school years. I read it in high school. The story is very captivating and the good vs. evil keeps you in tuned with the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first got this book I tought it would be just another fully comercial and fancy fashioned work, without any literary value. But as soon I started reading it prooved to be a masterpiece of imagination. Rowling gets to describe characters, artifacts, situations and creatures that go beyond our wildest dreams, with the geniality that at the end of the book we get to know this objects and people in a way we think they are real. Last time I was watching ESPN I hoped someday they would televise the Quidditch World Cup!, as weird as that sounds!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard of the book from a friend who was reading it at the time. My friend encouraged me to read the book as well. I was amused by the fact that my friend never lifted an eyelid off the book while reading. It motivated me to buy the book, so I bought it that week.Harry Potter is a very real and lovable character. I never really seamed to embrace the fact that most of the people today have read the book, I think of Harry and his world as a friend and place that belonged only to me. I am transported into his form and feel what I think he would feel. I felt hate towards his life's long enemy, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - which he did not know he had until his eleventh birthday. Harry felt so alone when he left for Hogworts, that I wished I were there to comfort him. I felt pure joy in the time he spent with his friends (Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Hagrid,) and pursue strange and thrilling adventures. I think this book is for anyone who likes fiction books.However, I have another side to my thoughts on the book. Although, (I am American and this might not even have to do with the fact that I am American,) it disappoints me that \`Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' has been changed to \`Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' to accommodate Americans. I feel that it is an insult to many people and to the author. Nevertheless, whereas the fact that many things have been changed in \`Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' for the convenience of Americans, it remains one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 31 year old pediatric nurse.

It's a wonderful book to read because it has a lot of good vocabulary for kids from 9-17. I had fun reading it especially when my teacher made the good voices. Like Voldemort with the deep voice. I liked when Voldemort needed the unicorn blood for his strength. I thought it was a suspenseful when Harry was looking for the sorcerer's stone and they had to get the key to the door, the problem was the keys were flying up by the top of the cave.

K. Rowling is one the best books to read by any age. This book has elements that will keep the interest of a reader. After you have read the book once you would want to read it again. The book tells a story of a boy who finds out he is a wizard. Ten years old Harry Potter lives with his mean uncle Vernon, his wife Petuna, and their young bratty son Dudley. Harry's parents were believed to have been killed in a car crash, but in fact they were killed by a powerful dark wizard named Voldemort. On Harry's eleventh birthday a giant tells Harry that he is a wizard. He is then sent to a world where fairy tales come true in order to learn the ways and magic of a wizard. The story goes to describe Harry's adventure in this land and the past that is sealed by his Uncle and Aunt. The plot keeps the readers drawn to the story. The world of magic and fantasy would persuade a child to read this book. Harry Potter is an extraordinary story that is interesting to readers, young or old alike. The story plot of a child who is a wizard would attract a child to this book. Most Stories that has been told by a child consist of fairy tale elements. Some examples of fairy tale elements, such as: giants, trolls, magic, and mystical worlds are all included in Harry Potter. The first three chapters lack the fairy tale elements of a fairy tale book but as the reader continues to read the book more and more fairy tale elements are introduced.Another element that makes this book an excellent book to read is the magic written about in Harry Potter. A new type of fantasy world is introduced in this book. In a child's mind his or her world consists of imagination. Harry Potter extends a child's imagination. A child dislikes reading books which tend to get boring. In order for a child to read, a book should include elements of imagination. Harry Potter is introduces into his new world, trolls, giants, unicorns, castles, forbidden forests, ghost, and wizards. As the child reads this book he would imagine himself as Harry Potter. In the book, J. K. Rowling describes Harry as an excellent student who finishes his homework. As a child learns some of Harry Potter's characteristics he or she would perform his homework and imitate some of his other characteristics so he or she can be more like Harry Potter. This book can be considered to be a good means to persuade a child that reading is fun. Although as the book is good there are some small drawbacks to it. It is intended for young readers and for some older readers it may not be appealing. The entire vocabulary used in this book in simple and suitable only for third or fourth grades. In order for this book to lure a child to read, J. K. Rowling should have included some harder vocabulary words so the child would learn some vocabulary words that are presented in the seventh grades. In spite of the drawbacks of this book Harry Potter is a capital book to read for young and older readers. A person who write a book that encourages a child to read, she or he may be considered the best author in the world. Harry Potter has the best qualities of a children's book. A book that includes a good plot and fantasylands where kids can imagine them in are interesting books to read, Harry Potter is an outstanding book to read even if it is intended for young kids."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I used to really dislike my commute. It is no longer the case. Like the majority, I bought and enjoyed the Harry Potter books. Yes, I really liked the world depicted by J.K. Rowlings, a mix of British tradition, wackiness and humor . However, Jim Dale's oustanding performance truly brings J.K. Rowling's work to life. All the characters, from Harry, to Hermione, to Hagrid, to professor Dumbledore and Malefoy all rode to work with me.

While the books are written with a pre-teen audience in mind, the story will sweep most adults away as well. Rowling takes the reader to a magnificent fantasy world and describes each detail thoroughly. Morality should not be an issue in which this book is judged. It does not encourage children to believe they are wizards and in no way slanders the morality of real-life. If anything, it shows that there are some immoral things that do go on in the world, and that you can overcome them, such as in the story line of Harry and his &quot;muggle&quot; family."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was aware of some of the controversy surrounding this series and so decided to read it to my children myself, rather then letting my 8 and 10 year old read it alone. I am very glad I did. The story is captivatng from the start, and we all enjoyed it thouroughly.We took plenty of pauses and breaks to let the storyline sink in, stopping to discuss what was happening and why, and what we thought might happen next. My kids loved the challenge, and I liked watching them mentally engaged,their minds working. No one was bored. The storyline is fairly complex, with many characters and subplots.I strongly suggest this book be read as a family.

J.K. Rowling has amazing inventive authority in gripping a reader's attention with such commanding lyrical voices in her story, a reader's age becomes irrelevant. I was hooked to the book from the very first sentence, couldn't take my eyes off the book till the fascinating end. I heartily recommend Harry Potter to everyone.

I for one, was not interested in reading the series. But after many pleas from my fellow readers, I picked it up. I could not put it down. I along with the rest of the people in the world who have read it, am bewitched. It is a wonderous book, filled with excitement! I would definately not cast this is a &quot;Kids Only&quot; book. Rowling's writing allows the story to progress at a natural pace, with a very moving climax. After you read it, you want more. Some people have said that this book is not good, and there is too many hate themes...I say that it is about being a kid and having adventures. It is about friendship, pain, excitement, horror...some things every kid and adult knows about.Each character has his or her own flaws and is not perfect, even Harry. But they are all likeable, especially when working together. It shows the power of the friendship between them. I have also heard that there is not a likeable person in the book, that you can't relate or what not. How untrue! I feel just like Harry, and can relate to Ron.

After all, fighting a three headed dog, a troll, and the most feared wizard of all is hard work!My favorite part is when a boy named Nevile beats up Draco Malfoy, the school bully.I think the author's purpose was to tell us that unexpected things happen in life.

Her vocabulary might not be sophisticated and her descriptions tend to be overlong...but it works as a children's book,and most specifically,as fantasy.In the beginning,Harry Potter is like any other 11 yr old boy. He grows up in middle-class England,thinking he's nothing special. However,he is able to leap onto roofs to escape bullies and speak to snakes at the zoo. Still,he doesn't see anything distinctive. Then he receives letters from owls inviting him to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A giant named Rubeus Hagrid comes to his house on Privet Drive to inform him of his chosen status.Harry's adventures on Diagon Alley,to Platform 9 3/4,on the Hogwarts Express,and his first Quidditch games are exhilarating and fun. Rowling adds whimsy with Bertie's Every Flavored Beans and Chocolate Frogs. His friends, Ron and Hermione,have distinctive personalities and bring the reader in. There's the wise Dumbledore,the snippy Snape,and no-nonsense McGonagall. Rowling keeps the action going,and the plot simple. It reads as a good detective story-a Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys story with fantastical elements as Harry,Ron&Hermione; search for the Sorcerer's Stone. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" works as a fun fantasy story,innocent and unburdened with politics.It worked in the beginning..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Of course the first book of Harry Potter is already considered a classic by many, but the telling of it by Jim Dale is just as good!

I finished the book in one sitting. Rowling is an excellent writer. I've not read a book that was as imaginative in years.

For a book of such high quality, I'm glad it has a wide audience."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this first installment of the Harry Potter series. While written for children, I was enchanted by the book. I really enjoyed the Wheel of Time series, the Belgariad and Mallorean and Lord of the Rings, and while Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone wasn't the same reading level, the story and lessons were very similar to all of those epic series.

Every one would enjoy this book and it would change their opinion about books from the very first sentance. You can feel what the characters are feeling every page you turn . It is a book that you can't resist to read. A book that you can not put down but you want to because you don't want it to end.

An extremally cool wizard!! going from soccer, to quidicth!! (a sport played on broomsticks)Its true about what they say......HARRY POTTER IS A WIZZARD!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had some apprehensions about reading this series, despite all the hoopla surrounding it. I had never even heard of Harry Potter until Book 4 was coming out in the summer of 2000 and practically every magazine in American was doing a feature article on it. Unlike many others, I hesitated in just splurging and buying all four books. I was afraid that with all the hype encasing the series, I would be let down. I was worried that I would be one of just a few people who wouldn't like them and that I would be out of a lot of money.Boy was I wrong. I love this series. I have read each book twice since buying them during the summer of 2000.The first book in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; gets the bandwagon rolling. We learn that Lord Voldemort is a wizard gone bad, responsible for the mass killings of innocent Muggles (non-wizard people) and wizards, including the deaths of the parents of the main character, Harry Potter. He is so frightening, that people only refer to him as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.We also learn that Lord Voldemort attempted to remove Harry when he did away with Harry's parents, but it didn't work. Harry was able to fend off his attacker because, as we discover later in the book, his mother died in the attempt to save him. She unwittingly provided him with the protection of her love, she left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. Lord Voldemort is so evil that touching someone who is loved so much very nearly destroyed him. It left him completely powerless, but he still managed to escape.The Lord of Darkness doesn't let this deter him, though. By the end of the first book, he has gained just enough energy to possess one of the teachers, Professor Quirrell, at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His attempts to get his hands on the Sorcerer's Stone are thwarted by Harry, however, and Lord Voldemort is left even less alive than he was before.These books are very engaging, and readers of all ages will enjoy them. I am glad that I decided to throw caution to the wind and buy them all at once. And what I told you above is only scratching the surface of what all goes on in the first book. I didn't tell you about Ron, Hermione, all the different teachers, Quidditch, Harry's adoptive parents, and so much more.This is a series that has turned kids away from shoot'em up video games and converted them into reading fanatics. No matter what some people may think of these books, they will always have a permanent resting place on my bookshelf. Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for creating such an inspiring and heart-warming series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was as little uncertain whether or not this book would appeal to me.

While attending the school he has great adventures, and doesn't ever relize the great destiny that awaits him. I do not usually read fantasy books but, I was pushed to read this. I loved the book it was interesting, and made me go to a different place every time i picked up the book. It distription of the magicial word amazed me. &quot;You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.&quot;&quot;I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for my self, thanks,&quot; he said coolly. This quote tells you what kind of person he is. He doesn't care what others think about him and sometimes that is hard for people to do. The author has bulit his character Harry as a person with strong belifes and values. He also protred him as a chararter with anourmos amount of courage! Harry Potter is a very well rounded character and he has a good heart.

My quote is from page 97, &quot;Oh, Mom, can i go on the train and see him, Mom, oh please.&quot; this shows that Harry Potter is a well known person to all the wizards and that even though he was miss treated by his aunt and uncle that there is still a lot of people that really would like to meet and would give him the respect he wanted and needed.A good part about this book is that once you start reading it you cant stop becuase you keep getting things thrown at you that you want to find out and when you find them out something else comes that is a shocker so you have to keep reading to find out what happens.A bad part about it is that sometimes the will drag a part in the book a little to long."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine yourself in a school in a far away land where ghosts and goblins are a common sight.

The story I felt did a real good job of getting you to sympathize with Harry so that when all the \\"good\\" things start happening to him you simply want to cheer outloud.

Almost all the setting take place at a school. Harry parents died. Harry live with his uncle and ant Dursley. Harry got a room but not exactly a room it is a closet. Harry goes to this school. Harry never played a sport called flying broomstick. My favorite part of this book is when this teacher is entering the class of Harry and everybody was talking out loud than they see a black cat entering the class. Everybody was quit until the cat jump on top of a table and while the cat was jumping on top of a desk the cat all the sudden turned to be Harry's teacher. When all the student saw what just happen with their own eyes what they saw a while ago they were surprised what they just saw. A lot of cool stuff happens in this book because is a lot of magical stuff in it.

The housemaid is for witches and wizards. This troll had a letter for young Harry Potter. If you want to find out more about this book you should buy it.I love this book because it was breathtaking and you would almost always have to turn the page just one more time to see what happens to Harry and his friends. The book started out slow in the first two or three chapters like any book but then it was thrilling. My favorite character was Hagrid he is a big scary looking man with rough looking hair. The first time he is described to you he sounds so mean but you need to read on because Hagrid turns out to be a very nice man.

Its how the story is layed out. There just one mystery after another.

Harry has always had strange things happen to him, but has never known why. One day Harry finds out a secret about his parents, that explains every strange thing that has ever happened to him. His parents were wizards, and Harry is taken to a magical place full of new things. He meets new friends, plays new sports, and even finds out more about his parents.During the book, Harry learns a lot about his parents, who have been dead as long as he can remember. He gets the chance to see them one night when he sneaks out of bed and gets lost. He finds a room with a mirror in it, but this isn't an everyday mirror. In it he sees his parents and when he realizes this he decides to bring his friend Ron to see the mirror with him the next night. Ron stood in front of the mirror and didn't see his parents. Harry goes back to the mirror alone and the headmaster of his school is there, he explains to Harry that whoever looks in the mirror will see the thing they want the most, and for Harry it was to see his parents.This book let's us see many things kids deal with everyday such as, trouble with teachers and students, making friends, and family. Harry Potter added something to all of these things because J.K Rowling made the book about magic and facing your fears instead of just school, friends, and family.

This is a must read!!! I'm a book lover everyone must read"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I resisted reading this book, having seen all the movies (which I loved.) It's easy to see why it became such a hit with young readers - easy to read, but not childish. Great imagery. Obviously the beginning of an epic story. I'll plunge in and read the rest!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heart Harry Potter!!! These books will ALWAYS be classics!!!!

You truly hey lost in the magic of the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've waited long enough to get on the Harry Potter series with everyone else, but I am glad I finally did. Great read and looking extremely forward to the next!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book because my younger brother wanted to read it. of course, it was appropriate that i read it first to make sure that it was alright for him to read. i finished all three of them in days! i absoultly loved the sorcers stone especially because it places you in a magical world that all people feel is there, somewhere. the controversy about this book is totally wrong, it doesn't bring ideas of cults and whatnot into a child mind, it stimulates the imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A funny and magical book, Harry Potter is so good I can't stop reading this great book. It is filled with lot's of good detail. Harry Potter is a boy who was stuck in a closet for ten years, but one day he found out he was a wizard. P.S. Tons of great characters are in this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling does a great job in this book by beginning the story perfectly and ending perfectly. Also she left Harry wide open for more adventure at the end of the story. This book is one the most exciting books I've ever read. In that J.K. Rowling keeps the reader on their toes because when you're sure something will happen it will be the exact opposite. I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and suspense."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ok, so I'm not your typical Harry Potter reader. I am a 21 year old college student instead of an 11 year old 5th grader but I LOVED this book. It was all that everybody said it would be and so much more. I couldn't put it down because I was so caught up in Harry's adventures. Usually the end of a book is dissappointing but this was quite satisfying. I have started on the second book of the series and can't wait to read the rest. Buy This Book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I started reading this book when I came home from school one day. I read to page 74 by the time the night was over. I really liked it and if you were to ask me what I would rate it after the first two days it would have got 4 stars. But as the book went on it became better and better. I espeicaly liked the last two chapters. 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The magic of this book is truly incredible. Sure, you're thinking it's not real its a fantasy . . . but that's where you're wrong! In my grade 8 class, we are reading this book Harry Potter. No one wanted to start reading it, because they never had read 'leisurely' before. They were supposedly too 'cool' to read this book. But after they got started, the 'cool' boys were actually caught with their noses dug in the book, during their free time, during class, at home, and any other time they had to steal a quick peak of this magical book. It has literally changed the attitudes in our class, and now the only problem is, how are we going to get them to stop reading through out math class ... and history ... and science . . . and every other subject. So when you think this book is only fiction, you are so wrong, it is real and I'm living it! I have living proof in my grade 8 class, and I'm sure if you ask those 'cool' boys they'll agree how magical this book really is!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Our teacher just finished reading this book to us in school......AND IT ROCKS! In basic, it's about a boy who lived with an uncle, an aunt, and a spoiled-rotten cousin who all detest him...(deep breath) for the first eleven years of his life. Then he starts getting mystery letters, is visited by a huge giant named Hagrid, and before ya know it, he's enrolled in a school of wizardy and witchcraft called Hogwarts. I thought this book was AWESOME, and I CANT WAIT to read the next two books. If you like fantasy, magic, and have read the Chronicles of Narnia, this book will give a jumpstart to your day. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"j.k rowling is an absolutly amazing writer. thismagical, mystical book facinates the 5-year-oldkid being read a story before bedtime to the 95-year-old man just wanting a good read. lushdetail, constant displays of bravery in toil, andunimaginable mystery fill this book and it'ssequels...read them NOW!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will be the first to admit that I'm 30 yrs old and I love Harry Potter. It doesn't matter how old or young you are-if you can open your mind just a bit and want to believe in a little magic, you'll love this series and Harry Potter in particular. We have all at one time or another been the underdog, the person faced with insurmountable odds-this is the story of one such person and how he deals with everything life seems to throw at him. JK Rowling has created a magical world that is extremely creative, fun, mysterious and leaves you wanting more. I look forward to reading the rest of this truly imaginative series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was skeptical at first to read this. My mother raved but I doubted. I got halfway through the book, and couldn't put it down! The images of Hogwarts, the people, Quiddich (sp?) and all aspects to Harry's life were SO vivid. When I finished, I wanted to cry, because I didn't want to leave Hogwarts! I'm 18, and an advocite of a peaceful world, and giving good messages to children. I've spent a lot of time researching violence in kids, ect and let me say right now this book does nothing to spread evil and violence. Read the right way, The Sorcerer's Stone is filled with great messages of friendship, doing what's right, and not letting the Uncle Vernon's and Aunt Petunia's of the world get you down. Spread the gospel of Harry Potter through-out the world!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have recently read a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I think it's one of the greatest books of all time. It's about a boy named Harry Potter who is an orphan and lives with his mean uncle and aunt with their spoiled brat son named Dudley. He grows up miserably with them because they treat him like an animal. Then one day, Harry finds out that he is a wizard and begins to attend Hogwarts wizarding school. That's where the adventure begins. I like this book because of the magic, excitement and adventure. I recommend this book for 10 years old and up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an extremely well-written book, with a detailed plot, excellent descriptions, and likable characters. Although my eight-year-old brother was reading it, I figured that I'd give it a try (I'm 19) and read the first chapter. Afterward, I was hooked.I would also like to inform any other &quot;Ann M. Oslund&quot;-like people out there that this is fantasy. Magic doesn't really exist guys, so I think it's perfect to have kids reading this without worrying about them trying to emulate the characters (like one might worry about kids emulating the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers antics)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was an excellent book in my opinion because it was exciting and very interesting. There was excitement and adventure around evry bend and you never knew what was going to happen next. So if you like to read i am sure you will like this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was great! I would recommend this book to everyone I know. My favorite part of this book was when Harry Potter, Hermione and Ron went in to the corridor with the three headed dog. It was funny because they were scared stiff. All they wanted to do was get out of there. I also enjoyed the part when the Dursleys dropped him off at the train station so he could go on the train that was on track nine and three quarters. This would be a great present for all ages. Many people would have a hard time reading it but if you like fantasy-adventure you would love this book. Thank You Ms. Miolla and Ms. Levine for picking out such a good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I like this book because it is fun and exciting. You can read this book no matter how old you are. It relates to magic, and that's another reason why I like it. You will want to read it over and over again because the story just gets you going."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is long, but extremely good. Harry Potter has a three book long series, so far. Each book has around three hundred pages. I loved this book because I just love stuff like magic, mysteries, secrets, and sports."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All the Harry Potter books are good books for children to read. The most appropriate age I believe to be is 4th grade. They will not glamorize or idealize the liftstyle portrayed in the book. A younger child might have a hard time seperating real life from fiction. The books are easy to read and will hold your interest throughout. You should read the series. If you do not start with the first one you will not be lost as the author explains everything."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I give Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone five stars, because J.K. Rowling does an excellent job of drawing the reader into the story. In the book Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, the main character is Harry Potter. Harry's parents were killed by an evil sorcerer named Voldemont. Then Voldemont tried to kill Harry, but couldn't kill him. If you want to find out what happens to Harry, you'll have to read the book. I recommend this book to anyone who can read because it's very funny."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry finds out he is a witch and is sent off to Hogwarts. He is famous there, because his parents were murdered and he was the only one to survive Lord Voldemort. Now he and his freinds, Hermione and Ron, must get to the Sorcerer's Stone before Lord Voldemort does. It's great, you just have to read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It starts out without Harry in the book and suddenly he comes in and the action rises. A giant comes in his house and tells him he is a wizard and is taken to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and the rest of the story is a giant climax."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 22 years old, and this book is so well written that I do not feel at all weird about reading it. I have a day care and all my children, ranging from 8-13, constantly ask me to read this to them. I have read these two books about five times a piece. That doesn't even count the amount of times I have read them myself. This series of books is bound to stay on the best of all times lists with others like Charlotte's web and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I am so glad I have purchased these books, they will stay with me until they have fallen completely apart. I can't wait to purchase number three!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book so much and I would reccomend it to anyone! While reading, I couldn't put it down, it was so exciting. It was the only thing I could think about until I finished it. I also read Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, and am looking forward to reading the next Harry Potter book. Read this book now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the sort of book you buy for your kids, but read the first few pages just to 'have a peek'. You then find yourself curled up under the covers with a torch, imagining you are in the hidden passasges of the wizards' castle. Your kids will have to steal it from you!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My mother gave me this book to read, which she said was fabulous. I didn't want to read it at first- I finished reading children's books years ago- but after the first chapter, I was hooked. It's a fabulous book and is definitely one of my absolute favorites. JK Rowling is a wonderful writer and I recommend the book to anyone- kid, adult, or teenager!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was a magnifisent book that i reccomend this book. it was a trip. All the dialogue and description, Its alomost as if your there yourself!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the book with great expectations after hearing and reading so many wonderful reviews on it.....well, I'm happy to say it went beyond what I expected! It is a wonderfully charming story that I throughly enjoyed reading along with my 9 year old daughter. We are ready to begin the next book and have already pre-ordered the third!! We've been recommending it to all our relatives!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first read this book I had no Idea it was even popular. I've known how to read since I was 3, (i'm 12 now) and can currently read at the level of any other adult. I've enjoyed books such as &quot;the Bleak House&quot; by Charels Dickens An &quot;Moby Dick&quot; But never the less the 2 Harry Potter books did not fail to enchant me. I've read both of them 12 times already and can't wait for the third one. I'd recommend these books to anyone age10 or older who enjoys fantsy and can release the child within them to read this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was really great. I saw a few people who said that the book was too simple. Who cares! As long as you enjoy it whats the difference. I wouldent say that the book is written with tremendous skill and cunning, but It is entertainment! Alot of the fantasies i have read were boring. Someone also wrote that it is an insult to even ten year old readers, but really. It shouldent be! I am 13 yrs old, and although it was not extremely hard material, it was fun to read. I think that those comparing it with oth er books are just being stupid. It is just not the same thing. I have known a lot of people who have read and loved this book. Those who complain are just a few faces amidst millions who adore it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The people at Amazon.com were smart enough to make this a book on the top of their list. It has a gripping plot, imaginative characters, and a good-and-evil storyline. This book does not contain all that foolish nonsense that other books have, it blends fictional magic into real-life, which I love! I've read the first, and second one, and I can't wait to see the third one in bookstores! This is a MUST BUY! It will stand in a treasured place in your bookcase. Perfect for ADULTS and children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 47 years old and loved this book. It was interesting, fast paced, and easy to read and follow.

This is Not just a book for children. Such a fun read. Cant wait to start on the next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heard about this book while watching the Rosie show a whileback and decided to pick it up. I really didn't know if I would likeit all that much but the price was right and if Rosie liked it why not give it a shot...well am I ever glad I did. I could not stop reading this book. I had to force myself to put it down so I could get some sleep. Its full of mystery, adventure and imagination! A great combination!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is interesting, but it is nowhere near deserving of a five star rating. The basic plot kept me reading the book, but there are certain aspects of the book were not developed nearly enough. For instance, it's vital to any good book to capture the reader by creating a sense of verisimilitude, of &quot;being there&quot; right along with the characters. This book failed to do this because it lacked enough discription of the surroundings in the book to allow the reader to become immersed in the book. Without this feeling of actually being &quot;in&quot; the story, I felt rather detached from the occurances in the book and was therefore only reading, not experiencing the story along with the characters.I know, I know, many people will say that reading is what should be taking place when someone reads a book (DUH!), but a truly excellent book can take this simple process a step further and actually *pull* the reader into the story. Sadly enough, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone failed to do so. This book had much potential, but the actual product was merely satisfactory.I sincerely hope that Ms. J.K. Rowlings will be able to improve on this in her future books and close that gap between average and excellent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was and absolutly wonderful, spectacular, fun-filled story about a boy who goes off to a wizard's school, meets great friends, and learns how to use powers he never even knew he had.

Anyone up for a game of Quidditch?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read this book and I didn't want to, but after the first chapter I could not put it down! I would recommend this book to kids, and adults as well, to read this book if you like magic and thrilling &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; excitment!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After seeing Rosie O'Donnel and J.K. Rowling on television, I ordered both of Ms. Rowling's current Harry Potter novels. I just finished THE SORCERER'S STONE and wanted to share a few words about it before I begin the next book. My taste usually runs to mysteries, sci fi/fantasy,and the &quot;classics&quot;--but I took a chance on this book! It would be a wonderful &quot;read aloud&quot; book for a third, fourth or even fifth grade classroom. Teachers -- Give it a read! It has action, humor, pathos, and MAGIC! I will certainly recommend it to our local and school librarians as I am certain it is destined to be a classic!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling has truly created several fine works of art, with her Harry Potter series. I often find myself wishing that I went to a school like Hogwarts and did not live the ordinary life of a &quot;Muggle.&quot; Despite the books saying that the age group is 9-12 I think that people of all ages would love them. Read these books!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series is a breath of fresh air to the world of children's literature. Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is a dazzaling novel worth reading again and again. I have yet to meet a ten year old who is not intrigued by this famous wizard and his wonderful adventures."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a summer read that I would suggest to anybody, no matter what age! It was lighthearted, and the characters seemed to come to life, despite the fictional setting. I'm on my way to buy the next two of the Harry Potter series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Some books cause you to lose sleep, get car sick and miss wonderful vacation opportunities - because the book is just too good to put down.

It is an amazing book. I absolutely love it even though I watched the movies before reading it. I read this book in about a week, which is fast for me. Usually I switch from reading to playing video games on my tablet but this book was too interesting. I think it was better than the movie. I think everyone should read it. HARRY POTTER ROCKS!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As always, much better than the movie. The wording is very well done and it flows naturally, making it easy to read.

I return to this book once a year at least and I have never been bored while reading it. :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Awesome read! full of adventure and suspense. this book is great for all ages and a must read. great creativity and imagination"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a parent of a 12 and 4 year old. I saw the movie listing and wanted to read the book first after years of hype about &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, so I bought a paperback for my oldest daughter. I started the book in the morning and finished it that night. To put it simply it was like going back into childhood and just reading a good fairy tale. That's it. You shouldn't put more into it than that. Just a well written (although I had to keep the odd sounding names straight)fairy tale that opens your imagination like it should."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've just read this book. It reminded me of the books I read when I was about twelve or thirteen. Rowling has combined the elements of allegory with the formulaic children's novel. Boy's parents die and he's sent to live with wretched relatives, then sets off on an adventure. Sure, it's been done before, but it's refreshing to see a new approach to and old idea.The allegorical elements don't stray far from the path, but they are classic. Sure, the evil is personified say through someone like Malfoy and even at times Snape, but it's always what's perceived by the reader and even the main character. What isn't expected is the twist that Rowling delivers so many of throughout the book. Some expected and more unexpected. It doesn't make sense to me why people wouldn't let their children read it.The Bible is a constant battle between good and evil. However, not many children are interestd in the Bible. Yes, Harry Potter contains witchcraft and many elements Christians don't exactly agree with. However, if it will teach children right from wrong, good from evil,then I say let them read it.To deny children the opportunity to read this book will only increase their interest in it. I feel it's wrong to not let children read a book because it goes against the beliefs of the parents. Children should be the judge of what they read, not their parents.Rowling has done an excellent job in getting children to read. The children's market was lacking something that would spark children's interests. Maybe the books do lack substance that adults seek, but what matters is that it's what the children like.Children are taken to a place that's free of Muggles and the problems of the Muggle world when they read Harry Potter. In today's times, I can see why children would enjoy Harry Potter so much. They can also identify with being the under dog or being the new person or being the poor kid or being the bossy girl or even dealing with bullies. Rowling tackles these subjects in a way that kids can understand them. That's where the true value of Rowling and the Harry Potter series lies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved the book! It was soooo great! I thought I wouldn't like it but I was totally WRONG!!! I'm totally in to magic and I love how some parts of the stories revolve around his classes. Also you get to know the characters really well. Another thing is Harry isn't like some genius or really popular perfect kid, he is just HIM! I love Quidditch! Especially when you get to hear how you play. The Dursley's are sooooo annoying. I would hate to have an uncle, aunt, and cousin like that. Anyway to sum this book up in one word it is:FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My kids insisted that I read the book before going to see the movie. So, I purchased it and half-heartedly started reading it. In less than 4 hours I had devoured this book! I could absolutely not put it down. I immediately rushed out to find the next volume and read that with equal fervor. I highly recommend this to all ages. As soon as he is old enough, I will be reading this to my grandson!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not going to sum the book up, or tell you about the story line, because it has been done in all of the other reviews. ^_^ All I want to say is that you are missing a great series if you aren't planning on reading any of the Harry Potter books. It's truely an age-spanning series, having fans ranging from my 7-year old cousin to my 11th grade classmates, and even to my mom and other older family members! This series is wonderfully imaginative and unique, and I know I'm impatiently waiting for the 5th book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has probably been the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. The way Rowling writes captures the reader from page to page, daring us to read on to what lies next. When one adventure is over, she then suprises us with another. Even though some may say that all of the books are exactly the same, with very indifferent plot and occurances, they actually are very different. Harry always wins though, but us readers definately have no problem with that. So that is why I recommend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Only for the adventurous and daring.."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book. For the people who think it is bad and stuff, You're wrong. Its an enchanting book. Its the best. I would give it a million stars if i could!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Bravo! This is an excellent book and I would read this book aloud to any child near enough to listen. I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, action, suspense, and well-thought-out characters. The book jumps right into modern day times with original thoughts, actions, and feelings that many of today's kids may have. I loved how Harry makes the most of his situation with the Dursleys and ends up prevailing over their doubts in the end. Harry is such a great role model for today's young adults. He doesn't follow the crowd simply because it's a crowd. He does what he thinks is right and it ends up to help him in the end. He makes friends with people no matter what anyone else says and his friends turn out to be true friends. I love the magical elements to the story like the thinking cap, that decides which house they will live in, and the animals that bring them messages. The moving pictures and photos also bring humor and magic together at times. Hogwarts is a perfectly magical setting for everything to take place and you breathe a sigh of discontent as Harry leaves. The only slightly negative thing I would have to say about this book is that it gets a little gory in the forest, when Voldemort drinks the blood of the unicorn. This may be a little unsettling for younger listeners."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit-- I didn't want to read this book. When it first came out, and everyone started clamoring to get it and raving about it, I just didn't want to jump on the bandwagon. But when I saw the previews for the movie, and saw the book available in paperback....I gave in. I had to see what it was about.I'll skip the summary, as I'm sure everyone pretty much knows what it's about.Once I started reading, I found myself absorbed in Hogwarts and....well, I couldn't put the book down. And the ending-- I was taken completely by surprise. I also didn't want the book to end-- thankfully, I've already purchased the next book and will start that tonight.So, for those of you who are avoiding Harry Potter, perhaps you should re-think your decision. You may find yourself actually enjoying it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being a huge fan of the books, I was a little sceptical about getting the audio version. I love hearing and visualizing in my own mind as I read. I have to say that Jim Dale is wonderful on this and the other recordings. He really brings the characters to life, and his flexible voice changes for each character. Highly recommended for traveling or those who have a hard time reading printed books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is the BEST book I've ever read in all my 10 years! And I've read a lot of books! Harry Potter makes me feel like I'm really there, playing Quidditch, taking test, potions, all of it. I wish it were real!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book brought back memories of the Encyclopedia Brown books that all of us devoured in grade school. I see nothing offensive about these book for any age. At least they are not full of sex and violence. They do prove that good does outdo evil everytime. Which would you rather have your child do----read and enrich his mind or look at pictures in today's magazines? Most of us know fantasy from truth. I'm 46 and I enjoyed this book tremendously. My Co-workers are also into reading these books for a few hours away from the grind of real life!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My freind was reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in class one day. I asked her if she liked and thought it was good. She turned to me and flat out said, &quot;it is terrific&quot;. I thought about getting it, and then one day I had to have surgery in my mouth(tooth exposure, stitches, oww). After I got the dreadful procedure done my mother and I went to a bookstore and I broke down and bought the book. I don't really like to read and thought since I had to stay off my feet(due to the numbing)why not? The book is the longest book I have ever read(309 pgs.), I read the book in 4 days (would have read it sooner but school got in the way!). To make a long story short(too late, huh?), most people who read it say it is the best book they have ever read--and I agree.The book was imaginative, wonderful in every way, and surprising. Some say it is terrible and will put things in your head--the book is unrealistic and every kid(and grown-up)knows that(of course I can't speak for every kid, but the majority).I have now joined the crowd(something I rarely do)and will be looking forward to many more books by Ms. Rowling(and not just Harry Potter either)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My reading class just started reading this book and I was expecting some lame story line with no interesting or realistic characters.I could not belive how totally wrong I was! As soon as the class got thru the first chapter I was hooked! I zoomed out to a bookstore, got myself a copy and completly devored it! I couldn't put it down and finshed it within the same day. The characters are so real you expect to meet them on the street. Everthing is described so vivdedly you feel like you could just walk into the book and you'd be there. Some of my fav parts- When Hagrid gets a new &quot;pet&quot;, the flying lesson, the trip to the wizard bank, and the Sorting Hat singing. This is just a great book for any and everyone.

Why are these books getting banned? After reading the 1st book(i am 12)i was shocked that people were trying to ban it. During the time i was reading i never thought it influcing the wrong thing. May i ask parents out there who think this book is awful, what did you think about Dalh's books. The Witches for an example, should we bann it because it has imagnary people, even witches? Why aren't all creative and fictional books banned? Why? Answer these questions and think about what you are doing. I think this the best book. Read other reviews most everyone thinks it is great. Even teacher's say this book is a great CHILDREN'S book. Rethink you're banning. Think about what you are banning from kids. If you are thinking RIGHT now i'm a stupid teenager think again. So what if this book has creative witches and wizards. It is a terrific book and i will tell all my friends to read it. This book will be read no matter what you say. It a great book. i've read it 3 times,and still love it.

But then those religious types who I would bet have either no imagination or did not read the books decided to speak out against a harmless children's book so in protest I borrowed this book from a friend. And read it. Again and again. And again. And then bought all three Harry Potter books. In hardback so I could get the full artwork. And I keep reading them. They're so addictive and I have yet to encounter another author like Ms. Rowlings. Clever and emotional. I love Harry Potter.

But what good is that? Tons of people say what there favorite book is, and 87% of the time no one aknowledges their remark. Therefore, it will take my greatest writing skill to convince you to read (and like) this book. If you do not, I've failed. Try me.Put yourself out of the pleasures of your nice and comfortable home, and into a dark, cobwebby cupboard. In the morning, you are woken bright and early by a violent rapping on your cupboard door and a shrill voice commanding you to get up. Your aunt and uncle (who you live with, as your parents are dead) make you mow the lawn, weed the flower beds, prune the bushed, scrub the floor, polish the silverware, et cetura. Your life goes on like this for 10 painful years, until, miracuosly, you recieve your first letter.Before you can even open it, your uncle has snatched it out of your hands. He takes one glance at it and turns chalk white. More of these letters arrive, the amount doubeling each day. However, your aunt and uncle always manage (through violent fights) to shred them all up.On Sunday, hundreds of them come shooting down the chimney. Uncle pushes everyone into the car, and drives away. You drive for days on end, until, finally, he rows everyone out to a &quot;hut-on-a-rock&quot; out at sea. The wind is howling, rain ounding on the shack's roof, and the waves collasping on the rosck below. You stay up all night, wondering about the letter when ...BOOMThe door bursts open. You sit straight up, and your uncle comes skidding into the room holding a rifle. Both are horrified at what is now standing in the room ..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It seems like some people just don't get the Harry Potter novels, and never will. The book aptly names these people Muggles. They refer to these books as hype or dangerous fantasy. They despair over the poor innocents that will be impaired by this book in some way. They fail to see that this story is the introduction to a wonderful world, every bit as fully realized as Lewis's Narnia with characters as memorable as Dahl's Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach. The only way Harry Potter could impair someone is by giving them a love for reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Do you like magic, wizards, mystical beings,and fantasies? If you do I recommend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a boy who grows up with his aunt, uncle,and his fat cousin Dudly. Growing up is tough for Harry because if anything terrible happens Harry gets the blame and sweet little Dudly gets off the hook.On Harry's twelfth birthday Harry gets a letter that tells Harry about who he really is and what's going to happend. Dudly then snatches the letter away before Harry has a chance to just even take a glimps of it and gives it to his dad,Harry's uncle.Then his uncle reads it,throws it away,and locks Harry in a small cupboard. Weeks pass and hundreds upon hundreds of letters come for Harry talking about the same thing and Harry never gets a single one.Finally one day someone comes and visits Harry and tells him what he really is................ a wizard. To find out what happens to Harry and what kind of adventures he has, read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is by far the most imaginative, well written book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I love to read and try to read everything, but I was a little apprehensive about these books. I had heard all of the hype, but I also thought they were children's books and I thought I would be bored and they would be too basic. I was shocked and amazed that I enjoyed them so much. They take you to a new world and transform you into a twelve year old again with ideas and an imagination that won't quit. We all dreamed, as children, that our dolls could talk and that they could move and speak to us, well J. K. Rowling brought that world back to those of us who are now all grown up and know better than to think that we can have a tea party with our dolls and they will respond to our conversations. It is extremely wonderful to lose yourself in her words and dream back to the days when life was simple and all we had to do was jump on our broomsticks and be whisked away to a fairy tale land where all little girls dreams came true. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who is not too mature to appreciate being twelve years old again. Young and old alike can enjoy this book and it can help generations to understand each other better and give parents and children even more things to talk about at the dinner table. This book will definitely leave you begging for the next book in J.K. Rowling's wonderful series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This charming book is wonderful for children and adults alike. I recommend it for anyone who has a thirst for adventure. When I got this book, I assumed it would be directed more at children and did not anticipate being so captivated. As soon as I finished the book, I turned around and read it again!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will admit first off that I am 14 years old and I STILL loved this book. It is my new favorite book, when just yesterday, Angela's Ashes was. My family and I got home last night at 1 am, and I did not go to sleep until 5:15, when I was done. This book is a must read for everyone, and unless you are extremley religious, you won't find it &quot;evil&quot; or whatever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book. It is full of mystery and detail. I feal awfly sorry for all the kids who can't read it beacause of the &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;horror&quot; their parents claim ar in it. I can't wit for the next 4! To me, it is so far the best series ever written."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The modern American mentality remains a puzzle to me. Kids should know everything about sex at the age of three, because that\`s 'real life', but reading about a little bit of magic will twist their minds. Oh, sure. Got it.Huh! What makes this book any more harmful to your kid than books by Edward Eager and E. Nesbit? And if you think THOSE are harmful as well, then you really have a problem.Kids aren\`t stupid. They know witches and wizards don\`t exist. Stories such as this feed their imaginations, which at that age are certainly hungrier than their sex instincts. Stop underestimating your kids\` intelligence and mixing up your priorities.Of course, I\`m 18 and I love the Harry Potter books. And I still remain grateful to my parents for 'allowing' me to read fairy tales."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I cannot stress how much I adore Harry Potter stories. They are funny, adventurous, magical, dramatic, and just perfect. I love every part about them and I can't wait untill the 5th book comes out. The first one is like all other first books, they are the beginning of a wonderful tale with colorful themes and backrounds. If there were an award for best author, J.K. Rowling would be sure to win it! All I can say to her is, &quot;Keep Up The Good Work!&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have been reading a lot of books in my life, I write some myself. When I first heard of Harry Potter I thought to myself, &quot;Eh, it's probably just a children's book!&quot; Then, I started hearing it was good. I believe I got them for Christmas or something, actually for both my sister and me. I read the first one (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and fell in love with the series. I was completely caught up with it. I couldn't put down the book. I used to read the whole page until I found one that ended the sentence or else I would lose my place. I know, but I didn't feel like using bookmarks! I couldn't stop reading because it was so interesting. I love mystery and adventure books such as Harry Potter and EverWorld. I like being kept in suspense. I think that Harry Potter is a great and magical book not only for young ones to enjoy, but for everyone to experience the magic Harry Potter is experiencing in J.K. Rowling's mysterious and fun series. I do hope they keep the books coming!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Even though J.K. Rowling's rags to riches story is what initially inspired me to write \\"The Merchants of Men - The Terracotta Soldiers Series,\\" I'd never actually gotten around to reading Harry Potter for myself. Even though I saw some of the movies, my friends always told me that the books were WAY better and that I just had to give it a shot. Man, am I glad I did! I read The Sorcerer's Stone in ONE DAY, cover to cover and IMMEDIATELY bought \\"The Chamber of Secrets.\\"Before I actually read the book, I was certain that Harry was going to be the only character worth caring about, but I quickly found myself looking forward to Hermione's appearances as well (seeing how she was usually the voice of reason, if not a little prudish). I also found Hagrid to be a lovable character. A sort of antithesis to Hermione's rational/logical approach to problems in the story, I personally found Hagrid to be a somewhat simpleminded galoot with a heart of gold. I guess Hagrid is not unlike Lennie fromOf Mice And Menin that regard (By the way, if you haven't read Steinbeck's classic, then don't be afraid to give it a shot. It's relatively brief, but still an amazing tale). These amazing supporting characters, as well as others, serve to drive Harry's growth and maturation in what is essentially a Coming of Age story that spans 7 (deliciously written) books.So what do I think? In case you haven't gotten the point yet, I think that Ms. Rowling's success is well deserved :). If this book is any indication of what the rest of the series is like, then she has won yet ANOTHER fan. It's just a shame it took me so long to see what the fuss was all about."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was very enertaining.

Especially when Harry was alone with lord Voldemort."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE HARRY POTTER'S. Every book gets more magical.

I really got a good sense of how Harry was feeling throughout the book. Anyone else wanted to strangle his Aunt and Uncle? The world she created was absolutely magical and wonderful! I want to be a part of that! The language was really easy. Didn't have to struggle with lots of strange words usually found in fantasy novels. I love the dynamics of the characters involved. Having read the entire series, I was really hoping that Hermione and Harry hooked up but the way Rowlings had it played out was acceptable. I really do enjoy all the little things Rowlings put into each book that later surfaces in the other books. The story line with its twist and turns kept me reading until the very end. I couldn't put any of the books down until I was done!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book definitely lives up to all the movie and media hype. J.K. Rowling is brilliant and Stephen Fry is thrilling. We decided to listen to these on audio-book while driving, cleaning and working, watching the first movie afterwards. The storyline is engaging and enthralling from the beginning. Magic begins almost immediately, quickly pulling the audience into the mysterious life of Harry Potter. Stephen Fry is capable of a wide range of voices; just when you think he can't possibly read as another new character, he excitingly does it. We worried we might be too old to enjoy this series, but Rowling is such a genius author that she writes at a level enjoyable to all ages. Bravo! Read this book and then watch the coinciding film. The movies never please every fan, especially the hardcore ones, but it's always great to see the characters come to life in cinema."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Delivery time was good, condition as advertised except the sound quality does not seem as good as other audio books I have purchased in this series.

The storyline is easy to follow and descriptive, enabling the reader to colorfully visualize characters and scenes. I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 15 due to the lack of character development, depth and interesting dialogue. Sorcerer's Stone is the first and last book of the series I'll read. Not enough \\"juice\\" to keep me interested."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am amazed on how well J.K Rowling has put this book together. I have read the series many, many times and I am shocked every time how everything is placed just in the right spot at the right time. It's very subtle looking at the big scheme of the books, but it's there telling you more about what's going on and what might happen. It keeps you on your toes without it being too much for you to take in. She has done a brilliant job setting up the series with this book. You are really depriving yourself of a beautiful piece of art if you don't read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Pretty fun stuff, but not particularly original and the writing itself is bland and mediocre. Fine for kids, but there is so much more out there for children that is better done. Try anything by Roald Dahl. It's too bad that it takes such a faddish craze to get people to read. Hopefully parents will take this opportunity to turn their kids on to all of the other amazing works there are out there."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It starts out without Harry in the book and suddenly he comes in and the action rises. A giant comes in his house and tells him he is a wizard and is taken to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and the rest of the story is a giant climax."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Nothing new here. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone iswell-written and engaging, but there is nothing original here. Harrycould just as well be any of many super-youths unaware of their power and heritage, such as Wort or Luke Skywalker. The plot is predictable.Much better is the Wizard series (So You Want to be a Wizard, etc.) by Diane Duane."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It may be that I expected too much. It may be that I'll end up liking these books. However, there are things illogical that do not belong in any book, fantasy or not, such as someone trying to pound a nail with fruit cake. I realize this book is for young people, but I agree with C. S. Lewis who said, &quot;Any book that is not worthy of an adult, is not worthy of children.&quot; There are even little picky things, such as using words such as &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;wham,&quot; as if this is a comic strip. Ms. Rowling has a marvelous imagination, but I could wish there had been a bit more creative editing. You cannot know how disappointed I am in this first volume of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first book in the series, is a decent enough book. Where it falls distressingly short is in measuring up to its own hype.First, a confession. I saw the first Potter movie years before I read the book. I was hugely disappointed.Frankly, having worked in Hollywood myself, I blamed the filmmakers. To me, the movie played like a highlight reel: a whole lot of big action scenes with little to connect them. Not much character. Not much logic. Not much believability.I figured Hollywood had removed all that boring \\"humanity\\" that had no doubt contributed to making the book so popular, in order to cram in more action and visuals.I just now read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I was wrong about the movie. It was, unfortunately, rather faithful to the book. I'm also afraid that my \\"highlight reel\\" complaint was far from my only one.This Harry Potter book suffers from Welcome Back, Kotter syndromeIf you remember the annoying 1970's sitcom, you know what I'm talking about. Kotter was a high school teacher saddled with a smart-aleck class full of underperformers.Four of them were the stars of the show. They sat in the front row. The rest of the class was made up of extras. Kotter never spoke to the extras. Their job was just to laugh at the clever exchanges between Kotter and the four stars.Even as a kid, I had a problem with that. It didn't meet my standards for realism and believability.Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has much the same problem. Harry enters as a first year student. It would seem there are at least a couple hundred students at this school, but reading the book you'd swear there were only about eight, and only three who figure prominently: Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron.These three get in adventure after adventure, find themselves in trouble continuously, rarely consult adults before setting out recklessly to save the world (the world seems to need saving by these three about once a month), and always manage to pull off whatever it is they're trying to achieve.(Here's a general precept of good fiction: the hero fails a lot before succeeding in the end. Harry, on the other hand, succeeds a lot before succeeding in the end.)To my mind, author J.K. Rowling's great talent is the charming way in which she renders the wizardry and witchcraft believable. She does so by making magic - or at least the learning of it - humorously mundane. Students moan and groan over their pending Defense Against The Black Arts exam just like regular children moan and groan over Algebra!That Rowling does this so well is part of the reason the Kotter Syndrome is so grating. Harry and his friends are too young and untrained to be succeeding - no less surviving - in their absurd adventures.I realize I'm practically the lone voice in the wilderness hereBelieve me, I know this book, and the other Potter books, have merits. I see some of them. But obviously, these books are touching millions of children - and adults - in a way that they aren't touching me. I don't assume that I'm right and everyone else is wrong. (Though it's tempting!)I do have an opinion, though, on what has made the Harry Potter books so popular at this particular point in history. Here it is.They're about celebrity. Completely unearned celebrity.We live in a celebrity-obsessed culture, right?People are no longer just famous for being good at something. We now have people who are famous for their bad actions, and other people who are famous for, well... nothing at all.In this, the first Harry Potter book, Harry finds out one day, at age ten, that he's famous! Not in the mortal (Muggle) world he's been living in, but in the world of magic, wizardry and witchcraft that he hadn't known existed.Children know his name. Adults know his name. They whisper about him and point at him. He hasn't done anything to deserve it. It's just that his birth parents were famous.Harry Potter seems, to me, very much of our celebrity-soaked times. True, he didn't audition for the role of Best Kid Wizard. But he's plenty content to be in it, and I don't remember a single passage in this 300 page book where he paused to question how he came to be the anointed.That would have been refreshing. But at least he doesn't hire a public relations agency.True, Harry has lived ten years with a rather awful family who make him live in a cupboard. It's a rather Cinderella existence. He is deserving of sympathy. He may not exhibit Cinderella's pure goodness and selflessness, but who would? He's still a pretty sweet kid.He deserves better. But does he deserve fame?I don't doubt that this book would be an incredibly satisfying read for children who have had a truly hard time of it in their short lives. But I despair somewhat for the message it imparts to kids who haven't had a hard time of it.The book's message? Actually, it's more like a fortune cookie. It reads,\\"You will soon be recognized for your innate genius. Don't sweat it.\\"It's another precept of good fiction that heroes succeed in the end by virtue of hard work.Not in Harry Potter. Heroes succeed by virtue of being Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't know why I'm bothering to write a review about this book other than I'm bored. Everyone already knows about it, and everyone already has their opinion, so it's pretty much a waste of time. But here goes.I just don't get it. It's not a bad story. It's got some interesting characters. The setting is okay. And every so often, there are flashes of inspiration. But overall, it's just not that great. The book is too long. The story is sluggish. And the magic is poorly defined. What can these kids do? What are their limits? In a world where everyone has magic, why does Harry, our hero, hardly do anything magical?I also don't care much for the world. It seems too grounded in reality. Who wants to relive their lousy school days, even if it's a wizard's school? Apparently, a lot of people, so never mind.This book suffers from the weakness of so many books nowadays. It just seems like a set up for the next book, and I guess I don't find Harry or his world interesting enough to continue on. Rowling can barely fill this book with material.If you're a Potter fan, of course you'll think I'm wrong. Maybe I am. Only time will tell."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After being bormbarded by the media for over a year now, with Harry making it even on the TIME Cover, I (Fantasy-Fan and 33) finally bought it.Hmmm. The conclusion is that if a so many people think that this is really a great book it is a very, very sad statement on the state of children's education and culture not only in the U.K. but in the industrialised countries worldwide.If you read something like Winnie or Alice or the Neverending Story, you wonder what is so special about Potter. Yes, the story is funny and fast-paced and there is mystery enough in it to make it successful. I can understand that. But I cannot understand people saying that it is actually a GOOD BOOK. It is not. It fails in a lot of aspects: Narration is sloppy, sometimes simply omitting story-lines in the middle of the book and sometimes things are not explained at all. (Like how did Harry get his cloak of invisibility back from the astronomer's tower?). The style of writing is ok, but neither good nor competent (I once counted 10 times &quot;Harry said...&quot;, &quot;Harry looked ...&quot; etc. in one paragraph.The Verdict: Yeah, it's ok. You can buy it for yourself or your children. It was ok for me too and I bought #2 too (which is boring and I will not buy #3). I will give them to my nephew when he gets old enough.But it's really sad that people do not know any more what really good children's literature is like."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"On some of my reviews i stated that the Harry Potter books were poorly written, but thats just because i have resad better fantasy books... Like books by Robert Jordan and Jrr Tolkien. The Harry Potter books are not as good as those books. I also said that the Dreaming Tree by C.J. Cherryh was better than than Harry Potter books, however, not all people may think so; but that is my opinion. Personally, I think The Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings are better written. Other people may disagree, but, again, that is just my opinion. Read these if you want to and ,well, if you dont want to read the Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings.{I am not saying the Harry Potter books are stupid or anything, but not all people have like them}"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was a great summer read. I'm not a very avid reader but I couldn't put this book down. The author does an excellent job of creating a fantastically fabricated reality, that I did not want to leave. In a world were owls deliver the mail and cats may really be witches and wizards in disguise it is difficult to leave this place and face reality again.Aside from the wonderfully exiting world, the characters, while sometimes a bit stock are still well-written. And I really hated that Snipes guy!The plot is well written as well. It offers a nice twist at the end. I can't wait to get started on the next book! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books have received raving reviews everywhere from pretty much everyone, and to see what all the fuss was about, I read the delightful Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the end of July 2000. I did enjoy reading it too and had a wonderful time. In the first few days to come once I had read it and the dust was beginning to settle, I however had an unsettling feeling that just wouldn't go away.I think the feeling initially surfaced when reading the Halloween chapter in the middle of the book, at which time some tension had been building for a while with Harry and mostly Ron dismissing Hermione as &quot;clever&quot;, &quot;nagging&quot;, &quot;annoying&quot; and being a &quot;bossy know-it-all&quot; (p164). It was Hermione though, who got Harry and Ron out of the mountain troll trouble (pp177-179) and in doing so was punished herself. And &quot;from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend&quot;.That's nice of course, but it struck me later that Harry, unlike Hermione, is not the kind that would unselfishly go out on a limb. He is simply the chosen, the natural if you will. While Hermione has faught hard and read much to get where she is, Harry was merely born into a destiny for glory. And whereas luck and others tend to protect Harry when he has broken the rules, Hermione, who by nature is not as easily likeable as Harry, has come to view following the rules as a defense mechanism. The more she does so, the more she is ridiculed, and vice versa.Once she has broken the circle, all is more pleasant. &quot;Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.&quot; (p181). Hermione was the one who discovered that &quot;The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone!&quot; (p220). She also figured out that Harry's broomstick was jinxed. Yet she says to Harry towards the end: &quot;Books! And cleverness! There are more important things - friendship and bravery and - oh Harry - be careful!&quot; (p287).Once Harry wakes up from the stone and mirror climax, Dumbledore is there to tell him that &quot;only one who wanted to find the stone - find it, but not use it - would be able to get it&quot; (p300). This somehow rings truer for Hermione than for Harry, who earlier said that &quot;Anyone would want it! (p220) and that &quot;If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! (p270) and &quot;Voldemort killed my parents, remember?&quot; (p270).It is a highly personal matter of course, and it may be argued that Harry is indirectly using the stone, inasmuch as if he prevents Voldemort from getting it, then everyone, including himself, is saved. Looking back at the story, I can't remember a single incident where Harry did something exclusively for others. And that surprised me, because how can it be that there must always be something in it for him? After all, he is supposed to be our hero of the book. I am also a little uneasy about the various times he appears to be a bit too eager to get back at others like Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Snape, Voldemort and of course Dudley.Harry looks like a saint next to Ron (Harry's &quot;animal&quot; side?), who is easy to critize others. It is however Hermione, who comes through on her own, and she is my hero. J K Rowling once said in an interview that &quot;Hermione Granger is a little bit like I was at her age, though I was neither as clever or as annoying (I hope!).&quot;, and the question is why she was written to be that way, if not simply to make Harry look better? The author says in another interview, that &quot;I was a little bit like Hermione in the book when I was young. I wasn't as clever, and I really hope I wasn't as annoying. I did consciously base her on me when I was about 11.&quot;, and also that &quot;Harry came fully formed out of my imagination, but there is obviously a lot of me in Harry.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love the Harry potter series I'm a huge fan.

Let's turn back the clock a bit, shall we? In 1999, I was a student ambassador traveling the Mediterranean and about to start my freshman year in high school. On that trip, another student ambassador was reading a paperback funny-looking book with a picture of a kid on a broomstick who looked like he was about to crash into one of the pillars- with a lighting-shape scar on his head. 'Huh. Good character design!\\" Was my first thought- Harry actually HAD an appearance! If there's one thing that irked me with many books is that you never see the main character. And yet this one, you could see him. Yet the whole cover looked so.... different. The title sounded so... Cheezy. Harry Potter? Oro? ...Okay.\\"This is actually a pretty good book so far.\\" The kid who was reading it told me.\\"What's it about?\\" I asked. He showed me the illustration for Chapter 2 and there I saw Dudley and all his presents, looking smug.\\"It's about this orphaned kid who's raised by his neglective relatives. See that kid, that's his cousin, Dudley- he's so spoiled that every year he counts his presents to make sure that his parents give him more than what he got last year.\\" Wow, I thought, that's one spoiled cousin.\\"So what does Harry get then?\\" I asked.\\"Nothing. But the part I'm at, he talks to a snake.\\"\\"Hmm.\\"So it looked like a weird book about a boy who crashes on brooms, is neglected, and can talk to snakes. O......kay. The title alone sounded cheezy. Origional. But cheezy. Besides, I rarely read fiction. Books weren't all that cool to me.... Sure, I've read a few things, but most books I read were ghost stories and facts about animals. Maybe a few short stories, here and there. But I never could read a whole novel anyway. On my own, at least. I seriously doubted I could. I barely read a few books on my own for book reports, but I don't even think I took in most of what was happeneing. So, I put it from my mind. Fast forward to the end of my freshman year in high school, 2000. (I had just turned 15) One of the friends I had made was pratically spazzing out about the up-coming release of the 4th book, Goblet of Fire, which was coming out that summer. When I told her I never read it and had only heard of it, she insisted I read it, and even loaned me the first book in paperback. Well.The first chapter alone intrigued me. I had no idea what the heck was going on, but it caught my attention. The flying motorcycle, the bearded guy, the groovy Merlin-figure with the cool name Dumbledore, the lady who can turn into a cat- and the black-haired, scarred sleeping baby Harry. :D The end of the first chapter was so beautifully described, I wanted to know more. So on I read.It took me a while to get past Diagon Alley, but even as I did, this book made me react in a way no other book ever had- I actually found myself getting dizzy reading about the cart ride in Gringotts, I heald my breath at parts, found myself fighting off tears at other parts, and I even jumped up, whooped aloud, and punched the air in triumph at the Quidditch scene. My dad probably thought it had finally happened: I lost my marbles. :DI picked up the title just in time- I had no idea there was even a school in the series. All I knew about it was that it was the story of an orphaned kid with bad relatives. Soon after I finished the book, I felt renewed, awakened, and inspired. I read the rest as that summer ended, and as I finished book 4, the hype was born. At first it was all cool and everything to buy a coffee mug with Harry grabbing one of the winged keys, but the popularity was almost enough to drive even me crazy. But still, the book has a spell of it's own. It's healing, it's entertaining, it's educational and I am proud to say that it is anything but evil. I discovered that I had a love for reading I never knew that I had all along, and I went back to re-read titles I read in school, and have moved on to tackle other books out there. Finally, after I graduated High School, I read the 5th book, and have now finished the 6th book this summer, and I feel I have grown with the series. I've learned from it. But even so, each book has it's own flavor that's unique to it. I look back now and read the first book and there is a beautiful air of innocence to it, but it's not all light and fluffy, the book DOES get dark. Even so, I catch things I never did before with each re-read, I understand things I never did before after reading the later titles, and each time I go back, it never grows old.After having read the 6th book, I look at the first and see exactly why Harry is special. His power the Dark Lord knows not is definately there and going strong while he is merely a kid; instead of seeing material gain or wealth, all Harry saw in the mirror, all he ever longed for, was his family. Being neglected as he was and having to watch Dudley get everything his greazy heart desirres, he could have easily longed for the same things- but no. All he wanted was his parents at his side. In that chapter, it meant more to him to see his mom and dad than anything else anyone could ever want might mean. I felt a kin-ship with him there, having lost my mother when I was 7. Instead of treating Neville as the other kids did (laughing at him, etc), Harry showed him compassion several times through the story. When given the opportunity by Draco to be popular, he turned it down, deciding he could decide who \\"the wrong sort\\" were for himself without Malfoy's help. Harry was not afraid to pick his friends :D In each book, he is constantly tempted by the Dark Arts, and never once does he give in to them. Even Voldemort himself offers to Harry that if he sided with him, they could find ways to bring his parents back- Harry was even able to see through that, too.I'm not surprised the series made it so far, but I like to look past the hype, past the advertising, past the movies, to see the books for what they are: Incredible. The first book alone is an excellent story to set the stage for an adventure anyone with an open-mind is obliged to embark on. It's so much simpler, yet there is so much to learn. J.K Rowling has found a way to portray fantasy in a way that is so real the reader can almost breathe it. I am also thankful- I never knew I could understand literature- and here I discover it's as if all along I possessed a love and knack for it that needed to be awakened.I'm very lucky to have discovered this series before I knew what it was. The best way to discover Harry Potter is to read it for yourself-having no knowledge of what lies within it's pages. :) I learned for myself that it is not some random book about some weirdo-kid with issues, but it is something to relate to, grow with and learn from. The Movies are fun, but they can't compare with the true mastery of the novels!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcer's StoneI have just recently read this book and I didn't really care for it. I think that it would make a great children's book though. I didn't like the story that much because I like sport stories the most because I am a sports kid. Out of all the adventure stories that I have read so for Harry Potter has probably been the best. Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is about a boy and his parents die and Harry Potter goes to a wizard school. Harry has to protect the school and keep a guy named Voldemore from taking over the school. The climax of the story is when Harry Potter fights Voldemore and tries to get the stone back to help the school."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read many editorial reviews praising this series and must conclude that J.K.

Read this extraordinary book to find things out of this world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, kudos to Rowling for getting children away from the tv and into books. Now let's talk good children's books. The first thing i wondered after having finished this and the other books (up to number 4) in the series was &quot;what is the appeal of this poorly-written fantasy (...)?&quot; The second thought that astounded me was &quot;why are adults across the country so fascinated?&quot; Really, i am appauled. As i sped from book to book, trying to find something of worth in the two-dimensional blather topping the bestseller lists, i wanted to throw the book at the wall. However, since it was my younger brother's copy, I did not. The characters are two-dimensional, the problems and their solutions too obvious (will Harry be picked for the wizard championship thingy? i think no...) and althogether you could see everything coming from a mile away. Worst of all, Rowling has taken a simple fantasy book with a heart of gold and sold its soul. I think its wonderful that she has gotten children interested in reading again, and i dont care at all about the &quot;pagan themes&quot; and &quot;evil witchcraft and wizardry&quot; present, but once the kids are reading, why not get them to read something worth while? For ages 11 and under i recommend Tolkien's The Hobbit, while for older than that I recommend books such as Sabriel by Garth Nix, The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, and perhaps most of all the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. RELIGIOUS PARENTS BE WARNED! The Philip Pullman books just mentioned deal with many issues you may not approve of. They are, however, the most wonderful books i have ever read(besides the Lord of the Rings) and they made me cry more than once. All in all, I think that Harry Potter had the right idea, but now that people are reading again, shouldnt they be reading something good?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love harry potter, so I got the Collector's Edition, trust me its worth the money!

I do agree with other reviewers that the messages being spouted, however subliminally, by the author are not the most wholesome; to wit, characters having no compunction about lying, cheating, and generally disobeying authority to get what they want. I have read each book (a friend continues to buy them for me even after I expressed a dislike for them), so as you can see, I didn't pick this up on my own; I do not read things simply because they are popular, I have never read Goose-bumps, for instance. But, out of all the Harry Potter books, this is the best, and that's sad. As the series continues, each book is progressively worse, less interesting, and downright dull. As for the title of this review, I was taking a psychology course at the same time as I read this, and after finishing it, what popped into my head was: 1. This is so utterly, obviously Freudian! (from the cupboard under the stairs, to the broomsticks, dueling wands, etc. every page and sceen is full of Freudian symbolism.) I was also reading Cristina Rosetti's \\"Goblin Market\\" at the time, so the other thing that I thought was: 2. this is a subversive attempt to tell children about a homosexually dominated world, but I won't deliniate my reasons for that here, since I don't even remember them, this was over two and a half years ago. All in all, though, this book is no revelation or eye-opener, this all has been done countless times, and Rowling's celebrity, I think, has to do more with the circumstances she was in while writing than with the caliber of the writing itself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i really did not like this book! it was really boring for me!YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked this book because it is great and exciting book.My favorite part is when he gets to go to the school of Wisardry.Another part is when he gets to play Quiddich games and how he has the best broom stick."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked this book because it was fun to read about when he kept on getting in trouble.

In this book, you find out about Harry Potter's parents, and his mean aunt and uncle who torture him.

Ignore the short-sighted, narrow-minded fools who seek to ban these books because they &quot;harbor an interest in the occult&quot;...please! Nothing could be furthur from the truth. I'm sure Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz faced similar opposition. The books stand for freindship, teamwork and self-sacrifice, and deal with some very real-world issues like an orphan growing up in not the most ideal environment, and still managing to become a decent kid in the process. These are values I don't mind my eleven year old reading about. And ANY book that encourages a child to read and excite the imagination like these books do, must be supported.

My only complaint: Why did I wait so long to finally read this? I just finished reading this first book in the series and it is very, very good. We all know the story of Harry Potter, but for those who don't, this book introduces us to the world of Harry Potter. It's about a young orphan boy who lives with his mean aunt, uncle, and cousin. His bedroom is this small closet-like room at the bottom of the stairs and he hasn't had a birthday in thirteen years! But everything changes when Harry gets a letter from Hogwarts school, a school to train kids with wizardery and witchcraft. When he leaves to attend the school to train to become a wizard, he learns that there is more to life and even ends up making friends and learns how to create spells. This is a very fun relaxing book that is easy to read. It is long (and the other books are even longer), but it is fast-paste and extremely entertaining. I like how J.K. Rowling created all her unique characters from her own imagination. It is great fantasy with a British twist, since J.K. Rowling is British. It's the first book in the series (like I mentioned before) and a true classic. I love the way J.K. Rowling writes so much that I look up to her as an idol because I want to become a writer someday, too. I haven't gotten to the other books yet but I definitely will soon. And I can't wait to see the film, either because it looks just as excellent as the books and it looks like it follows the books pretty well, too. I have to say that I am not an obsessed Harry Potter fan and I don't really care about all the hype or the games and toys, etc., I just enjoy reading the books and will see (and probably enjoy) the highly anticipated film, too. If you haven't read this book yet than what are you waiting for? You'll love it so much that you'll want to desparately read the other books and see the film! Read this today! :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ok, like other reviewers, I had to get past the hype of this series before I would read it. Actually, my 40something sister read this book at the suggestion of her co-workers, and my 50something mom-in-law also read it. This got me to thinking that these are people whose opinions I respect, so I'll give it a chance (and I'm 30something). As you will find from other reviews, it is an easy read--I probably could have finished it in less than the week it took me had I not had a baby and toddler to take care of! I'm a huge fan of the Christian Left Behind series as well as authors Dean Koontz, Robin Cook, Michael Crichton, etc. and found this book to be a breath of fresh air! The character development is superb (you really get to despising his &quot;muggle&quot;, or non-magical, family!), the elements of fantasy (the whole spells/wizardry/broomsticks aspect) wonderfully described. The fictional game of Quidditch sounds like something I'd go see! I also like that each book (of which I hear there will be 7) corresponds to Harry's seven years in secondary school, so it'll be interesting to watch the characters we've grown to love (or hate)mature, or otherwise change. I admit, I'm looking forward to the movie--but only because I read the book first.

The book is very easy to read, the plot is very catching and intense with lots of surprises, and the imagination is wonderful. All in all, this is a great book. Compared with the famous mythology books like Lord of the Rings, this series is more geared towards younger readers with simpler characters and more straight forward plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I bought the rest 3 books in the series and finished them quickly. Those 3 are also very good but not as good as this first one probably because the novelty starts to wear off.To my surprise, magic and wizardry isn't the central role in this series. The book is good because the plot is catching and the imagination is wonderful, not only because magic and wizardry is in it. After all, mastering magic is the yearning and the imagination of many good people when they grow up. It is only when magic is used for evil purpose or when people are drawn and controlled by the evil behind magic (like the Dark Lord Voldemort in the series) is it started to turn evil. In this book, magic is used by both the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; guys, so it is more at a neutral role.One thing does concern me in the book, though. It is the defying of the authority. Harry and his gang repeatly broke the rule and got away with it (and earned rewards from doing so!). This is not a good role model since we need to recognize that youngsters are prone to risky behaviors and normally such behaviors bring about bad results, not like the good rewards depicted in the books. Thus, young people need to submit to authorities who have more wisdom and experiences. I am worried that many young people will be encouraged to ignore responsible teachings and to pursue risky behaviors because of the book. So in my opinion, this book is better to be read by young people after some guidance from their parents."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first I did not think I would enjoy this book being as I beleived it to be a children's book.

I always told myself that I was to old to read those kinds of books. Man was I ever wrong. I absolutely loved this book. It took be back to the good old days of when I used to read just because I wanted to and not because I had to finish the book for school.This book had a very enjoyable plot. There really weren't any slow parts to the book because at every turn of a page it seemed like Harry was just about to get expelled from school. Then somehow he would get out of the jam and go on being a normal student. It just kept me wanting to read more and more of the book.J.K. Rowling had wonderful characters for this book. None of them were \\"perfect.\\" They all had some sort of flaw. Harry wasn't the brightest or the strongest person in the world but he managed to stand up to the worst Wizard in the land. This book really shows people that hero's come in all different shapes and sizes and that you can always use help in your life.Sometimes books will drag on forever and you'll always be wondering when is it going to end. Well, not with this one. This book is a very easy read. It doesn't seem like your reading a 310-page book. I literally read this book in two days. (Which for a high school student is pretty fast.) I just never wanted to put it down. I remember towards the end, I was reading the last chapter and I wanted to see how Harry ended up but as I looked at the clock I noticed that I had to go to rehersal. Immediately after rehearsal was over I went to my room to finish the book to see how Harry made out. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone. You will definitely enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The reason I think that this is a really good book is becasue not very many books are good when they come out and still like several years later"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an excellent start to the Harry Potter series.

I'm in my forties, and thought this was a children's book. Well, I think it would be a rare child who could truly appreciate this masterpiece of literary genius. I loved this book, and the next two, \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\", and \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\". The movies were great, too. I own \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\", just haven't read it yet, but J. K. Rowling is one of the most gifted writers of modern times.

I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a good book and that it shall not be banned. However I can see some of the reasons that someone would want to ban this book. One of the reasons is probably the wizards and creatures in the story. I would say that the author (J.K. Rowling) is very unique and she is a very creative thinker. For example, Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels about a boy in training to become a wizard. Harry goes to Hogwarts Witch Craft and Wizardry, which is the name of the school that he attends. Harry Potter has become extremely popular among readers of all ages. This book is only fantasy just like some of the other books that are out there such as one of the famous stories are Alice and Wonderland. J.K. Rowling is just using her imagination to make kids think and really imagine what it is like to fly etc. Harry Potter teaches readers nothing bad; actually I would say that it teaches some good lessons like to stand up to your enemies and don't let them pick on you. Harry Potter is a good book and you should try it out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's StoneOn number 5 Privet Drive in London a young boy goes to school, plays on a baseball, and has adventures with his friends. He is an ordinary boy. Or is he? He lives with his uncle and aunt who treat him lower than dirt and make him sleep under the stairs. He plays a game on a broom called Quidditch and goes to a school named Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he and his friends learn to be witches and wizards. He studies classes such as Defense Against the Dark Arts, Divination, and other classes.His name is Harry Potter.Throughout the book the boy struggles with his life because he has strange things happen to him. But it's not over yet. He finds out that he is a wizard and could be one of the strongest ones alive. His parents were murdered by a strong dark wizard named Voldemortwho was also after Harry. But he didn't kill him...yet. After the murder he was only left with a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead while He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was killed. You-Know-Who is out there somewhere still to weak to live on and living off of others.On Harry's first year there he discovers new things in the wizarding world and loves every minute of it with new friends Hemione Granger and Ron Weasley. The three of them solve mysteries in this fantasy and have lots of adventures to become memories. His headmaster Albus Dumbledore gives lots of advise in the story and tells Harry, \\" It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are far more than our abilities.\\"Harry reads in the newspaper that at Green Grotts (a bank) has a volt that someone tried to rob but didn't get what was inside. A person emptied the volt earlier that day. Harry fights throughout the entire story trying to figure out who it was that tried to steal the object and face his worst nightmare that causes his scar to burn with hatred. Soon he will figure it out...Parents and other elders shouldn't tell their kids that they couldn't read these books because of the magic. They should let their kids have a fantasy of their own while they can.Everyone should read this book and enter the magical world themselves. The only magic use is your sense of adventure to create the world in front of you. So don't judge the book by its cover. Dig in and have an adventure of your own. And remember swish and flick your wand because a new world awaits you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When a person who has read numerous novels of fantasy and science fiction first begins to read \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" it may be difficult to align with J.K. Rowling's universe. Rather than build upon existing mythology, J.K. Rowling started from scratch and created a self-consistent universe unique from all others. The result is that some readers may initially attempt to fit their paradigms of magic, wizardry and witchcraft to Rowling's story, and become frustrated until they wipe away those paradigms. It is for this reason that children enjoy Rowling's universe so well. They have yet to acquire the preconceived notions of adults, and Harry Potter is so fun to read that they fall into the story immediately.Harry Potter is the stereotypical of the classic nerd. He wears broken glasses, his clothes fit poorly, and he is put down by his aunt and uncle. Into this rather mundane and pitiless world comes a mysterious letter from a place called \\"Hogwart's. \\" Suddenly Harry realizes there is more to the world than living under the stairs, and we travel the road to knowledge and a better life with Harry because we want to BE Harry.When Harry was a baby he encountered Voldemort, considered to be an evil wizard. Voldemort was nearly destroyed in the encounter and Harry Potter became famous, even though he was removed from the world of magic until he turned 10 years old. Unfortunately, Harry's parents did not survive the encounter and thus Harry came to live with his cruel aunt and uncle, both \\"muggles\\" who despised and denied the existence of magic.Harry attends the first year of seven years at Hogwart's school, and learns there is a world of magic that exists all around, but which is protected by a multitude of resources lest the muggles become alarmed. Harry learns much about magic and that there are mysteries in the world of magic that affect him. Harry also begins to learn the amount of magical ability that he has inherited from his parents, and that with that power he has the ability to control the outcome of situations.J.K. Rowling has written a book that compares favorably with other children's book. Her characters are likable and accessible, and her world is fun. There are moments of amusement and moments of fear, and children of all ages should find this book a treat. Highly recommended reading for anyone over the age of 8 years old."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this book was amazing because it had tons of action in it and the author does really well with words. This book is also a great book because it displays a great amount of friendship. This type of writing is interesting and fun to read at the same time, you don't even want to put the book down. It also displays how you can overcome fear; harry does this a lot in the book. He helps his friends out with their obstacles. This book teaches kids good things and deeds to do."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that the first book of the beloved Harry Potter series was by far the best of all five. It's fun to step into the world of Hogwarts and picture the adventures of the young wizard. Harry shows bravery and perseverance, but doesn't always stop to think about if what action he's taking will have a great consequence; but this only makes the book 3 times more exciting.

Now half way through the second book, she's still going strong. I read the first one myself and found it to be very enjoyable. The author has a very appealing writing style that's super easy to read. Could've done without all the hard to pronounce names, but that's the adult in me talking. This series reminds me of the Chronicles of Narnia that I loved as a child.

I found it a wonderful children's story employing all of the traditional concepts of fantasy (first problem...after a while this becomes tiresome with one cliche directly following the last). Perhaps I shouldn't criticize, after all it is a children's story and I'm not a child. But nor am I an adult. I have found lovely works on both the children's and adult shelves, also books whose words shouldn't be read as a hideous torture. This falls in neither of those, but somewhere where it will be read, enjoyed, and forgotten, lacking in the brilliance that I've come to expect from books hailed as this one has been. Make no mistake, read this book to your children and have fun. I strongly disagree with previous reviewers who use religion to condemn imagination and make believe. I am a Christian and believe in obeying God, but I also believe fairy tales are vital to any life, and that means introducing elements that aren't real and not condemning them as evil just because you can't see them. My final qualm is that so many, probably older and better educated than myself have expressed such great esteem for this book that is a nice story, but by no means original or brilliant. I'm quite glad for your enjoyment, but I hope it encourages you to explore other books that will be better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book,it was so very delightfuly written.

Whether you are traveling by car cross country or simply strolling in the park with a walkman, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone narrated by Jim Dale, is one of the best ways to spend time with Harry and his friends. And Jim Dale is the perfect reader for this book as he makes life at the Durlseys and life at Hogwart's School come alive. It comes as no surprise that it isn't hard to imagine Hagrid or Mr. Dursley or even Hermnione uttering the words while listening to the tape. But what is hard to do is imagining that Jim Dale is able to capture their voices so well that its as if they are played by individual readers.While I don't ordinarily enjoy audiotapes, listening to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone made a convert out of me. While I think I will always prefer reading a book first, I really had a good time listening to this tape. But a word of advice from me, skip the movie and if you'ver already read the book, move on quickly to the audiotape of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets which I am currently listenig to and enjoying just as much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had absolutely no interest in this Harry Potter phenomenon until I got drawn by the movie trailers to go see the film.I felt the movie lived up the hype and after seeing it, I kept thinking of the characters and settings and had to relive it by reading the book that inspired it all.(I will also aknowledge that after reading the book, I feel the movie did an excellent job of capturing the story on film and stayed very faithful to the work)I don't feel that J.K.Rowling is a brilliant novelist and poet of words, however her ability to create such a wonderful and fun story is remarkable....and that it has become so widely accepted and encouraging to kids (and adults) is great. She does a fantastic job of taking realities that we know growing up with the awkwardness of childhood and the mythological legends that we have learned and combine them all into a fantastic story of whimsical adventure.The first book has a lot of exposition and sets the scene that will lend itself to the many adventures in the following books. It also stands on its own with a decent plot that is mostly underlying untilt he final few chapters. For me, the fun of this book was not the actual plot of the sorceror's stone; but rather discovering this magical world of Hogwarts alongside Harry. Harry as a character is not as fully developed as the people he meets, but I feel this allows you to take on his role and experience things through his eyes.The characters are wonderful and full of mystery. With names as simple as Ron and odd as Hermione(both Harry's best friends), the gentle giant Hagrid, silly stylings of Prof.Dumbledore, ghosts that simply roam the halls to greet you, and the 3-headed fluffy....you'll instantly get hooked.This book performs the greatest magic trick of all, whether you are a child or adult (like myself), you'll find yourself wishing you were back in school with the anxieties of final exams and extra curricular activities (with spells and quidditch of course!)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I never knew I could become so enthralled with an audio book.

As a twenty-nine year old reader, I thought I would grow tiresome of the whimsical adventures in magic, but instead found my heart racing, and my mind working out the mystery while even at work. As an adult looking through the eyes of I child I can definitely understand the love for a book so easy to read, yet so interesting and fun.

It is elegant (I refer to it as beutiful), has golden-glided pages, and is a magical experience everybody should read. Why waste so much money on a Collector's Edition? You might think, but it is worth it. Because you'll fully enjoy the HP experience, and if you don't like it, due to limited production, in a not-so-far future, you might sell it for a lot more than what you paid for.

JK Rowling manages to provide a thoroughly enjoyable story filled with wit, humor, and action. Even older readers, such as myself, will be surprised with the twists and turns the story takes. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an excellent first book into the 7 book series. While this book is an extraordinary novel, I can assure you they keep getting better. This is a book for all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has been around for a while now, but it is only recently that he has been elevated to a worldwide phenomenon. I can remember first hearing about these books when book three was about to come out. I remember seeing people line up to get it.I know how people can sometimes get freakish with children's books, and I know that typically it is women that fall into that category. Perhaps it is maternal instinct that causes women to latch onto this genre. Perhaps that is why I can make no sense of it.Back then I would have never thought I would be a fan of Harry Potter books. Their just kids' books, I would think, or at best young adult. But their not.I finally decided I was going to read the first book before the movie came out. I had bought the book for my girlfriend on a hunch that she would like it some time before that. It of course goes without saying that I ended up buying the rest for her as she plowed through each one in record time. She would talk about the books claiming each one just got better than the last, and she would strongly urge me to read them. I had to admit at that point that I was becoming more interested, and I did want to read the book before seeing the movie.Unfortunately, the movie came out before I got a chance to read the book, but that didn't stop me. It's the first time I've ever read a novel after seeing the movie it was based on, and surprisingly it didn't detract much from the experience.Harry Potter is about children. It's a story told in a manner making it suitable for children, but it is not a children's book. When I was a kid, I always felt insulted at the garbage thrown at me, always being dumbed down because I was a kid and wasn't expected to appreciate anything deep and meaningful or intelligently written. I suppose it is these experiences that held me back from reading these books. But this book is neither garbage or dumbed down for little people.J.K. Rowling writes a story about three kids and their first year at a prestigious british school. In many ways the story is as classic as it is unique. What sets the story apart is that this is no ordinary school and the kids are no ordinary kids. They are wizards and they take part in a world invisible to the rest of us muggles. The story itself is a very human one. All the wizarding and magic is interesting and fun, but the story would probably still work even if set in the normal world. The story isn't wonderful because Harry is a wizard or because there are trolls and magic in it. The story is wonderful because it really is a great story. Rowling does a fantastic job creating fascinating characters that you really want to keep reading about. She is amazing at keeping the story flowing and not getting bogged down in too much description yet still not leaving you confused. But what I am most impressed about is the plot. She is so masterful at the use of misdirection, that you simply will not guess the outcome (the movie is not a good example of this), yet you will be able to look back and it will all make sense.The best thing about this book (and probably why it is so popular) is that it literally appeals to everyone, as a good story should. We only dumb down children's books because we're stupid, not because kids are. In the same way Mark Twain was able to write contemporary stories about kids, reach a mass audience, and be hailed as a great author, J.K. Rowling does the same thing for a new generation. And just as Mark Twain's stories about some kids named Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer are as classic as they are timeless, so too are J.K. Rowling's stories about some kids named Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Harry Potter destined to be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For anyone that loves audiobooks and is interested in Harry Potter, I highly recommend this audiobook. As a teacher I read the book to see what was captivating my middle school students. It happened to be a captivating book with a wide selection of well developed characters. Now that the movie is out, take the opportunity to read the book, or listen to the audiobook. After my child read the book, I purchased the audiobook for a long trip we were taking. It was masterfully read, better than I imagined. We have now purchased each of the audiobooks after we've read each book.

I can't wait to read the rest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling has all the makings of a children's classic! It is original, surprising, and very imaginative. It gives you thrills and chills due to its exciting suspense, makes you laugh, and is very emotional at times as well.Harry Potter is an orphaned boy because the evil wizard Lord Voldemort murdered his parents. He is taken in by his aunt and uncle, who are muggles (ordinary, non-magical people). Harry's aunt and uncle hated Harry's parents, which is why they hate Harry. On the day that Harry's parents died, Voldemort tried to kill Harry as well, but was unsuccessful. The powerful curse that Voldemort used when trying to kill Harry reflected back on him, resulting in his becoming very weak. Harry is often abused and neglected by his aunt and uncle due to their hatred of him. On Harry's eleventh birthday, the years of abuse in Harry's life finally come to an end when Hagrid, the keeper of the keys and grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, takes Harry away from his aunt and uncle, and enrolls him at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Gradually, he makes new friends, most notably Ron and Hermione, learns to become a professional wizard, and finds out that one of his teachers is an ally of Voldemort! This ally decides to steal the philosopher's stone, an artifact that could make Lord Voldemort stronger. Harry and his friends try to find this ally and stop him from stealing the philosopher's stone.As I said earlier, the book has suspense, comedy, and is mildly emotional as well. It features lots of narrative hooks, which stop the reader from putting the book down. Most of the suspense comes from the main theme, which is stopping the evil ally from finding the philosopher's stone. The comedy in the story comes from Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival classmate. Harry and his friends often try to embarrass Malfoy, which gets hilarious at times. Ron is portrayed as a humorous character as well. His verbal fights with Hermione are very comical. The emotional parts come from Harry and his parents. Many times in the story, Rowling talks about Harry's feelings towards the loss of his parents, which makes readers feel sympathetic. The plot, characterization, imagination, and style of writing make the book absolutely mind-blowing. Children as well as adults will love this fantastic fantasy thriller.Who is the evil teacher at Hogwarts? Can Harry, Ron, and Hermione stop the teacher from sending the philosopher's stone to Voldemort? Does Voldemort die in the end, or is it Harry that dies? The answers to these questions lie in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a book that I thoroughly recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneImagine spending your entire life living under the stairs with a family who despises you and everything you do. Then, in a magical twist, you find yourself conducting absurd magical things. You find yourself surrounded by things only wizards are used to and ordinary day people are afraid of and have no idea what is going on. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard! This is exactly what happens to Harry Potter in the enchanting, mysterious novel by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.J.K. Rowling clearly depicts the literary device of characterization. Rowling's employment of characterization in this novel is her method in which she reveals the antagonist. In able to not spoil the mystery of finding out who actually tries to behold the sorcerer's stone, their identity will be kept silent. Rowling does an excellent job making two characters in one. She gives two personalities to a character, who until the last chapter is shy, calm, and not well liked by other characters. She is able to keep the identity of this certain character a well kept mystery for the reader to keep guessing throughout the entire novel.J. K. Rowling also demonstrates a well-used point of depicting the conflicts of man verses man, man verses society, and man verses self. She builds a character, Harry Potter, the protagonist, who struggles with each conflict stated. She also creates a resolution and gives excellent details and examples of showing so. She creates a round, dynamic hero within the first few chapters of the book.Rowling's success to employ characterization and conflict lead to a mystifying resolution. She explores a resolution of wonder and the curiosity of knowing and thinking of what this would be like if the society of today lived in almost like a fairy tale land like the characters in this story. She throws the reader into a world of witchcraft and wizards and makes the reader feel as if they have become part of the story.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone clearly depicts an extraordinary international phenomenon. This novel garners rage reviews and major awards and is truly one to read. It is a five star, two thumbs up book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a very entertaining, fun, lively and easy read. It is a fictitious story, but it gives children the opportunity to dream and be creative with their thinking. This book could be used with 6th grade and above. Parents and teachers could use this book to promote the study of Language Arts, History, Geography and Science."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unfortunately, I did not read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone until after I had seen the movie. I thought everyone was just fussing over nothing, but after the movie, I decided if the book was better than the movie (which is usually the case), I have to read this book! I am so glad that I did. Rowlings's imaginative tale is a real page turner. I stayed up all night to read the entire thing because I simply could not put it down even though I already knew what was going to happen. The plot moves just as quickly as the movie but with fantastic description and great character development as well. I believe children and teens can definitely relate to the idea of trying to figure out exactly who you are and dealing with the past while trying to plan for the future. I believe this coming-of-age series will become a classic!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is an orphan as the dark wizard killed his parent, His was sent to his Uncle&iexcl;s House, but was isolated in a cupboard under the staircase for his past eleven years. One upon a day after Harry growing up, a letter of Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to invite him to attend the school, this ignited the life of wizard of Harry.You will think it is a book with happiness and fantasy after seeing the film of &iexcl;the Sorcerer&iexcl;s Stone&iexcl;. Not only it can make you laugh, can also be a teaching material of primary children. It&iexcl;s not a book that only talks about mystery. Through others&iexcl; review of this book, I notice that there may be some Christians do not like this kind of books, which contain wizard and witchcraft. For me, a storybook that includes religious content is irrelevant to the one that has a particular religion. If we can separate out the actual side and virtual side of the book, or to treat the book as only a story, I ensure you could find the fun out of the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the book is Harry Potter and the philosopher&iexcl;s Stone. It is written by J. K. Rowling. The book cover is quite funny. The background is a castle and there is a three head snake inside. The time is evening. In the middle have a boy flying on a broomstick and have a red cape that who wear it can disappear. He is wearing glasses. I think the book is about a boy who is a wizard and have some relationship about the &iexcl;three head snake&iexcl;.It is a fantasy story. Harry potter is a famous wizard by he apparent defeat the vol-deh-more. And his parents were killed by it. And so he lives with his aunt home, but their family always cruel to Harry. After ten years Harry receive a mysterious letter. And a men call Hag rid tell him about his past and take him to Hog warts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

His name was so feared in the wizard world and no one to speak his name, and only say as &iexcl;You-Know &iexcl;VWho&iexcl;. Except Professor Dumbledore. This book is talk about the battle good and evil, and every single evil person in the book has a background with Voldemort.I like book because it is quite funny and fantastic. It is funny because the word is not very difficult and the description of the characters is quite clear and it is not boring. There have a lot of dialog and the plot compact. It is fantastic that the author have lots of imagination and merge with the traditional of English school to make the story.I think it is a book that suitable for each age people.

I absolutely, outright, verbally refused to read them despite the insistence of my closest friends and did so for a very long time.One very recent morning I felt tired of the little everyday hassles of life and wanted to spend a quiet day reading peacefully. At a friends house I found a copy of \\"... and the Chamber of Secrets,\\" which I finished that same evening. I was unable to put it down, literally laughing out loud at myself when I stood up to make some lunch and kept reading on the way to the kitchen!Since then, I have read all of the Potter adventures (including the lengthy \\"Goblet of Fire\\" in three evenings' time) and am seriously looking forward to the release of number five.These books are pure joy, suspense, happiness, fantasy, integrity, adventure and in a nutshell an entirely thought-out other world where there is something NEW around every corner. The characters actually have CHARACTER. There are SECRETS held over from \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" that we still haven't found out the answers for after four books! The writing is incredibly DETAILED, although certainly not overly so; every word of every description is given to you for a PURPOSE. It is really remarkable how these books have held my attention so blatantly.I urge you: even if you don't think or expect or hope to enjoy it, pick up \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" somewhere -- if you don't want to pay for it, then borrow it from a friend -- and read the first chapter. [It doesn't matter much which one to begin with but starting at \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" will keep everything in order in the long run.] I guarantee that you will complete all four books and add your name to the emailing list for Book Five notification faster than you will learn how to pronounce the name Hermione."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Jim Dale is the perfect choice for the Harry Potter series. With his many voices for each character and perfect timing he makes it a joy to listen to the story of the teenage wizard, Harry Potter. Many people think this book is simply for the children but rest assured this book works on so many levels that it could be considered a book for the masses. I'm sure you will enjoy the books as much as my family and I have."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've been hesitant for YEARS to read this novel, but I finally bought and read it. I must say that the author impresses me quite a bit. JK Rowling really knows how to write a good story. It kept me interested and turning the pages. I admire and respect Rowling as an author, even if I don't respect her as a person for her careless and irresponsible marketing strategies. Anyway, I highly recommend this novel for its literary value. And, it's fun, for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My husband, my child (age 7) and myself purchased cd #2 with the thought that we would listen to this book together... We all thoroughly enjoyed the reading by Jim Dale. We did discover that the best place to start this book is on a trip of at least 2-3 hours in length...as you truly don't want to stop listening to the story! We actually started to create trips so we could listen to the story! Mr. Dale is such a great story teller - that my son preferred to listen to Mr. Dale as opposed to myself or my husband doing the reading! Mr. Dale does marvelous voices and sounds!We have since listened to Books - 3 and 4 and are now purchasing book 1 on cd - as we are anxious to see what we might have missed(We saw the movie for book 1)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is great because it has so much suspence and will catch your attention so fast that you can not put the book down at all.

I am a high school freshman reading at the level of an honors senior, but the creativity expressed in this book is meant for young children up to nuclear physicists. So I finally decided to give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a shot...worst case scenario I would just put it down and move onto something else, if the bordem began to overwhelm me. The outcome was the exact opposite of what I expected. I couldn't put the book down! By the time I finished the first book, I was an addicted Harry Potter aficianado and I needed more. Within the next month I had read the other three book and I can't wait until the movie comes out.I guess this proves the accuracy of the cliche...don't judge a book by its cover. Just because it looks like it's meant for your younger sibling or even you child, doesn't mean it isn't worth reading. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing crossroad between the real-life trials and tribualtions of being a young boy and the wonderfully imaginative world of wizardry. Join Harry and the rest of the gang as they spend their first of what will be seven years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the many adventures they embark on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is a measure of this book's quality that, although I am an adult and therefore not the target audience, I still found this an entertaining read. There is an appeal here that transcends age; the major difference for an adult reader is that he or she will go through the book more quickly. In terms of plot and character, however, this book beats some of the recent &quot;adult&quot; books I have read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In most cases, five stars are given to fantasy and sci-fi books because the reader is unfamilar to this new world and is completely immersed into a world unknown to them, and they like it! Experienced fantasy readers are always looking with hungry eyes for another series that is completely new. Tolkien-being the father of fantasy-brought readers into a world of humor, remorse, frightening wizards, and adventure that sets the reader's heart to a new pace. Although many new &quot;original&quot; fantasy series have been wrought since then, none have strayed to far from Father Tree.But, Rowling has given a rather new perspective to fantasy. A look through magic and wizardary and witchary through the eyes of preteens. A wonderful and humor-filled look into the world of fantasy.There isn't much I can say that wouldn't give away this compelling story. I wasn't expecting much from J.K. Rowling, so I guess an average story would have blown me away; but she gives you a wonderful read, that most anyone can enjoy. I plan on reading the others, but not right yet. It was refreshing to get back to some fantasy.

J.K.Rowling is my second favorite author second to J.R.R.Tolkien. The only reason I gave this book only four stars is that J.K.Rowling uses some languege that I think is not necasary.

I finally caved in to the peer pressure (don't we all?) and bought the first book. It's a good book. Not great, just good. The story is fun, decently exciting, and captivating in its descriptions of wizardry and sorcery. However, it's just not that special. Read Dahl or Lewis. In my opinion, this series has caught on because the product has been hyped and marketed so well, which isn't all bad, considering its causing kids to read, as opposed to other commercialized fads like boy bands and other pop music garbage. I liked the book, but as an avid reader all my life, I can think of hundreds of books similar to the harry potter series (with its 'kid' content and 'adult' appeal) that are far superior. Middle schoolers who liked this book would love Ender's Game or Watership Down.

They are saying things like \\"this book has people drinking, and Hagrid is a drunk, what kind of an example is this setting for our childern?\\" Well as a kid i say YOUR STUPID PEOPLE. plus hagrid is NOT a drunk, he just drinks a little.for 1, there are much worse books then Harry Potter. ok lets start a list-Huck Fin-The Golden Compass Triligy (read this series!)-The Hobbit-The Tripod series-you can think of more...cant you? come on just think it over...And all of these books are read by kids. most are in school libarys.Most TV is worse then the Harry potter books. Same with movies- movies and TV have sex, and sex related meteral. Now i'm defently not saying that TV and movies are bad, im just stating a point, Harry Potter is not a bad book, and in my opinon, people that think harry potter is a bad influence on kids are wack, there phycho, there crazy, and they should give there kids a CHANCE with the booksPLEASE e-mail me and tell me your opionin of my review...or just Dis me or my view on this \\"Debate\\" hope this review was helpful to you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The storyline is pretty good. I do like the idea of a boy who knows nothing of what he is to become and how he will affect many people's lives just by living. But that has been overplayed too much.

No, I don't beleive that Harry is Satan, but I do beleive that this book is average and there should not be a big hype over it.I did like the ending. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to use everything that they had learned to face VOLDAMORT! VOLDAMORT! VOLDAMART!

Finally, I held the book in my hands and read until my eyes were sore.

I highly recommend it for those with vivid imaginations!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My daughter, a teacher and mother of my first grandchild, encouraged me to read the Harry Potter series so when the youngster is of the reading-to age, I would be prepared. To that end, she gave me the entire set. Beginning at the beginning, I opened the Sorcerer's Stone and became hooked. This is great stuff, and as a senior citizen I highly recommend it for the ubiquitous children \\"of all ages.\\" I can see why it takes Ms. Rowling so long to write one of these adventures: It must take months to come up with all the delightful names of people and objects and to create the wizardry world of Hogwarts (see what I mean about names!), plus the traditions and games and history of this other world. And yes, even though it is fantasy, I predict you will be caught up in the spells she weaves. This is a book of mini-adventures, which - except for the principal mystery - conclude within a few fast-moving pages. I believe this is an important factor to keep children interested. There is suspense and some scary stuff, but most of it is over in a paragraph or two. And there's humor that kids will laugh out loud at. This is a book that is populated with great characters that children can identify with. They range from Harry, the put-upon orphan who becomes a hero, to Hermione the bookish girl who earns her place among the boys, to Neville the diminutive lad who just naturally lags behind as he is constantly looking for his lost toad. There's even Hagrid, a gentle, and not too smart, giant. If you've got a child about nine who won't be motivated to read, I suggest you just leave a couple of these Potter books lying around without comment. Chances are good that the child might just pick one up, after all Harry is totally awesome among the young set. Once reaching the second page, the child will forget about the fact he/she \\"hates to read.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I ordered this book to complete my set of Harry Potter books.

Watching the movies, and the books have been a Thottam family past time (filled with discussions on insider trading tips on what we think each new will bring and what sec rets the future holds for Harry. This was the first installment in the Harry Potter Saga and is truly a winner with suspense, sadness and adventure all rolled into one (something you would expect no less from Rowlings imaginative brain). Coming from corporate America (such firms as Morgan Stanley, IndyMac Bank and Homestore), I, Jameson Thottam, have found the series a nice respite from the day to day work life and a return to child like wonders for this Thottam family child at heart.

Once I started however, I could see why people had become so enthralled with Miss Rowling's work. Harry Potter has a sort of Sword in the Stone feel (young nobody prophesied for greatness), but more intricate and a lot more fun! Rowling is inventive and witty, and those qualities are manifest in her writing.But...the later books are better. The Sorcerer's Stone (why isn't it called the Philosopher's Stone as Rowling's web site lists it?) concludes in a Scooby-Doo sort of way (I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for those darned kids!) that felt a bit hokey. Don't get me wrong, this book is very good...it's just that the rest of the series casts a shadow that the first (and actually, the second) book cannot quite escape.Long story short, this book is good in and of itself, but is really an introduction to a much larger and enthralling plot--sort of like the Hobbit in comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.For older readers: Don't let cynicism keep you from reading this series! It's a genuine classic, right up there with Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, the Little House series, and Beverly Cleary's Ramona Quimby books!A last note: Although I know it's a bit sappy, I'd like to congratulate Rowling on creating a series that excites young people to read! In the age of instantaneous digital gratification, sensations like the Harry Potter series are all the more welcome!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was one that I had avoided forever because I didn't want to go along with the hype.

It definitely was a fast read but kept pace with interesting characters and plot developments. I recommend it to all &quot;stubborn readers&quot; as I once was.

I've never been quite so entertained by children's literature as I was with Harry Potter, although the question of how childlike the novel really is, remains a mystery to me.The first novel in a series of four, The Sorcerer's Stone concentrates mainly on Harry's transition from ordinary life with muggles to the extraordinary life that he lives in the magical world. Unknown to Harry, he is a herioc and mysterious entity from his birth. Harry, after long and painful years in the muggle world, is finally told that he is a key figure in a great magical victory, and he must go to Hogwarts Academy to receive proper training. On his way to the wizarding school, Harry meets his future best friends, Ron and Hermione, with whom Harry shares many a great adventures at Hogwarts.The magical adventures of Harry Potter keep the reader's attention throughout, and there is never a dull moment following the journies of the young and inexperienced Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Don't think this book is just for kids--I'm 35 and LOVE it!

I think the first chapter starts a little slowly, but as soon as you meet the almost-11-year-old Harry, you fall in love with him and won't be able to put the book down. But the best part about this book is that it's one everyone in your family can enjoy and share--my 65-year-old father and 12-year-old nephew and I finally have a common interest to talk about!

K. Rawling, a clear plot, theme, setting, and characters are presented to the reader. The theme, good verses evil, and the plot, Harry's quest to become a wizard and the obstacles he overcomes, play an important role all throughout the novel. The main characters are described vividly, and the reader&#65533;s attention is kept through amazing attention to detail, and Rawling&#65533;s ability to keep the story flowing.Throughout the novel, the well-developed theme of good verses evil arises several times. When Harry moves in with the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, after his parents are killed by Voldermort, he is forced to live in a tiny cabinet and is not allowed to do anything fun. He is rarely fed and is constantly scolded. Eventually, however, he overcomes the Dursleys wrath by escaping with Hagrid, the gatekeeper at Hogwarts....The plot of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone is a fictional one....All during this plot, however, Harry is trying to learn how to become a wizard, and he faces many other obstacles. From fighting with Malfoy, his arched nemesis and one of the main antagonists, to arguing with Professor Snape, a believed to be enemy of Harry&#65533;s family, Harry&#65533;s schooling is not easy. When it just so happens that he discovers of the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone, the plot gets interesting and the main conflict reaches its peak.Most of the characters in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone are stock characters (Harry, Harry&#65533;s family, Harry&#65533;s friends, etc.). Stock characters are stereotyped figures who have occurred so often in fiction that their nature is immediately known. However, some characters like Hagrid and Voldermort, are more round. That is, they can be described with many traits and are not so common to us. The protagonist of the novel is Harry Potter, and the main antagonists, fighting against the protagonist, are Voldermort, Professor Quirrel, and Malfoy. However, through all of the characters, the story unfolds. Rawling carefully uses each character in each scene and as a result, the plot and the theme develop nicely.Overall, this novel was very good. Rawling did a great job in keeping the story flowing. There is hardly a dull moment. The plot and the theme are very clear and the characters are plausible. Rawling also pays great attention to detail, which is essential to a good story. When she described the way the food looks before a meal, my mouth watered. If you want a good series of books to read, this is the one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved the book, specially when you compare Harry's muggle life to his new magic life.

Wish there was more"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book about 11-year-old wizard who lives in a world only controlled by muggles (people), or so he thinks. On his eleventh birthday he is told that he isn't a muggle like most everyone but a famous wizard who survives the wrath of a powerful dark wizard. He leaves his awful muggle home to study witchcraft and wizardry and finds many troubles along the way. Harry learns how to operate a broom, make things levitate with his wand, and many other things he never thought possible. He meets true friends and awful enemies as well. It seems as though wizard school is going to be easy, until he stumbles upon the powerful secrets of the sorcerer's stone. One teacher is bound to use it to rejuvenate the power of the dark wizard who plotted to destroy Harry ten years ago, but not if Harry could help it.I really liked this book it makes you wonder what will happen next so you would want to continue reading. The characters in this book all have different characteristics unlike some books that only have only two different kinds, good and bad. It also contained some humor. Harry's friend Ron had a rat that is almost always sleeps. As Ron said during their ride to Hogwarts Ron tells him, \\"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference.\\" Ron was right, after his rat fought a battle against a bully Ron thought he was knocked out, but no, he was only sleeping.J.K Rowling, the author created a great fantasy world with a ton of myths and faerie tale characters we've all heard of before. This first book also has a large amount of characters, each with their own distinct characteristics. Hagrid, a man much like a giant talks on his own unique tone. Like the time when Harry suspected his meanest teacher for attempting to kill him Hagrid tells him, \\"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong! I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try to kill a student.\\" Hagrid's personality was frank and kind, and as it turns out the teacher Harry had never expected to have anything to do with evil was trying to kill him under the orders of the Dark Wizard who had tried to Harry.My favorite part in this book is when Harry plays Quidditch (a game a lot like basketball on brooms) for the first time. It was his team versus his enemy's team. It was a long match and Harry is nearly killed by one of the Dark Wizard's servants when he chanted a dark spell on his broom. Luckily he is saved by one of his friends who broke his the teacher's eye contact. Just when it seems the enemy team's going to win, Harry catches the golden snitch, which gives his team a hundred fifty points and ends the game. I liked that part best because the author's description of Quidditch makes it look like a really fun game, and it was cool how Harry nearly escapes death from the dark spell cast on him."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In an ordinary world, people long for excitement. Many people love to imagine, and \\"Harry Potter\\" is your #1 passport to a world of imagination! Are you tired of reality? This is exactly what happened to the book's main character. The story concerns Harry, a strange, orphaned, young boy, who is tormented by everyone, especially his way-too-normal aunt, uncle, and spoiled brat cousin, Dudely Dursley. But strange things occur, and Harry experiences somethings that never happened before. He's even found out about his secret past, that he is actually the son of two, famous wizards, and that he's going to a special school for wizards in a secret, magical world!Though his cruel aunt and uncle are shocked by this, the friendly giant Hagrid convices Harry to come to the magical boarding school, known as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft a Wizardry. Now, nothing is the same! While he's too young to be in, Harry unexpectedly is selected to play for a team on a magical game. He evens meets new friends, such as the clumsy, yet lovable Ron Weasly, and he even meets new enemies, especially the spoiled, arrogant, and stupid Draco Malfoy. But can he protect the the mysterious Sorcerer's Stone from a mysterious enemey?People are either reading a lot, reading less, or not reading at all. But with this book, what will happen next? If you probably offered a child how reads less, who knows? He might even start reading for many hours each day! What's so special about \\"Harry Potter\\"? The answer is simple. Adventure, action, and excitement. J.K. Rowling has taken mythical creatures, beings, and other magical stuff, then blended them all into one, fasinating story!

There are so many different moods that are created within the story- humor, scary, happy, shocking, the list goes on and on. They are unlike any other books. Most people think that these books are for little kids and are an easy read. That's not even 1/8 true. The great thing about the books is that JK Rowling writes simply, without too much big vocabulary that a 7th grader shouldn't know- or an advanced 5th grader. But thats where everyone thinks that the books are for kids- but they are NOT! Her writing is simple, but her plots are not. They twist, weave, tangle- and are great. At the moment you think Harry is safe he opens a screaming book and attracts attention to himself. The moment you think Malfoy is about to get cursed, Hermione makes it to him first and smacks him across the face. The moment you fear Harry isn't going to make it, a wonderful something happens, and everything turns out alright."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing how good Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was by J.K Rowling, I began to read this novel.

Voldemont still tries to kill Harry but harry is always more powerful.Like I said Icould never put the book down my mom needed a crow bar just for me to let go of the novel.

While on their quest they learn that together they can accomplish the task at hand. I enjoyed this lengthy tale of Harry Potter. This book kept me on theedge of my seat. I would recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Admittedly, I don't remember ever hearing of Harry Potter before the summer of 2000, when there was all of the buzz about how well the fourth book sold. I was in college and not even remotely interested in reading some children's book. Reading the adventures of some kid that lived in a different type of reality just didn't seem even remotely entertaining. I was one of those people that hated all of the Harry Potter books, without ever having read them.In November 2001, a friend repeatedly asked me to go see the \\"Harry Potter movie\\" with her. After complaining quite a bit about how the theater would be filled with just a bunch of whining little kids, I finally gave in-very reluctantly. My friend then insisted that I read the book beforehand. With a little resistance, I gave in yet again, picking up the first book a few days later. Working at a small shop, I had intended to read it on work breaks and between waiting on customers, but it wasn't long before I began to fall behind in my work, because I was engrossed in this novel. I, eventually, had to force myself to put it away to get my work done. As soon as I arrived home that evening, I pulled the book back out and read until late into the night, when I finally completed the book. Before the week was out, I had read the next three books and was anxiously waiting for the release of the fifth book in the Harry Potter series.I had mistakenly believed that since Harry, Hermione, and Ron were only eleven years old, they couldn't possibly peak the interest of a 19-year-old young woman, but the characters and themes dealt with in this book are not specific to any one certain category or age group. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is perfect for anyone who has ever felt alone and unloved or anyone who has wanted to be something more than they think they are. It's also wonderful for people who have always followed in the shadow of a talented friend or family member or for anyone who has been picked on for being too smart or too slow to learn. The characters in J.K. Rowling's series deal with all of the same problems that just about all of us have had to deal with at one point or another.When the book begins, the completely normal Dursleys are having a completely normal day, as everything around them is utterly not normal. There are odd people running around in cloaks, owls flying through the daylight sky of city streets, and shooting stars seen all over the country. That night, as the Dursleys sleep, Mrs. Dursley's nephew is left upon their doorstep. Nothing in their lives will ever be the same again, as they do everything in their power to convince this child that there is nothing special about him and that he is completely \\"normal.\\"Young Harry Potter grows up living in a cupboard under the stairs of his aunt and uncle's house, wearing hand-me-down clothes that are much too big for his thin, frail frame, and believing that his parents were killed in the same car accident which left him with a jagged lightening-boltlike scar on his forehead. His slightly older, portly cousin antagonizes him mercilessly as Harry just tries to survive growing up, so he can leave the Dursleys' home.As Harry's eleventh birthday draws near, he begins to receive letters in the mail-then letters delivered by owls-all of which his Uncle Vernon tries his best to destroy. These events, combining with a few odd occurrences which occurred when he had been angry or afraid, begin to let Harry Potter know that no matter what he has always been told, he is anything but normal.Perhaps the best thing that could ever happen to young Harry takes place when he learns that for the past ten years, his aunt and uncle have been hiding the fact that Harry is a wizard, and he is sent away to school to learn to properly use and enhance his magical powers. The book continues, constantly drawing the reader into a world filled with familiar types of people, with just enough of a magical twist to make the reading very entertaining without being difficult to understand.Please, if you have never read any books in the Harry Potter series, read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The entire series has been written so well, it is hard to believe it to be a work of fiction. This is one set of books you will want to read over and over again. J.K. Rowling, undoubtedly, has a gift-one that I'm sure you will appreciate as you read this astounding novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must admit, I did not pick up this book voluntarily. My daughter urged me and urged me to read this book. I kept putting her off, thinking it was just another kids' book.I was wrong. While the reading level may not be the same something written by someone like Clancy, this is a very well written book. The characters are very well developed and the sceens very vividly displayed.I am not typically a reader of science fiction/fantacy, however this book is not a typical book. It is a very well crafted story about the student at a boarding school. It could have been very easily written set a a modern day boarding school with soccor as the main sport. It is about learning, growing up and relationships, with those in the present and those in Harry's past.Harry is the very unlikely hero, who with the help of his friends, reveal the Sorcerer's Stone, and prevent a disaster, had the stone fallen into the wrong hands.My mother (age 70+) was recently in the hospital, and I gave her a copy of this to read while she was a patient. My daugher, who is now 11 loves this book, and I very much enjoyed it. It is truely a family novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first read this book in fourth grade and right from the start I was drawn into it. The plot is well written and imaginative and the characters are humerous and delightful. When the book ended I was reluctant to put it down.

In some ways the Animorph series is more imaginative and reflective of real feelings than this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After all these weeks on the bestseller lists, I finally decided to pick up my brother's copy of HP&amp;tSS and see what all the fuss was about. I didn't really go into it expecting a whole lot, and I didn't get it.Sure, this book is cute enough, with some likable interesting characters, and a few fun and zany ideas, but it was really nothing spectacular. Harry himself -- famous of no fault of his own, he does everything right, despite his lack of experience, seemingly by accident. This book has a lot of very stereotypical kids, and a lot of evil, Roald Dahl style grownups.This book wasn't bad, and is pretty entertaining and a quick read, but I have read many other, much better young readers books, including Thief of Always by Clive Barker, Neverending Story by Michael Ende, John Bellairs' House with a Clock in its Wall cycle, and Susan Coopers' Dark is Rising cycle, not to mention the classic Lion, Witch and Wardrobe series.This book was an okay example of YA literature, but it's nothing spectacular. There's plenty of much better fare out there, but there's also plenty worse."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! AT FIRST WHEN I SAW IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BORING TO READ. BUT AS I STARTED READING IT I BECAME ENDORSED IN IT, LOVING EVERY WORD. I'M 14 AND I THOUGH IT WAS GREAT! MY AUNT EVEN LOVES IT! (SHE'S THE ONE WHO SENT ME THE BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE!). BOOK #2 AND 3 ARE EVEN BETTER COMPARED TO THIS ONE! I'VE SEEN SO MANY ADULTS WITH THIS BOOK, AND WHEN I ASK THEM THEY SAY THEY LOVE IT! J.K.

It was, indeed, a fun book, but honestly, I can't see what all the frenzy and hooplah are about. It didn't leave me craving the second story in this series, and if I happen to see it at a yard sale or bargain store, I may pick it up ... having said all this, though, I really dislike the fantasy genre, and perhaps if I didn't, I'd find this series more engaging than I did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd have given 5-stars to this book 4-5 years back, when i first read it. This was the first fantasy book, I had read in my life and at that time this was my most fav book until LoTR came and everything changed. But still this book remains one of my top-ten. I'll not start-up with the story because now Harry Potter doesn't need any Intro. People, worldwide, knows him either through books or movies.But I'd like to say to those who have seen the movie and not read the book that you have to read this book because though many says that this first part is a bit childish as compare to the later ones, I'd say this book is the best of the series.Everything in this book is at par than the other books. The Humor, Horror, Thrill, Suspense, Adventure, everything.So, I'd suggest you to read this book, If you are interested in watching HP movies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this book is cool because It tells about a boy who goes to hogwarts and learns to use magic and basically I think the Books is alot better than the Movie because the Movie sucked! and I think the books are better because watching the movies are boring!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has always been a series I could enjoy, in the past week alone I have re-read all 5 books and watched the 3 movies over again while waiting for the sixth book.I first read The Sorcerer's Stone in 1997, shortly after it was released, I had just turned 11 myself (I'm 18 now.) so, as you can imagine, I was able to enjoy the books with a mindset of the main characters. It was one of the few books I enjoyed at that age, and even at this age it remains one of the few I enjoy. I have an odd taste in books, I heavily enjoy fantasy literature, but not such that is set in the past, such as the medieval times. Due to the fact that a great number of \\"true\\" literature about fantasy themes is based in such times, I have a hard time finding books I like to read. Science-Fiction I typically find a bit stretched- and I cannot stand children's books. (In short, the above paragraph basically means I enjoy mainly books about fantasy, but those in modern times, that aren't Science-Fiction, and that aren't based solely around a children's mindset. So basically nothing, really. Picky, I am.)So why did I enjoy Harry Potter so much? That's just the thing. It's good old fantasy- magic, dragons and the like. But it's based in modern times, times we can relate to, in a way. It's not phony in the sense that you won't read something and mutter \\"This is just plain stupid.\\" due to a lack of cohesion. Everything melds perfectly. All my life I have been a big fan of RPGs (Role-Playing Games.) for gaming systems. (Nothing like D&D;, however.) So the fact that these wizards and witches had to train in school to obtain their powers really struck me as a good point. They don't have all their strength yet, and each excels at something else.Now, before this turns into an autobiography of my likes/dislikes, let's talk about the book and why I enjoy it. (Yes yes, me me me. But hey, I've been wanting to write this review for years now.)First off, as you undoubtedly know, with the 5,000+ reviews on this book, Harry Potter is a newfound wizard. A poor, abused boy living with his Aunt and Uncle for 10 long years is suddenly informed that he is a wizard. He can't believe it himself- magic and whatnot was always regarded as nonsense (And got Harry into quite a bit of trouble at the mere mention of anything working out of the ordinary.) as in the real world. Awestruck, Harry sets out to Diagon Alley (Here's how dense I am, just last week did I realize this was simply \\"Diagonally\\" split into two with an \\"e\\" tossed in. I laughed at my own ignorance.) to purchase supplies for his new school. He's treated to the fact that his parents left behind a small fortune for him, so he'd always be able to get what he needed, but not so much as that he could simply waste it all before finishing school.Shortly thereafter, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches alike, Harry realizes he's incredibly famous in this world, and for something he can't even remember, being attacked --but surviving-- as a mere infant. But Harry's fame and survival of a curse that he was the only to ever live does not mean he's invincible. Harry is still just an 11-year old child with powers he cannot yet comprehend fully. Only by the protection of his friends and teachers can he hope to strive and overcome the many challenges that face him.This is by no means a children's only book, as you may have already read. Don't be stubborn if that's your only reason, in fact- I don't really think there is a good reason to not read this book, no matter what your tastes, you may enjoy it immensely. Sure, the book is \\"made\\" to capture the eyes of children, but it is written assuming that the reader is intelligent, has a wide vocabular and enjoys the sense of fantasy and adventure. Nothing is \\"toned down,\\" in any of the books, there is no censor here. If someone gets cut, they bleed, if they fall from a great height, they break bones, and in some cases, if they're taken beyond their limits, they will die.If you're going to start anywhere with the books, you definitely need to begin with this, the first. All the books are fairly directly related and you will not understand a later book very well if you haven't read previous installments.However, I still don't believe I have explained enough, as I said, I've been waiting to write this review for nearly 8 years, so I think I'll add a bit more. What exactly made an 11-year old boy read a 309-page book a single afternoon that long ago?Well, aside from what I've already written, the book also has a great emphasis on many other things. Acceptance of death, which is not exclusive to the first book. Nextly, reliance on friends. A bit of a cliche department in most cases, but Harry's friends feel more real than a lot of other authors may describe a person. They don't always have the right solution, they don't always get along, but they are always there for Harry, and he for them. You will yield a great deal of respect for the trio the further you read.There is also the aura of deception the book presents, one thing isn't always what you may think, and not everyone is as they may appear, which for children will re-enforce the theory of not judging a book by it's cover, and for adults, provide the element of surprise and cunning of writing prowess by Rowling. The sense of desire also comes into play, when Harry finds a certain mirror... But then also comes the heavy sense of reality, presented by Dumbledore, who speaks wisely that one should not always rely on wild dreams to become something great, and that desire is not always of the possible outcome. For some things, the reader will come to realize, there simply isn't a magical solution-- even in the world of magic.Perhaps you thought I was done? Not a chance!Now I shall explain the entire series, no- not the series itself, but a general outline of the Harry Potter line. The world is not stationary in these books, it's constantly evolving and presenting new challenges or threats. Likewise with the characters, Harry won't be a naive child forever, nor will he always enjoy his stays at Hogwarts. He and his friends, as mentioned before, won't always get along, but some bonds just can't be broken. Harry and his pals make new enemies and friends, and mayhaps lose some as well. Not everything is always as it seems. Relationships will develop and change, flowing like real time, in what seems like something the reader will never want to end, especially as they near the ends of the books, which while often satisfying, is never too enjoyable due to the fact that you know you'll be hungry for more.There's a lot of secrets in Harry's world, his own life begins to become shrouded in them, and he finds himself maturing and experience things he may not have wanted to so quickly, but again- he can't change everything with magic, and sometimes you simply have to accept reality. The books themselves often reflect upon their own world through Harry's eyes. To quote the fifth book... \\"It was impossible to think there were still people in the world laughing, eating, and worrying about nothing more than homework...\\"As you may imagine, the series continues to get more intense, and the fifth book in particular has an absolutely incredible finale that will make you realize just how invincible Harry is not.Here's waiting for the sixth book, this eager fan won't be happy until he has read all seven. Regardless of who you are or what you enjoy, don't strive off the phobia of popularity, these books are so extraordinarily popular for a reason, give in, just pick one up from the library and read. I can guarantee at the least, that you'll have nothing to lose, except perhaps a few hours lost in the wonderful world of Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books! It offers excitement,and unbelievable deail. There is no reason why anyone shouldn't read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is OK, but it's not as good as Brian Jaques Redwall series. J.K. Rowling's books are not like those &quot;book's you can read over again.&quot; You read it once, and think it's good. But you can never read it a second time, it gets too boring. Believe me, I tried. I read all three books, and I don't think you should buy it. Try checking it out at the library first. If you like it, and think you can read it again, then buy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Don't get me wrong: Rowling knows how to weave an imaginative story, but imaginative does not always mean clever, and clever goes hand-in-hand with delicious restraint. Her tale of Harry Potter (all four of her tales, to be sure)must be commended for the ability to grip the attention of child-readers and inspire such a literary phenomenon. If kids are devouring these books like video games, all praise to Rowling and her publisher. Personally, I think her characters are wooden, her descriptive powers are mediocre, her plot is amateurish and her gratuitous use of magic lessens the effect of the book. TOO MUCH magic makes the magic run-of-the mill, and when magic is run-of-the mill in any child's fantasy tale, the Wonder Factor plunges. All in all, a great book for kids aged 12 or so, but pretty amateurish for the adult fan of the genre.I see nothing that makes a book classic here, but realize a great many folks would disagree. Rowling DOES have great potential, though, and I'm glad to see she's reaping the rewards of getting kids to read! I'll read her subsequent books and see what she's up to."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This the kind of book adults and children both will enjoy!

These were CHILDRENS books! The CD's were shoved into a drawer and forgotten until the summer holidays rolled round and intense boredom led me to dig them out and give them a shot. The little time I took off from listening to them I spent kicking myself for not having done so earlier. J.K Rowling demonstrates a delightful sense of humour, excellent comic timing and great skill with plot and pacing not to mention superb taste in her choice of a narrator for the series. I don't know who deserves more praise for my addiction to Harry - J.K Rowling or Jim Dale! Mr. Dale brings the characters to life in a way that is quite impossible to describe. I'm not sure whether to go and see the movie simply because the voices in the movie will not be Jim Dale's. My rating is 4 stars not because of a deficiency in the book but because compared to the others in the series, the Sorceror's Stone is a little too cosy, a little too neat. On it's own however, it's a very well written book and the only one in the series that I would want any under-10 child of mine to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the greatest book I've read in a long time. Before I read this book, I didn't even know who Harry Potter was. Even this book is a fantasy, I still sounds real to me every time I read it. The plot of the book is decent, how a boy named Harry finds how he has magical powers. When he finds out who killed his parents, a evil warlock sets out to kill him. This book is not like any other book. If you want to read a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've always hated fads and crazes, and had an almost subconsious notion that the Harry Potter series was nothing more than an overly popular children's story following in the wake of Tickle-me-Elmo and Razor Scooters. So it was with reluctance that I picked up &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; and with skepticism that I glanced through the first few pages. The shame in reading a &quot;children's book&quot; and the doubt that I could actually enjoy it had passed by the end of the first chapter, and if I had no need to work or sleep I wouldn't have stopped reading until I had closed the cover on the series' fourth book. The shocking truth is that Harry Potter is NOT a children's book; neither is it an &quot;adult book.&quot; Rather, this is a story. As such, anyone who enjoys good stories should find this tale irresistable. With an open imagination and a comfortable chair, a reader could easily get lost in the magical world of Harry Potter for as long as the series lasts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read! It is engaging from the first page. I purchased the book the weekend the fourth book was released out of curiousity. I had to find out what all the fuss was about. This book certainly lived up to its reputation. The characters are round, engaging, and fascinating. I finished this book in one sitting in the car at the beginning of a trip to a secluded bed and breakfast. It was so wonderful, I searched the Carolina coast the next day for four hours, hitting every bookstore in every town to find the next books! I am a fourth grade teacher and I plan to share these books with the children in my class.

Harry is a sensitive child with unknown powers living with muggles (thats what normal humans are called by magic folk) called the Dursleys. The plot of the entire book revolves around Harry and his first year at the wizard school Hogwarts. The other important characters in the book are his friends ron and Hermione , Hagrid (a delightful character), Albus Dumbledore the headmaster and the evil Voldemort. The book revels in gleeful imagination from the description of Quidditch ( the favorite sport among the magic folk) to the Howarts Castle that contains beings such as Peeves the poltergeist and nearly headless nick.J.k Rowling has managed to capture the very essence of an adolescent's imagination in the book and his insecurities. Its a powerful book and is in no way cutesy or overly syrupy. Comparing it with Tolkien might be a little too far fetched but Harry Potter is a classic in his own way and a must read for all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I saw quite a nasty review for the Harry Potter series and so this is for all of you who have yet to read these delightful books by J.K. Rowling;may you not be led astray by someone who obviously has no idea of what he or she is critizing. Ms. Rowling knows how to tell a story and making sure you are completely absorbed in her world seems to be her foremost concern. Her language is simple but her description is vivid. No verbosity here,only well-crafted prose. Hardly a challenge for anyone over the age of ten,these books do not leave anyone [including brainy know-it-alls like myself ;) ] with that strange,&quot;used&quot; feeling one might get after reading one of those horrible,wooden Dick and Jane type novellas. The characters have been &quot;fleshed-out&quot; by Rowling to the extent thet one might wonder if they were not possibly real. Still, each entity in the books has his/her/its own mystery. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stands as a personal favorite by many because in it, we meet Harry for the first time. Also, on a personal note, the first time I read this particular book I was drawn into a world I had left many years ago. That world in which everyone had a peculiar set of wings,where the mountains bowed low to the dancing stars, and where Happiness was the name of my pet lion(he's really cute,with large,floppy ears). Only one thing remains to be said in this review:God. Where is He in Harry Potter's world? Where is He in our world? The answer to both questions:Everywhere. Only in both places,real and imaginary, the people tend not to have theological discussions with one another about His existence and His wonders. J.K. Rowling could have easily opted to use a word like &quot;Oompa-loompas&quot; in place of wizards and thus avoided all this hearsay and hubbub over immorality and book-baning. Or maybe not, every genius has at one time been accused of being a crock,a loony, or of being in league with the devil. It comes with the territory, I suppose. People always find a reason to dislike a successful person. Read the book and if you are offended,put it down,but by all means if you love it,enjoy and keep reading.

From the cruel Privet Drive, to the enchanted Hogwarts, it felt like a parallell world. The book is also funny, not because J.K. Rowling is the greatest comedian, but because the characters are so lifelike, and their particular antics and strange behaviors, we can relate to. When Harry's living with the Dursleys, it's very hilarious, because of the Dursleys' pure paranoia of the magic world, and atrocious living conditions for Harry. All the descriptions are so clear, like Uncle Vernon's huge face that can go from red to green faster than a traffic light.I won't give the story away, for all of you who are strangely wondering if you're gonna read this or not. The story starts as an prologue. explaining why Harry's lives with spiders in the cupboard with the horrible Dursleys. When Harry is 10, letters start coming, saying that he's accepted to Hogwarts, a school for wizards. So then his adventures begin. That's all I'm going to say.The wonderful thing about Harry Potter is about its vivid characters. You'll really trust Albus Dumbledore, and if he was actually a real person, and you'll detest Malfoy and Snape, who'll do anything to make Harry miserable. J.K Rowling has done a great, near impossible thing. She made kids want to read, not because their parents force them to. Kids don't care if traditionally, reading is not the coolest pasttime, they just want to read Harry Potter.Sometimes, I don't like Ms. Rowling. You know why? Because she made me completely dependent on Harry Potter! I don't know what I'll do when the series ends. Lots of times, I feel jealous of Harry, even though his world can never be true, the books describe it so well, that it feels real. This great book launched the magical series, that should go down in history as the best children's book series of all time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, i just finished the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book.I find it interesting that, among all of the honours it's won, listed on the back cover, there is no mention of the Newbery Medal or Newbery Honorable Mention status -- they ARE still awarding the Newbery for outstanding children's/YA fiction, aren't they?I was a bit worried at first, actually holding the book in my hand and reading the blurbs, to find it compared by more than one blurb to the children's books of Roald Dahl (e.g., &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; or &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;).I happens that i abhominate the children's books of Roald Dahl.And, at first, it looked as if the blurbs were right -- it was just as twee and arch and coy as Dahl and came across as just as aware of its own cleverness. ((In Dahl's case this reads like a smarmy condecension to the Dear Little Kiddies' Limited Comprehension; in the case of this book it seemed like a First-Time Author trying to be Clever because That's What Kiddies Like...))And the opening pages, in which she demonstrated her arch inventiveness with such strokes as &quot;Muggles&quot; to mean non-magician humans, and described Harry's home life with his uncle and aunt and cousin in such over-the-top whimsical terms that i almost got seasick reading them, almost put me off the book entirely.But i persevered and finally got to Chapter Four, in which Harry finds out just who and what he is and his dead parents were and receives his invitation to attend Hogwarts School, the premier school of magic in the World. From there on it's a pretty straightforward Term story, except that the main subject at THIS school is Magic. Harry makes friends, makes enemies, becomes a star on his House's Quidditch team and deduces that one of the Masters is Up To No Good and Must Be Thwarted.I sort of wonder if the author didn't experience the Mimieux Effect -- i read that when George Pal began filming &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, Yvette Mimieux was ((actually)) slightly underage and had never acted in movies before. By the time they finished making the film, they had to go back and reshoot several of her early scenes, because she'd learnt so much about acting in the course of the shoot -- since i understand she is a young single mother who began writing this on scraps of paper in London(?) coffeehouses.However, Harry and his friends are fun in the Term sequences, and the quest he and two others undertake is sufficiently interesting that it carried me straight along to the end and left me deciding i WILL read the next one -- even if the quest's working-out DID remind me of quest-fantasy computer game...For those who have read the books of DIana Wynne Jones -- particularly the &quot;Chrestomanci&quot; books, which have similar themes to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, the comparison between Jones and Rowling is natural; i would definitely recommend Jones's books to anyone who has enjoyed the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; volumes.A point of irritation is that the American publisher apparently feels that those of us in the USA are not sufficiently intelligent or well-educated to understand some things, and has made changes in the text for the US edition -- up to and including changing the title; the &quot;real&quot; title is &quot;...and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;. I strongly suspect that there have been changes in the text as well in this book and in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;... i haven't read the other two to check yet."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i have to admit this is the best book in the world.im from england, and really just wondering why on earth the title is different in america. have they changed the philosophers stone to the sorcerers stone all the way through the book? other than that, read it - its ace."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Its awsome i read it last year and its like my favorite book of all time its the only harry potter i have read and i reccomend it to everyone its a book everyone can enjoy.Its down right pure goodness and its a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was quite entertaining and definitely held my interest, enough to prompt me to read its two sequals and eagerly await the third.Rowling has quite the imagination and has a way with names; however, I did get confused initially with all the names that began with the letter &quot;H!&quot; Other than this, the plot is well-constructed and has quite a few twists that keep the reader interested.My one complaint with this series of books is that the story-line is somewhat cliched. It's your basic &quot;rags to riches,&quot; &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;the good kid always wins,&quot; etc. motif that has been done oh-so-many times. As I pointed out earlier, though, Rawling has enough plot twists and quirky details to refresh this type of story and keep both adults and children alike turning the pages.This is a book that appeals to people of all ages and is written so that adults will not find it juvenile.

Even though I had seen the movie it was still exciting to be there and go through it even closer than just watching it on the screen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Magic, children who are magic belatedly being discovered, alternate worlds, worlds coexisting within others, enchanted beings, weirdly fascinating schools to teach these kids about magic, British countryside &amp; manners...Sound familiar? You might think J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, but you'd be revealing a woeful ignorance of Diana Wynne Jones' work of the last 25 years.Don't get me wrong - the book has much to offer, &amp; young people in particular will enjoy it. But they have in their favor a lack of experience and a lack of experienced children's bookstore personnel and/or parents to advise them. Better they might check with a children's librarian, these days!For those with less excuse, permit me to introduce them to a &quot;contemporary&quot; of Rowling's, namely Diana Wynne Jones. The similarity of these two British authors' works is, to my mind, suspicious and unforgiveable. (To be sure, I am agrieved in part because, as a bookseller and librarian myself, I have been kids on to DWJ work now for over 20 years, &amp; also dismayed when I encounter other professionals who are unaware of her work. Unconscionable, I say.)DWJ is still writing exciting, witty, intelligent fiction for young minds (age indiscriminate). Back in 1974, she began publishing her work in Great Britain through Greenwillow Books, &amp; here in the States through Alfred A. Knopf &amp; Bullseye. Such novels as *Witch Week*, *Charmed Life*, and *The Lives of Christopher Chant* (especially!) are so similar as to make it appear Rowling (or esecially her Johnny-Come-Lately admirers) are ripping off Jones' work. It's almost as if &quot;The Muggles&quot; who are always scheming &amp; yet bumbling to keep certain things hidden are at work here in the world of (children's) books. Jones' books are far more hilariously funny, inventive, charming &amp; gripping, exciting &amp; involving excursions into fantasy...Read them, if you want to see how it's really been done by a master wordsmith. Better yet, just read them &amp; do yourself a favor."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was awesome!! I loved the part when Gryffindor wins the house cup.

There is a lot of controversy over this book but what it really comes down to is it's a great novel &amp; since it is imaginative that is good.

Rarely have I been more engrossed in a novel.&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is one of the best novels I have ever read, and I am far beyond the target age of 8 to 12 year-olds. Ms. Rowling has done an expert job of bringing the reader into the story, and making him feel as thought he were walking through the vast corridors of Hogwarts beside Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Shortly into the novel, one finds himself caring very much what happens to these children, and anxiously awaiting their next course of action.To the nay-sayers of the Harry Potter phenominon, I dare you to actually read this book.

I read the first two books in October and November in the evenings and couldn't wait to read the next two. So for Christmas my wife, who also reads them, got me Books 3 and 4. Today is January 9 and I have already finished both. 15 days I read about 1200 pages. I read the last 400 pages of Goblet of Fire non-stop in 6 hours. I couldn't put it down. I cannot wait til book 5 is out. I am so used to having a book waiting I haven't read that now I have to wait. I am going to read all 4 over again they are that good. I reccommend this book to anyone, and will definitely be reading the rest of her books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first Harry Potter book is my favorite of the series so far. I've only read the first three, and have started the fourth, but still the first is my favorite. I liked &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; the best because when starting to read a series you always pay more attention to the first one you read more. When reading a book for the first time in a series you're meeting the characters for the first time, and really able to visualize the scenery, characters, and really get a feel for the author's writing style. The first book lets you meet Harry, and lets you get a feel for his family, and his friends. When reading the book you start liking the people Harry likes and resenting the people Harry resents. J.K. Rowling is such a wonderful author because she writes so greatly that I'm unable to put the book down. Not only that, but she has a writing style that many people love and respect. I have seen elementary children, highschool, and grandparents all having the same reaction to her books. Being able to write to fit so many different age groups is quite amazing. The book is basically about Harry, and he has to live with his aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley. They are muggles, which are also humans, anyways they are very mean, and he feels very unwelcome. Harry is a wizard, and on his 11th birthday he finds out he is a wizard and he gets to go to Hogwarts, which is a witches and wizardry school. The book is basically about Harry getting settled in their, and learning about his parents and the evil wizard Voldemort who killed his parents. The reason I was so amazed with this book is because I don't like fantasy books, and that's exactly what this book is, but I ended up not only loving it, but not being able to put it down. I would definately recommend this book to anyone and everybody!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, written by J.K. Rowling, was on of the most wonderfully written books I've ever read. This book is for anyone out there who is willing to sit down and enjoy a great adventure. In other words, its for anyone. I'm a high school student and I'm proof that this book is for anyone of all ages. What I really enjoyed about this book was how creative and well written it was. I have never read a book like this before in my life. That's how original this book is. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fascinating story about a wizardy school where Harry Potter and good friends Ron and Hermione try to solve the mystery of who is trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone from the powerful headmaster Albus Dumbledore. However, a lot more is involved then Harry realizes. For example, getting past the vicious three headed dog. Will Harry Potter and his friends find the stone before it gets into the wrong hands? Read to find out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! I was hesitant about reading it, and kept putting it off. Now, I can't wait to read the next three books. I couldn't put the book down and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have just got done reading the very first Harry Potter bookand I have to say that I was really surprised with the book. I know alot of (children) that are all reading Harry Potter and I use tofeel like it was only for children and it was a child's book but sinceI had to read it for school I decided to give it a try and I found outthat it isn't just a child's book. I right away got really interestedwith the book and I couldn't put it down. It had a lot of lessons tobe learned too. It was a really good book for children but I thinkthat almost all adults would like the book too. Imagine being HarryPotter. A poor boy whose parents died and he was left on the doorstepof his uncle and aunt's house. They were really nasty to him andtreated him horrible. Most of his childhood was spent in the familyscupboard. But then when Harry turned 13 he found out that he was awizard and that he had to go to hogwarts school of wizardary andwitchcraft. So he goes off to school leaving the life he hated for newthrills and adventures. He meets a new set of friends on the way andtogether and all get into many problems and adventures. I thinkeveryone should read this book at least once in their lifetime. If youdo read it continue reading it and go though the whole series. rightnow there are 4 Harry Potter books but the 5th is on the way. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is simply wonderful! I'm probably way too old to read this, but hey, the book was worth it. If you've ever read and loved CS Lewis, R Dahl etc, you will more than likely treasure this book and the other books written by Rowling. What I enjoyed particularly about this one were the humorous episodes in the story - Ron and the Weasley twins are great!! WARNING: Try to avoid reading this book as an adult on a train full of other adults whilst wearing a Buzz Light Year Disney Watch and sucking on Red Skin lollies - trust me, they won't understand why you're tittering to yourself incessantly for the next half an hour it takes to get to your stop.It takes a great writer to pull off a fantasy, comedy, and murder mystery in one book. Well done, JK Rowling!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is so good! I can only try to put it into words. Harry Potter was the son of two very famous wizards. When an angry demon killed them when Harry was a baby, he was sent to live with his muggle(mortal) aunt and uncle, who &quot;just didn't hold with that magic nonsense.&quot; There he spent 11 un-loved years in a cupboard until a messengar from his magic school, Hogwarts comes and gets him. There he got in some major and hilarious predicaments. This book is filled with great characters, surprise twists, and a smack-you-in-the-face ending. I assure you that that your stomach will be in your head and your throat in your stomach the last 4 chapters. It is great reading for all ages. If you like mysteries with a funny and light edge, you will love this book. J.K. Rowling is an amazing author. I look forward to reading and reviewing the others Harry Potter books in the future. I hope you like it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was the best book I ever read. You weird people who give it only one star are insane. In fact, you're insane if you give it anything less than 5 stars. I read it with my mom, and I read the last 3 chapters to her, but she was asleep when I read them!

Harry Potter was a perfect book to start with, reading my whole book shelf. When the book starts off with Harry's rotten aunt and uncles it captured my attention just like my teacher wants me to do.

Do you and your child a favor and read this book together. I'm rushing out to buy the next in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow! For a book half written in a coffe shop I have only great things to say. The basic storyline is great. It is entrticately detailed but not that hard to follow. Also, Rowling has the great skill of leading the reader in one direction, then switching all of a sudden. This is something that after reading three of her books, I cannot predict. Rowling also does a great job of leaving the scene open for the sequel.P.S. I don't whether or not this is only rumor, but there are going to be only seven books, one for each year at Hogwarts (his school of magic)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A month ago I saw people crowding around a table in a bookstore, grabbing for Harry Potter books. As a high schooler, I have had little time for pleasure reading. However, everyone I talked to said that the Harry Potter books were great and I should read them. I thought, &quot;What do I have to lose? If it isn't that good, I'll just give it away as a Christmas present.&quot; I finished the Sorceror's Stone the same day I received it from Amazon, and immediately ordered the other two. These books are imaginative, and everyone should read them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a very good book to read for people of all ages. It is easy enough reading for younger kids and interesting enough to keep anyone interested. The book starts out slow, but is very quick to pick up and it runs straight through the book.

I also work for a school district which unfortunately has a large &quot;controversial&quot; book list (Dr. Suess has come up for review). J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series ranks with some of the greatest children's and young adult fantasy writers. Her series of books (I have just finished reading them in 1 week) are imaginative, thought provoking and humerous. I beleive they will become books that I will not be able to keep on my library shelves. For students who enjoy the fantasy genre I would highly recommend these titles. These would also be a good starting place for students who haven't yet read any fantasy. They can then go on to the classic writers before Rowling (L'Engle, Lewis, Alexander). I plan on buying the series for my 8 yr. old to read with him. I think he will enjoy then immensely. Thank you, J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a O.K. book. It wasn't the best I have ever read.The reason I rated it a three is because it was not my kind of book. I read the whole book becasue I thought it would get better but I didn't.

It's about an eleven-year-old boy who finds out he is a wizard so he goes to Wizarding School. This book is very exciting and it's got a very exciting plot! There wasn't a boring part in the whole book. It's so exciting that after reading the first chapter I didn't want to put it down. I would highly recommend this book to men and women of all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The setting of the story takes place in London at the home of the Dursley's. Mr. Dursley worked as director of a firm called Grunnings. He was a big man with a fat neck and a mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin, blonde and very nosey. The Dursley's had a small son named Dudley who was the most wonderful child that had ever lived, in their eyes that is.Everything was wonderful in their lives until one day Professor Dumbledore, accompanied by Hagrid, and Professor McGonagall, from Hogwart's school dropped a baby on the stoop outside the Dursley's home. The baby, whose name was Harry Potter, had come to live with the Dursley's when his parents were killed by an evil sorcerer named Voldemort. Harry was the only person to survive the attack. Professor Dumbledore, who was the Headmaster at Hogwart's felt that because Harry was already famous that he would send him to live with his Aunt and Uncle until he was of age to attend the School.When Harry was of age, Hagrid, who was a big burly man and groundskeeper for the school, was sent to bring him to Hogwart's to begin his training as a wizard. The Dursley's, who had not treated Harry very well, were not happy to see Hagrid and refused to let Harry go with him.While Harry was settling into the Dormitory at Hogwarts, he became very good friends with his roommate, Ron Weasley and another classmate Hermione Granger. These two would prove to be superb friends when Harry came face to face with his parent's killer. They helped him find the Sorcerer's stone and destroy Voldemort.At the end of the school year, Harry went back to his Aunt and Uncle's home with a new and brighter outlook than he left with. He knew that he would have new adventures and he could hardly wait until summer was over.We greatly enjoyed the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. We thought the author, J.K. Rowlings, did a wonderful job of adding vivid detail to keep the readers' interest. We had a mix of emotions while sharing in Harry's adventures. Even though this book has been surrounded by controversy, we feel it is a great story for people of all ages. It is full of humor, suspense and magic that fully engages the reader in what is going on. We enjoyed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone so much that we have continued our reading with the other books in the Harry Potter series. This book would be great for all grade levels and many subjects such as math, language arts, social studies, and science could eaily be integrated into any class. Sources that are readily available for use include: internet sites such as...the video of Harry Potter, and the book itself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I did not hate the book, I can't say I liked it all that much either, though it's one of the two only good ones in the series so far. I just don't see what the big deal is with these books....I mean, they're not that great.....And althogh at a younger age I thought these books looked very lenghty and difficult, but they are, in reality pretty quick reads.....This book reminds me alot of The Giver, which I also didnt really care for all that much.....All in all, I thought the 2nd one was better...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read Harry Potter when it first came out.

It is about a boy namd Harry Potter who lives with his aunt, uncle, and his obnoxious cousin Dudley Dursley because his parents died in a car crash when he was a baby. The Dursley's abuse and make fun of Harry. Until that fateful day the day that he learned who he really was, that day that he learned he was a wizard. And he would attend Hogwarts school of witchcraft nd Wizardry.The Harry Potter novels are truely original. Joan Rowling truely sends the reader into another world where children can fly. But the book isn't just a light hearted romp. There is darkness in these novels and aren't to kiddie for adults. Infact the Harry Potter novels are entertaining for everyone, and fantasy geeks, science nerds, computer genuises or punky 6th graders will keep reading this amazing page turner. It is one of the greatest fantasys in a while, Harry Potter is a must read for fantasy fans and jocks alike.Harry Potter the Sorcerers stone is the first volume in the Harry Potter saga. So far there have been 3 Harry Potter novels written. The fifth novel is scheduled for an August 2003 release. The Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone and all the Harry Potter novels are highly reccomended if you enjoyed this book.~Dan~ Grade A++"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't hesitate to say that this book, along with the rest of the series, is a good read in general. It is engaging, enjoyable, and holds you until the end--just plain fun. I encourage you to read it just for the experience. However, I didn't really identify very much with Harry, though it's just me. I recommend the is book and its sequels, but for a truly wonderful childrens' series that adults can also enjoy, try John Bellairs' books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the BEST book I have ever read. This book is not agaes 9-12, I say it is for ALL ages. I am an 8th grader who loves to read young adult books, and this book is so good i cant put my feelings into words. The way the author puts the end of this book together is genious."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Before summer had started I had never heard of Harry Potter, Hogwarts School of Magic, Ever Flavor Jellybean, and Peeves the Poltorgeist. But once my friend told me all about Harry Potter and his friends, I knew I had to read the book. Harry Potter made me laugh all the way through. With characters like Fluffy the 3 Headed Dog, Peeves the Poltergeist, and Malfoy the mean bully at school, its hard not to enjoy this book. Harry Potter is the story of a boy who's witch and wizard parents were killed by Voldermont-the dark wizard. Oh yes, he tried to kill Harry too, but it only left a Scar on his head. Harry alive and well now lives with the Dursleys-Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley their son. While he lives under the cupboard and never gets any mail. One letter is Adressed to him. His Uncle wrote let hime read it and day by day more letters flood the house. Even when the family tries to escape the letters they still get them at a shack on an island during the rain! After that the adventure begins for Harry Potter with games like Quidditch and him being the Seeker in the game. I definetly recommend reading this book to anyone and everyone. I can't wait to read the next 2 Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I picked up this book accidentally when I was waiting for a train, and it is excellent. While I can see that children would enjoy it tremendously, since the kids win out against the bad guys, anyone who enjoys SF or fantasy will love it too. In fact the author claimed in an article last week that she wrote it for herself originally.So don't take any notice of the reviewers who say it's a childrens book. It might be, but adults can read - and enjoy - it too. (My mother's about to go and buy the second instalment in hardback!)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"During the last six weeks of school, my English teacher, in all her cruel humor, decided to assign a huge project. The rules were that we had to create a totally unique presentation about absolutely ANY fictional book. So I decided to make my teacher regret her creativity. I told her I would read the first Harry Potter book, the phrase &quot;children's literature&quot; running like a theater marquee through my head the entire time. The weekend before the project was due (yes, I procrastinate) I actually bought the book and started reading. I figured I could skim over each chapter and get away with a &quot;C&quot;. However, when I opened the book I saw the comparison of J.K Rowling to Roald Dahl (my favorite writer EVER) and I was hooked. I did not sleep that night; I finished the book instead. And I didn't regret it. I'm so glad my vengeful spirit led me to such a wonderful book. The Harry Potter series has given me a thrill comparable to when I read &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; for the first time. J.K. Rowling has managed to write books suitable for absolutely every age, and I applaud her for it. She has avoided the cliches of usual juvenile trash literature and she doesn't &quot;talk down&quot; to the little readers. Much as I despised the thought of another project, I'm rather glad my teacher gave us that assignment. I know what to get my younger cousins for Christmas, I have a lot of new vocabulary words, and I actually got an &quot;A&quot; on an English assignment. Thanks, J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is fun to read! Harry Potter is a rather abused 11-year old orphan, who lives in a cupboard under the stars with his mean aunt and uncle and their brutish son. One day, Harry receives his first ever letter. It seems his mother was a witch, his father was a wizard, and now Harry is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! On the train to school, Harry meets fellow magical kids Ron and Hermoine, who become his very good friends. Together the trio goes through a school year and deal with suspicious teachers, play quidditch (a game played on broomstick), and even solve a mystery involving a battle with Voldemort, the evil wizard who killed Harry's parents.At the heart of the story is the close bond between Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. They are loyal, courageous, and true-blue, right to the very scary conclusion. This is one page-turner you simply won't want to put down, whether you're a child or an adult. The writing is nop-notch and you'll soon be off for the bookstore for the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I did not catch onto the Harry Potter craze with the first wave... in fact, it has been months since the books came out. My friend told me that I had to read the book before I saw the movie, so I reluctantly picked it up and began to read. This book was fabulous- i truly could not put it down. It took me only a couple of days to read, and I don't normally have time to read. This book is great! It will get younger kids to read, and older kids to maybe enjoy reading a little more. Give Harry Potter a shot, I haven't met a person yet that didn't think that the book was worth the read, and in most cases, really good. Don't think that the book is too childish or elementary for you either! My friend and I made our teacher read it and she loved it also!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Belatedly I found out that this is not worth buying. Yes, I bought the book because I thought that being touted as the 10th Anniversary Edition, it would be SPECIAL. Like there would be at least a Reflection page by Scholastic or JKR since the book (and the obscure author) has been a huge success. However, the contents are basically the same. The only additional is the sketch of Snape by JKR with a small note regarding the sketch plus the colored frontis of Hagrid on the boat...yes, the dust jacket has a new art and the boards are red with golden stars...but that's about it.If you collect the books though, as in because you want every copy of the HP book series, then what I just said won't matter. But if you're buying it because you think it offers something new, then I would say it is not worth it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sometimes - and it's sadly rare - we can look at a picture or work of art, hear a piece of music, watch a film, and immediately upon our completion of the act of \\"surveying\\", know that what we have seen or heard will be timeless, will be passed down through the ages, will be discussed and enjoyed long after we are laid to rest. Such it must have been when children first read the Wizard of Oz in 1900, almost exactly 100 years before Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone would be published. The popularity of The Wizard of Oz was unheard of for the time - a children's book selling so many copies, engendering so many fans, children and adults alike. That book paved the way for thousands of writers after.Such it also was when children read The Hobbit in 1937 (indeed, its popularity was so great that it demanded a sequel - unarguably the greatest sequel in fantasy literature), and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe in 1950.While I was seventy-odd years removed The Wizard of Oz when I first read it, forty-odd years from the Hobbit, and 20-odd years from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, after reading each, they created within me a hunger, a desire for more that seemed unquenchable.For me...such it was when I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - thankfully only a month or so removed from its actual publication date. I say thankfully because now I saw, for the first time, the excitement that a timeless book of children's literature creates.And this book is timeless. While it's now five years since from the publication of the book, I can say with certainty that when I closed the cover of this book, I knew it. I knew that something amazing had happened, and I watched in mute astonishment as the rest of the literate world agreed with me.What a tale this is! The character of Harry Potter virtually sparkles with eternity. Everyone who reads the story of this poor young boy, treated so appallingly by his Aunt and Uncle, who were meant to provide him with a good home, respectable clothing, and love, instead *locked him in a cupboard under the staircase* while allotting two full bedrooms to their own son! There are few stronger emotions than pity or empathy, and so strong are our feelings for the young Harry Potter that before we are completely aware of what is happening to us, we have fallen, somewhat, in love. In love with a character who leaps from the page as if the book itself was imbued with thaumaturgical qualities.Cheering for him, once we learn that he is a wizard - of all things! - and the revenge visited upon the Dursley's by his new friend Hagrid, one can only laugh and feel your heart warmed as if you were drinking hot cocoa on a cold winter night. And when we find that he is an expert Quidditch player, with an uncanny ability to sight and grab the elusive Golden Snitch, we cheer for him even more. The poor, bedraggled boy we fell in love with is finally getting his.There is so much that is brilliant about this book. Many writers have boundless, inventive imaginations, but scant few possess those qualities *and* the ability to interest readers in their inventions. Rowling is one of the few. From the Sorting Hat to the fantastic game of Quidditch to the paintings on the wall that talk to you - everything speaks to us so deeply, and arises within us - almost without knowing it - a sense of feeling very much at home while we're reading these books, even though we are being transported to a world that is far different than the one we live in. That's the dream and goal of every aspiring writer of fantasy, whether for children, young adults, or adults - to create a place so vivid and real that it makes you feel at home. Baum did it, Tolkien did it, Lewis did it - and some others, although perhaps with slightly less success - and now Rowling has done it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I tried hard to be (cynical) about \\"Harry Potter mania\\" and succeeded thoroughly.. until I decided to sit down and actually read the first book, then I failed miserably. \\"The second coming of Christ wouldn't warrant this much hype!\\" thought I... Oh but by the time the last chapter rolled around all my 'hatred-of-hype' fueled pre-emptive 'Harry Potter' loathing had flown swiftly out the window like an emergency owl. My initial wariness disappeared in a puff of smoke and a fizzle of sparks! (Will cease and desist with the magical analogies forthwith..) It's a shame really, I had stockpiled some really juicy derogatory adjectives for general conversational usage for when the book was all read and done. Damn. That's all I can say. They will just have to wait for the next Jackie Collins books' arrival I suppose...Favorite characters: Snape (was rooting for him all the way! Alan Rickman, I must say, I imagine will be absolutely PERFECT in this role in the movie. That was a great casting decision.) Also loved Peeves the poltergeist. Best all-round character (if something of a ripoff of Ghostbusters.) Peeves hogged many of the best lines in my opinion.. and seemed to have the most fun.All in all, with grudging respect and a slightly forced smile, I proclaim 'Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone' to be a fine, funny, and compulsively readable childrens yarn. Suitable for children between the ages of 6 and the drawing of their last pension.(If you like this, try these!* JK Rowling's other 'Harry Potter' books* 'The Hobbit' by JRR Tolkien* The 'Discworld' novels by Terry Pratchet* Choice literary selections by Tom Robbins and Douglas Adams)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is full of archetypes such as the struggle between good and evil, a prophet figure (Dumbledore), and the hero (Potter) just to name a few. At the same time Rowling has succeeded in making this book entirely her own with a surprise around every corner. This book will honestly enthrall both child and adult. The ending was stunningly ironic creating that needed satisfaction at the completion of a novel. It gives you a desire to delve right into book 2 to continue partaking of Rowling's passionate talent.This book introduces the hero and numerous other friends and takes him through adventures of learning he is a wizard from Hagrid, enrolling in Hogwarts, searching its secret passageways with his invisible cloak bequeathed by his dead father, becoming a Quidditch champion and facing one of his greatest fears and the dreaded person whose name no one dares repeat.I think this writing shows the talent of someone who knows the art of writing. She puts obstacles in front of the main character at all the right moments. She cunningly includes principles in the book such as educating oneself and avoiding greed. Her imagination is unique enough to interest an adult like myself and yet still catch the heart of a young child. Anyone who can get kids to pick up a book this long deserves three cheers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to agree with Rosie O'Donnell, this is a very fun and enlightening book even for adults to read. J.K. Rowling is a very creative writer. I couldn't put the book down. I'm waiting patiently for her third book to come out. Everyone who asks me for a new and different book to read, I always suggest them to get any Harry Potter's Series books. Not only can they read to their children, but as an adult I think they would enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We purchased both of the Harry Potter books that were available here in the USA and both my kids ages 11 and 7 are constantly fighting over who gets to read them. My 11 year old is usually never interested in reading books, but has been enthralled with both Harry Potter books and has read them both in a matter of days. I, as a parent, am delighted. Harry Potter seems to give them the mystery, adventure and pure fun that all kids look for in a book. My 11 year old is very eagerly awaiting the 3rd book in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The last thing this book needs is a 1039th review saying (justafiably!) how wonderful it is. Still, I had to add my comments. As a 19 yr old college student, children's books aren't usually my thing, but I was intrigued by its presence on the NYT Bestseller list. I'm sorry that I waited so long! This is probably one of the best children's books I've ever read, and I only wish it had been around 10 years ago when I ran out of Roald Dahl books! I am holding back from getting the next two because I want to spread them out until the fourth is published, but believe me, it's difficult.I passed the book on to my roomate afterwards, and she loved it as much as I did.

When looking for a book I look for one that sounds and looks interesting. The reason I brought this book is because a person in my class done a book review on it and straight away I knew that I wanted to buy it.

Along with your basic &quot;THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER&quot; reviews, I have found three that i would like to complain about. First, the one that said this book lacks verisimilitude, a feeling of BEING THERE with the characters. My opinion on that is that the person just wanted to show off their bigheaded vocabulary. Second, the review that said that JK is making it OK to ridicule fat people and that the behaviour examples are horrible... especially the part that said that Hermione wasn't accepted until she started to lie and break rules. Okay, my opinion on that review is: 1. The Fat Lady is the TITLE of the painting. And when the unpleasant and FAT character was turned into a pig and only got the tail, it was because his PERSONALITY was like a pig's. 2. Hermione doesn't WANT to break rules, but sometimes you HAVE TO. If Harry and Ron hadn't Hermione would be dead. If they all hadn't Voldemort would have taken over. The last review said that these books are glorified horror stories. I get nightmares easily and NOT ONE of these books has given me one no matter what time of night I read it. John Bellair's books can be glorified horror stories. But NEVER HP! I LOVE this book and anyone should read it. parents kids aunts uncles teachers grandparents stepmoms stepdads cousins... what ever! ANOTHER thing on the #2 review. The person said that he or she would NOT give it to her children to read. Well, better that kids be reading where the &quot;horrific&quot; and &quot;bad behavior&quot; things are covered by magic and a sense of &quot;this can't really happen&quot; then be off shooting guns or something.

Harry has grabbed the attention of young and the old, transcending culture, gender, and nationality. With a broad cast of characters, Rowling appeals to the masses, ensuring that everyone can find a common bond with a player in her great tales. Never before, in my memory, has a series so naturally achieved this. As an educator, I know the importance of instilling a love for literacy in children. Any book, such as this, that can capture a child's attention, has this teacher's full support. Very few authors can create such long and lasting relationships between reader and a 300 page book and Rowling, without doubt, has done it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"JK Rowling started her famous series with this fantastic book on the Harry Potter character.

However judging it independently it is a very good read. Rowling has the ability to write so that the book is no longer words on a page but run through your head like a movie and your forget you are reading.This book is, unlike the later installments, truely a children's book. There isnt much tragedy or sadness other than Harry's parents and there aren't very many moral dilemas the characters need to deal with. It is truely a tale of defined good versus defined evil.Would I recommend? ABSOLUTELY!!!! Even if you dont particulary care for the first book of the series, you MUST read the rest.

Maybe they wish they had their friend's parents, or some sort of powers to instantly become and adult so they could escape school reports, homework, and their parents, but nothing compares to young Harry Potter's childhood. In his case it is his Aunt and Uncle that he wants to \\"wish\\" away, and his parents that he wants back.Harry lives in a small cupboard under his Aunt and Uncle's stairway. He's loved with his Aunt and Uncle his whole life because his parents where \\"killed in a tragic car crash,\\" so he was told. Teased and mocked by his large, spoiled cousin, Dudley, Harry lives a life that kids only see in nightmares. At the age of eleven Harry's life starts to change. One day Harry receives a letter via owl. This letter gives him the offer of a lifetime: to escape the Dursley's and go to Hogwartz School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.At Hogwartz Harry starts to uncover the truth about his past. He finds out his true calling and destiny, which is to become a famous wizard whose life is in his hands. Driven by the love his parents used to save him, he enters a life no man, woman, witch, or wizard could ever imagine.Throughout the book you meet characters that become Harry's friends, as well as enemies, that soon become yours also. Rowling creates a whole world where almost anything is possible, which you'll soon almost think this place exists. So even if you don't like magical/fantasy with a touch of mystery and wizardry, you'll love this one!

The author creates an entire universe with history, well developed characters, and layers of intrigue... all in an easy to read (very addictive) style.Don't avoid it because you think it's just for kids... it's great for anyone.

There is no kid on the planet who, at one time or another, didn't feel like he shouldn't belong to his family, or wish that there was something special about him and that someone someday would take him away and show him a whole new world. And that's exactly what happens to Harry Potter.In addition to kids being able to identify with Harry Potter, the book's full of great, believable characters and wonderful adventures. Some of them reminded me a lot of some older Roald Dahl books I've read. Both Rowling and Dahl are masters of explaining strange new worlds, and making us believe that they really could exist. For those of us who love weirdness, this is great.I have to say, my favorite part of this book was the end. Without giving anything away, I will say that Rowling manages to slip in some great lessons and some touching, tear-jerking moments. Not sure I would have cried over the same parts when I was young, but now that I'm old, I understand why some of those touching moments are so poignant.Not just for kids, and a great read all around."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", J.K. Rowling tells the story of an orphaned boy who, on his 11th birthday, discovers that he is a wizard in a long line of wizards. Having been neglected and harassed, alternately, all his life, by his adoptive family, the boy now finds himself at a school for wizards where he fits in, is respected, makes friends, and has great adventures. A fairy tale. A story that might amuse and inspire children, but at first glance not the makings of an international phenomenon that would enchant adults as well. But J.K. Rowling has created vivid characters whose fears and aspirations are immediately understood by all. She writes with a great sense of humor. And her evocative descriptions of the wizard world create a universe so colorful that it captures the imaginations of young and old alike. Readers want to return to that world time and again, because it is simply delightful to visit. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is one of the rare books that doesn't give children's literature a bad name. Intended for readers 8-12 years old, it doesn't insult their intelligence, their reading ability, or subject them to illiterate drivel. The young characters are smart, curious, and independent. They use logic, research, and good old-fashioned mischief-making to understand the world they inhabit. I can't think of a more appealing context in which to encourage children to read and explore. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a fast, fun read that is thematically complex enough for adults and straightforward enough even for young children.The wizard boy is Harry Potter. Orphaned in infancy, Harry doesn't remembered his parents, but he bears a scar from the \\"accident\\" that killed them: a peculiar scar in the shape of a lightning bolt on his forehead. Left to live with his Aunt and Uncle, who dislike him, and their son Dudley, who torments him, Harry has learned to find joy in small things and not to expect anything more. Shortly before the start of his first secondary school year (equivalent to the 6th grade), Harry, to his considerable surprise, begins to receive letters in the mail. His Uncle Vernon is determined to keep the letters from him, but they just keep coming. Vernon becomes so desperate that he takes the family on a road trip to escape the deluge. But he cannot. For inside those letters is Harry's heritage and his destiny, the knowledge that he is a wizard, and a famous one at that. So off he goes to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with more questions than answers about who he is and how he came to be that way. Together with two new-found friends, a friendly boy named Ron Weasley and a bright overachieving girl named Hermione Granger, Harry will embark on exciting and mysterious adventures, learn a few lessons, and stir up a lot of trouble as he begins to discover the answers to his nagging questions.The Leather Collector's Edition (ISBN 043920352X): The \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" Collector's Edition is bound in dark green textured leather with gold lettering and design embossed on the cover and spine, and matching gold design on the back. A 3 1/2\\" x 2 3/4\\" print of artist Mary GrandPr&eacute;'s color artwork of Harry on his broomstick that illustrates the cover of the American hardback and paperback editions is mounted in the center of the book's front cover.

This is not Lord of the Rings. I recently read a review which criticised Rowling for introducing a book that led children astray from the \\"true classics\\", i.e. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.One of the reasons Harry Potter has been such a success, is the simple fact that the books and characters are accessible. In fifth grade I had a grade 12.6 reading level. When the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, I reluctantly saw it and was immediately hooked. I read The Hobbit, and then got ready to bunker down with Lord of the Rings. When I cracked the first book at age 18, I read about 4 chapters and gave up, being extremely disappointed that I couldn't \\"get into\\" the books. Because for the same reason the books are so amazing, the attention to detail, that is also their downfall. Many people simply can't follow the books. Not to mention the size of the books being a bit daunting.Now, I read my first Harry Potter book when I was 16, the circumstances being similar to that of many others. I was in a Literary criticism class, and the book was assigned. I ignored it for months before running out of reading material, and deciding to see what the hubbub was about. I was then hooked, and have read book in the series to date.That being said, this is what I feel is worth consideration: Why should children be expected to strain themselves trying to read a book that they feel no connection with, and will not enjoy because of the effort it takes to read? \\"Harry Potter\\" is not a novel of cataclysmic significance, and I doubt J.K. Rowling will go down with Virgil, Dickens, and Dante; but what it has done and will continue to do, is open an avenue down which children will WANT to travel. The novel IS profound in the sense that it is enjoyable, and kindles (and rekindles, for some of us,) the desire to read and to learn. We all have books that have stayed with us for many many years, and Harry Potter is likely to be that book for people everywhere.There have been complaints that her characters are predictable and one-dimensional, such as the antagonist, Malfoy: sneering, stuck-up, backed by two muscle-headed \\"cronies,\\" and full of insults for every occasion, (so long as an authority figure is not near.) There are the Dursleys, who have not a single redeeming virtue, and the generally omniscient Dumbledore. Every now and then the characters do seem packaged, but it does not change the fact that each adds to the story exactly which is needed to develop the main character, Harry, while maintaining the magic. The reason clich&eacute;s arise is because they're simple and they're true. The characters in the Harry Potter books are ones that we all know, which makes it that much easier to identify with Harry.To make a long story short, it is doubtful that twenty years from now high school students will be required to write essays on the importance of this series and it's contributions to literature. But it is very likely that children reading the books today will remember them years from now, and will be enjoying them as much then as they are now.So instead of thinking of these books as a replacement for the classics, think of them as stepping stones. And if you're still very skeptical, feel free to borrow the book before you buy it. But regardless, I guarantee this is a book you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The year 1997 was the beginning of a literary phenomenon with the release of the first Harry Potter book entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" (a.k.a. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\") by J.K. Rowling. The story is about an 11 year old boy named Harry Potter, who is an orphan being raised by his very unpleasant Uncle Vernon Dursley and Aunt Petunia (his mother's sister). Unknown to Harry, he has magical powers and occasionally (and unknowingly) makes things happen that greatly upset the Dursley's. However, the Dursley's know that Harry has magical powers because Harry's deceased parents (James and Lily Potter) were a wizard and a witch. A very powerful wizard named Albus Dumbledore had left the infant Harry on the Dursley's doorstep following his parents' deaths. The Dursley's own son, Dudley, is the same age as Harry and treats Harry very badly.Upon Harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter: something that has never happened before. The Dursley's won't let him open the letter and become very upset when they read it, but more letters begin to arrive for Harry. In spite of Vernon's efforts, Harry finally gets to read the letter when Hagrid (the groundskeeper at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) bursts in to personally deliver Harry's letter, which is his invitation to attend Hogwarts. Harry at first doesn't believe that he is a wizard, but agrees to leave with Hagrid and his life is never the same again. He learns about muggles, goblins, wizards, witches and magic. He also gets to meet Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and a host of other wizards and witches.What inspired me to start reading the Harry Potter books was seeing the first two feature films based upon this book and the next book, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\". I was very impressed with the amount of detail in the book that did not make its way into the first feature film and understood how much the film deviated from the original story. One of the biggest differences is the amount of attention given to characters in the book that only had minor roles in the film including Neville Longbottom, the Weasley twins and Dudley Dursley. Also, a few characters in the book don't appear in the feature film at all. The other major difference between the story presented in the feature film and the book is changing of when things are said and done, which is understandable considering the length of the film. (It took me about 8 hours to read the book and the feature film is 2.5 hours.)Overall, I rate \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading fun and exciting stories that encourage the imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter used to live a somewhat normal life with his Aunt Petuna, Uncle Vernon, and his devilish cousin, Dudley. His Parents died in a \\"car crash\\" when he was only a baby. At the age of ten Harry was told by a giant, named Hagrid, that he was a wizard. Hagrid said Harry would begin school at Hogwarts (a school for young witches and wizards). The ways of life start to change for Potter. He would discover magical creatures, beings, and objects. Of course he would give a little pay back to his hosting family. Harry gains friends and enemies at Hogwarts who know more about him than he knows himself. A short tempered boy, named Ron, and a smarty pants girl, named Hermione become Potter's long life friends. No hearted boys named Draco Malfoy, Crab, and Goyle become his life long enemies. Harry's life becomes a whole mysterious adventure from then on in. J.K. Rowling's imagination is so great it leaves me in awe. Not only is the first book good and full of surprises, the second and third are even more enchanting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I DID NOT want to read this book!

BUT, i loved it. i couldn't put it down! I read all the other that summer, and am still waiting for 5 to some out. Its really a great book and not just a &quot;kids&quot; book. I highly recomend it to anyone! (even my mom liked it....) Well i hope everyone enjoys it as much as i did, and i highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book deserves an &quot;A&quot;. My cousin in Colorado Springs let me borrow this book. It took me five months to finally decide to read it. It was worth reading even if it has a reputation as a children's book. It is a fantasy for children but any ADULT would love it if one would simply give this book a chance. It took me back to the beauty of being a curious child. There was a great &quot;cliffhanger&quot; feeling after each chapter. I couldn't wait to learn what happened next. You will LEARN something if you read this book. Favorite Lines: &quot;...He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loves us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin...&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rereading it again, I remember how much I like this series. Now admittedly, the characters created for this series are not particularly new. You can find each person's inspiration throughout other books in children's literature. That said, these characters are rendered here in a new light, fleshed out as three-dimensional interesting people. The great joy of this book is the imagination behind it. Unlike most children's fantasy series, the Harry Potter books use a great deal of humor. Few kids books in this genre can say as much. There might be brief smatterings of it in the \\"Dark Is Rising\\", \\"His Dark Materials\\", or \\"Wrinkle in Time\\", series, but nothing to compare to \\"Harry Potter\\". And don't even think about trying to find anything funny in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books. Rowling has elevated pure enjoyment to an art form. You care about these people, and you can identify with them. Perhaps most importantly, Harry isn't perfect and he isn't \\"the hero\\" in the worst sense. He has a personality and belief system, and you like him (sometimes despite yourself). I would recommend this book (and I have) to every man, woman, and child who can string two words together on a page. If the book has flaws, it's not particularly multi-cultural. We are dealing with Britain, particularly Northern Britain, but Hogwarts (a supposedly international school) is very white. An interesting side note, the character of Dean Thomas is described in the American edition of \\"Harry Potter\\" as black. No such description exists in the original British. Take that as you will. Pairing this book with another introductory fantasy series, perhaps the Edward Eagar books, would be an excellent idea."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Did you ever dream of a place where you could fly?

In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a boy named Harry is a wizard, but he doesn't know it yet. He lives with his aunt and uncle and their son Dudley. Strange things start to happen a couple of days before Harry's eleventh birthday. Harry, the protagonist, starts to get letters more and more each day, but his mean uncle won't let him see them. There were also owls all over town even during the day. One day Harry's uncle can't keep up with all the letters so he goes to a lighthouse. Suddenly, there was a huge pounding on the door and the door fell down. There stood a gigantic man named Hagrid. He came to pick up Harry to take him to a wizard's school named Hogwarts.Imagine shopping for school in a secret alley to get an owl and a wand. Or perhaps running through a wall to get to a train platform #9 ? On the train, Harry meets Ron and Hermione. They become Harry's best friends in this strange world which he is entering.When they get to Hogwarts, they are divided up into four schools. Harry, Ron and Hermione all go to Griffendore. Each of these schools compete against each other. One of the games they play is quidditch. Harry becomes the star player as the seeker. Harry also has a special lightening bolt on his forehead which makes him famous atHogwarts.The story had been told throughout the wizard world that Harry lived after Lord Voldemort killed his parents and tried to kill him.There is a place in the school that they are not allowed to go to, but Harry, Ron and Hermione accidentally went there. When they tried to get out, they find a three headed dog-named Fluffy on a trap door. He was protecting the Sorcerer's Stone. This stone is a rare stone that lets you live forever when you have it.Professor Quill comes in at Halloween and says that there is troll in the dungeon and then faints. Harry and Ron go to the girls bathroom to warn Hermione, but the troll was in the bathroom. Harry and Ron knock the troll out and all the teachers come in. Harry saw that Professor Snape had a cut on his leg.

Do you think Harry will make friends at his new school of witchcraft and wizardry?I think Harry, Hermione, and Ron are good friends. Harry is a bit shy at first. Then he meets Ron and Hermione. They become very good friends. They are loyal to each other and are willing to stand up for one other. They also keep their secrets to each other. Harry meets Ron Weasley who likes to play jokes and goofs off too much! When Harry got on the train to go to this new school, he meets Ron and Hermione. They sat with each other.Hermione Granger is a girl with frizzy brown long hair. She is smart and a perfectionist. She is more serious than Ron. They become very good friends. The three of them get into a lot of trouble and danger together. They help each other get through tough times. Harry and Ron got sick of Hermione when she knew how to do a spell to make paper float in the air, and they did not.My favorite event was when Harry Potter and his friends went to see Fluffy, the three-headed dog. They were trying to find the sorcerer's stone before professor Snake did because they thought he was trying to steal it. When they entered the room, they got scared because Fluffy was so big.

JK Rowling's style of writing is unique and easy to read, with words to build a child's vocabulary, but not too hard to understand. She doesn't slur the reader with names of places and things, but gives you little enough to understand, but enough to keep you wanting more. She does not write in thick paragraphs where there isn't any good place to stop, but keeps her blocks to a reasonable length. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is good. But the movie is better. Harry Poter's books are a little bit scary.

I was not a major fan of this first book. I thought the writing was mediocre at best and the story line too choppy. What makes this book so good, and one you want -- need -- to finish is the character development. Almost from the beginning you're on Harry's side and wishing he could get away from his mean aunt and uncle, and when it finally happens and he's walking down Diagon Alley looking for \\"school\\" supplies with Hagrid...well, you're hooked. This series of book is, of course, geared towards young people, but they are much more than your average children's novel.

Yes, she does use her own ideas, but from what i've read (and what i've heard about the other books) Harry does encounter some known myths and ledgens in his adventures. I'm not saying this is a bad book, i really think its quite good, but all i'm saying is that i would like her books a lot better if she thought of other things instead of using myths and ledgens (even if they're only on a couple of pages)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are looking for a great way to bond with your child well this book will certainly help in your efforts. It is good for both girls and boys. My daughter of 8 and I have great fun reading it at bedtime each night. It has opened the door for some fulfilling conversations at various times of the day. We like to makes conjectures on upcoming events in the story line. So I believe it helps her to learn to use her logic and make her own surmises. Of course her listening skills have improved greatly as well. We have learned a great deal about each other and our own experiences of good and evil. She has shared many a story with me of her own basis of morality. I think people who are criticizing this book series are fogetting that in just like any fairy tale the whole point is for children to see both the good and evil (bad) and make their own conclusions as to what is apppropriate behavior in their world. Besides the books are just great fun. The author is able to actually paint a clear picture of exactly each scene. You can close your eyes and see it plainly. My daughter has hopes of being a writer herself and this is such a great example to her. She has something to look forward to at bed time as well and this has made the whole process of bedtime easier to settle her down and get her to sleep. The only drawback that I can see is having Harry Potter withdrawels in the future if the author decides to stop writing!

I would have read it all in one night if I hadn't been so tired.

I couldn't out the book down, and the descriptions, oh the descriptions!From Charles Dickens and now it's J.K. Rowling. The book played in mind and I could visualize the characters and their actions. I have only read a few really good books and this is one of them. Only a select few books have really caught my mind, and when someone asks me a good book, Harry Potter always comes to mind. I can't think of another book that comes so close to playing all the scenes and images in my head, and she has such an easy style of writing. It's not to hard to understand,a nd for all those adults out there, if you get past the first few chapters, the books turns out to be a smash. I would recomend this book for any age, old and younge. I really hope that you do give it a chance and try it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is inevitable that any good fantasy novels would be compared to the classic like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ( by J. R. R. Tolkein). For the sake of comparison, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone does have some similar elements to the classic, e.g., instead of the One ring (invisible ring), we now have cloak of invisibility or an old, wise wizard Dumbledore in place of Gandalf. However, this book can stand on its own merits and would set a standard for the children books in the years to come. Since the setting is in the modern age, it is easier for children to understand and connect to Harry's world. By a masterful narration, we're introduced to the magical world through the eyes of 'muggles' (people with no magic) and progressively learned how magic works as Harry studied the arts of magic. Although packed with delightful moments, the main theme of the story is that Harry had to struggle to live up to his unknown destiny which would satisfy the more sophisicated readers. This is a very enjoyable book to read and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The story is well written especially as if it is through the eyes of an 11-year old. The story is wordy at times and I found it slow to read. The story is enjoyable, but I do not understand the fanatical behavior that it prompted in the public. I certainly would not have been on lines at midnight to have purchase any of the books. It is good but not great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was good even though I do not like to read. The book kept me interested because of the fact that I like magic and trying to figure out what is going on at all times. Another thing I liked about this book was that Harry could not figure out why the wizards were coming and going from the pictures. Something that really confused me was that LORD VOLDEMORT was killed but came back just for revenge knowing that he would die again, and that the stone could only be gotten out of the mirror by Harry. My favorite part of the book was when Harry learned how to play quittich."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wanted to know what the big deal was about Harry Potter.

It is the most refreshing, most imaginative and most thoughtful book I have ever read. An added plus is that it recognizes growing pains that all children go through: dealing with the bully, the mean teacher, the well-meaning friend and especially the famous (most popular) boy who remains humble and true to himself.Great piece of writing.

When my 10yr old daughter (I am 31) came home from school raving about Harry Potter, his adventures and how I just had to read the books, I thought, sure when I have time. 2 months (I think)later I wish I had taken her advice and read them sooner. I must admit the first few chapters of this book go abit slow but I urge people to keep at it. The book(s) don't seem to be trying real hard to impress any particular age and I am very impressed at how Harry and Ron have embraced Hermoine as their friend, a lesson which alot of boys both young and old could do to learn. In an age when most fantasy is seen on TV through programmes or games it is refreshing to see the process of my children imagining how these fantastic charecters and places must be. These books have inspired my daughter to greater heights in her own creative writing at school and have managed to capture my sons attention when I read them to him, and those of you with 7yr old boys know how hard that is. We have had family ring us from London to rave over these books for us to tell them we already knew.

The &quot;missions&quot; they try to accomplish always turn out differently from what they expect! I'm not a faithful reader,but when I started to read this book I could not put it down.

Though this book gets better and better with each chapter, it dragged me into it and I didn't want to stop reading it. The book is confusing but after a while it all clicks.

I suppose I'll say my piece concerning my background with the series first:I am a pure non-conformist. I don't watch the TV more than an hour and a half a day (and only for news and Friends, then) and I don't listen to the radio. I generally abhor popular media. I'm definitely not trying to be a hobbit and seclude myself from the world, I just have different tastes than most other people. When I first heard of the Harry Potter series, it was only because of the hype surrounding book number 4, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I was immediately disgusted and was turned off to the book.A few months later, I was at a friend's house, and she has books 1,2, and 4. I picked up the first one, read the first three paragraphs, and was still not impressed. This only furthered my disdain. Most of the people I know have read most of the books - and I gave them a rather hard time for it. Beginning a couple weeks ago, my fourth period teacher has been reading The Sorcerer/Philosopher's Stone to us, and I caught the occasional word here and there over the book I was reading that day. The thing was, the words I caught were interesting: Bernie Bott's Every-Flavor Beans, Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort, Quidditch. So I started paying more attention. By the eighth chapter, I was so taken by the book, I went out and bought it for myself!I have to say, it's an amazing read. Science fiction/fantasy books are not my usual par for course, but this is definitely an exception! The way J.K. Rowling weaves her storylines with her characters with her setting is incredible. So, if you're still reading this, my point is simple: For months and months on end, I really didn't want to have anything to do with this book. Snicker all you wish, but read the first two chapters. If you still don't like it after that, then read another! I promise, by chapter 10, there will have been at least one thing that will have caught your attention and/or imagination. Cheers to you, Ms. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I totally enjoyed this story. Rowling is a darn good writer, able to capture the essence of her characters in just a few paragraphs. This is not written like a children's book. Really liked the way she presented the Hogwarts school for witches and wizards. Treats it like a typical boarding school, except with magic all around. Liked the chemistry she developed between Harry, Ron and Hermoine. Three completely different personalities that are able to team up and survive one adventure after another. Also liked how not all the kids were buddy-buddy with one another (like real kids sometimes are). Hermoine, in fact, is an annoying knowitall who Harry and Ron can't stand many times. And Malfoy is just a young blaggard in practice. Interesting and diverse personalities for the faculty, and Harry's big friend, Hagrid, is a riot. Rowling did a first rate job taking Harry from his hellish life with his aunt and uncle and putting him into a magical environment where everything is new to him. Lots of peaks and valleys for Harry at Hogwarts. I most definately have to read more &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked reading this book, it isn't as polished as the later books, first books seldom are, but it is a good book. My worst complaint is a very minor one in that some Americans won't understand a few of the British terms but even those are minor."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter, as a media phenomenon is pretty impressive by now: millions of books sold; total sales represent a hugely lopsided portion of Scholastic's annual income; J.K. Rowling rocketing from virtually homeless to the 3rd most wealthy woman in England - it's a bit much to accept.I picked up the book because I liked the illustration on the cover, but as I read a few pages, I found my imagination moving faster and faster - there is so much to imagine and experience in these books, that it's difficult to not spill out the entire plot in one sentence....This is a great read for both kids and adults for a number of reasons: the plot is very inventive, intricate, and well-crafted; The characters are fully developed and ring very true, in the tradition of Roald Dahl or Beverly Cleary; and the settings and imagery consistently set your imagination ablaze with activity.When a kid begs you something that's part of the latest craze, as an adult one tends to simply dismiss the object out of hand, thinking that the desire for that thing will be quickly replaced by something just as vapid - don't fall into this trap with Harry Potter. Getting a kid interested in reading is a reward enough, but I would encourage parents to read the books also (in order, please) to be able to talk about this wonderful world with their kids. It'll be an experience that you'll never regret."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Be prepared to leave this world when you pick up this Harry Potter book. Harry, the main character, was different despite the never ending attempts of his relatives to cover this difference up. It all comes out in a most hilarious way at a big dinner party given for poor old Uncle Vernon's associates. Harry is a very different but not so different child in this story. He is a typical ten year old boy who just happened to have a witch and a warlock as a mother and father. Harry Potter was a very famous child but his fame was unknown to him until his eleventh birthday. Harry grew up in a closet with a brat for a cousin, Dudley. Harry makes you feel sad and glad for him at the same time. You are sad because he is mistreated and yet glad because he is at least not like the people who are raising him. Harry manages to get a few on them also as the plot thickens. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon have their work cut out for them when they try to keep Harry from his real mother and father's former school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. We see Harry in his attempts to make his stand many times in this book. He becomes brave and courageous and you would never believe he was treated so miserably due to his very warm and considerate treatment to his friends. This story communicates many themes. The most prevalent theme is that of loyalty. Hagrid's loyalty to Harry's parents saved Harry from a cruel existence. The loyalty and honor of the friends that Harry made at school was expressed. The loyalty and admiration that Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore expressed for Harry and his parents was extremely enduring and strong. Other themes are friendship, companionship, child abuse, and of course self worth. As a media specialist I highly prefer this book among other fantasy due to the areas involved in the book such as loyalty, peer relations, child abuse, social skills, honesty, and just plain good literature for young adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a 22 year old college graduate who spent the last four years reading and reading and reading, this book was a best--a fascinating delight!

I really enjoyed this book because of the cluster of details that allowed you to picture what was going on and play it out in you mind. It is fairly easy to read and does not take much time. People who like adventure and fantasy would enjoy reading the first book of the series. I would recommend this book for any age group.The story starts off with Harry arriving at his aunt and uncles house as an infant. Harry lives with them until he is of age to attend Hogwart's. The years he lives with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and his Cousin Dudley are not all great. He sleeps in the closet under the stairs and gets hand me down clothes from his fat cousin. The day of his eleventh birthday, a messenger, named Hagrid from the school rescues him from his so called family. Hagrid takes him to get ready to start his new school that he will love, only there does he really feel at home. At Hogwarts he learns about what happened to his real parents and makes friends and enemies. During the school year, he learns something disturbing. The man who had killed his parents was back and looking for the sorcerer's stone because of its magical powers. Harry's job is to stop him from succeeding his hunt. This book will leave readers guessing about who is helping this evil man, and the unexpected ending will take them by surprise."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"~Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone~This book is not like most stories someone might read. By looking at the cover, readers see a young boy flying on a broomstick with a cloak on his back. When I first started reading the book, I was very interested. A baby being dropped off at someone's doorstep, and cats reading newspapers are not normal to most people. You just want to keep reading, because they cannot think of what might happen next.This book has many other books along with it. It's kind of a never-ending story, with all the other books and movies that have come out since they started making Harry Potter. This book is a fantasy with a mystery. This book is not for all people because of some beliefs about magic, myths and lies. At the same time, it's mainly written for children and young adults. There is something that makes its seem so real and extremely interesting, that makes adults and the elderly love this book as much as children.

I really liked this book because it had a way of creating an image in my mind. When Harry met up with the Mountain Troll, I could not only visualize the shape, but even the odor of the beast.Harry Potter grew up living with his Aunt and Uncle. When Harry was about to turn 11, letters came from nowhere, addressed to where he sleeps. They are invitations to Hogwarts, the wizarding school. Harry finds out that he is a wizard and responcible for killing Lord Voldermort. Hagrid came to take him shopping in London so Harry buys all of his school supplies. So after that he goes to Hogwarts. He is sorted into Gryffindor. When he takes his first flying lesson Moganagle sees him and then he becomes Gryffindor's Seeker. Harry reads the paper and finds out the vault that he and Hagrid went to had been broken into but there was nothing there when the thief broke in because Hagrid took out the pacage that was in there. At his first Quiditch game, Harry almost is thrown off his broom. Ron and Hermione think it was Snape,so Hermione sets Snape's cloak on fire. Harry and his two friends take the wrong stairs and find out why that corridor is forbidden. They tell Hagrid about it and he starts to give away a ton of information about the socerer's stone. One day Hagrid gets a dragon. He raises him for a few weeks then sent him to Romania. Harry gets detention and had to go into the Forbidden Forest. In the Forbidden Forest Harry runs into Lord Voldermort. Harry and his friends think that Snape is trying to steal the stone to bring Voldermort back to full life. they try to tell Dumbledor but he is gone!I would recommend this book to any one who likes a good book with magic in it.

Book one introduces a world within our world, a world of wizzardry and wonder. J.K. Rowling has written a wonderful story about a young boy who discovers his true heritage. This well-written book is a page turner and for anyone who feels that these are merely kid's books are severely missing out on a wonderful story. Once you read this one, you will want to continue and see what else lies in store for Harry and his new life.Harry Potter was a normal child living a miserable existance with his aunt and uncle. His parents were dead and he was raised by them. One day, a letter appears at his mailbox and changes his life forever. He discovers the mystery of who he really is to become and finds a world that is more amazing than could ever be imagined."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Scholastic Press, 309pages,J.K Rowlings ISBN 0-590-35340-3This book is the first in a series of 5 books out. J.K Rowlings is a magnificent author to describe every detail. The story is about Harry Potter, a wizard, who is growing up without knowing about his magical powers. When he was a baby both his parents were killed by a powerful sorcerer while protecting Harry. On Harry's 13th birthday he gets a letter from a school called Hogwarts but his evil aunt, uncle, and cousin who he lives with won't allow him to go. He went Hagar to Hogwarts anyways. There he met all the teachers some of which didn't like him. One boy didn't like him either Draco Malfroy. Harry doesn't excel in his class like his teachers had hoped and then strange things started happening. Like a teacher trying to kill Harry during a Quidditch match. Harry finds out that the sorcerer that tried to kill him as a child has taken of a teacher's body and was trying to get the sorcerer's stone to get his body back and kill Harry. Harry foils his plan and drives the sorcerer away and is the hero.I liked the book it a lot of adventure and never got boring. With all the magic and fights and games they play it's just a great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Orphaned as a baby, Harry Potter hasn't had the happiest of lives. Raised (in the loosest possible terms) by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, he never knew his parents and was not allowed to mention them. According to his Uncle and Aunt, they'd died in a car crash - the same accident that left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. Forced to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs, fed sparingly and only given his cousin's cast-offs to wear, he dreamed of his unlikely escape.Incredibly, though, the escape comes. After a mysterious flurry of letters addressed to Harry and withheld from him by his Uncle and Aunt, Harry finds out on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard. Visited by an apparent giant called Hagrid, he finds learns a little about his own past and the truth about how his parents died. They were killed at the hands of an evil wizard called Voldemort, who also tried to kill Harry himself. For some strange reason, however, he couldn't and he hasn't been seen since. This attack was the real cause of his strange scar. He also finds out about some of the plans for his future - which include attending Hogwarts, a school for training young witches and wizards. His learning is not restricted to spells, however - he will also be learning about the way wizards live. He never realised, for example, that wizards have their own newspaper (\\"The Daily Prophet\\") and bank (Gringotts). Visiting Gringotts for the first time with Hagrid, his tall friend takes something mysterious from one of the vaults. Harry later finds that there has been an attempted theft at the bank on the same day they visited....The majority of the book is centred on Harry's first year at Hogwarts. The school is made up of four houses, each with its own distinct personality. These houses include Gryffindor (the house Harry's parents belonged to) and Slytherin (the house that spawned practically every wizard that ever went bad). For the first time ever, Harry also makes friends - the very ginger Ron Weasley and the very bossy Hermione Granger. Despite these faults (!!), however, they become very loyal friends to Harry and are genuinely likeable. Among the books other notable characters are Albus Dumbledore (the kind and wise headmaster), Minerva McGonagall (the firm Head of Gryffindor) and the school's groundskeeper Hagrid (a close friend and confidante of Harry's). Naturally, there are some other rather less likeable characters - the sneering Draco Malfoy (a first year from Slytherin house) and Professor Snape, who takes an instant dislike to Harry. Snape, as well as being Head of Slytherin, is also the Potions teacher. However, it is widely known he wants to teach the Defence against the Dark Arts class - currently taught by the permanently petrified Professor Quirrell.First published in 1997, this is first in the hugely popular series of books that has made J.K. Rowling a household name. It's an entertaining and very easily read book - it will certainly be enjoyed by children and also by adults willing to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For those of you who don't know the premise of the Harry Potter series--both of you--it's about a sad orphan kid raised by a neglectful Aunt and Uncle, and one day the kid discovers he's actually a wizard and there's a magic wizard school he's supposed to go to. Then he goes there, and he doesn't feel so bad, and some various things happen. Yay!J.K. Rowling has said that she tries to write every volume of this series for a reading level of whatever age Harry Potter happens to be. So for adults wanting to get into this series, be forewarned that he's only about nine or ten or so in this book. It reads like a very young kids book, as does this series's second volume.But, the series does get better, and you'll probably be lost if you don't read them in order. So, check it out if you want to.I've read all the books in this series, but personally I prefer \\"Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo,\\" by Obert Skye. If you like young adult fantasy that's original and funny, you'd probably like that too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"far removed from the mundane life of the Muggles on Privet Drive.This is the first book of the Harry Potter series, which, if you have been living on another planet or in a coma for the past 8 years, is about an 11 year old boy named Harry who just happens to discover one day that he is a wizard. Since he has been living with his horrible aunt and uncle and their throughly rotten son ever since he could remember Harry was delighted that being wizard meant that he could go to Hogwarts, the school for witches and wizards. Even though he knew nothing about the school or even the world of magic anything had to be better than where he was...didn't it?Harry soon discovered that the world of magic had many delights and just as many dangers. He also found friends and people that valued him both for what and who he was. With his new found friends Harry began to unravel mysteries that had been set into motion before he was born and face dangers that he had never even dreamed of.This series is wildly popular for some very good reasons. It is well written, amazingly well plotted and just a great story. Even though the description states that this is for 9 to 12 year olds I have found it fascinating and I am old enough to have a grandchild in the target audience.

I grew up loving other fantasy series like Madeleine L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time books, The Chronicles of Narnia, and of course Lord of the Rings. Harry Potter is just as much fun, and just as well written, as all of these.I was worried at first about all of the hype and commercialization, but the books still have not lost their charm. The most exciting thing about this series for me is that I get to enjoy the suspense of waiting for the next installment, with no idea as to what might happen next... L'Engle/Lewis/Tolkien published their entire series before I was of reading age, so the entire series was available when I started reading. Now, I get to experience the thrill of watching history be made...and a great new series added to the shelf of classics."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...and saw the movie a couple of times! It was fun every time.I read this and the other four Harry Potter books published to date before, but decided to listen to them as a refresher for the upcoming new title, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Even though the story was familiar, it was just as entertaining. This first book in the series has a delightfully fresh quality to it that makes it very appealing. In this book Harry finds out his family origins, gets to Hogwarts Academy, makes some friends and has his first battle with his nemesis, Voldemort. Even though the school year comes to an end at the conclusion of the book, the reader knows there is more to come. There are still conflicts brewing in the background of the story. Five stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I didn't think I'd ever find anything else that would satisfy my taste for mythopoeic fantasy on a par with Tolkien or C. S. Lewis's work. Rowling's Harry Potter series rates high marks in this regard.I began reading once the first 3 books were in print so it's impossible for me to look at the book purely by itself. Everyone knows the basic story: Harry Potter finds out he is a wizard at age 11, that his deceased parents were also wizards. He is sent for by the famous Wizarding school, Hogwarts, where he begins to learn how to use magic and learn about the magical world, full of good wizards, bad wizards, goblins, spells and all sorts of magical creatures and objects.What distinguishes a good wizards from a \\"dark\\" one? One thing to remember is that Rowling's original title is \\"The Philosopher's Stone\\" which should provide an enormous clue to the author's approach to magic and morality. The one historical character mentioned in the book, Nicholas Flamel, was a Christian Alchemist who alegedly produced the philosopher's stone and used the subsequent proceeds in gold for benevolent ends, e.g., giving money to the poor, etc. Putting Headmaster Albus Dumbledore in league with Flamel is a direct reference to Alchemy which has historically been seen as a neutral study which can be used for good or evil (Sir Isaac Newton was purportedly a \\"dark alchemist\\".)One thing fantasy readers might appreciate about Harry Potter over the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is the amount of mystery involved in the destinies of the characters; we're always finding characters who might be bad or good or who were good and went bad - the moral development is more dynamic and in process as we see them making good and not so good choices."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My girlfriend's daughter was having problems in school.

They're magical. They don't just take you away, they lift you off your feet and you float to Hogwarts or Number 4 Privet Drive, or wherever Harry is. J.K. Rowling is not just showing you this world, behind thick, foggy glass, you are living it. When you read these books, Rowling does not seem like just a writer, but an inventor, a creator.

Another book I really loved thisholiday season is &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp;Shya Kane.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and the lot, are delightful characters that everyone can relate to in some way.

I thought, well, I suppose it must be a good childrens book. As time went by, however, my friends (aged friends!) read it and they were raving about it and recommended that I read it. And so I did. I can just say that this is one of the very few books that were up to my expectations. It is such an original plot and its amazing how well Rowling conveys the feelings of the characters in the book, Snape with his emmence dislike for poor Harry, Hargrid's kind and gentle nature, despite his physical description, the vindictive nature of Malfoy, Ron's longing to be better than his brothers, and Harry's happiness about finding out he is a wizard.Rowling introduces some delightful idea's into the story, such as the sport Quiddich, which I found highly entertaining, and the rivalry between the four houses at Hogwarts. An excellent read, especially for those young at heart. For those who read it, it will be one, if not the, most entertaining and delightful books you have ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, I have read a lot of Harry Potter stuff in internet, among the first three books, so I am doubtfully...DO THERTE ISNT ANYBODY IN THIS WORLD WHO HAVE NOTICED DE SUSPICIOUS SIMILITUDE BEETWEEN HARRY POTTER AN THE TV SHOW BASED ON THE BOKKS OF JILL MURPHY, THE WORST WITCH!!!!!You know, It have been quite a dissapointing time for me when I saw the show for first time, and I noticed the bunch of similitudes.Anyway, the book is great, and I strongly recomend it to all the people who wanna read an interesting, humorous and well writted book.Thanks, and e-mail me!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series are the four best books I have ever read.

I think That you should read Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's stone because it was a really, really good book. The book was mostly about Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They wanted to find out what to know what the sorcer's stone was. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to get past a three headed dog named fluffy. They hadto get pass a lot of hard magical from every teacher at Hogwarts to get to the Sorcer's stone. The patrts that I liked in the book was that Harry Potter was the youngest wizard to play Qittich. Harry Potter also has two best friends named Ron and Hermione. I really like the part when you find out Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione are wizards and they go to wizzardring school. if there was a scale that was one through five with five being the the best number. It would get a five because I think that it would be a great book to read. I would recomend it to anybody who loves to read about wizards like Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Give way, ye doubters! Older than 8-13? It's all right! Just get a copy of this first book in the Potter series and READ. Let go of your reservations that this is for kids only and/or for the parents of kids only. Let go of your hesitation that this story line is beneath you. Let yourself ease into the enticement of good story telling, the kind your classroom teacher, or if you were really lucky, your parents, used to read to you at night.And if you have concerns about the evils of the series, i. e. withcraft, magic, you MUST READ in order to know what you are against.In any case, bravely go into the world of Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, mail delivered by owls, and see what is there.It is the opinion of this grandmother/librarian that this is the next set of classics, and that a tale of good versus evil always has a place in modern living. The great myths and legends of the literary past are redolent in the plot lines of Rowling's work. She obviously understands the meaning of archetypal hero journeys and honors the ages old story tellers by adding Harry to the list.This pitiful little survivor, Harry, finally meets with his fortune and his future and tackles the task of maturity while fighting to avenge the evil that befell his parents. He is a gifted student, a child ready for development into the best weapon against He Who Must Not Be Named.Taking this first journey with Harry will either confirm your doubts about Rowling's intent as an author, or open your eyes to the innocent pleasure of a good story that continues in three other books. (The other three are in the works.)Seeing the Warner Brothers website, getting sorted into a Hogwarts' school, buying Harry Potter games, puzzles, ornaments, loving the movie trailer, are the fanaticisms to which this good reading may lead. Collectibles for fun or investment, these are all big business.But the business of reading is an altogether more special subject. Seeing readers, young and old, enjoying the Potter stories is the best MAGIC for which any book lover could wish. As Mikey might say, &quot;Try it!

Every thing you know was made up or was a lie. Even your own parents are somebody who you think they aren't. Your name is still the same but the whole past thing was just made up from the top of your twisted uncle's head. In the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling the main character, Harry, goes through exactly this. Harry Potter has always been blamed for the unexplained and the things that go wrong, but when Harry finds out who and what he really is, it's time for a little payback to his Uncle Vernon at Privet Drive. At the same time makes his only family members a little uneasy around him. When Harry arrives at a place where he is not welcome he encounters many adventures. One instance of this was when he receives a gift from the unknown. When he puts it, on he finds out that the gift can do magnificent things beyond even Harry's imagination. This thing that Harry's gift can do helps Harry find out things about his past. It also helps him escape predators of the night. He even can spook out his archrival Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy has had it in for Harry ever since he came to the school. If you haven't read this book yet your missing out in the action. You are also missing out on the friends and wonders that you will find in the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the first book in the Harry Potter's series and it is one of my dog gone favorites! Harry Potter is a wizard but he doesn't know it and he also is rich, but he is. He also has two best friends. Also someone wants to kill Harry, but who? My favorite part is when Harry Potter is fighting the guy who I can't tell you because it would ruin the story and I would be writing this story for nothing. I like it because it is the most exciting part of the story. I would say that it would be recommended for 4th grade and up so because other kids don't have high advanced reading skills and there are swears in the other books so I think it wouldn't'be necarey for kids that aren't very old. This is the first book in the Harry Potter series and it has about 300 pages and it is very hard to read sometimes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This wonderful book is about an orphan kid. His miserable life ends by a visit from a friendly giant named Hagrid. Hagrid helps Harry get started for his new adventure in Hogwart's school. Harry was very excited becoming a wizard, after living with the Dursley's who never cared for Harry. Once you read this book you'll know what happens to Harry in Hogwart's."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It seems like a long time ago that I first heard about this book -- on NPR, a report about children's books that adults should read (this was at least a few months prior to the general public taking notice of the book). Even though so many people have become wild about Harry Potter, I can only share the enthusiasm to a certain degree after finally reading this one.Who wouldn't appreciate a book though that is packed with amusing characters -- even if they aren't all that deeply developed? If that book also keeps the action moving, you can't help but like it -- even if it does play fast-and-loose at least once with explanations (for instance -- How did Hermione solve the &quot;bottle riddle&quot; as she did when one of the clues states specifically that one of her choices could not have been correct?). And of course, who wouldn't side with a poor little &quot;wiz&quot; kid who makes good even though the odds are stacked mountainously high against him?This book does have a lot to offer children and adults who want some quick, amusing reading. But Ms. Rowling is not a great author -- nor would she class herself as one, I think.She has done a great job in getting young (and not so young) people interested in reading and using their imagination. And, if this book and its sequels whet the appetite for other books like it, that is all to the good.I read this after Philip Pullman's fine trilogy (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, The Amber Spyglass) and can only suggest that if you like Harry Potter and need something to read while waiting for further adventures, look for similar fantasy and adventure books by other authors. There is plenty of great reading to be had for people of all ages -- just look for it and don't be afraid of a challenge.Harry wouldn't be!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers StoneHarry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone by J.K. Rowling is about a young boy who is orphaned and sent to live with his Aunt, Uncle, and his cousin. He is treated badly by his family, until he turns 11 and receives a mysterious letter and a visit from a giant man named Hagrid, and discovers he's a wizard. Harry goes to Hogwarts School for witchcraft and wizardry and makes friends with Ron and Hermione. They set out to solve the secrets that they find at Hogwarts. I'm not going to say anything else because ill ruin the ending for you but I believe this book is a must read for any who love fantasy and mystery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a great book, because the author, J.K. Rowling expresses the feelings of the characters very well. they story has a great plot, and is explained perfectly. She kept the story moving and was always an exciting part, even from the beginning. the beginning for most books doesn't start out strong, but this book was strong all the way through. The book couldn't be put down, reading isn't a favorite but there was no I was going to stop reading it. Its an amazing book. The story is about how a boy, Harry Potter, that finds out that he has magical powers and goes to a school to figure them out, and his whole adventure there was interesting, never a dull moment in Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is very entertaining, people who do not even read would be interested in these fictional novels. Mystery, death, wizards, it's a plethora of excitement! As soon as you start your adventure to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and wizardry. You will be captured in the magic by watching Harry's first day at school with friends to coming extremely close to expulsion. If you are a constant reader or someone who barely reads at all. Either way this book and all of the series are books to pick up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have the privilege of claiming discovery before the hype. I first read this book when a girl I was nanny for received it as a present from a friend from England. I was sucked in immediately. The idea of a hidden power, appealing to all children and most adults, drew me in and plot line held me enraptured until the last page. I was truly sad when I finished the last page.Harry is treated as a pest who must do chores by his Aunt and Uncle Dursley. He sleeps in a broom closet and is tormented by his cousin mercilessly. He tries to stay out of trouble, but strange things just happen.Harry begins getting letters one day. His uncle vehemently thwarts Harry's attempts to read any of these letters to the extreme of dragging the family to a deserted, rickety cabin by the sea. Uncle Dursley's discovers his attempts at sequestering his family are in vain when a giant breaks down the cabin's door.The giant, whose name is Hagrid, enlightens Harry that he possesses magical powers and is invited to attend Hogwarts, a school for wizards. Hagrid takes Harry away from his rude relatives and into a wild world of magic.Harry discovers his parents did not die in an automobile crash but were murdered by a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort. He should have been murdered by the same wizard but somehow he survived with only a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead to mark the terrible event.Through the year he meets some friends like Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and he meets his nemeses Draco Malfoy and Sneverous Snape. His exploits are entertaining and good fun for all.I have personally read Harry Potter several times over. My husband has read the book a few times as well as my mother. I can't wait until my son is old enough that we can read about Harry Potter together. It is definitely worth the price we paid for this treasure in our library."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is a good book.In it the heir of slithern is out and petrifing people.Harry and the others figured out what it was tring to do to people.It took Ron's littel sisster Ginny.Harry and Ron went in to thechamber.

I was thinking it would be a little kiddish but this was not the case. I fell in love with Harry Potter. I think J.K. Rowling is a brilliant writer. Such a creative mind to come up with a whole new world, new creatures, new games. Set at the school of Hogwarts, I was amazed of all the secerts and surprises within each chapter of the book. It felt like as I was reading I was lost in this world of magic and mystery. I can't wait to read all the rest of the books..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter book the Sorcerer's Stone written by J.K Rowling is a great book and it is exciting. Harry and Ron Fith, a troll, do all kinds of magic. In this book if you think one thing is going to happen the other is going to happen. It kept you on your toes through the whole book. I think it is better than the the new one because this one is so good. If I were you I would buy it in a hearbeat."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Are you one of the half-dozen or so English readers who have not read Harry Potter yet? I understand, having avoided it until now because it's a children's book focused on occult and fantasy themes, all of which makes me gag. But in a fit of work-aversion, I finally broke down and read it, only to find it impossible to put down. Maybe you will, too. Here at last is an excellent, non-threatening case study in the basics of plot and character development. Rowling breathes life into a dazzling variety of likeable and detestable personalities in a few short lines, which build quickly into rich, layered plots. Forgive her the occasional Tom Swifty and you'll find here a true philosopher's stone that soars well beyond the confines of its genre."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Like most adults without children, I didn't know about the Harry Potter books until the movie was released. I decided to read the book and see how the movie compared to the book. I was blown away by how well this book is written. The character development is exceptional and the flow of the story is easy to follow. The book can be enjoyed by adults and children. Also, the book and the movie are closely aligned which is very surprising. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you've got an imagination, these CDs are better than the movies. You can listen to them to and from work. Makes commuting a lot less stressful and a lot more interesting. The Harry Potter series itself is absolutely awesome. Struggling through good and evil, Harry Potter enchants the imagination and leaves you wondering at the mystery. When the book is done, you'll be looking forward to the next. I personally look forward to the opportunities I have to sit down and listen. All of the story CDs are read by the same narrator and he does voices for the different charectors. The CDs are done very well. Definitely worth the extra money to get them in this format. Even if I'd read all the books, I'd say this format is a worth while purchase."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was happy, sad, exciting....the list could go on and on forever.

Harry Potter is a hero who appeals, not just to children, but to anyone who has ever dreamed of stepping out of their mundane lives and into the realm of magical adventure. Though written for children, I feel this book has a lot to say to adults as well, about their kids, and about themselves. I most enjoyed the mythical elements of the story - like the Star Wars movies - it plays on our most cherished archetypes. I think, were mythology scholar Joesph Campbell still alive he would have loved this book. I know I did. I will be giving it to everyone I know - nieces and nephews, friends and my parents. J.K.

I loved the book especially when he was trying to get the Sorcerer's stone. That was really exciting now am reading the second one.

This is the first book I have ever come across that actually had my daughter and I equally interested in it, what a wonderful story! And what a wonderful joy to share with my 10 year old. Not only did we love the book, but we had such nice conversations talking about what we 'thought' was behind some of the things going on. I would recommend this book to anyone, but most certainly parents who want to share their love of reading with their children! We have started the second book and are thrilled to see there is a third one! These are classics and I will save them so she can read them to her children!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books are good fun, well worth reading, and full of neat stuff (in a wizard's photographs, the people in the photograph don't just stand still: if they're busy they disappear, if they're pleased to see you they wave). Harry Potter isn't just some boring child-hero: he's real, he changes, he misses his parents... and he has neat friends.But why change the title? The original title was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone was an actual medieval concept - a substance that could make you immortal or change &quot;base matter&quot; into gold. The sorcerer's stone is completely meaningless - particularly as, unless they've changed the text of the novel too, the stone is referred to as the Philosopher's Stone throughout."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Im an 11 year old girl who is crazy over Harry Potter.

I'm 15 and I've already read it about three times all the way through. The first night I got it I stayed up all night long finishing it. I just couldn't put the book down!!!!! This was an amazing debut book for Ms. Rowlings. Her plot was fasanating, her descriptions were great, and her characters were the funniest. I REALLY liked all their names, like Dumbledore and Hagrid. And the Weasley twins were hilarious. Oh, yeah, and I would love to be on Hogwort's ball team. Flying through the air on a broom like that sounds like alot of fun, as long as you don't fall off.

My brother told me to buy it because his teacher was reading it in class. I had no idea what it was and when i read it i could not put it down.

That is a great compliment!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Maybe I'm just prejudiced, but I'm one of the few &quot;evil&quot; people in this planet who doesn't like Harry Potter that much.I thought it was funny sometimes, and I thought a lot of the author's ideas were really interesting and exciting, but I just didn't like the book.For example, I didn't like the idea of Slytherin. It seems like the author just wasn't thinking when she decided there would be a whole house for the &quot;bad guys&quot;. I think that's a shallow idea and also kind of cruel. Could you picture standing there and finding out from the Sorting Hat (which NEVER lies) that you're evil? I think Slytherin was probably the biggest mistake in Harry Potter.I think it's kind of sad that people call it the best book ever written. I know everyone has their own opinion, but I think there are so many books that are better in every way with no contest and a lot of Harry Potter fans refuse to believe it. It bothers me that some people are so brainwashed by Hogwarts that they won't even try to find out if there are other, better, books.I think J.K. Rowling has her own creative, exciting, and charming style, but sometimes she loses it when she tries too hard to be like Roald Dahl (who I think is a better author than she is.)I recommend Harry Potter as a fun book to read, but I don't think anyone should let it control them.OK, I'll shut up now.

Evocative of much great fantasy of the past (and dealing with many of the same themes of intergenerational power, love, loss, and vengeance), it tells a solid and exciting story on its own terms while at the same time setting up the characters and situations for the rest of the series very nicely.Rowling's prose, while hardly high-flying, has the gift of grabbing readers quite effectively by the emotions and the imagination. Many of the details of the magical world she creates are reminiscient of Roald Dahl in their playfulness and sense of wonder."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i liked the book because it was fantasy.it was very enjoyable,not like some books that are a drag to read.i hope the other book in the series are this good!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My wife bought the first two Harry Potter books for me last Christmas because I had mentioned that I was interested in finding out what all the fuss was about. The answer? Not much. This is nothing more than an engaging, if shallow, tale about a misfit who makes good. Nothing different or more enlightening than any of a thousand other books already out there.Harry is a semi-likeable guy. He doesn't cause any grief or put anyone in terrible danger, and he's a hell of a Qwiddich player, but that's about it. The rest of the book is fairly standard fare, easily cribbed from any of a dozen other children's books from the last quarter-century."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am very impressed with Rowling's work. She is a very talented author! You don't see many works like &quot;Harry Potter&quot; anymore. It's so refreshing to see the fairy-tale books popping back up for kids again. She creates an impossible little world of magick which is both funny, sad, scary, and altogether charming. These books were not to be aimed only at children. It creates a lot of humor and plots the adults and teenagers would enjoy. While entertaining, it had its serious side. I cried at one part. I was thinking it was a children's book, but there are some pretty freaky things in there! It reminds me of the old fairy tales, and is thus wonderful. Rowling is able to word the story in a impressive wording in an easy-to-understand format.

The story does encourage fantasy and imagination, but in the end it's your basic good triumphs over evil. Reality should be that straight forward.

If your years of parental guidance in the hopes of raising your children right is threatened by one (or a series of) fantasy book(s), then I ask that you re-examine your relationship with your children. Do they have more respect for your love and guidance, or the fantasy world of a book? If it appears to be the latter case, then you'd better make some more quality time with your kids first so you can avoid end up blaming the Charles Manson bedsheets and ritual pet sacrifices on a children's book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Maybe I don't get it.

A Brilliant book - definitely read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd recommend this imaginative little book to any (unadventurous) child under the age of twelve. S/he won't learn anything from it, but as an alternative to \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and other dreck TV, it's solid, inoffensive fun. To others, though, the book could be instructive. Some adults--ambitious, mercenary, would-be writers--will find an object lesson here.The lesson: stick with the tried and true. If you want to be praised for \\"originality,\\" just reach a little further back for your literary models. Rowling herself was a failed writer for years before she struck her gold mine: the English schoolboy serials of the early 20th century.George Orwell describes these stories--which were hugely popular in England and its colonies for over 30 years--in his great essay \\"Boys' Weeklies.\\" They were all set entirely at posh boarding schools, hence their fantasy snob appeal: most of their readers could only dream about attending such places. The school rites, rules, customs of daily life, etc., were enshrined in fetishistic detail. For thousands of children, and adults, too--to judge from the weeklies' uproarious letter columns--these self-contained (and mostly imaginary) worlds held a mystical fascination that bordered on obsession.The typical heroes of these stories were titled (that is, bluebloods, with family in the peerage) and filthy rich. Their friends and foes were a variety of types: the plodding boy who's good-hearted and loyal, though a trifle melodramatic; the hand-raising pedant, who nevertheless shows pluck in a crisis; the villainous swell... Sound familiar? The teachers, too, were a menagerie of types, many of them eccentric and mysterious, a few not what they seemed (foreign spies, master thieves, etc.), but by and large, wise and benevolent. The plots consisted of mild pranks, curfew-breaking, besting bullies, solving quaint mysteries of the school, and so on. Sports and team spirit (and \\"house spirit\\") were, of course, all-important, and unshirking respect for those institutions was a given. The stories did not confront real life (even real school life)--or real emotion--in any shape or form except the most sentimental.These serials lost their readers by the late '30s because they were excessively \\"polite.\\" Kids turned to power-trip fantasies about gun-toting brutes (commandos, explorers, detectives, \\"Doc Savage\\") whose exploits were faster and more sensational, more \\"life-and-death.\\" Rowling's bit of genius was to throw both genres into the same pulper. The result: life-and-death power-trips set within the cozy, hallowed halls of a prestigious school. The hero is still a blueblood: Harry's magical destiny, the aura of Promise he carries into Hogwarts (symbolized by his scar, which is a throwback to the \\"royal\\" birthmark or tattoo of the pulps), is entirely a legacy of his powerful parents. The wealth fantasy of the earlier stories has become the even sadder one of having magical powers. And so the stories have cringed even further away from real life.Harry's beginnings as a transplanted orphan are another appeal to fantasy. The young reader can imagine that he too was born to greatness; that his own, loathsome family and school-life are amendable accidents; that any day now an owl will swoop from his chimney with certified proof of his true pedigree as a doyen of magical omnipotence--and vengeance.So--what should kids be reading instead of this stuff? How about: something exciting, with fantasy elements, yet still grounded in the real world--and with a dash of irony, to bring it all further down to earth? (I reject the doctrine that children are deaf to irony, which is a necessary ingredient of intelligence). My humble suggestion: give them the \\"Flashman\\" books of George Macdonald Fraser. This series of novels (the latest one appeared just last year), about a Victorian adventurer and coward, are thrilling, hilarious, eye-opening, and educational in every sense--historically, culturally, psychologically. Any child who has ever felt a little nauseated by the sententious, schoolyard call to conform and embrace \\"team spirit,\\" will take to them readily--and become far more historically astute than his classmates (especially the ones who dream of playing \\"quidditch\\"). Oddly, Fraser lifted his anti-hero, Harry Flashman, from a 19th century \\"schoolboy\\" tale that was also one of Rowling's models: \\"Tom Brown's School Days,\\" by Thomas Hughes. Flashman was the sadistic bully who made Tom's school life a living hell. Hogwarts could use someone like him. Actually it does have something comparable, but he doesn't show much promise. In a hundred years, will Draco Malfoy have his own novels?I doubt it. But then, I'd be very surprised if \\"Harry Potter\\" is still read by anyone (other than nostalgia-buffs) in thirty years' time... even after Rowling has used her gazillion merchandising dollars to restore the British Empire to its full whimsy of cream buns, cold baths and cringing menials, with herself as Queen..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing of the Harry Potter craze for a while, I finally decided to check out the books. I was able to get all four form the public library. I whizzed through the first three, and was in the middle of the fourth when my parents decided that I had read enough fantasy for a while, and I had to put the books down. My dad recently fowarded me an article on the Harry Potter books, and after reading it, I could see that my parents were right to have me stop reading the books. In the article, the author points out that, although the Harry Potter book may seem harmless at first sight, their message is more subtle and twisted. The books uphold the philosophy of revenge (Harry wants revenge against his mean foster family and a rival at school) and the witch craft in the book, while unique, has taken a darker turn. Harry finds that he has certain characteristics that compare with Voldemort, his mortal enemy and the murderer of his parents. Later on in the series, the books seem to hint that your best friend may be your worst enemy, instilling a sense of distrust into children and teens alike. Although the Harry Potter books claim to be children's books, I think that it takes somene more mature than a child to perceive and deal with the underlying message of J.K. Rowling's books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a wonderful book that I couldn't put it down. If u haven't read Harry Potter yet you must read it!

At first I was very impressed. I could see that Rowling had an ability to write in a way that would draw young readers into a classic children's story, and to also maintain a bit of ironic distance and light humor from the proceedings, thus pleasing older readers. I was floored by the marvelous world (within our world) that she creates - the Hogwarts School, the whole business of boys and girls being educated to become wizards and witches, the game of Quidditch, the houses of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat, etc. That really was a bit of genius, and one that many other writers wish had come to them first. But as the book went on, it seemed like the childish side of the storytelling took control, and this adult reader began to lose interest. The business of Harry being marked for greatness from the beginning, the way he very quickly becomes one of the top kids at the school, the confrontation with the evil professor and Voldemort at the end - all this struck me as being fairly contrived, but something that a reader below the age of 13 might like a lot.

RowlingReview by Tara JohnsonElizabeth WallaceMeggan FreshourCrystal MathesonStep up to the Platform nine and three-quarters and you enter a world-within-a-world via the vividly descriptive writing style of J.K. Rowling in the first book of an amazing series titled \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". From the beginning, the reader will know that there's something different about this boy who lands at 4 Privet Drive, \\"the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen\\" (Rowling, 17). It is here where we first begin to befriend our hero, \\"Harry Potter- the boy who lived\\" (Rowling, 17). Eleven year-old Harry Potter, who lives in the cupboard under the stairs, is immediately likeable when you learn about the dysfunctional Dursley family he lives with. Harry's Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley make you wish for Harry to be able to escape to another world.As the story unfolds you may feel like a muggle yourself when trying to follow the mysterious conversations between people of other worldly names. You may not understand owl messengers at first, but as you spend more time in Diagon Alley you become more and more comfortable in Harry's magical world. The book is so descriptive you actually feel that you are a part of the story setting. Once at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Harry finds true friends in Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. It is at Hogwart's where the reader becomes aware of Harry's magical destiny. The Headmaster and mystical teacher, Albus Dumbledore provides Harry with knowledge and support to gain the self-confidence to battle the dark lord, you-know-who.The story continues to captivate the reader with, fantastical characters, like Nearly Headless Nick; magical creatures, such as Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback dragon; and mysterious riddles in the third floor corridor that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are eager to solve. What is so exciting about the youngster's world is that the reader becomes a part of their team and is just as eager to learn the spells that will help Harry succeed in his quest of good over evil.Even though the events in the muggle world take place in the 21st century, the wizarding world exists as a parallel universe only visited through a portal or port key. This element of a secondary world represents genre of high fantasy perfectly. Some characters of the story have more transparent personalities than others. On the other hand, you also meet characters with more opaque personalities, and you can't be sure if it is true darkness you are looking into when you encounter events that surround them. With this element of suspense, the mystery genre emerges and continues to appear throughout the story. Potions master, Professor Snape is one such mysteriously opaque personality. The antagonist gang of students Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle give the reader a chance to completely dislike characters of the story, while characters like Hagrid the giant give the reader hope that looks can be deceiving.It is easy to see why this book has been on the national bestseller list and has won multiple book awards. J.K. Rowling is able to transport the readers to Harry's world and gives us the opportunity to wield our imaginative powers to help our friend triumph over evil. Through reading Harry Potter, many people discover not only the magical wizarding world, but also the magical world of reading.BibliographyRowling, J.K. (1998). Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone. New York: Scholastic Press."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At this point in time (late 2009), what can one say about the first Harry Potter book? Almost everyone must know the story by now, so what is left to say? Well, I'll put my two cents in on why one might want to read it as an adult so late in the game by telling why I did it.I went to see the movie corresponding to this book when it came out - that was late 2001 I guess - and really enjoyed it. Didn't think of reading the book, since it was a kid's book, and I was over 40. A co-worker soon after admitted to me that she was reading or had read the book and that it was very good.Later, I saw the second movie and found it a little hard to follow and thought that the books might be worth reading before seeing the films. Since I had seen the first two movies and was short on time, I started reading with the third book. After that, I read all the later books as they were available and saw the movies as they came out in theaters. Recently, when I saw the 6th movie, I decided that maybe I would read the first two books and watch those movies again as the series was almost over and maybe I did miss something.I finished the first book today. It was very good as most people know already. From what I can remember, the movie followed it pretty closely, but I think I did pick up some details that I had missed. I congratulate the author for her wonderful contribution to literature and movies - for children and otherwise.One thing that I will say to an adult who is hesitating to read this or any book in the series is this. They aren't written all that simply, and there are some good vocabulary words thrown in now and then. As the series progresses, I think the author wrote aiming at an older audience as well - in subject matter, style and length.One thing about this first book that an adult might notice that is a little off is that it was weak on continuity from one chapter to the next here and there. That is, it seemed more like several closely related short stories strung together than one coherent story at times. This was not the case in the later books from what I saw. This may be because the author had so much to introduce to get the series going and/or it was to keep a younger audience from getting bogged down otherwise.The author did a great job in making the wizard world seem all so real. It was great fun - maybe as adults we could all use a little more of that in our lives, especially when times are tough otherwise.I'm glad I read this one and look forward to reading the second book and re-watching the first two movies before seeing the final two movies due out in future. Well done, Ms. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"LOVED THIS BOOK AND RECEIVED IT IN GREAT SHAPE. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ADVENTURE!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I know the world probably doesn't need a 5301st review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this book, so I felt compelled to share.In many respects, I'm probably the last person who would enjoy this book. I'm a cynic by nature, and my reading habits lean more towards the darker, more mature series by Stephen King and George R.R. Martin. I also tend to have a knee-jerk reaction to anything so roundly embraced by such a wide audience. I mean, how cool can something be if everyone is into it? Still, as someone who grew up reading C.S. Lewis and practically worshipping the (good) Star Wars movies, I have a soft spot for a good fantasy tale. I ended up watching the first Harry Potter movie and loving it, so I decided to give the books a try.I know some people argue against seeing the movie before reading the book, but in this case it was a real benefit. I was able to jump into the book with a clear picture of what Harry and his pals looked like, and there were more than a few occasions that brought John Williams' powerful soundtrack to mind. Sure, I knew how the book would end, but getting there proved to be a real treat.J.K. Rowling has created a delightful world of magic and mystery, with a compelling cast of characters you'll come to love (or hate) almost instantly. I readThe Books of Magicgraphic novel several years ago, so the concept of a bespectacled young wizard apprentice with a pet owl isn't entirely new to me, but the idea of a parallel world of magic with wizard academies, magical sports, and enchanted candies was a breath of fresh air.There are times when it is obvious that this is the author's first work. The story is a bit predictable, and she doesn't take a lot of chances. Still, this is a very impressive first novel, and further volumes in the series read like the work of a seasoned professional. Besides, I like to think that some of the wonder and enjoyment I felt reading these pages came from the sense that the author was also experiencing this world and its characters for the first time while writing them.For me, the real test of a book's strength is whether or not I want to read it again. Most books get read once and traded in. I've already read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone three times and have upgraded to the hardcover version. And the best part is that the series gets progressively better with each new volume. As good as book 1 is, book 2 is even better.Younger readers certainly don't need me to point out something they knew from the start, but hopefully this review will help persuade some of the people like me who still cling to the notion that a children's book can't possibly be enjoyable to us oh so sophisticated adults. Reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is like reaching back and grabbing onto some of the magic of childhood, which is something I think we all can use from time to time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a compelling character in an exciting book series. If you haven't already checked it out, you are missing out on a classic tale of magical adventure.In addition to the Sorcerer's Stone, check out the other books in the Harry Potter series. It is one of my favorites, which also include the Narnia series (you should start with the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe), the Oz series (Which starts with the Wizard of Oz), the Abacar the Wizard series (Which starts with Abacar the Wizard) and the Xanth series (Which begins with A Spell for Chameleon). Each of these series is filled with interresting characters, magic and adventure. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After reading all of the Harry Potter series that is currently available, I decided to look back at this first book and see why I loved it so much. While attempting to skin its contents, I once again became so enchanted by the story that I read every word, from beginning to end. This is a fabulous book, filled to the brim with literacy and fantasy, and I get the feeling I will love it every time I read it. I recommend it to anyone with an open imagination who is in need of a good, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":".The first book in the series, The Sorcerer's Stone, was one I was pressured into reading. I had purchased Goblet of Fire (book 4) through my daughter's Scholastic catalog, and had started reading it to make sure it was appropriate for her age (she was about 6 or 7). Then, my sister's friend Amy called to answer a few research questions for me and we got on the subject of the books. I'd told her I couldn't quite get into the intro of Goblet. She told me I HAD TO READ THEM IN ORDER. She was so enthusiastic, that I went out and bought Sorcerer's the next day. I read it in one sitting, feeling completely enthralled and excited about reading for the first time in years. The writing was stellar, but JK is a master storyteller. I found the intricate details of the world so exciting and fresh that I was turning pages even while stirring that night's supper. That first trip to Diagon Alley, arrival at Hogwarts, seeing it all for the first time through Harry's eyes. It was the definition of magical reading.I won't insult anyone by giving a synopsis. Unless you've been under a rock for the last 10 years, you know what Sorcerer's Stone is about. But I will say that the afternoon I finished SS, I went out and bought Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. I read them all within a week and still wanted more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My mom bought this book for me about 6 years ago. This was before all the hype about Harry Potter and all the movies, and so I'd never heard of J.K. Rowling before. For some reason, I didn't begin reading this book right away and it made it to the bottom of my pile. One day, on a hot, boring summer morning, I pulled Sorcerer's Stone from the bottom of the pile and opened it up.As soon as I began to read it, I was completely captured by Rowling's world. I started reading this in the morning and I stayed up until early morning the next day and didn't go to sleep until I had finished it. After this, I knew I HAD to get the other books in the series.I know this book is geared towards younger kids, but I've known kids of all ages to read these books. Not only that, but my grandmother asked to read all of the books after I was finished, and my mom enjoyed reading this to my younger brothers. Although it is not written on a particularly challening level, people of all ages and different backgrounds can relate to this story.Rowling doesn't talk down to her intended younger audience, and because of that, she tells it like it is. You go through each experience with Harry, feeling all of his ups and downs along with him. I remember feeling nervous and extremely tense along with him when Harry went to put on the Sorting Hat and he didn't know what would happen. I was enchanted right along with him when learning more about the world of wizards that he'd missed out on for the first 11 years of his life.The plot of this book is not completely original, and I'm sure readers can find many books out there with similar plots to this one. However, in the fantasy genre, that's only to be expected. What makes authors like Rowling stand out from others is her original characters, her way of telling everything as it is and her wonderful creativity that brought the world of Harry Potter together.I would reccommend this book to anyone of any age looking for some time to sit back, relax and spend some time in a marvelous fantasy world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Many great books have been made into movies and more often than not the movie is a disappointment. In this particular case I happened to see the movie long before I read the book and although I really liked the movie, I absolutely loved this book. I realize that this is a children's book but do not make the mistake of passing this story up no matter how old you happen to be.The story itself is fairly well known and requires no rehashing from me. There are however bits of information and subtle nuances to be found in the book that are missing from the movie. One example would be Professor Snape's extremely negative reaction to Harry Potter from the very first day that the two met. In both the movie and the book Snape's hostility to Potter was used as a tool to build toward the climax but the movie never bothered to explain. I clearly remember leaving the theater wondering about this and now the book has cleared everything up. I also found that the entire first chapter of the book is missing from the movie and it is a delightful chapter that really should not be missed.This is one of the most imaginative books that I have come across in years. Ms. Rowling has created an entire world and has painted for her readers a vivid colorful picture of this wonderful world. Just how many people other than this author would think of giving the name Fluffy to a giant three-headed dog?Adding even more luster to this glittering new world are the marvelous characters that inhabit it. Seldom in any form of literature will one run across a more brilliantly portrayed cast of characters. Each and every character literally jumps off of the page to become as lifelike as can be. The author's inability to create an enchanting cast of characters has been the downfall of many a good story but Ms. Rowling has passed this test with flying colors.Children are obviously captivated by this book but I urge my fellow adults to avoid the pitfall of dismissing this as merely a children's book. I can't say that you will be a better person for having read this book but I think that I can say with certainty that you will find it to be a very fun read. I know that I did!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter. A lot of people love it, while others, such as literary critic Harold Bloom, hate J.K. Rowling's work. Mind you, Harold Bloom hates a lot of fiction, including his own.I remember the first time I heard about Harry Potter, it featured on the news here, I think around the time the novel \\"Goblet of Fire\\" came out. All these excited little kids were cheering for him, and telling the journalists random facts about Harry's adventures. I thought to myself, \\"why would you name a series of books that sounds so much like Beatrix Potter\\" (author of the Peter Rabbit books). Some time later, I saw an episode of \\"Just Shoot Me\\", where in one scene David Spade's character was eagerly reading \\"Goblet of Fire\\", struggling to put it down. Then, talk of the movies came, then the movies themselves, then the merchandise. Both my ex - girlfriend and my girlfriend are fans, and I have resisted reading them for so long. The other day I finally gave in, and promised myself I'd at least read the first three, beginning with \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\".After reading it, I can see why people love it so much, but I can also see people hate it. I don't see myself becoming a feverish sort of fan, but I like it.Harry is a young English boy, an orphan who lives in the cupboard of the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, and gets a regular beating from his cousin Dudley. It's a miserable sort of life, until he finds out that a certain Hogwarts School of Wizardry wants him to enrol. It turns out that his parents were wizards, who died trying to save his life, and that he's rather a celebrity in the secretive world of the wizards. The book describes his first year at the school, eating magic sweets, collecting cards of famous wizards, playing Quidditch (a complicated wizard sport played on flying broomsticks), getting house points, and solving a mystery, getting in a lot of trouble while he's at it. He makes friends, discovers enemies and encounters many creatures from mythology on the way (centaurs, unicorns, goblins, etc).One thing I noticed was Rowling's way of getting certain facts about her wizardy world into the reader's head. I remember, for instance, that first year students at Hogwarts are allowed to bring either an owl, a toad or a cat with them, but only one. It's not like I found that quirky little fact any more interesting than the others, but it stuck in my head. Almost infectious. There were a lot of other little tidbits like this, and yet the parts of the book that you were supposed to read and forget (like things that Harry notices while doing something but forgets later on) I forgot too. That's not to say the writing's perfect, there were a few weird descriptions of things (\\"feet like dolphins\\" is one that springs to mind). Still, that doesn't happen that often.I liked the idea that Hogwarts was like an English boarding school, complete with houses, house points, school sports and text books. Though I'm Australian, I did spend some time in a private school that was rather like the English ones for a couple of years, and could relate to the vibe of the place described here.I like most of the characters too - slightly awkward Ron, Hermione so eager to please, the friendly Hagrid with his English farmer accent, the sagely Dumbledore, the snapping Professor Snape, stammering Professor Quirell on the verge of a breakdown. Harry, the main character, I found harder to understand. He starts off as a character down on his luck, unable and unwilling to fight back, but on coming to Hogwarts he rather suddenly becomes a lot braver. Where does all this bravery come from? He kind of feels things all of a sudden, reacts to them. This could be seen as a flaw, I suppose, but I remember when I was eleven and a LOT of my friends were like this. Children aren't as complex as adults, after all. Perhaps I'll understand Harry more as I read more books in the series and he grows.I did annoy me a little that Harry was famous in his world almost from the start. Whenever a character gets famous in their world (particularly in fantasy) they always become a little more distant, harder to relate to, and it doesn't help that Harry gets this kind of distance from the reader right off the bat.A lot of the negative reviews here, some of them were a little strange to me. I didn't think it was supposed to be classic literature, or even \\"high\\" fantasy. It's an adventure story. I didn't see the fact that the wizard community hid things from the Muggle (ordinary community) as racist, its kind of like what they do in the film \\"Men in Black\\" and no one had a problem with that. As for the whole \\"Harry Potter is promoting witchcraft\\" angle, I didn't see it in this book, it is obvious that it is not the real world, there is no line like \\"maybe YOU can go to Hogwarts one day\\" hinting that it even could be. I've read children's fantasies that have much, MUCH stronger occult trappings than this, but probably because they were not one tenth as popular as Harry Potter they didn't get so lobbied against, if at all. Mind you, I do hear these books get darker, so I'll keep an eye out.A pretty enjoyable book. Worth a look, just to see what all the fuss is about. It won't take too long to read (not this one anyway)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I despise events that are hyped up. Whether it is a film or a book or a television show, if their is a lot of hype, odds are it is going to disappoint. So I try to just avoid almost everything that is very hyped or has a prominent reputation in the public eye.People have been trying to get me to read the Harry Potter books for a couple years now, and I just never really wanted to. Yes, I enjoy fantasy books a great deal, especially anthologies (LOTR, Narnia, etc.), but there was still part of me that was saying \\"nah, those books are for kids.\\" Well that statement is true, these books are for children, but they are also entertaining and fun for adults.The first book of the series doesn't disappoint in any way. You instantly become attached to the three main character, and are left wishing for more of certain background characters (Snape, Dumbledore, You-Know-Who, etc.). The main plot of this book doesn't even really start until about two-thirds of the way through the novel. It is mostly about Harry adjusting to life at Hogwart's and the life of a \\"first year\\" in a high school that is normal in pretty much every way, except for the whole wizardry thing.Maybe the best part of the first book is the apparent social undertones that J.K. Rowling does a good job to keep out of the limelight, but visible to the discerning eye. As I embark on a research paper on the Harry Potter books, and their social meanings, it's good to know that the author of the primary source knew what she was doing when she wrote the novels. Understandable for children, meaningful for adults, and entertaining for both."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This unforgettable novel penetrates every corner of the imagination. The characters brilliantly come to life, and the plot is as original as anything I've ever read. The element of magic is introduced slowly, giving the reader time to become familar with it and therefore focus on more important components of this incredible story. There is an absolutely thrilling climax where Harry and his friends face a frightening villan. Quite a few moral lessons are given, but not in a preachy way. This is a must read, even for the poor people who don't enjoy children's fantasy. It is already a true classic, and hopefully will be remembered as one of the greatest children's books of all time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have heard many people say J.K. Rowlings is a wonderful writer. However, I believe there is a difference between great writers and good story tellers. Rowlings is a good storyteller. She has created a world of magic, with characters that kids will remember. The stories are fun. They may not hold up to such classics as Hemingway, Austen or Tolstoy, but most people want a little diversity in their reading anyways. And a very important thing to remember for all the adults out there expecting something that compares to the classics--these are CHILDREN'S books.The hype that is built up around these books is perhaps disproportionate to the quality, in the true nature of most hype. Harry Potter has become a pop icon--and like all pop icons, not everyone will appreciate him. Most people do, but no one can guarantee that you will enjoy these books. So, if you're curious, either buy it or borrow it from a friend and give it a try."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter and the socerer's stone is a excellent imaginative book about a boy who goes to a school to teach him magic.

Being the mother that I am, that was pretty much enough to make me run right out and buy all three books for my daughter. I don't agree with the parents/readers that commented that the books are much to 'violent' for children to read. I would much rather my child read this book than watch the evening news anyday of the week. As her parent, I thought it was my job to discuss the world around us with her, not sheild her from it and have her be shocked by it when she reaches adulthood.I'll continue to read each book before her to ensure that it's something I am comfortable with her reading, because really, it should be MY choice, not the choice of a bunch of closed-minded people."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Everyone loves Harry Potter. I, who prefer realistic fiction, love Harry Potter. My best friend, who likes authors the like of Ray Brdbury, loves Harry Potter.

In fact, ALL my friends from camp love Harry Potter. My friend who needs things to read loves Harry Potter. My aunt, who works at a Barnes and Nobles, loves Harry Potter. EVERYONE LOVES HARRY POTTER!

And the hero has glasses! No stereotypes there! Also, Ron and ?Harry's best friend is a girl. As a girl whose best friend is a boy, I appreciate that. Also, i think the story of how the author read the book is pretty amazing! She was in welfare and wrote iton one of those yellow pads at a coffee shop. Then, boom!

Overall, it's an okay book. It isn't a classic, but it's pretty good. For people who hate it and say it's absolutely fake and horrible, I would have to disagree. It isn't horrible, but it isn't outstanding either. What bothers me is when people fall in love with it and read it only because it's popular. They claim it's the best book ever and they can't wait for the next one and it's so, so awesome, and I can tell that they have bought into all the hype surrounding Harry Potter. People should actually think about what they read, not just read it because it's a fad or because they get an excitement high from it. Harry Potter is taking the spotlight and drawing attention away from the true classics. Of course, this isn't the author's fault, but it is true. Harry Potter is decent, but not brilliant.

It was then that I realized that I had hardcover versions of every book except the first. So of course, I hopped on Amazon, ordered this book and it arrived promptly [the next day]. I've read all except the last book at this point, and if there's one thing that I can say, it's that Harry Potter has changed my life.If you're here looking for a review of the story, just know this.

Just a good sense of fun throughout."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I believe the Harry Potter series is the best children's book series ever. There are so many things to like about it. By now you know this is about a boy, who discovers he is a wizard. He also is prophesied to deal with the most evil wizard around. This all plays out over 7 books and about 7 years in his life.What I am unduly awed by is:* the way the reading level of the books advances with the reader. Book one is relatively short and more simply written. Each book progesses in complexity (plot, language) and length.* critical plot points are introduced throughout the books, although the reader may not realize it at the time* there are so many meaty themes that can be discussed with children: prejudice, faith, family, friendships, the power of choice* well-developed characters, ones we love and ones we hate and some we're just not sure aboutThe first book is filled with wonder as Harry discovers he's a wizard, escapes the Dursley family (temporarily) and enjoys new friendships (that are family replacements) at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love all of the Harry Potter books. I have this one on hard copy as I do all the others because I just couldn't wait for the paperbacks to come out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"To paraphrase Jackson Pearce, you'd have to be living under a sorcerer's stone if you were not aware that the last Harry Potter movie is due out this summer. Very soon in fact! So with that in mind, I decided to make my way through the books and the movies to prepare myself for this final big event - the last movie and our farewell to Harry and his friends.When these books first came out I had no interest in them. None. My siblings were all in an uproar (my sister was also 11, so she's grown up with Harry) but I dismissed the books as fanciful nothings, young adult fiction, psh when would I ever want to read that? I mean, at that time I was caught up in the fantastic world of romance novels. (Yes, that was sarcastic and true at the same time!)But then, around the release of the fourth book, I decided to pick up the series and see what all the fuss was about. Since that first reading of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I've read the book four times (one of those times out loud to my niece and nephew), and every time the book just gets better and better, and I think a large part of that is due to the movies.Now, I'll first say that yes, a lot of the original books didn't make it into the movies, specifically for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I missed Peeves, the potions Hermione has to get through to help Harry stop Quirrell, the introduction of Malfoy in the train (and not on the steps) and little details here and there (such as explaining to Harry where the pictures came from in the book Hagrid gives him at the end). But overall, I think the movie did a fantastic job of bringing to life the wonder, excitement and awe I felt while reading the book. I loved the portrayal of Quidditch and the main dining hall at Hogwarts, and I still catch my breath at that first sweeping view of the school.In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the weakest of the books, in terms of development - but it also captures the innocence of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and grabs the reader by the hand and gently introduces them into the world of Hogwarts, allowing time for us to catch our breath and relax into it all. That's the best way to introduce children to the world of fantasy and Rowling did a marvelous job.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, in closing at least, how much I've also come to appreciate Dudley, and the Dursley's. They add comedy to the stories, but also that necessary anchor to the \\"muggle\\" world - the other side of what might have been had Harry's mother not been magical.Feel free to join me in the next several days as I read, watch and review these books and movies. You do not need to read or watch every one, or do both, or.. well, do whatever you wish and chime in with your thoughts, your hopes for the upcoming movies and how you plan to fill the void after the last movie has been watched."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter, while he doesn't know it now, is full of perseverance, especially in later books, but you can see it now. He takes things head on, never backing down. That is what I like most about him. He always makes sure he does what is called of him. Never giving excuses as to why he can't.In this book we are introduced to characters, the forbidden forest, Voldemort (gasp!), the Invisibility Cloak, Quidditch, and many other things that we have all come to know and love.

The book, much to its benefit, opens the reader to a much larger world and series. The series is what makes Harry Potter good, not the writing or interesting characters. This book was well-written in terms of public appeal, and should not be considered to be a highly literary work.

Unfair treatment from relatives - yes, it starts with that - sets the scene for unprecedented adventure. From invisible trains, a boarding school for the magically inclined, and the struggle against evil , this first book in the Harry Potter series makes you want to read about his adventures forever. It's not just for children. It's for people who enjoy fantasy,fun and affection. This book is really funny, too. A great quick-read for adults and a charming, accessible epic for children, only without the poetry.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read and re-read this book multiple times and obviously love it. Briefly this is the first book of seven and we are introduced to the world of Hogwarts. Ms Rowling does a wonderful job of capturing the reader from the very start with the scene of the day Voldemort kills Harry's parents. Even though they don't really place a large part in the books, the Dursleys are what makes Harry the person you cheer for. For those of you who have no clue the Dursleys are the evil foster parents of Harry--his aunt (his mother's sister), his uncle (her husband) and his cousin, his only living relatives and they are certainly a work of art. Harry gets to escape them and go to Hogwarts where he makes friends and enemies, has a great adventure, and learns more about his past.But to continue on, what makes this book review get the tongue-in-cheek name Magical. Well, because it transports you out of everyday life and makes you really care about the characters. Because when I first read it, some 14 years ago, I couldn't put it down because I just knew Harry was going to get in big trouble or Snape was going to kill him or Snape was going to bring back Voldemort and all his army or Harry was going to be thrown out of school...in summary the possibilities were endless because well I didn't know who Harry was (more of that in the next book) and I wasn't really sure if he was going to be the good guy or the bad guy.In Summary: Lay aside all you preconceived notions and enter the magical world of Harry Potter for it is a multi-layered tale with something for all ages, and that is why it made Ms Rowling wealthy is because it is really a great read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm in the 7th grade, and I thought that out of the many books I've ever read, this was by far the best.

Ron is the runt of his family and doesn't get the credit he deserves. This book is full of adventures...and gives all the characters a chance to star. AT the end of every chapter there was always something that puzzled you and made you want to keep reading. Our brother GRant liked Harrybecause he was the star of all the adventures.

However, listening to the book is a very different experience than reading the book. For one, there are those &quot;proper&quot; English pronounciations that my eye interpreted differently for my ear (It's not &quot;Hay-grid&quot;, but &quot;Hah-grid&quot;), and the audio corrected. Secondly, Dale's interpretation of Hermione's voice also gave me a different slant on her, as it did on other characters. He often had characters say Harry's name &quot;Ha-reeeeeeeee&quot;, which somehow came across as much more British than my American idea of how to address him. It is through listening to the audiobook that you begin to appreciate how these books are perhaps slightly to certainly better when read aloud, especially with a masterful story-teller like Dale. I happened to like Chamber of Secrets better (both print and audio) than Socerer's Stone, but part of that could be that the first book spends a lot of time setting the stage and introducing the characters. The real action comes later. Still, Dale seemed to enjoy reading the second book better than the first. OVerall, I recommend that you get the audiobook and add it to your ever-growing Potter library. Better to buy the tape than the ensuing paraphrenalia that will soon be robbing our wallets. Dale IS truly Jim Dandy in his character portrayals!Oh, if long car trip is in your future and you don't plan to get there by magic, listen to the audiotape to while away the time!

Rowling's brilliant saga of 7 volumes, 6 of which have been released. This is my favorite book series, so great that I have read each one at least 3 times.It's about, of course, a boy named Harry Potter who's parents were killed by a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldemort tried to kill Harry, but for some reason (the books work their way into explaining) the curse rebounded onto Voldemort, and ended his reign of evil. Some didn't believe he was actually dead, however. For this reason, Harry is famous in the Wizarding World. But as Harry was only 1 when this happened, he was sent to live with his muggle (non-wizard) aunt and uncle who despised magic and never told him of his past. Harry is treated badly by them; his room being a closet under the stairs, wearing his over-weight cousin's old clothes, improperly fed, etc.Harry notices that he has done some unexplainable things, which are explained when the huge, friendly, Hagrid comes to tell him he has been accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Uncertainly and first, Harry attends this boarding school, and discovers that he is famous. He and his friends also discover that Hagwarts is guarding something and that someone is trying to steal it. He and his two best friends have an exciting year, and Harry comes face to face with Lord Voldemort toward the end.Each one of the books takes place during one of Harry's years at Hogwarts, and during each one Harry grows and becomes more aware of the dangers of the world in which dark wizards have part. As the books progress, you stop thinking of Harry as just a boy in a world of magic, and he's doing all this cool stuff. J.K. Rowling really developed this story and thought it through to its tiniest detail before she began writing the books. And it will show, for those who will read all of the books, and get deep into the real story. As Harry grows and becomes aware of more things, the story does as well, and all the sudden it doesn't seem like a child's story anymore. I'm getting ahead of myself. That's sort of describing the series as a whole. Anyway, the best way to know is to read them.I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy of any sort at all. I only know of one person who hasn't gobbled up the books once they've started.I hope that you enjoy them, and eagerly await the release of the 7th."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was one of my favorite books i have ever read in my life i think everyone should read this book.

Well, Im glad a friend gave me a copy thinking I might enjoy it. I definitely did.While this isnt my usual reading material, it reminded me a lot of a series I enjoyed as a child by Piers Anthony. Those books also revolved around a land ruled by magic. In the Potter series the land is replaced by a school, Hogwarts, but it's otherwise similar in style.Rawlings did a wonderful job of describing the terrible living conditions Harry had while living with his aunt and uncle and the thrill he experienced while first exploring his new life at Hogwarts.While it was fun reading this, people older than 14 might find some of it a little childish but, hey, the target for this series were children in the first place. Approach it in the right spirit and you'll have as much fun as I did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is probably the best way to describe this book. Few books are so accessible to such a wide variety of readers. Everyone I know who has read it loves it; guys, gals, adults, teenagers, children, high school teachers, sci-fi fans, literature professors, and people who've never read a book in their life. The book has everything; comedy, tragedy, drama, irony, comeuppance, action, suspense and terror. This book to children's literature is like Star Wars to movies; you mix in all the tried-and-true ingredients, edit it well and boom; out comes a great product. Lets examine these ingredients one by one to see what we can learn about this phenomena, and Western culture in general.First, Harry is an orphan. What other popular stories do we know about an orphan? Bambi, Superman, Batman and Cinderalla quickly come to mind.Second, Harry is kind of nerdish; with his glasses and foppish hair. Sounds quite similar to Peter Parker (Spiderman)...?Third, he leaves his adopted family and comes into the mentorship of a group of older, wiser, unrelated, but sincere and caring individuals. Kind of like Bilbo and later Frodo with Gandalf, the young King Arthur with Merlin, and of course the various individuals in the Bible and other religious texts who leave their home and family to serve God's will.Fourth, he has an archenemy waiting just over the horizon, and one not of his choosing. Sounds like a lot like all of our superheroes.Fifth, he has his friends. This I believe is where this story makes the greatest advance from previous tales.... Harry has one good friend who is a boy, Ron, and one good friend who is a girl, Hermione. Children's literature of previous generations tended to feature unisex friendships; Little Women, Lord of the Flies, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, Treasure Island, etc... Or if they did feature relationships between the sexes, there was always that undertone of sexual attraction, i.e. Great Expectations. This is probably the few major works that feature see cross-gender friendships without any hint of romance or sex current or future.Last, the book is quite easy to read. The dialogue is simple and direct; setting descriptions are kept short and concise, and there is minimal philosophizing. In short, the book is meant for a generation raised on TV. All told a good book, though not a great one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book, it's been so long since we had a book out that kids couldn't wait to read.

Also I'm really big on reading this book with your kids you'll both love it and the myths and history that you can talk to the kids about is a great subject to expand learning"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First off, I was challenged to begin reading this book. I am a Christian and there are many stereotypes that Christians \\"shouldn't read Harry Potter\\" - and I followed that. Anyway, I decided finally to read it for myself and develop my own opinions. The work is very original and appeals to children as well as adults. The messages are very strong and I do not regret starting to read the Harry Potter series. Strongly recommended for those looking for a good read of exceptionally well-written literature!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, I finally did it! I went out and bought the 1st Harry Potter book and read it in two days. What a delightful, whimsical, creative, adventurous romp this is! Rowling deserves every bit of credit for what she's done. The magical story and constant creativity keep you enthralled and after 30 pages, you're hooked. Bravo to Rowling for engaging an entire young generation back into the written word! A book for the entire family, perhaps most marvelous in how it paints a fantastic world without the use of today's multimedia. Books are still very much alive!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Even though this is the shortest book in the Harry Potter series, it is in some ways the most endearing. This is where it all began, one small book, supposedly marketed at pre-teens, released to an uncertain reception, not yet the worldwide hit it was destined to become. What worthy person can possibly be immune to the charm here? An orphan who is secretly heir to great powers, fame, fortune, escape into another, more interesting world... There are universal themes here, of course, heroism, villainy, mystery, a quest, a hidden inheritance, clandestine passages within a great foreboding castle, but there is also much that is new. J.K. Rowling's creation is so inventive and fun it's no wonder it's brought as much joy into the world as it has. I unapologetically love this book even though I'm twice the age of its supposed target audience, and I've read and re-read it since I first got it several years ago. I think Harry Potter, his friends, enemies, and their world are extraordinarily special, and I hope they entrance the minds and warm the hearts of readers for generations yet to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Like any first book of a series it usually is the hardest to get into, due to the fact that you know little to nothing about the book. This was the hardest book to read of the series, even after seeing the movie and then reading the book. But it is not the best book of the series but I can't say it is the worst either. I don't think any of the books can be labled 'worst'. This book and the second book hold unique places within the series, for everything is being build on these two and the ball starts rolling in the third book (The best of the series, along with the Goblet of Fire), the ball is rolling and we know the characters and we know what to expect at times, but at the sametime she keeps up suspensful as to what really is going to happen and keeps us in the dark about the next book.This book is an introduction to the characters, like meeting anyone for the first time it takes a little while to get acquainted, this is why I think book three is the best, we are fully acquainted and they are good friends.But nonetheless, this is a good book and better to read the second time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am sixteen years old and bore with books easily, but I was persistant when it came to &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, it was amazing. When I put the book down, I was never disappointed with what I'd read, and was never bored. I'm looking forward to reading book #2, the chamber of secrets. I would recomend this book to anyone, it's not hard to read and expands the mind at the same time. I am so pleased with my experience, and intend on coming back for more, very soon. The magic is always there, it never goes away."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read! The best part about this book is its not just a story its a new world you get to see into and want to be a part of. It's a book most think is for children, but I loved it deeply and could understand it well. Read just two chapters and I guarantee you will be hooked. I have read only the first book, but if the others are have as good as the first I will devoir them as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I haven't been classified as a teen for about 10 years now, and am just amazed by how much I have enojoyed this series!

Bravo to an author who has found herself a wonderful world visit, and thanks so much for sharing it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow. This is a really good book! I think that this series is up there with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of Narnia. A really good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book and it was great!!! It didn't take me long either. My favorite character was Hermoine because shewas always trying to either pusuade Harry not to do something or else she would wish him luck. I didn't like how snotty Malfoy Draco was. I thought that Hagrid was really funny though. In the begginning I thought that Snape would change his actions towards Harry. I actually did think that Proffessor Snape was putting a curse on Harry's broom stick. I would have never guessed that Professor Quirrell was the bad guy. I thought that this was a great book and I rate it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was awesome. And I don't care if people say it's for ten year olds. I'm fourteen and it was very entertaining. It stretched my imagination to the maximum. I also can't find any connection between Harry Potter and drugs. I don't see how the media could connect the two. Also The book isn't saying humans are stupid. They are just another race. The wizards are portrayed as humans might, and &quot;muggles&quot; are just a non concerning race or species. I recommend this book to anyone even if they are older than ten. As I said I'm fourteen and this book didn't seem immature or too basic at all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought the paperback edition because I had been curious about a children's book that adults wanted to read. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Ms. Rowling has put together a very well constructed, thoroughly absorbing, and what is really to the point, a tale that delights, surprises, and thoroughly entertains the reader, even one who has been reading for far more years than most of the purchasers of the book have been alive.To those who condemn the book because it allegedly promotes necromancy, nihilism, and other nefarious practices I can only say that I respect your opinion but beg to differ. This is a work of fantasy designed to entertain. Many (very young) readers have been quoted as understanding fully the difference between fantasy and reality.If you've been thinking about getting it -- stop thinking and add it to your cart. You're in for a delightful few hours."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Not to sound arrogant, but I'm an avid reader with hundreds of books behind me. I found &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; one of the most wonderfully entertaining ones I've come accross. When I started reading it, I didn't know it was primarily a children's book. . . After reading it, I still wouldn't know it if someone hadn't told me. It's a shame it has a reputation as a children's book, for I fear that will keep many adults from a wondrous experience! I most highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is one of the best heros to come along in a longtime. He appeals to me, a 44 year old mom and wife, and to my 15 yearold son, and to my friends' 10 year old daughter. How many books can that be said about? Harry, Ron, and Hermione will charm your socks off. Good story, good friends, awful Dursleys!!! Quit being a Muggle and meet Harry and friends. You'll be awfully glad you did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was an average boy, so he thought. Harry had been living with his aunt, uncle, and his pudgy annoying cousin, Dudly. Harry was told that his father and mother were killed in a car accident. But all that is about to change when Harry discovers that he is one of the most powerful wizards of all time. The author, J.K. Rowling, truly has written a classic tale of good versus evil. This is Rowlings first book. If this book sounds interesting to you, try it. But even if it doesn't, or even if you don't like good versus evil themes, try it. Harry Potter is a must for all ages. I don't like to read, but this is the best book I've ever read. &quot; Harry Potter should run for president.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. That was all I heard about so I decided to try it for myself. Boy was I in for a big shock. I actually liked it! Harry Potter is a little boy that survived when his parents got killed. He was sent to live with his aunt and uncle. They treated him like he wasn't even there. Mysterious letters started arriving but the most mysterious thing happens on Harry's eleventh birthday. A giant named Hagrid comes to visit Harry. He told Harry all about his &quot;people&quot; Harry got accepted into wizardry shool. Thats where Harry's adventure begins. He has two close buddies with him on his search to find the secret behind the trapdoor that a very vicious beast is gaurding. You have to read this book.

A great beginning to an undoubtedly great sequence of books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wondered what all the hoop-li-da was about on these Harry Potter books. Curiousity finally won out and I ended up purchasing this book. I have to be honest in that I expected to be a bit disappointed but I was very happily surprised. It is excellent reading, no matter your age. Now I can see why it appeals to young people. It has all the right ingredients. A hero that that any young person can relate to, and dare I say it, even adults. The book is fast-paced and keeps you turning the pages to find out what is going to happen. Plenty of villainy to boo and heroics to cheer. I also purchased the next two books in the series and enjoyed them as much as the first. I plan on purchasing the fourth and am sure I will enjoy reading it as much as the last three. Cheers to the author for writing a series that both kids and adults can enjoy. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a 29-year-old graduate student in English literature, I approached this book cautiously, disdainful of anything stamped with the word &quot;Bestseller.&quot; But this book is a sheer delight. It reminds me of the Xanth novels by Piers Anthony which I used to enjoy in my youth. I love all the unique devices the author invents (I wouldn't mind having a Nimbus Two Thousand of my own!) and the message that kids have &quot;powers&quot; cultivating which adults would do well to help along.I took away a star because as I've discovered, not all adults will like this type of fiction, though certainly all children will! If you've never enjoyed the fantasy genre, this isn't the book for you. For the rest of us, try to read slowly: there are only four books and they have to last until the fifth comes out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't know what all the fuss is about whether or not Ms. Rowling has written books that are of &quot;literary&quot; quality, etc. I borrowed this book from my mother, a 2nd grade teacher, after hearing for so long now the split praise of it. And while I can see where some critics might find fault with certain editorial aspects of the book, I can't imagine why they'd allow such nit-picking to overshadow the truly wonderful overall composition. This is a classic story with a contemporary attitude! Children, adults -- it's got something for everyone, even a 24 year old college student wanting something to read on breaks from studying for finals. The characters are engaging, if not completely developed -- but, hey, that's because there are more books to come, more opportunities to develop everything! I'm buying copies for all my nieces, nephews, and little cousins who don't already own their own!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just wanted to say that I am 25 years old and that it has been a long time since I've enjoyed books as much as the HP books. I read all four this week and it was so addicting that I did nothing else! I had heard about the hype but wasn't too impressed. Out of boredom I decided to read the 1st book and I thought it was just great. I'm just sad that I'll have to wait so long to read the next one. This week I got to read one after another!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am now in the process of re-reading all four books now. But, the first time I picked The Sorcerer's Stone up was after my little sister and my grandma kept saying that these books were so great. So, I started into the book and found an odd sense of adventure, magic, and pure originality in the first 10 pages when 3 mysterious people drop a small child off on the doorstep of his muggle aunt and uncle's home at Number Four, Pivet Drive...And so starts everything. As the story moves on as Harry, who is an outcast in his adopted family, realizes he is an already very famous wizard because of his defeat of Voldemort, the most powerful and evil wizard when he was only an infant. His aunt and uncle (the Dursleys) are Muggles, but the kind who are aware of the wizarding world, and hate it. Soon Harry gets a letter that sends him of to Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry, and his adventures unfold without stopping. Read the book to find out how.Rowling has created four masterpieces of literature that will not soon die out in people's hearts. There are the people who will read this and wonder 'how those books about witchcraft can be good! They are from Satan himself!' If there are any of you who do think that, it is your opinion and you are entitled to it. But, if you could actually READ the books and possibly find a way to say they are from Satan, you need to open your eyes to your own imagination. Being a devout Christian, I know that God did not give us an imagination just to lock it away. I know of a good God that gave us an imagination to USE it. And Harry Potter is a perfect example and I pity anyone who can not see anything more than the 'witchcraft'. Just for anyone's information, the 'witchcraft' Rowling narrates is the purely imaginary kind with magic wands and old wizards, dragons, potions, and broomsticks, NOT the kind of REAL witchcraft where people get around a fire and pray to the devil.I am a 16 year old male who cannot put these books down, which may seem odd. But I have found these books to create a whole new side of fun in my life! There are parts of this novel (and its sequels) that absolutely make me feel just EXHILERATED. My first experience with reading about the wizarding game Quidditch had me in fits once I straightened out all the rules in my head and got a clear understanding of it. It is so completely original and I can't think of anything more exciting than chasing balls and other players on speeding broomsticks high up in the air. It is incredible. And to make it better, the way Rowling creates it in the story is that WE discover it at the same time Harry does, but when he understands, we do too. And now I would give anything to have it to be real because it is so fun!This book only has a blurred focus of who Voldemort really was, but purposefully I think, because in the sequels, what happened to Harry as an infant are played out in more detail. Rowlings tequnique at giving us loveable and hateable characters is fresh and awesome. This story though, has very real themes in it, such as Harry's friend Ron and his poor family being taunted by rich kids. It is real and we see it everyday. I am sorry for those of you still reading that this review seemed to stray from the main parts of this novel, but I had to say the things I did. But this is the best start to such a wonderful series of adventures.And Rowling, if you EVER read this, I want to thank you for sharing such a great piece of you with the rest of the world. I know you wrote these books for YOU, and I am so glad that you wanted to share your sense of fun and spirit with everyone. You have single handedly changed the way kids and adults alike view reading. You won't ever be forgotten."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces us to a boy orphaned as a baby.Poor Harry spends the first eleven years with his horrible Aunt, Uncle and cousin Dudley where he is made to stay in a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs.

It was the typical overkill of the entertainment market media--the first movie coming out, the promo stuff at fast food joints, you name it. When I was in Florida last Christmas for the Holidays, I made the mistake of remarking about the issue, that the whole thing was turning into a 21st Century American mantra; \\"Hare Krishna, Hare Potter, Potter Potter, Hare Hare\\". I even sang that part in the original chant melody, I was so-oo-oo witty.My 14-year-old niece commented serenely; \\"I think Harry Potter is awesome.\\"Oops, Uncle Dick--I thought.On the flight back home to upstate New York, I changed flights at Atlanta--and on the airport concourse there, I passed by a bookstore with a huge display of this edition. I stopped in and grabbed one for the connecting flight. The end result was as follows:1) When the film came out on DVD the following summer, I grabbed that.2) At this writing, I now have an order in which includes \\"Chamber Of Secrets\\"So much for dissing a story I'd never read just because I was sick of the overpromotion. So much also for assuming that just because I'm over 50, a \\"kid's book\\" can't possibly interest me. Is Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" only read by children? Nope, I read it every year myself. So there you go. Here's hoping you don't need to embarrass yourself in front of a kid young enough to be your grand-kid before you give this one a try."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book?

This book was about a young boy named Harry Potter whose parents were killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort. Harry Potter ends up living with his Aunt Petunia Uncle Vernon and his fat cousin Dudley.I don't have a favorite part because the whole book was great. I recommend anyone who wants to read this book, and is interested in fantasy books should try reading this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What more could a kid (and any adult for that matter!) wish for?! One minute you're unwelcome and alone, next minute you're extremely popular (even rich and famous!) and you have magical powers! Sound stupid you say?Well it is! and yet Rowling manages to keep you glued to your seat, laughing out loud by yourself, crying alone with the book, gasping aloud, and flipping pages like mad - that's why you should read it right now!(Read it with your kids! so you don't look as stupid as if you're laughing outloud on your own!)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'll save you the trouble re-reading the story line and get right to the review. Harry potter is a wonderful story of friendship, suited to adults and children alike. My uncle bought these books for me and posted them to me as he had read them.I love to read but find most books a bit hard going at the minute, as I am ill and bed bound, however I found Harry to be as light hearted or as deep as I wanted. At first I put off reading Harry as they were everywhere literally, and I though all the raving was just hype, I am now disappointed that I did to say the least!I am severely disturbed that people can think of Harry as a bad role model and a non-Christian, my father is a Methodist minister and we have had many a discussion about this and just can't under stand it. Reading about a pretend world of witchcraft and wizardry isn't going to make me run out and either buy a broomstick or become a Satanist. I feel that Christ wouldn't feel afraid of a book and if you are I don't think you got a great relationship with god, I am sorry if you disagree but that's what free will is all about. Christ trusts you to deal with issues that arise to do with your faith.As for Harry being a bad role model what a crock! All children lie and rebel, and I'm sure the fact when ever Harry does it it's to either help a friend or he's punished and regrets it later, has completely escaped your notice. Anyway the children who are young enough to be affected by that will probably not realise it unless you bring it up with them, if your that worried about it talk to them they'll respect you for that a lot more than trying to ram that lying is wrong down their necks!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read enough books in my life. But I can honestly say that I've never skipped any sleep for any other book before I started reading these books. I could not put them down, not just a first one - all four of them. I finished reading them (all four) in less then a week. Each one seems to be better then the one before.For anyone with a slight imagination these books are the most enjoyable reading. They have everything the reader can look for in a story. And most importantly, pages are not felled with unnecessary details like most adult books I've read. Non-stop adventure.Only disappointment I felt was when I finished the fourth book and realized that next one was not published yet.Two very enthusiastic thumbs up to Ms. Rowling for writing the most creative book I've ever read in my life.And as for those criticizing these books: GET A LIFE.

What about adults? I, for one, couldn't put it down. I like adventure. If I had magical powers, I definitely would use them solely to benefit my fellow humans and other living beings. When the bad guys use their magic for evil purposes, it's a thrill to see them exposed and thwarted. Nevertheless, in no sense is Harry Potter in a league with The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. The characters are all one-dimensional, although Harry's perception of them sometimes changes. While some of the suspense involves catching evil-doers, some of it simply has to do with breaking school rules and maybe getting caught. Harry gets out of tight places by magic (no surprise), but in the sense that he's saved by something unexpected, like a power he didn't know he had. This kind of escape isn't always satisfying. Whenever you can share an adventure with the young folks in your family, it's good. Accept Harry Potter for what he is, an adventuresome kid."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i think harry potter is a great book,when you are reading this book it almost seems like if youre in it! like 3D! wow! -m.s."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just wanted to say that this was a wonderful book.

Harry does everything from finding a home for a baby dragon and taking down a mountain of a troll to defeating his arch-nemesis. J.K.

This is a mystical adventure full of a wide variety of spells, magical creatures, and mighty sorcerers. With all the magic used, it is impossible to correctly predict what will happen next.

Makes me feel like a kid again! a 52-year old Mom!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the book called &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; by J.K.Rowling. The Dursley's, of number four Privet Drive, were perfectly normal people. They had a terrible son named Dudley. Then Professor McGonagall, Albus Dumbledore and Hagrid came. Hagrid was the last to come. Hagrid brought Harry Potter in a blanket. Harry was a wizard but he didn't know it until he got a letter inviting him to a Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. There he learned to play Quidditch.The rules of Quidditch are: You play on a broomstick with four balls. There are 7 players on a team. Three of the players are chasers who play with the Quaffle. They pass the ball around and try to throw the Quaffle in one of the 6 hoops. The Keeper guards the goal posts. The second and third balls are bludgers. They fly around and knock people off their brooms. The 2 beaters fly around and hit the bludgers to the other team. The last ball is a small golden ball called the snitch. The seeker tries to catch the snitch before the other team's seeker. Whichever team's seeker catches the snitch earns his team 150 points. And that's how to play Quidditch.The four houses at Hogwarts are: Gryffindor, Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. The third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death, because behind the door is a three-headed monster dog called Fluffy.My favorite part of the book is when Harry gets the letter inviting him to Hogwarts. The letter said to get on Platform nine and three quarters, but no one could find the Platform. See if you can find out how!The part I liked the least was when Gryffindor lost 150 points. Losing the points was bad because he might lose the house cup at the end of the year.I recommend Harry Potter as an excellent book. I encourage kids to read Harry Potter. I hope you will find these books exciting. I hope I will be able to read the whole volume of Harry Potter books. The next Harry Potter book I would like to read is: &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was not so sure of what to think about the book.

He is sent to live with them when his parents are killed in a car accident. Little does he know, he's a wizard! He later finds out what really killed his parents.

Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After hearing all of the rave reviews, I was expecting a book on a par with the Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, the E. Nesitt books, etc. It was a nice enough story but I found it disjointed and full of distracting cliches."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wonder if the big fanfare about the Harry Potter books is due to us Americans having little experience with the light/humorous fantasy books more prevalent in the UK, both adult and juvenile. I can't help but feel Rowling was influenced greatly by other authors, possibly even the hilariously clever Terry Pratchett. I like the books, but they are not, as some have decided, revolutionary in juvenile literature. I would hope this might encourage readers to expand their vision to those like C.S. Lewis, Douglas Adams, and other British writers of fantasy. Additionally, it's a downer that Harry is repeatedly placed in bad situations where the numerous authority figures to which he's entrusted at school either don't care, can't be trusted, are unbelievably unfair. Adults love these book, yes, but are actual kids comfortable with them?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think the real appeal of this book - why millions of all ages have been drawn to it - is its strong basic theme. It's the story of an abused and under-appreciated person being recognized for his true inner greatness. It's easy to relate to because this greatness lives within each of us, and this story gives us hope that maybe...someday...our own greatness will be recognized.My problem with this book is that this great theme - this classic theme - is rendered into a weak story. The Hobbit works off the same theme, but J.R.R Tolkien weaves his story with far more finesse. The Hobbit's character development is slow and subtle, with depth and insight. Harry Potter, on the other hand, goes from being a miserable, abused, depressed kid to being a worshipped bigshot in a matter of two pages, which amounts to the entire character development in the story. To make matters worse, the entire shift happens through no work or perseverance of his own. Bilbo Baggins has to work and has to face real emotional challenges...and you grow to respect him for it. Harry Potter: he's essentially the same character at page 50 and page 310.And the Hobbit...what tension in the story! It followed an emotional arc, slowly unfolding, with the unique and many-sided characters become increasingly lovable and admirable. Harry Potter lacked this tension, being dull and unsuspenseful by comparison. I found myself not really caring what happened in the end, and not really being emotionally drawn to any of the characters. I'll probably forget their names in a few days... I remember the Hobbit's characters' names years later.And Harry Potter: it read like a trivia book...tons and tons of irrelevant names and details and characters and side stories. It just felt like fluff...the kind kids like to read and amass...but doesn't make for an enduring book.And last extremely annoying point: why is it that a bunch of completely untrained 11 year olds are able to use better magic and logic and intelligence than the greatest wizards and witches in the world? It makes for a cute story, but not a cohesive one.So all in all, I predict that this book - and series, from what I can guess - will not become a classic, not even remotely in the same boat as the Hobbit or James and the Giant Peach or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...If you really want to read a good book, don't buy the hype and read this one...there are others that are better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The three Harry Potter books I have just read are AWESOME! I read the entire first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers, in one day, the next book in two days, and the last in three. I mean it when I say: I couldn't put it down! I wait for more books. Hopefully more will be published soon enough. The story of Harry Potter is addictive, and I recommend it to everyone who appreciates magic. It is a very enjoyable tale-Go read it! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"(. . .)Joanne Rowling is one of that extremely rare breed of animals that many others aspire to. She tells a bloody good story. This fact is often forgotten when her work is held up as \\"children's\\" stories. Well let me state at once in that case I must still be a child as I enjoy every word she has written. If she can get children back to reading books rather than watching TV, she ranks very high in my estimation. The first of her works on the phenomena known as \\"Harry Potter\\" is called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone. This book is the first of a proposed series of seven, all of which are anticipated to be films of gigantic moneymaking proportions.How then will the film live up to the expectations of thousands and thousands of young fans who know every word of the books? It is always a notoriously difficult task to convert a favourite book to film. I suppose that in all honesty I cannot think of a single example where I prefer a film to a book. The medium of film makes the transition impossible and it is exactly the case in this instance. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and some of the scenes are, to coin a phrase from Ron Weasley, \\"bloody marvellous\\".There will be very few people who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter story, but for those who have recently returned from Mars, it is the story of a boy who discovers that he is in reality a wizard who lives in the world of Muggles (that's you). It is necessary that his magic education require that he attend the world famous school of Hogwarts, from where his adventures begin. You will notice that I do not include myself amongst you common Muggles....the very idea.Knowing the story makes this film truly awe inspiring, as your mind is trying to recall what is going to happen next, and some of the scenes are exactly as you imagined them. The Grand Hall at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat, the Hogwart Express, all marvellously captured and depicted on screen.My favourite scenes are the quidditch match and the chess game. The quidditch match, and other scenes, was shot at Alnwick castle, which is only a mile or so from where I live. If you watch as the quidditch players are flying round, you will see scenes of the Northumberland countryside. The film captures the excitement of the game perfectly; in my day it was an honour to be picked for the first team, but we did not have the advantage of the Nimbus 2000.Words cannot describe the marvellous wizards chess game. Imagine huge chess pieces which attack and fight at your command. The realism of the animation is truly breathtaking.The cast are all flawless in their interpretation of their various characters. I pick out those of which were my favourites, but no doubt you will have your own once you have seen the film. I am sure that I will run out of superlatives in a very short space of time:*Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. It was said that Rowling selected him because he was exactly as she had imagined Harry Potter to be. He is exactly as I had imagined him to be also, but probably because he is a ringer for the illustration on the book cover. Be that as it may, his performance was perfect and I am absolutely certain that he will develop the character as each film is produced. He will probably be typecast and forevermore be Harry Potter but there are worse things in life.*Maggie Smith as Prof. Minerva McGonagall was for me the star of the film. Her portrayal of McGonagall is perfect as is to be expected of an actress of her calibre.*Robbie Coltrane as the enormous Hagrid, makes the part his own very early in the film. He is exactly as I had imagined him to be and the humour of the character shines through...oooohhh I don't think I should have told you that.*Richard Harris as Prof. Dumbledor...perfect. The deep voice and quality acting bring the endearing Dumbledor to life.*Rupert Grint who plays Ron Weasley and Emma Watson, who plays Hermione Granger, have two pivotal roles in this and subsequent films. They are to grow up with the young Harry Potter and will become stars in their own right. I place my cap in the ring now and say that Rupert Grint is one of tomorrow's top stars in the movie world.*Alan Rickman plays the difficult part of Snape perfectly. Is he evil? Or not? Those who have read the books know exactly, and the rest of you will have to shell out to find out.Other parts, which will come to the fore in subsequent films include: Zoe Wannamaker (Madame Hooch), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), John Cleese (Nick the Nearly Headless Ghost) and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy).The part of Peeves the poltergeist was reputedly dropped from the film on the grounds of time, a pity, as I believe Rik Mayall took the part.Do I advise you to see the film? Unquestionably yes. I make the following proviso however, that you see the film before taking the very young. Some of the scenes are not, in my opinion, suitable. The film has been given a PG, and quite rightly so. Also beware, the film is a massive 2 hours long.The only things that I found disappointing in the entire film were the wands. A wand is a slender, highly complex and delicate instrument. In the film they looked quite frankly like sticks of wood. Ah Well nothing is perfect."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My sister gave the paperback to my son a couple years ago. He really enjoyed it, and has read the next two so far. He hasn't started on the huge 4th volume yet. I recently read this one, and thought it was a very good book. Suspense, humor, adventure, magic... what more could you want? Especially if you're a kid. This collector's edition is very nice, and the Amazon price was great. The drawing by JK Rowling is pretty good. i wonder why she didn't do her own illustrations all along. from what I had read, I thought maybe it would be an actual pen and ink drawing, but it appears to be a reproduction. However, there is an autograph on the same page that certainly looks like it was actually written there with an ink pen. I've yet to find a website that clearly describes what you are getting. Anyway, it's a nice collector's item, and you can't beat the price."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Looking Beyond the Harry Potter Stories.If Rowling had not defied the &quot;standard&quot; trends in children's' books she would have never written her books. Lets hope our children learn from her to be innovative, bold, and creative on their own.In your school days, do you still remember how you hated to read a long book? How many times were your book reports based prologues, forewords or book summaries you managed to find? Yet today's children are reading Rowling's books (over 300 pages long) two or three times. Her books have revived our children's interest back to reading books of length that is priceless.God, I am so tired of hearing how our children rank so low the rest of the world in education. I have heard the same stories since 1948 when I was in high school and when I raised my kids. Yet the kids for the last 50 years have grown up, led and maintained this country as the worlds' greatest power of freedom. As in past generations Rowling is showing that our children have been underrated and when motivated have the abilities to read and lead our country."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recently read where some of the readers of this book didn't like it. Why? Well, because they obviously have no sense of adventure, or humor, or curiosity. Both Harry Potter books are very well written (I'm an English major), especially for an unknown author. She captures your imagination. As for the review that thinks the author makes it OK to ridicule &quot;fat&quot; people....get a life! If we can't laugh at ourselves, we need help. Every one of us has something wrong with us. You have to learn to get over it and stop being offended or you will NEVER be happy! As for the reader who thought it shouldn't be directed at children because of the &quot;murdering&quot;...think about the great Shakespeare, a legend, whom I had to read at least 4 of his works in high school. He wasn't considered &quot;dark&quot;, he wrote masterpieces which are still around today. Stop looking at everything at face value and have some fun and imagination! These are great adventure and imagination books, for all ages.Hint: If you think that your child is too young to understand it, read it with them and explain it is only fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With over 5000 reviews out there for this book I'm not kidding myself into believing anyone is going to read my review to decide whether or not to read it. I'm writing this so that anyone who clicks to read all my reviews can use this as a point of reference in understanding my other reviews.As an author of children's books myself, I am familiar with what it takes to write a standout novel. I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when it first showed up in this country, before it was a huge success, before anyone knew anything about it, really, and knew then what a great book it was. When it became so popular I studied it further to understand why and have now read it enough times to have lost count.One thing that has made this series so successful is that every one of us has that part of ourselves that wishes we could find out we are more than we realize. For children, the thought that they could one day find out that they, too, are a wizard, certainly holds mass appeal. But Rowling takes it further than that. She has created a world at Hogwarts that is so detailed and, despite its basis in magic, believable, that it comes to life for children and adults alike. Rowling never misses a chance to tell us, during the main action of Harry sneaking down a hall, that Neville messed up a spell in the background and sent the witch in one of the paintings scrambling for cover.Take this great writing and use it to tell a great story of good vs. evil using characters who exhibit qualities of each, suffer the same problems as the reader does, struggle through tough decisions, don't always make the right ones, but stick to their moral compass and overcome huge odds in the end, and you have a series that can't miss.While I'm here I should mention the other books in the series:Book 2 - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: a second great story about the characters we loved in the first, left fans wanting more.Book 3 - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: a darker book than the first two, this one scared off a few non-loyal Harry fans.Book 4 - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: proof that once you're a successful author you can break all the rules and editors won't dare cut up your work. This book was twice as long as it needed to be and probably should have been, but we didn't care. True fans by this point, we wanted to read every word.Book 5 - Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix: by far the worst book of the series sees Harry mad at everything and distancing himself from everyone from start to finish.Book 6 - Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince: a lighter book than #5, this one has an ending that leaves readers in shockBook 7 - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: no one who has read books 1 through 6 could imagine not buying this last book of the series. A wonderful and horrible ending that wraps up the series nicely and leaves a world saddened to think there will be no more Harry Potter masterpieces to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My highest recommendation is for more American readers to pick up the UK versions of the Harry Potter books, published by Bloomsbury, which are quite readily available in paperback from Amazon.co.uk. I would rate Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which is essentially an Americanized version of Rowling's classic first HP installment, at 4 stars, while HP and the Philosopher's Stone, Rowling's original book sans American editing, earns 5 stars. Rowling's original prose style is both poetic and witty, which is unfortunately compromised and in some cases absent from the American version. (An HP fan who had read the original US version several times, found whole paragraphs missing when compared to the UK version.) The original UK editions are lighter, faster-moving, and altogether so much more a joy to absorb. The American publishers feared that US kids wouldn't understand the British humour, and they also swayed Rowling to alter the title to HP and the Sorcerer's Stone. Again, the US publishers feared American kids wouldn't understand the reference \\"Philosopher's Stone\\", which is a term almost every youngster in Britain and Europe would know as referencing alchemy. Personally, I think the books still would have done as well, and the publisher's could have provided an index for British-English terms which are not necessarily as prevalent in the US. For example, being called \\"thick\\" in British English is the equivalent to being called a pin head or stupid in American English. Hence, \\"don't be think\\" means \\"don't be stupid.\\"Rowling's tale concerns a loser orphan boy residing in a closet, care of his aunt and uncle, the Dursley's who would make Pontius Pilate seem like a breath of fresh air. The loser boy, Harry Potter, does have one small trait in his favor: he can make extraordinary things happen without much effort, which of course infuriates his totalitarian guardians who treat their only child, Dudley, like he's the future Prince of Wales. (Dudley gripes when he receives a measley 36 presents for his birthday when he had 37 the previous year.) After a prelude which is much longer than the film, including gangs headed by Dudley who desire to put Potter in his place, Harry begins to realize he does have something special about him. He eventually learns through a big lug named Hagrid that he is the son of wizard parents, making him a wizard as well, and he has been accepted into Hogwarts, a parochial school for wizards. Also, he learns an evil wizard figure was responsible for the death of his parents, although the exact details are purposefully kept blurry. On his way to the school on the Hogwarts Express, he befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, two new first-years.The central plot concerns the Philosopher's Stone, an alchemical stone said to contain the secrets of immortality and longevity, which has been hidden at Hogwarts for Dumbledore, the chancellor of the school, and Nicholas Flamel, whom Hermione discovers in one of her tomes; Flamel was an alchemist in the late Middle Ages. (In fact Nicholas Flamel (1330?-1418) is an historical figure who supposedly wrote a treatise on the Philosopher's Stone, as well as a book published in the late Renaissance, \\"Exposition of the Hieroglyphical Figures\\") The three friends begin to suspect Snape, the instructor of the dark arts, is going to steal the stone from its hiding place below Hogwarts, whose entrance is guarded by a three-headed canine approximately the size of King Kong, lovingly referred to as \\"Fluffy\\". Snape's goal to attain the stone is related to the dark wizard who is responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents.In addition to the central plot, Rowling has imagined an entire mythical world, a cross between the magic and lore of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth and early 19th-century Britain a la Charles Dickens. Diagon Alley, Harry Potter's first foray into this world (the world of mortal humans is called the \\"Muggle World\\"), is replete with the kinds of shops you could imagine the Artful Dodger sneaking into, although these shops carry magical artifacts, such as wands and flying broom-sticks. The local bank is run by goblins. Not only does magic permeate every aspect of this society but it is also replete with dragons, werewolves, and even mythical creatures right out of Ancient Greek mythology. And at Hogwarts, they even have a sports competition, Quiditch, which is far as I can tell is a cross between basketball, rugby, football (aka soccer), and cricket played on flying broomsticks.Even when you erradicate the hype, such as the large big-budget campaigns for the films, the Harry Potter books still hold their own. A wit and wisdom exists in the HP books which still makes them a delicious read, almost at every level, and they can be enjoyed by the young as well as the older crowd. (In Britain, the publishers actually released so-called \\"adult versions\\" of the books whose covers look less juvenile.) The world Rowling has forged and the characters she has created to reside in it have become staples of fantasy literature, something I am sure the author could never have imagined when she was writing it in coffee shops, sometimes on napkins. And try the UK editions if you get the chance."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter believes that he is a normal boy. At least until his eleventh birthday. At that time he hears that he should go to a school for witchcraft and magic. This school is called &quot;Hogwarts&quot;. And so for Harry this first year in Hogwarts becomes the most exciting and happiest year in his life. He &quot;falls&quot; from an advanture in another, must fight against monsters, other pupils and has many troubles with the teachers. But he has found many friends who helps him in the fight against the dark power."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"So many people have asked me why I have enjoyed the Harry Potter series so much and how someone 27 years old can relate to a children's book. The answer is simple. We were all children at one time; we may have only forgotten. As adults, we tend to shy away from things that make us appear silly and childish in our own eyes. This so often prevents us from finding true happiness. These books offer a return to our childhoods set in a fantastical world in which we could never have dreamed of finding ourselves.The bottom line is that Rowling has a unique talent for leading the reader thoughtfully and carefully through an entertaining tale. There are moments where you may be almost convinced that you are standing right next to the characters in the books. That kind of enchantment is hungrily devoured by so many and has contributed to the craze surrounding her work. She may never be acclaimed as a writer of classic literature, but she has tapped into something deep within us all that so few ever consistently reach. I think that puts her in some elite company with the likes of Tolkein, Spielberg, Lucas, and C.S.Lewis for having touched the child in us all regardless of age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The most exciting book ever!I have read this book once and I think it is the most exciting book I have ever read.

While he is there he gets into a lot mischief but always manages to escape. One time he was walking around at night when he was not supposed to but somehow he escaped. Another time is when he went to fight one of his enemies at night and somehow he also got away with it.I chose this book because people were telling me what a great read this was. So I read the book and since I liked it so much I am now recommending it to other people."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being a 14 year old it was kind of strange that I'd read a book like this, but Harry Potter has to be one of the greatest fantasy books I have ever read.

Harry who lives in a cubard under the stairs, isn't that much normal, he can make things happen when he gets angry enough and has an unusal lightning shaped scar on his forehead. When a strange letter comes in the mail for him, is Uncle Vernon &amp; Aunt Petunia start to act extremely strange, ripping up the letter &amp; giving poor Harry more chores to do.Then more &amp; more of the same letters start to come, Uncle Vernon freaking out, then rows the family to a small island &amp; takes shelter in a falling down boat house. That night, Harry's whole life changed, when an enormous wizard named Hagrid stomps into the boat house tellling Harry about his true identity, that he's a wizard. Harry amazed at the discovery is suddenly put into an magical alley to get suppies &amp; on a magical train that will lead him to his new school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry, &amp; his new life.The book is excellent in every way &amp; I praise JK Rowling for writing a pure masterpiece."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've heard alllll the hype about the Harry Potter books.

Well, I was not disappointed. I can't think of enough adjectives to describe my feelings for this book. I can't say that it is the best book I've read, Tolkien holds that territory firmly.

Bravo to J.K. Rowling and her ability to take youth and adults to a wonderous wizard land! I will also add.....to those who throw words around like satanic, violent, brat, mean, rude, and selfish.....you just described the world we live in today!!!! How could J.K.

I teach 5th-8th grade students...and believe me, Harry has nothing on my kids! It's called being a kid....and I would think so-called parents would recognize the signs! Let's not all pretend our kids are angels....when I get'em at school you have no idea what they turn into......and yes they break every rule possible at least once! So let's give Harry a break.

I had hoped it would rekindle the magic that the Chronicles of Narnia had made when I was in junior high.The story starts out a little disjointed, setting up the Cinderella-like premise of the early life of the protagonist, Harry Potter. A coherent story finally begins about a third of the way through. We enter J. K. Rowling's world of wizards, witches, trolls, unicorns, ghosts, gobblins, centaurs etc. It is an enchanting world indeed, but the story does not enfold neatly and logically. Loose ends are tied up a little sloppily in the end as subplots never seem to find their place in the scheme of things. We were also introduced to two or three more characters than necessary. It seemed that the story could have been trimmed to its essentials. I did not get the sense that J. K. Rowling is the genius implied by the hype of the series.Despite its faults, I found the story to be entertaining and will consisder reading the other books in the series. Perhaps I should also re-read the Chronicles of Narnia as a reference to gage how I think a young adult will view the Potter series.The book is 309 pages long with print slightly larger than in novels."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are the type who enjoys reading fluff for fun, you should almost certainly get _Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone_. Even if you are not generally a fluff reader, be aware that this is particularly good fluff. The characters are quite flat, the hero unlikely and his choices frustrating, but the book itself is quite enjoyable. The imagery is excellent and the plot, while simple, interesting. There is just enough of a twist at the end to catch the reader off guard. Rowling does not spend much time on the specifics of spell casting or explain much of the structure in her magical world, but for some people this would be unwanted background material. This also gives a more lighthearted tone, so if you like the comprehensiveness and gravity of the _Dragonlance_ saga, you might be a bit dissappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, so I have to admit two things: one, I'm fast approaching 40 and don't have any children; two, I read this book just to see what all the fuss was about; three, I loved it.I'd heard of Harry Potter of course, but didn't think much of it until all the fuss over the fourth book. People I work with began telling me I should read it and they were right. The book reminded me of the works of Roald Dahl. I don't think small children should read it alone, but that makes it perfect for reading together. I really enjoyed the interplay of the three main characters - I thought it was cool that they were at once simple enough for children to understand and complex enough for adults to find interesting too.There are plenty of reviews which divulge part of the story, so I won't waste your time with a plot synopsis other than to say that I watched Silence of the Lambs with very few surprises, guessed the secret of Sixth Sense fifteen minutes into the movie, and got surprised by the ending of this book. I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to get the next three (two of which are currently on back-order - hazards of being a bandwagon fan I guess)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"F&uuml;r alle, die sich das Kind in sich bewahrt haben, ein Vergn&uuml;gen zu lesen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a reluctant 35 year-young adult, I picked up this book per the recommendation of my beloved wife.

They seemed to me to be more suitable for little kids and hardly the material that an adult would read, especially one who has long since been jaded by the typical fare produced by Tolkien-esque authors drawing upon Celtic-Nordic traditions.However, I was soon persuaded by the many positive reviews of this series, both by my friends and by book critics everywhere. Deciding that this would be a quick read and that I would not waste much time if it turned out to be another dud, I picked up the book...and didn't put it down until I finished it.While the fantasy genre is composed of hackneyed plots and themes, regurgitated by the many different authors out there, each cranking out thousand page novels, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone proved that succinctness is indeed a virtue. All of the stereotypes are here, but instead of just rehashing the same old fare that Tolkien dished out, Rowling re-defines it. And while many readers, especially those, like me, who are well-read in this genre, will recognize in Rowling's novels elements that have appeared in countless other stories and myths, Rowling does not use these as crutches to drive her story where none existed; rather, these are bridges she uses to communicate to her readers, common archetypes that exist in the minds of all. Hers is far more than one author's interpretation; it is a book that has captured the imagination and echoes the awe of the fantastic that resides within all of usSeldom has an author written with such clarity that her words flow so smoothly from the page into our thoughts. The fantasy genre owes its revival in large part to Rowling's gift of gab. Instead of alienating most readers as many other authors do, Rowling appeals to the mundane, beckoning them, in their own language, to visit the world of the incredible, the fantastic, the impossible that nevertheless seems so real.Harry Potter is a character of the new millennium, and his exploits usher in a new philosophy of fantasy. An orphaned child living in adverse conditions, Harry discovers that he is truly extraordinary; he is a wizard. Thus begin his adventures and his escape from his cruel life. He makes us all seek within ourselves that spark of magic that will allow each of us to transcend the mundanity and normalizing pressure of society, to become true individuals, unique to one another, and special, each in our own way.Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is a promising beginning to what I have found to be, thus far, a fantastic series, perhaps one day as defining as Tolkien's contribution to fantasy literature. Certainly, it is a worthy addition to everyone's bookshelves, young and old alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter that&iexcl;s the name of the inborn wizard, and is the name brand on my heart. The story is amazing, with such an extraordinary imagination. I do think that J.K. Rowling must have found herself in a magic-filled world. Plots, especially for the description of Quidditch playing, are carefully inter-mingled together to arrest the interest of the readers. The characters are portrayed in a picturesque and lifelike manner, making the story even more convincing.After I started to read the book for some pages, I felt that the book could not be put down. I had to read it page-after-page without rest. That&iexcl;s the first time for me to be so enthusiastic at reading a book. I finished it in two days nearly without rest. Just after I finished, I rushed down the street to look for the second volume of the series. That&iexcl;s the most &iexcl;crazy&iexcl; time in my life. Luckily, I just bought the other two books&iexcl;Xvol.2 and 3 on time (the two books were almost the lasts in the bookstore). I again used two days for each book. I just don&iexcl;t know how to describe it, which are fantastic.The series &iexcl;Harry Potter&iexcl; is definitely the best books I have ever read. I heartily am looking forward to the following volumes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I initially dismissed all the Harry Potter hype, which was massive indeed. But since I'm a great fan of fantasy, I decided to give the book a try - and I'm glad I did. Concise, sharply written, and imaginative, Harry Potter is well done. J. K.

Its an original compelling story that draws one in and holds on for a relatively quick read. It was not an &quot;I can't put this down&quot; read, but worth the price of the paperback.Ding from a 5 star rating; its too light a read. The plot and characterizations are not very deep or compelling. It reminds me a lot of early Heinlien (pre-60s, before he wrote his true classics). A book for the adolescent in all of us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Before I begin, I think I should warn you that this is a review from the perspective of a thirteen year old girl. I began reading the Harry Potter books at the end of my third grade year, and I have been hooked ever since. I am now a seventh grader, and a christian. I go to an advanced private school and, as a third grader, was having trouble finding books in the school library that intrested me. Then I found Harry Potter. The really cool thing was, we were just about the same age. My mom has always been sure that my sister and my reading matierial, movies we saw, and the games we played were not, in any since, evil. No ghosts, witches, voodoo, indiana jones, stuff like that. And that applied to halloween as well. Harry Potter had just about all the stuff that my mom was against. Having said that, she did not ban me from reading the book. Instead, she discussed it with me and made sure that I understood that it was all pretend. That it was just a fantasy book, imaginary. It was even discussed at sunday school. The point is, my mom made positive that I was mature enough, and that my faith in the Lord was strong enough, before allowing me to finish my book. My adventures with Harry allow me to dream, and to use my imagination. In the same way that I onced believed in the toothfairy and santa clause. My advice to parents is to be smart, dont allow your child to read the books if there is any doubt in your mind of there maturity. If you choose to listen to my advice, I highly doubt you will have anything to worry about.ps one more tidbit of info.~ at age nine i read a portion of the first book to my seven year old sister, she went to bed with nightmares."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I saw the first Harry Potter book lying around I got a little scared. But then my Mom who writes art books took it out one night and then I thought I have got to read it. All my friends are reading it. And now that my Mom read me the first book of Harry Potter I fell in love with it. I am almost at the 4th book but I got a little confused because I did not know where I was in the 3rd Harry Potter book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry this, Harry that, has the world gone mad for Harry Potter? My friends, my work associates, upper management, my wife - they were all reading these Harry Potter books. Then when we got together, they'd go off on Potter tangents, and I'd sit there dumbfounded. With the movie previews hitting theaters I could take no more. But I prefer to listen to my books (I'm a road warrior and spend more time in train, planes, and automobiles than at home).This reading by Jim Dale was stupendous. I loved how accurately he kept his different voices for the different characters. It kept the audio from being just a standard reading, and made it an experience. And what of the story? It really is a great story. Now I don't know that I'd go out and buy Harry Potter merchandise, but I can appreciate the value of this story. And I'm eager to get the next one.If you're in for the long haul, there are seven CD's in this bundle. Each is a little over an hour for a total of around nine (9) hours. So next time you're headed on that long three day weekend drive to see the relatives in another state, take this along. You'll find yourself lost in the world of muggles and wizards in no time flat."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think you should read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

It's a kid's book!&quot; I couldn't put it down. The adventures of Harry and his pals facing a 3-head beast and an ugly, club-carrying troll kept me glued to the book for hours. I loved the very believable characters like Hermoine Granger and school bully, Draco Malfoy. We all knew people like that in school! The book is full of great characters, fast-moving adventures and lots of humor that all adults would enjoy.I am definitely a Harry Potter fan now. Sorry, &quot;Danielle&quot; and &quot;Syndey,&quot; but your novels will have to wait!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had bought this book to read to my children, but they had no interest when it was discovered there weren't pictures. So I read it myself.This book is fantastic! Like others have said, this is not just for kids! I found the characters very engaging, even comical at times. Like George saying about himself and his twin, Fred: &quot;We know we're Gred and Forge&quot;.It begins with Harry as an infant, and wizards and witches watching over his deliverance to &quot;muggle&quot; relatives. Harry has a terrible home life: relatives who don't love or care for him, and he lives in a cupboard.The story comes alive from here. Letters pouring in from anywhere there is an opening: chimneys, open windows, the opening between the door and the floor...Harry makes off to Hogwarts, magical school for wizards and witches alike. New life, new friends, new magical adventures...The story was original and delightful as Harry encounters this strange new world and how to deal with it. The story had me riveted till the end.A must read for ANY fantasy reader! Children in the intended age group (should I include myself?) will enjoy reading the likes of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I personally thought that the Harry Potter books were really good .

Lord Voldemort wants to discover the Sorcerer's stone so he can live forever, but Harry and his friends plot to prevent this from happening.It's interesting to see how in each book of the HP series, Rowlng writes for an older audience. The first book is written for 11 year olds, the second book for 12 year olds, the third book for 13 year olds, and so on. She has created a brand new sport (Quidditch), a whole new curriculum for young wizards, and a world within the world of Muggles.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We have the book collection in total, but have read it repeatedly; all four members of the family.

But in an effort to get my kids to read any book that wasn't about sports, I got this for them and we read every page out loud together. My kids are ages 9 and 7 and they both hung onto every single word. Other than the story, of course, what I liked the most about the style of writing was that every detail was explained as if Rowling knew exactly when a child listening/reading would ask a question. In fact, just when my boys were about to ask what something meant or why something was happening the way it was, I encouraged them to just listen for a minute longer, and sure enough, the answer was a paragraph or two later. Just a really thorough, well-planned story with great characters and terrific themes around courage and friendship."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this for as a gift for my sister who loves Harry Potter, but hasn't taken the time to read the books.

I wish it could be a bit longer though."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the engrossing first chapter of the story of Harry Potter and his adventures in being a famous wizard. In this story, Harry Potter is just a baby when his parents are killed and he is left at the doorstep of his aunt and uncle. On Harry's 11th birthday, he is told by a vistor that he is a real life wizard and he has been accepted to \\"Hogwarts\\", a school that teaches students how to be a wizard. Along the way Harry makes two best friends and encounters adventure around every corner.This fantastic novel by J.K. Rowling has been a big surprise for me! I will admit that the only reason that I began to read it was because I am going into the elementary education field and I wanted to be able to say that I have read at least one of the books for my students' sake. But before I knew it, I was totally engrossed in the adventure and the friendship between Harry, Hermony, and Ron and wanted to not only finish the book, but watch the movie! As a child, I dreamed of being a wizard myself. I often wondered what a world like that would look like and feel like, and after reading this book, I believe I have my answer.After watching the movie, I am totally hooked and am thinking I just might have to finish the series. The author is a genius in keeping the audience engrossed in caring about all the characters, even the not so nice ones. The world of Harry Potter leaves the reader to use their imagination like no other book I have ever read. A world of wizardry, magic, and enchantment is something I believe each child should experience for themselves and I would recommend this book to any teacher or student, and I believe it is appropriate for all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I ordered the book for my 9 year old son and myself.

Also , the style of writing and the build-up of the story reminds me of an author ( in Bengali ) , whose writings have a similar flavor . For Bengali readers , who have read and liked Shirshendu Mukhopadhdhay : This reminds me of 'Monoj'der adbhut bari ' , 'Gonsai baganer bhut' , and a few more .

I thought the book was indeed fast-paced and had a balanced plot with all of the facets coming together in a satisfying way.However, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone didn't blow my mind. I thought it was good, but not unbelievably good. The books I read by Lois Lenski, Cynthia Voigt, and Judy Blume were as fresh, vigorous, and funny as this Harry Potter book, and in my opinion, more so.With the remainder of the series to read, I hope I do fall in love with the series like many adults and children have.Incidentally, I would love to see Ms. Rowling feature a female protagonist in her next series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't belive that there are some people that don't like this book. I have read other children's books, like Roal Doal, and the Whitch in the Wardrobe, and those are all great books, but this book beats them all.

Buy this book if you dont have it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Certainly there are more educational or lyrical children's books out there, but this one scores with me for just being plain fun and a page-turner. Though it starts off a little slow, the excitement builds as Harry takes off for his new Witchcraft and Wizardry School. Though no longer a kid myself, I believe what kids find so enjoyable -- other than the magic and mystery of it all -- is the rather frank way it mirrors peer competitiveness and companionship. And family and adult dealings are taken to hilarious extremes. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book! It is never boring and is so interesting. Ilove the amounts of imagination that is involved and never thought Iwould enjoy a children's book so much. As far as what the religious protesters say I think they are stupid! There is nothing wrong with an imagination, they cannot get past their puritanical points of views long enough to see that kids are reading again! This book is great and the liberator of young readers. I supose they rather children remain ignorant of the joys of reading, not all books are boring! Well, this book is execelant and I recommend it to anyone of any age the subject matter is appealing to all age groups while the reading is nice and simple.

One day last September, I wandering around aimlessly at a B. Dalton bookstore after school and then suddenly a paperback edition of The Sorcerer's Stone caught my eye. I had heard about this new Harry Potter craze, so I decided to shell out the six dollars to see what all this fuss was about. I picked up my copy of Harry Potter One and happily skipped off to the counter to pay for it. When I got home, I immidiately rushed to my bedroom, flopped down in my green-apholstered reclining chair, and read it the whole way through. I simply couldn't put this book down; I enjoyed profusely. J.K. Rowling is now one of the few favorite authors I have; her work is just so, well, I can't find a greater word to express my feelings about it, but, it's utterly brilliant. After about three consecutive hours of blissful reading, I came to the end of Book One, and I had the great urge to go out and read the next two, and now I'm looking forward to obtaining the fourth enstallment of this captivating series. Now, I know that there are probably many out there who have heard of Harry Potter but have merely shrugged it off without having actually reading one of the novels or giving it a fair chance, I highly suggest you just read it with an open mind.

In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling, a boy named Harry Potter mysteriously survived a brutal attack by a wicked wizard named Voldemort. This vicious wizard killed Harry's parents and forced Harry to live with his uncle's family, who hate all wizardry and are disgusted by Harry. A wizard named Hagrid rescued Harry from living with his uncle, and takes him to train wizardry at a school named Hogwarts. During his year at Hogwarts, Harry surrounds himself with supportive friends, encounters a variety of different monsters, becomes a part of an aerial sport called Quidditch, and races against Voldemort for the treasure that's hidden within Hogwarts.The author of the book, J.K. Rowling, was a poor mother that began writing the book to entertain her child. Now she is now a very rich and successful woman due to her very popular book. The main thesis of her book is that: someone who has nothing and lost everything, is still special and can be an important part of society. This is her claim because she was very poor and had a hard time making enough to live.Rowling supports her claim by creating a situation for a boy, who lost his family and his home, was able to stop Voldemort's reign of terror. Harry was a boy that was hated and disrespected by his guardians, but learned from Hagrid that he was special and is a wizard. Harry, started without having very many friends, becomes instantly popular by being one of the youngest people to join the Quidditch team. He also went from someone not helping his class team earn points, to earning several points for his class. He also was not very good at magic, and could hardly do any magic at all, but then became a very powerful wizard. Harry was not the wisest in his class either, but he was able to gain intelligence through research to be able to compete with Voldemort. Overall, the claim that everyone is special was powerfully supported throughout Rowling's book.Rowling's evidence was comfortably supported throughout her book and does well with dealing with counter evidence. Throughout the book, Harry does a good job of becoming the comeback kid and helping his peers. She deals with counter evidence by making the snobby people who are always expected to win, lose. She also makes people who are in power over him, like his uncle's family and Snape (his professor), seem spoiled, selfish, and malicious.Her argument that anyone in society can be special is very powerful and convincing. Harry, who was a disadvantaged but loyal child, became a hero through his skills in wizardry, intelligence, quidditch player, and problem solving skills. Harry trusted and was loyal to the Dursley family (his uncle's family), even though they were cruel to him and lying to him about his parents, which Hagrid learned about and shouter \\"\`It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story...\\"' (53 Rowling). Even though Harry, as an infant, was able to defeat the dark wizard that was so famous and evil that he was given the nickname \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,\\" he was treated horribly and lied to about his parents and even himself. He was able to gain strength while at Hogwarts, and was able to use his expensive and special broomstick, the \\"Nimbus Two Thousand.\\" His broomstick, which no one else has, shows him gaining friends, popularity, shows his special skill in quidditch, and he would use the broomstick to help gain many points for his class. All in all, Rowling supports her claim that anyone, including someone that was mistreated like Harry, could gain a reputation in society and stop evil!Some books that are similar to this fantasy and magical book are: Eragon, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Hobbit. If you like these books and find them enjoyable to read, you will also like Harry Potter. The reason these are similar is because they all have a deep storyline with fantasy and magic.Lastly, this book was very interesting, due to many suspenseful moments, and its plot twists. Rowling keeps the book suspenseful by not providing the answers to a lot of the questions in the book, or she keeps the answers very vague. Kids from the ages of 8-14 would really enjoy this book, due to the book being an easy read, and the book was in a mythical environment. Some kids can also find that they can relate to some of the conflicts and contemplations in the book. Finally, Harry Potter was a really good book that I personally enjoyed for its suspense, drama, battles, and quidditch."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book out of curiosity, and while I sort of enjoyed it, it definitely is not a book for adults (I am 32). The plot is subdivided in several chapters, which are more or less self-contained (this book reminded me of a season of half hour sitcom shows). The storyline does not advance much in each chapter, but little by little something happens. Am I going to read the sequels? Maybe. Read it only if you have kids or if you're into stuff kids like."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is another great addition to your Harry Potter collection."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not really into the wizardry book genre, but I read this to try to figure out why people like it so much. It's creative, well-written, has a good bit of humor, a nice twist at the end; overall a good quality work. It has very few drawbacks, the only one of which I notice is its length. It's long already and if you're not into wizards and stuff the book seems much longer. (By the way, I think about half of the kid's fiction books on the market are about wizardry. Don't ask me why this one stands out more than those because I haven't read them.) The last 3 chapters were great, but chapters 8 through 14 kind of drag as they're setting up for the last few chapters.I think I liked the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe a bit better than this because it's much shorter, and it doesn't have classrooms and things like that in it. It's more fantasy and less real-world. I like fantasy, but I like fantasy without wizards. Books like that are tough to find, except for things like Dahl's books and pure fairy tales. By the way, I like this book better than Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, although I'm more likely to read Glass Elevator again because it's much shorter and requires less of a commitment.I could nit-pick about how come that secret Flamel name was on the candy card and not in any of the books, and about how I didn't like the way the good guys won the house cup by seemingly making up the rules as they went, but I think that's just a matter of personal taste. Instead I'll nitpick about the way the book influences kids. I've heard some Christians are mad at this book because it promotes witchcraft, but it doesn't promote witchcraft any more than Bewitched, so that's not really a good argument. I think a bigger concern is with the way the kids in this book meddle in stuff they shouldn't meddle in and call it adventure. Darn kids.Anyway, 4 stars. Good, quality, but not AWESOME."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Harry Potter and The Chamber of SecretsJ.K. RowlingBrief summary: this book is about a kid named Harry potter who discovers that he is a wizard and can perform magic and spells. He goes to a school in which to harness these powers which his uncle forbids called Hogwarts. There at the school harry makes two friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and they suspect that their dark arts defense teacher Prof. Snape is planning something evil. They follow him around school facing trials and tribulations, using spells magic and know-how to save themselves from what they've already gotten themselves in to.I liked this book basically because it was full of magic I guess. I mean Its really not the type of book I read often, considering that I don't read much anyway, but the thing is, it was O.K. It had its highs and lows and I'm not allowed to disperse the most of them because they would ruin it for someone else. Anyway, I dislike it in the fact that this book takes so much credit from other books, there are other books about other things but they don't get an 1111212123243th of the credit.Would I recommend it? Eh, maybe given the right circumstances and asked the right way I would but it would really depend on the type of person asking.

She has to have her OWN PRIVATE store to purchase kindle books, without having to share a cut with Amazon? Greedy and gross. Leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. But still, I persevered, hoping to introduce my son to the wonderful world of Harry Potter...Pottermore was introduced as though it would magically link to my Amazon account, which it does not at all.

The directions are like a bad translation from, what, British?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've been hearing for years about how much so many people love the Harry Potter books and movies but I've never really felt compelled to get into them. When I told a friend I had never read any of the books or seen any of the movies he insisted that I was \\"missing out big time\\" and being that we typically share the same taste in movies and books I decided to try reading the first one and I have to say, I was pretty confused and disappointed with the story after I'd finished it. I say confused not because the story is hard to follow, more that it's just not all that interesting in my opinion and I don't get what makes it so special. It seems a very cliche story of the power of good versus evil and the one wizard that up and goes bad just for the sake of going bad apparently, not exactly the original ground breaking stuff some would have you believe. I just don't see what makes this story stand out from a dozen other similar stories I've read over the past few years. It's by no means a completely terrible book, it has it's moments where it's charm shines through but all in all I think this book was the beneficiary of a perfect storm of hype and marketing that just happened to push the book into the mainstream levels of popularity it achieved at just the right time. I've been told the later books are better but I guess I will never know as I literally had to force myself to finish this one, becoming bored and losing almost all interest less than halfway through the book. I'm normally a huge fan of fantasy material but I just felt like this book was following a familiar formula and seemed, not necessarily predicable, just not particularly surprising at any point (it really almost felt like something a non-fantasy writer would come up with in a semi-condescending effort just to sell books to fantasy fans because it hits most of the staples of things they've read before). Now that I have finished the first book, I really have no interest in reading the second but I may sit down and watch the movie one day, it's just not a story that I believe is worthy of all the praise and attention it's getting, maybe it's just me but I don't see what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the first Potter and I intend to read the others. And, these books will be useful if they get teenagers (and, as it appears, many adults) to read more, which seems to be happening. I ranked it a &quot;3&quot; because it is a good story with a neat twist in the end, but I feel the &quot;magic&quot; clutters a good story. In fact, I felt like a student at Hogwarts myselt with the overkill on the magic references. If fact, I think I learned enough to turn my desk blotter into a pink pig. That is what bothered me.I think this book strikes a chord with anyone who feels a left out yet dreams of finally finding purpose and meaning in life. With the venue of the book being magic, one might think that it takes magic to succeed. But, as we see in the end, love and concern for others is the strongest &quot;magic&quot;.I look forward to catching up with the rest of the world by finishing the other three books.

Harry begins to do research on Nicholas Flamel. christmas had came and Hermione had gone home while Harry and Ron had stayed behind to do more research. on christmas, Harry recieves an Invisible cloak from anonymous, the cloak came with a note that said &quot;use it well&quot; harry hadnt known what that had meant but he sure knew how to use it. that night when everyone had gone to sleep, harry snuck out of the house and went to the forbidden 3rd floor, there was a library section that was well, forbidden for 1st years to read, it was only open to the people who had went to Hogwarts or people with notes escorted by their teacher to do some research. Harry was so excited and he just took out a book and opened it, a face was screaming out of it. it made a loud noise and the caretaker came to see what was going on. harry dropped the lamp and ran. while he was turning a corner, he saw snape talking to quirrel in a bad way. harry was scared and was huffing and puffing from running from the caretaker. Snape hears the noise and reaches out to try to get something. it wasnt anything so he turned back to Quirrel. the caretaker had been looking for the student that was out of bed, he turned a corner and saw snape and quirrel &quot;talking&quot; and told them that a student was out of bed. harry ran as fast as he could and he came to a door and went in quietly. there he found a mirror, he saw himself and then a little while later he saw his parents, and all the relatives of his in the mirror. he sat and stared for a long time and Dumbledore appeared out of no where. the next day, everyone who went on christmas vacation came back. Hermione came back with a &quot;oh i remember now&quot; she had read about Nicholas flamel somewhere before and then she found the book again. it said that Nicholas Flamel and Professor Dumbledore were the creators of the Sorcerer's Stone. the sorcerer's stone was used to make an elixer for long life and if the stone was in the wrong hands, they were able to control the world of the wizards and the mortal world. harry then knew what was in vault 731. it was the sorcerer's stone. harry had gone on an adventure before, to look for things and found a three headed dog named fluffy who was guarding a trapdoor. Harry now knows what the dog was hiding and he knew what snape was after, the sorcerer's stone. One night, harry had detention with malfoy, hermione, and ron for some reason that i had forgotten, and had to go to the forest with Hagrid to search for a wounded unicorn. hagrid had found a wounded unicorn a few days ago. hagrid was hoping to find the unicorn. harry was partnered up with malfoy and they were walking and yelling at each other at the same time.they saw a vampire looking like person thing that was drinking unicorn blood malfoy saw it and ran away screaming. harry was frozen and couldnt move, the shadowy creature was moving towards Harry, he slipped and fell. a centaur came to the rescue and saved Harry. hagrid, hermione, and ron had caught up with harry and found that he was safe and sound. harry new that was Voldemort. the next day, Harry and his friends had visited Hagrid and hagrid had a Baby Dragon. Harry asked where he had gotten it and Hagrid told him that he was at the Cauldron getting a drink and then a little man comes up to him and asks him to play a hand of cards and the man offers the Hagrid a baby dragon and the little man asked for a three headed dog, and hagrid said he had one while he was drunk, and then he asked how to get pass the three headed dog and hagrid told him that if you played a song then the dog would go to sleep. after hagrid had said that harry and his friends were looking for dumbledore, trying to tell him that hagrid told someone how to get pass fluffy. Harry, hermione, and ron had ran to the counsiling office too look for dumbledore and proffessor mcgonnal was there. harry asked to speak to dumbledore but she said that he had left to go to a meeting at Romania. Harry knew that since dumbledore had left, Voldemort could just go into Hogwarts and kill harry, harry knew he would've died and knew that Voldemort would go after the stone. Harry had to die trying, so he woke ron and hermione and they went to the trapdoor. the dog was already put to sleep by a cursed harp. harry had used the invisible cloak to get to the trapdoor and he took out a flute hand carved by Hagrid, and played it. harry got into the trapdoor first and then ron then hermione, when harry stopped playing the flute the dogs woke up. Harry and them hand landed in a pile of vines and it was a soft landing too. harry had to through a long line of protections sutff and then finally, harry got to the end of the challenges. he was expecting snape but instead it was quirrel and the mirror that harry had found the other day. Quirrel was standing in front of hte mirror saying &quot;i knew you would come&quot;, he also said that he could see himself holding the stone but he didnt know how to get it. a voice from behind said &quot;use the boy&quot; then Quirrel told harry to go to the mirror. Harry had seen himself with the stone in his pocket, and suddenly, something felt heavier in his pocket. harry was scared and didnt know what to say. he lied, he told quirrel that he was holding the house cup and then a voice from no where again said &quot;he lies&quot; then the voice said &quot;let me talk to him&quot; and then qurirrel began unwrapping his turban and then he turned around, wut was behind quirrel's head was scary looking, it was voldemort. voldemort knew that the stone was in potter's pocket. Quirrel ran to potter and choked harry, the stone fell out of his pocket. harry tried to move quirrel's hand from his neck and the moment harry touched quirrel, quirrel's hand began to blister and burn with pain, harry used the rest of his strength to keep quirrel from the stone. Harry began to feel tired and sleepy, when he woke up dumbledore was sitting besides him and he told him what had happened and explained to him that he had destroyed the stone and that nicholas flamel was like over 600yrs old and is about to die soon. His friends came to visit him and harry told him what had happened. the story goes to the end of the book, gryffindor had last place, huffle-puff was third, ravenclaw was second and slytherin was 1st. everyone in the slytherin house was cheering. dumbledore had called for everyone's attention, he added additional points to gryffindor and then gryffindor has 1st place and everyone except for slytherin was cheering. this story ends with harry potter saying good bye to hagrid and going back to the mortal world, remembering and dreaming at the same time to get back at his cousin."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is your classic boarding school story/adventure, with the usual cast of characters. The stern nun-like character (McGonagall), the evil professor (Snape), and the strong but gentle groundskeeper (Hagrid). Think groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons. In fact, you can cast the rest of the characters that way, too. The mischievous Harry Potter (Bart), his sidekick Ron (Milhouse), the law-abiding Hermione (Lisa), the wimpy Neville (Ralph), and the school bully Malroy (Nelson). There's nothing essentially new about these characters nor the roles they play.Of course, this doesn't necessarily take away from the story itself, because it is an entertaining story. Unfortunately, the sudden hype and its backlash had somewhat obscured what Harry Potter really is. It's an interesting children's book. It's not the best book ever written (as some seem to suggest), and in retrospect, probably not exactly deserving of all its accolades. In marketing terms, it's a cash cow. Rowling will most likely try her best to complete the &quot;promised&quot; seven books before the interest wears out and/or before the current Potter fans outgrow him. The series will probably be done before 2004, and all seven books will not be turned into movies. Most likely the interest will end at movie 4, if not sooner. She will try to keep her promise of keeping it to seven books, but I doubt she'll stray far from the Harry Potter universe. Most likely, she'll start a new series, and get sick of critics (and readers) endlessly comparing it to Harry Potter, and Harry Potter (or one of the characters) will make a comeback or spin-off, and she'll say: &quot;Well, it's not really the same character...&quot; Just a hunch.Well, back to the story, I actually did enjoy it. It did keep my interest. I can certainly see why it's so popular with adolescents. It's exciting to see a book have such an impact on a society, even if the book and its impact isn't exactly Goethe and The Sorrows of Young Werther, or Joyce and Ulysses.

It was written by Joanne K. Rowling and was first published in 1997. But the real Harry Potter- boom came later when it got known all over the world.Joanne K. Rowling was born in 1965 in Yate in the South of England. On the journey from King's Cross Station to Manchester \\"Harry Potter just popped into my head, already fully formed.\\"Joanne won several prices like the Smarties Book Prize and the British Book Award.She is married with three children and famous all over the world because more than 300 million copies were sold world-wide. J. K. Rowling is the first British writer who became a US-billionaire by writing books.The book is so special because it is easy to understand and is really humorous but also exciting. What also makes it special is that it has a kind of open end and makes you dream of magic and fairy-tales...Harry Potter is a young wizard who grows up with his aunt, his uncle and his spoiled cousin because his parents were killed by Lord Voldemort, or You-Know-Who, as most wizards call him.Shortly before his eleventh birthday Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard. Against the will of his aunt and uncle he leaves for his new school called Hogwarts.At Hogwarts he meets a lot of other wizards and witches. He saves a classmate from a troll and fights against the evil making a lot of new friends.To give you an idea of the book and the style of writing in English, I'd like to read two short sequences from it. (p. 1 and p. 208)Opinions:This book is fascinating! Once you start you can never put it down again; you're taken by it right from the very first moment. I'd absolutely recommend it to everybody here, because the language isn't very difficult, so quite easy to understand, it's as thrilling as a crime novel and leads to the main topic of the series and introduces the main characters.(we were forced to place this into the internet)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry This book is a great book to read.

Then the exciding part of his life arrives. Harry finds out that he is a wizard and his mother and father were wizards and they didn't die in car cash.

But don't be fooled, the the only excepting of Breakfast at Tiffany's, I've NEVER seen a movie that was 1/10 as good as the book. Harry Potter is no exception. The series gets better as the books get longer, but this one started it all. It's a great book for children, easy to read and understand. Well written and developed makes it great for adults. You'll have a hard time putting it down as you get wrapped up in the secret world of the wizzard school, while Harry and his friends have mishaps and triumphs a plenty. You've probably heard the negitive criticisms surrounding this book, but don't let others decide for you, read it and make your own decisions. As an easy read for adults, it won't take much time to preview it for your children as well. But don't stop at book on, as I said they only get better and better. Read it today so you can share the hype and anticipation for book 5!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter books never got my attention since they came out. People would talk about how great and amazing the collections of these books were. Once I started to read the first page of book 1 around a year ago but I closed the book and never opened to finish it again.A couple of months ago I found out the movie was going out soon. I wanted to go see it because I just wanted to know about the mysterious scar Harry had in his head. Many of my friends were very excited about the movie, but I wasn't. When the movie came out people made great reviews and all I could hear was Harry Potter. I was beginning to feel curious about the movie and the book because it was being compared.I picked up the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and began to read it but this time I didn't close it, I kept on reading it, and found out how amazing and fantastic book it was. It got my attention that I read it in 4 days. I couldn't put it down.Mainly this book is about a boy wizard called Harry Potter. He has been living for 11 years with his muggle (human) family the Dursley's. The Dursley's didn't like Harry so much. They had a life of their own before he arrived at their doorstep by Albus Dumbledore (he was the headmaster of Hogwarts school for witches and wizards) with a letter explaining to them how and why Harry had to live with them. Mrs. Dursley's sister and her husband had been killed and told the story of how Harry had survive and when he got to a certain age to tell him that he wasn't just a normal kid he was also a legend and a wizard. The Dursley's didn't want Harry to be a legend and let him know he was a wizard they just wanted him to be normal. Harry lived inside a cupboard underneath the stairs. He wasn't happy though. He had this annoying and spoiled cousin Dudley who would pick on Harry. Harry was very small for his age, he was skinny and wore big eyeglasses that were hold on together with tape because of the many times Dudley had punch him on the nose.Near his 11th birthday a bunch of strange letters were addressed to Harry. He didn't get to see him because his uncle didn't want him to see what they were about. The day of his birthday Harry was woken up at midnight by Hagrid (he worked at Hogwarts) and told him about how Harry was a wizard and how he was a legend and he had been selected to go to Hogwarts school for witches and wizards and that's were Harry Potters adventure begins. Harry meets many amazing friends and goes through many adventures.I really liked this book and I regret it not finishing it the first time. I'm looking forward to see the movie and also read the next Harry Potters book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J. K Rowling has written an exciting book called \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.\\" When you start to read the book you have to keep reading it because there is so much action going on. This is a book about magic where many fantastic things occur. Harry lived with the Dursley's who were his uncle and aunt, and with Dudley his cousin. His room was a tiny closet in the foot of the stairs. They treated him badly because they didn't like him and they made him wash the dishes and do the chorus of the house. Harry had never had a birthday party or received a present in eleven years. One day Harry receives a letter that was brought by an owl that invited him to Hogwarts a school of magic.On his way to Hogwarts he met Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley who became his two good friends. He also met Draco Malfoy a boy who didn't like Ron and wanted Harry to be his friend not Ron's friend. He also liked to bother Harry and Ron a lot. Harry was famous in Hogwarts since he was a baby because he was the only one who survived when a bad wizard called Voldemort went and killed his parents. When he got to Hogwarts he met Professor Dumbuldore the school's principal, he also met other teachers like Snape, Quirrel, Moganigal, Sinistra and Flitwick. In Hogwarts there was a game called Quidditch that was about catching a ball flying on a broom. Harry, Hermione and Ron got in trouble lots of times but he discovered something very important for Hogwarts. Someone wanted to steal something very important that belonged to Hogwarts.My OpinionI give this book five start because it is a very exciting book to read. I liked how J. K. Rowling writes because she makes you keep reading the book because it is so interesting that you want to know what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Very great book ups and downs all throughout the book best fantasy book I ever read.

I've always wanted to read the harry potter series and I get to"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After noticing the fuss about these books, I bought the first three. I thought it would be impossible for them to live up to their reputation, but they actually do!Rowling begins with a popular plot-device: a character who is the underdog. Repressed by his callous Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, the orphan Harry Potter has been able to do little to help himself against their abuse. We instantly feel for him, as the object of such abuse, but our sympathy is due to his situation, not to his character. Many authors would leave it there, never giving us positive reasons to like the main character. However, Rowling does, with such instances such as Harry struggling against his Uncle Vernon (he tries to get the letters) &amp; his kindness to Hermine. Another area where Rowling's surpasses expectations is the fact that although Harry is talented, he doesn't really go beyond his own abilities to beat Lord Voldemort. This makes the end of the book much more satisfying than many others with the same initial set-up.Another area for rejoicing is that Rowlings doesn't shy away from complexity, either in her choice of words or her characters' reactions to situations.Combine the character with delightful language, a richly imagined new world, an engaging story and characters who have layers to them, situations in which we see true moral behavior -- the struggle to do what is right -- and Rowling's creations clearly demonstrate their reason for their popularity.How wonderful to encounter an author who does everything right!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I ordered this series of books because I am an adult interested in children's literature and hope to write some of my own. Harry Potter is a timeless hero to whom anyone can relate - he is &quot;everyperson&quot;. Boys, girls, men and women will be able to identify with this young person who is not &quot;perfect&quot; but extraordinary in his own way. If you like stories about Merlin, King Arthur, the Narnia books by C.S. Lewis, the Oz books, The Phantom Tollbooth, Babes in Toyland, even Charlotte's Web - you will like these books. Fantasy is a wonderful way to express the human experience to children of all ages. We can learn something about courage, friendship, trust and loyalty from Harry Potter, his friends, and through his very exciting adventures. Good versus evil - an age-old conflict. When times are tough a little magic can never hurt.Read this to your children, let them read it to you or to themselves, and then read the next books - they are successively better than the first!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is J.K Rowling's first book in the series and my favorite so far. She's an amazing writer with such depth and a remarkable ability to see the world in the eyes of the children who will read and love this book just as I have. You don't even realize it but as you are reading this book there is this certain love you begin to have for each of the main characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione) and a certain loathing for the bad guys (Professor Snape, Draco Malfoy). Children and adults alike will find a special place in their hearts for this series. I know I did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heard alot about J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books and decided to check it out for myself. Once I read the jacket of her first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I knew I'd love it. This book was the first one I have read in a long time and I am glad it was. Today I am going to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Maybe I can read this one in 2 sittings (I read the first one in 3). I reccomend this book to anyone who can get their hands on it. It was so very interesting and exciting. You get to know the characters and feel what they're feeling. It is so easy to imagine, or wish, that you could be Harry, Hermoine, or Ron. This book was just so good, too bad we can't play Quidditch. ="},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I haven't even finished this book and I think it is fantastic. I ordered the other 2 Harry Potter books yesterday. These books are definitely ageless.

I was on the edge of my seat when I was reading it and during the climax I could have sworn my hair stood on end! Besides the suspense I also enjoyed how interesting it was with the made-up words and interesting twists. Over all, I love the book and would recommend it to anyone that wants to be intrigued to read a great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone was written by J.K Rowling. A boy named Harry was placed on his aunt's and uncle's door step. His aunt and uncle wanted nothing to do with him, so they made him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs.When a letter appeared on his front steps, his uncle wouldn't let him read it. His uncle got scared and let him sleep in the house. The next day another letter came. His uncle got even madder and went on a family trip. The first night they stayed in a hotel, but another letter came. Harry's uncle went to rent a boat and floated accross the lake to a cabin and spent the night. As they were going to sleep, a giant named Hagrid took Harry to buy his wizard supplys. Then Harry was back with his aunt and uncle and began school where he has many more adventures. But I will not tell you any more, you have to read Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone. I recommend this book to all of you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a child, and when I first saw this book, I thought that it was just another pathetic stab at a child wizard. Then I started reading it, and I couldn't put it down! J.K. Rowling takes all children's fantasies, and breathes life into them through Harry Potter. Such as flying on broomsticks, and wearing invisibility cloaks. Then Rowling takes children's everyday experience and puts them to life. Draco Malfoy is the &quot;bully&quot; at Hogwarts School of Whitchcraft and Wizardry, and when you read about Harry's troubles with him, you develope a loathing for Malfoy also. I highly reccomend this book, and I hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an awesome book! In my class our teacher gives us 20 minutes to read books. When I first got this book, I thought it was going to be some dorky fairy tale thing, because I'm not the kind of person that likes those books!

Get it RIGHT NOW!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A whole lot of people had recommended these Harry Potter books to me. So finally, I decided to try them. My friend let me borrow the first two books. I didn't think they looked that great, but I decided to read them anyways. And boy, was I surprised! They were great! I thought that the first one, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; was definitely the best. I'd like to give a big thank you to J.K. Rowlings, for writing these wonderful books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is such a good book, I loved it. Harry Potter was so good I couldn't stop reading this great book. It was filled with lots of good detail.

Tons of great characters are in this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hi, my name is Sarah . . . I'm 26 years old, and I LOVE the Harry Potter books! At first I felt really awkward admitting this, but as the days pass and I anxiously await the fourth book to hit the bookstores, I've become much more vocal about these fabulously exciting, interesting, creative books! For me, it all started when my mother called me in October and told me that John, my 8-year old brother, was dressing up as Harry Potter for Halloween. WHO? I asked. NEVER HEARD OF HIM! My mother -- who is also a 2nd grade teacher -- patiently tried to explain about this new book hero, and I chalked it up to one of those weird fads kids have these days, like that Pokemon thing. Then Thanksgiving came, along with my family and my little brother's Harry Potter book collection. By this time, I'd heard a little bit about this J. K. Rowling person and her imaginative new characters. So thus it began. I picked up John's shiny new edition of THE SORCERER'S STONE and was immediately transported into the World of Witchcraft and Wizardry! It was wonderful! It was sad! It was funny! I LOVED it! Not only has it become a wonderful addition to my library, it has forged a new bond between my much younger brother and myself. . . before this, I rolled my eyes at his attempts to explain his Gameboy to me. Now we compare notes on what Harry and his friends are up to next! I truly admire J. K. Rawling's talent and hope that she keeps the books coming. . .we're dying to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...on the level of the Chronicles of Narnia[C.S.

For me, though it falls just a little short of these classics, although the Potter series will become a classic down the road."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got lucky last week and picked up a copy Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the local library. It took me less than one afternoon to finish and I couldnt wait to get my hands on the next one. I am avid reader, and I enjoy all the usual best sellers, Patricia Cornwell, John Grisham, etc. but this is the best book i have read in ages. It was exciting, colorful, descriptive, totally unrealistic and I was sad when i finished. I cannot wait to read it aloud to my children, ages 6 and 8."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a masterpiece. At first I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it. But if you're like that don't be. Order the book and enjoy. I guarantee you won't be able to put it down and you'll be reading more of the series. From the beginning you're pulling for this kid who gets dropped on his horrible aunt and uncle's doorstep and is forced to live under the steps in a cabinet. It will captivate you. No matter what age you are, don't hesitate. It's a great book for ANYBODY! Thank you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I got done reading this book i couldn't wait to read the next one. I never liked fantisy books until I read this book. I couldn't put it down. This book has opened a new door to reading for me.Dear J.K. Rowling i could never thank you enough for writing this book. Thank You!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a first book in a series, almost the first half of the book is devoted to setting up the story that has to happen later. Still, the plotlines of this second story are laid out early on, so the book does not seem to break from the origin-of-Harry-Potter to the story of the Sorcerer's Stone. That alone is worth a couple stars.I found the storytelling style similar to that of Roald Dahl, who wrote Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and many other children's stories. I think this is what has many of the protesters upset. There are some things that happen in the book that Americans have been conditioned to believe, over the last thirty years or so, that we have to hide from children. Scary monsters, people getting hurt, and generally nasty villains, for example. We seem to have sanitized these things from our literature in favor of more &quot;child-friendly&quot; story endings where nobody really gets hurt and everything turns out OK, monsters aren't really evil but only misunderstood, people we thought were dead come back, and the happy home is preserved. Well, not in this book. Harry's Parents die early on in the novel (we learn about this from other characters; we don't read it happening) and they don't come back.The story itself is great, full of new ideas and new angles on old ideas. It inspires imagination in the children and adults who read it. I can't understand why anyone would be stupid enough to want to ban it in our schools. I thought the goal of a school was to encourage children to think. I believe this book does that successfully, as I watched my daughter try to puzzle out the mystery, and even enjoying having been wrong about some her guesses when she finished the book. It's a treat for children and adults!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am no longer a kid. Except that is when I am engaged in this book. I listened to the audio book version on long business trips and loved each moment of the tale. So much so that I got the second book on audio and am in the midst of it now. I would recommend this book to children of all ages from 8 to 80."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a 15 year old girl who started reading the Harry Potter series when I read them to the girls that I babysit for- who, by the way, also love them. If you're thinking about buying the 1st Harry Potter book, you should stop thinking and buy it now! But don't buy it without buying the next 2, because once you finish the first one, you won't want to wait to read the next two- I read the first 3 books in 3 days! The plot is great, with an ending you'd never expect, just like the second one! I loved getting lost in Harry's world of wizardry and I'm sure anyone of any age would, too. Great series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to take away at least one star for Jim Dale's reading of this story. His inflections were strange and poorly timed. On more than one occasion there was a passage that he read flat or pensive that ended in &quot;she exclaimed&quot;! Oh well, as long as you can make the mental adjustments for how the text OUGHT to read, you'll do fine. I spend 2-3 hours in my car daily, so this was a great way to be a part of the Potter craze."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't believe how good this book was.

But after I read the first chapter, I wanted to know more and more. Four and a half days later, I was finished! I think it is inspiring to children and adults. I think it's amazing how when Voldermort tried to kill Harry, he got a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead. I would recommend the Harry Potter to kids or adults of any age. You're never too old to read about magic, amazement, and Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's a keen premise, but this is really a pretty rambling story with a lame ending. Harry is never much developed as a character, though I guess his blandness is appealing, sort of like Tom Hanks, people feel they can identify with him. The famed Nicolas Flammel never appears, which is also disappointing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got this book on my 14th birthday and stayed up until 12:30 AM to finish it. I can't wait until I get the Chamber of Secrets. This book deserves the Five Star rating it has. I certainly hope that Rowling writes the last six as good as the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We(my little sister and I) read this together and simply loved it.

This book compares with no other book that I have read recently, maybe with the the exception of the Jean Shepherd books, but this book is still great. All the time I thought it was really (can't say), but it was really (can't say)! A story with many twists, turns, and adventures, it will surely keep me hooked until the final installment!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book is well written, both my mother and I enjoyed it. But I personally think it IS NOT the BEST book ever written &quot;surpassing all others&quot;. There are other series that are better just because the authors are more prolific in their writing, no series can be &quot;5 stars&quot; best ever without at least having the sequels come quick. Once all the books are out, &lt;&lt;Maybe&gt;&gt; it might deserve better, but until then, I still think that the DragonLance Saga (TSR) or the 24 or so books by david eddings are more enjoyable because they came out quickly... All in all I would recommend this book for most readers, 9-Adult (however old that may be...) But do not think that it is the Earth shattering book it is portrayed to be, almost all of the concepts in the Book have been done before in some form in other books.

The only remarkable thing about him is that he has a lightning bolt scar. He lives with his aunt and uncle because his parents tragically died when he was only 1 years old. his aunt uncle and cousin are horrible to him. but one day something comes to change his life forever. a letter. it invites him to go yo a school for wizards. he cant believe his luck ( hes never had any before).He sets off to hogwarts. there he meets friends, learns about his magic, has to deal with a scarry teacher, finds out what really happened the night his parents died, and may even battle a troll!

I forgot how these books just suck my mind into a world of magic.I rarely ever reread anything. The only exception would be John Green, Kurt Vonnegut, and the book Tuesdays with Morrie. I don't like to waste time reading something again.However, this is far from a waste of time. I planned to give myself last week and this week to read book one as I have barely done any pleasure reading this entire year. I did not need that much time as I polished this book off in a few days.I am not going to give a book review like I normally do, but instead just speak about the experience of reading it again. Obviously this book series is one of the best series to ever be created. What I found to be so exciting was reading the story again forgetting so many cool things. I kept reading and thinking, \\"How did I forget about this character or that event?\\". I then took the time to look up names of people and phrases and such and was blown away by how much is really hidden in these books. The mirror of erised for example is such an obvious play on words that I overlooked until I Googled to see if Erised was a name of a mythological character(I was way off!). While reading I found myself constantly looking for little gems like this.I built a Google Doc page I am recording parts that I liked - [...]The first book in the series was even better than I remembered. I cannot wait to begin book two.

I absolutely loved this book. I was actually scared for Harry Potter and the information that he was told about his parents, not being fully accepted by his Aunt, Uncle, and his cousin. I like stories where characters are living one life and then they come into another life that is completely opposite from what he grew up with.

I really enjoyed reading this along with Pottermore. Pottermore incorporates a lot of the details mentioned in the story. It was fun to pay attention to the little details this time since I know the story so well. I also liked reading the bonus material she wrote on Pottermore - it adds a lot to the story. I don't know if I realized this before, but J.K. Rowling is excellent at showing and not telling. For example: \\"[Mr. Dursley] hummed \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\\" and as he worked, jumped at small noises.\\" She doesn't have to say that he's starting to lose it because I've decided that for myself. The books have so many fun characters that aren't in the movies. I love how optimistic and humble Harry is. I also like how light-hearted and quirky the books are. The movies tend to focus on the darker aspects of the story. I never get tired of reading these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Brilliant book, on of my favorites even after a decade. can't wait to read the rest of the series for the hundredth time"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic book!!

When Harry Potter books and movies became popular, I only wanted to see the films, but after seeing the films, I realized I wanted to get to know the characters a little more. So, I decided to read the books. This process began with this book. This book contains a great deal of information which allows the reader to get to know Harry and other essentail characters better. The backgroud of Harry's past is explained in a way that the movies could not protray. Also, while reading this book, I was able to notice differnt aspects of Hogwarts that were not shown in the movie. I understand that these books can be concerning to some people because they contain witchcraft, but I do not believe the protrayal of witchcraft is too over powering. This book takes a good approach to a make believe world. Students in middle school would really enjoy this book because it is an easy read, and it allows them to escape from the ordinary. Also, students can compare the book to the movie. They can essentail questions like \\"Was the movie better than the book? Why or why not?\\" Or, \\"If I lived in this \\"different world\\" how would it affect the way I act, or go about daily life.\\" This book is great because it allows people to step outside of the ordinary and experience something extraordinary, which is what every middle schoolers wants anyways, right?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What more can be said?

I consider myself a discerning reader, especially in the areas of fantasy and science fiction (because that's basically all I read when I was in junior high). I've read Tolkien. I've read Shakespeare. I've read Orwell. I've read Card. And now, I've read Rowling.I finished the first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, in one night. That alone says something -- Rowling is a gifted storyteller. Granted, part of this is that they're short and easy, but she really does do a magnificent job of playing with the fantastic elements of the story. Many characters are one dimensional, a few plot elements are a little weak, and some parts I found myself wanting to skip, but in general this book is superb. I give it four stars for Rowling's fun, meaningful, and all around good piece of literature. Yeah, it's not The Lord of the Rings, but who really wants carbon copies of Tolkien? There are enough of those. Harry Potter's world is his own."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"(Wonder how many others have used that not too imaginative adjective in describing this same thing?)There has been some discussion, most likely among people who have not read them, about what the reason for the popularity of the Harry Potter books could be, discussions which have involved words like &quot;escapism&quot; and other weird analysation. After reading this first book, the answer seemed perfectly obvious to me: they are just simply so very good.Like all of the others in the series, this book seems to have oddly many pages; a hundred will sometimes pass by so fast as to feel like less than fifty. This is simply because the reading can be so enjoyable. The idea of a kid who suddenly finds out he's a wizard and all that related stuff is somewhat intriguing but not terribly ingenious in itself, and it would never have made this book so popular; it may add to it, but what really matters is the skill of the writer. It is hard to say what magic Rowling has used but it sure works. This has to be one of the most readable books I have ever encountered. It is also very imaginative, even though every idea has in a sense been taken from somewhere else (broomsticks, assorted mythological creatures, Bad Wizard etc., and I am pretty sure there must be plenty of books about kids messing around in their school).About this book in particular: It may not be the best in the series but is nevertheless on the same level as the others. The plot is at the same time simple and quite complex (the latter because it lasts for a whole school year, and there is hardly any lack of activity, thus making for a considerable amount of side details). The characters are nice; the heroes are what could be called admirable in many ways, but still not perfect, since many think of rules as being completely irrelevant. In fact, look like the author has the same kind of tendencies, since the people who do follow rules tend to be at least annoying (and just think of the Dursleys).Like The Hobbit, this is a children's book that is excellent reading for adults as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a great story for anyone to read. But all those people who say it is shallow, listen. If you look under the surface you will find a huge expanse of greek and roman legends, acient traditions and millions of different languages and cultures that J.K.Rowling used in her books. I suggest looking at a book like \\"The sorcerers companion\\" by Elizabeth Kronzek. It explains all the wonderful legends and magical creatures behind the story. So don't say it is boring before you look deeper."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is so wonderful, but I hadn't even read the 1st book until september 2001! I read about five chapters in the first book and then I stopped because I thought was boring. Well bad me convinced a lot of my friends that they shouldn't read it. Shame on me! All the people who had read it kept pestering me to try it again. Sooooooo I did, and I read it all the way through. By November I had read all four! It was really good! After you get throught the first five or so chapters you really get into it and can't put it down. Now I'm stuck with trying to convince my friends it is really a great book. J.K. Rowling is a wonderful and magical writer. This book may look or at first sound dumb and stupid but it is NOT! It is a very good read and I would recomend it to everybody I know.All the charecters in this book really stand out and you get to know them really well!

Also literate people do read this book!...... =Quidditch Rules!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My daughter read this book about a year and a half before I did and loved it. I didn't think that I could really enjoy a children's book, though, and especially not one about pure fantasy. I was wrong! After one of my students did a book report on it, I decided to give it a shot. All I can say is -- incredible! Ms. Rowling has an amazing imagination and she knows how to make her characters come to life. This is fantasy that almost seems real. This is a book for everyone -- a refreshing break from the harsh reality of today's world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"BUY THIS BOOK! That's it, simply said.

It is a wonderful fairy tale with great characters and a very well crafted plot, but what I enjoyed most was that it was so accessible. It is written for younger children, so it is very easy to sit down for a few hours and just enjoy what you are reading without having to think too deeply or strain your brain while trying to follow the story. I will certainly join the crowd in recommending this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It may be the worst, but it's still one of the best books i've ever read.

It's a thrilling ride through a world of adventure. There are talking chess figures, magic mirrors and three headed dogs.

I am proud to say I am 23 years old and a fan of Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling reminds us what it's like to be a kid again! Her hero and weaving of the perfect imagiative and cerative story is timeless! I bet when my children go to school Harry Potter will be on the &quot;required reading list&quot; cause it is something you really need to experience to believe!

Well, I must say that I am thrilled that I did. My judgement based on book 1 tells me that these books have well earned their sucess. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very delightful read, introducing you to Harry, and letting you find out what makes him so special, you follow him and his two best friends through a series of wonderful adventures throughout his first year at Hogwarts school of magic. Throughout the entire book, you are introduced to a series of magnificent characters who are sure to warm your heart. This book is a great read loaded with tons of imagination for people of all ages to enjoy, and believe me, it leaves you eagerly anticipating the next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that this was a great book :)It was about an 11 year old wizard who goes off to Hogworts (a wizardry school)to find great trouble when learning about potions and spells.

Then when a 17 year old friend of mine told me how great they were, I just had to give it a try.I was amazed! It was excellent! I loved this book! Now, I am a high school student and thought (gee, I can't believe I liked this little kid book so much) but once I started asking around, I discovered that many, MANY people I know also read, and love Harry Potter books and as this is the first, most people had read it and agree, it was great!Just a note I'd like to add. Most of the negative comments I've read about the Harry Potter books are written by adults. Guess what? These books were not written with the intent to please you in mind! So think what you like, but I've seen kids that don't even like to read, pick up one of these books and and really enjoy reading for once, and who are so excited about getting the next book. So leave them alone. And be happy that more children have finally discovered the joy of reading.Do yourslef a favor, read this book, no matter how old you are, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a big Harry Potter fan but I almost gave up on the whole series while reading this book. I found it to be very boring and slow moving. I have talked to many other people who are into the series as well and they agree that this book is not that great.

This book is good for explanation and history but not great entertainment. I do agree that this is a great series just not this particular book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which was extremely intriguing, I could NOT put it down. Then I came here to buy one for a friend, I searched for Harry Potter Book 1 and I found it's called the &quot;Socerer's Stone&quot; instead. Why was it necessary to change the title? You can't find a meaning or description (not physical) of a socerer's stone in the dictionary but there is one for a philosopher's stone. And why change the text? An example is in chapter two; 'photographs showed a large, blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a roundabout at the fair,' this book changes roundabout to carousel. Do you think some people would picture the ones you drive around in England? I'm also not particularly fond of the cover art on the Scholastic publishings. I probably feel this way because I saw the artwork on the books published by Bloomsbury first. I'm not against the art work, or saying that I don't appreciate the artist's style but why change the text? Wasn't it comprehensible without the change?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book in one day, and when I did I was so upset that I finished it! It's one of those books you wish were everlasting! Of the four books (which I have recently finished) I found that this book stands out from the others because you learn with Harry about the wizarding world! The excitement of Muggles, Diagon Alley, Platform nine and three quarters, 'He who must not be named', and the amazement of Hogwarts itself is fresh, and new!The Story begins by learning of Harry's magical background, and being introduced to the horrid Dursley's, and the magnificent Harry. Withing the first page you will be whisked into the amazing story, and fall in love with good old Harry. This book contains so many memorable characters from the wonderful sidekicks Hermione, Ron, Hagard, and the gang... and the characters you love to hate: Proffesor Snape, Draco Malfoy, and fat, ugly Dudley Dursley!Buy this book immediately, and don't forget to get the next three too! You'll finish this book in a heartbeat, and you'll be aching to learn more about Harry and his wonderful life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I never actively set out to read the Harry Potter books - always felt that they sounded like Roald Dahl's children's books (which I really enjoyed!). That changed when someone gave me the first 3 books. So, I figured I had nothing to loose. As things go, my first impression that Harry Potter was written in the same vein as Roald Dahl was true. That is good because that makes the book quite enjoyable to read! However, I did feel at times that J.K. Dowling took the 'simple' route out and didn't really show any signs of wonderful little eccentric plot twists until the end of the book. Maybe this is because I am an adult. I am sure for kids and young teenager and the young at heart, this book is magic in itself. I will let slip that having progressed beyond this book in the series, it is defintely worth hanging in there - and you have to read this book to get going...

When I started reading it my mind changed immedeatly! I couldn't put it down! I loved how the author used big words I couldn't understand that led to big adventures that would get you so absorbed that you thought you were actually in thet book.

Our bedroom was alive with laughter when they mentioned the 'booger flavor bean' and they were snuggling close when they feared for Harry's safety. They would plead for &quot;one more chapter&quot; and then when they fell asleep, I continued reading on my own. It is a wonderful fictional book.

Magic books really didn't interest me much. But what I was yet to find out, the Harry Potter books weren't just full of magic, they were full of humor, adventure and fun! Then, not to long ago, I decided to find out what these Harry Potter books were all about. Once I started, I couldn't put it down! Harry Potter, just a normal kid living in a normal town with a pretty normal family, was wisked away to the most magical place he had ever seen, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He met friends like witty and wise Hermoine Granger and fun and likeable Ron Weasley. He also met many other different people like the two class clowns, the Weasley twins, Fred and George, Percy the Perfect Weasley, the evil Professor Snape and many more. And you can't just stop with the Sorcerer's Stone, then comes the Prisioner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire. I recommend all four of them to you because they're so full of adventure and fun, you won't be able to put them down. I know I couldn't!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, written by J.K. Rowling, is one of the best books I have ever read. Harry Potter, an eleven year old who lives with his horrid aunt, uncle and cousin is invited to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he finds out that he is a wizard. At Hogwarts he meets such friends as Ron Weasley, a tall red-haired boy, Hermione Granger, the smartest witch in her class, Rubeus Hagrid, a big, friendly giant and albus Dumbledore, the principal of the school. But will Harry have enough brains to figure out what's going on at Hogwarts?

I have to tell you, this book is fantastic. I could not put it down. It is full of adventure, heart, and fun. Rowling, does an exceptional job of bringing the characters and and their surroundings to life. From the beginning when Harry is at Privet drive to Hogwarts, to coming face-to-face with &quot;you know who&quot;, the reader is embraced by the lead character and all that he experiences. I am hooked. I am on the 3rd book of the series and am looking forward to the 4th book. In each tale, you become more attached to Harry and his friends, you can really appreciate their innocenence, their bravery and their sense of adventure. It does not matter what age you are, these are just really fantastic books.

The CE is really nice, bound in leather, gold-randered pages, an original drawing of Harry Potter by the author. But the story between the heavy leather covers is just fantastic.This is an extraordinary return to fiction in the range of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings - although it is definitely no reflection of this fantasy classic as another reviewer mentioned. This is a very original book, beautifully written, full of heart and full of mind - a rare combination only the person can achieve who writes not for a living but lives for writing.By the way, this is no children's book! As a matter of fact, I imagine the book to be very creepy for somebody who still goes to Elementary School. I enjoyed reading. There are lots of wizards, dragons, flying broomsticks, and loads of magic.This is fantasy just the way it has to be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A great start! This book is the first, and maybe best of a series of seven books.Harry Potter is really famous in the wizarding world. At the age of one, he survived a curse of the powerful Dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. His parents, however, died. Ever since then, Harry has lived with The Dursleys, his Aunt, Uncle, and spoiled cousin, Dudley. The Dursleys hate him, because he is a wizard. They make him sleep in a cupboard, and never throw him birthday parties. Even at school, Dudley, and his friends pick on Harry. Harry is glad that next year, he, and Dudley are going to different schools.Then one day letters arrive at the Dursleys. When Uncle Vernon reads them, he hides them from Harry. The giant Hagrid comes to the hotel the Dursleys are staying at. Harry is surprised to find out he is a wizard. The Dursleys don't want him to go to Hogwarts, but Hagrid still buys his school supplies in a place called Diagon Alley. On the Hogwarts express he meets Ron Weasly, and his brothers, Fred, George, and Percy. Pretty soon Harry finds himself in a world full of witches, wizards, jellybeans of every flavor, and pictures that move. At the end of the year, Harry faces Lord Voldemort, again. Will he be lucky, again, or is he doomed?

It is fun, it has an upbeat style, and it gives good messages. But it is not the genre-changing novel I was expecting from the rave reviews it was getting.There are thousands of great books put out each year, many of which are fantasy, and many of which are better than this piece. Nothing touches the classics (Lewis, Tolkein, Bahm, etc.), but even some of the recent children's fantasy has more appeal to me as an adult while still remaining fun and gripping for children. In particular I'm thinking of the Redwall series of books.Anyway, I'll wrap this up before I ramble too long. It is a good book, and I commend Rowling on her obvious grasp of what people want. But it just isn't the kind of book that redefines the way I view children's fantasy. I strike a lot of it up to good timing, a lot of it to good publicity, and a lot of it to the fact that the American people just don't read anything non-mainstream.Cheers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I honestly, don't get the hubub about the series. I've seen a few of the movies and now I've read the first book and all I can see that's interesting about it is that it sparks imaginative minds with it's mythology and it's characters are well formed. Maybe I needed to be on board from the beginning so that I could get caught up in the mystery. I think that was one of the problems with reading this book now. I already knew everything that was going to happen. There was no surprise, no suspense, no mystery left.But even if I hadn't already seen the movie and known the plot, I think the mystery was a little too simple. I mean, seriously, \\"what's in the small brown package?!\\" Oh, wait, let me look on the front cover...\\"Harry Potter and the SORCERER'S STONE!\\" Mystery solved. Didn't even have to open the book.While I'm on the negative rant: is anyone else tired of young kids outsmarting adults? What kind of series of security spells are easy enough for 3 11yearolds to figure out and get through in good timing? They weren't charms or spells, they were puzzles designed to let anyone with enough brains in! It wasn't believable--it was irritatingly juvenile. But I've been told the other books are less so.The mythology behind the book can easily be enticing, but it's not very original or inventive. Even the three headed dog (Cerberus?) who is lulled to sleep with music (common myth about beasts) is a cliche. Pretty much every creature we already know, characterized by the stereotypes we already can predict is thrown together in this book. Complete with garlic to ward off vampires.Also, after seeing more than one of the movies and being told the basic plot of a few others, I feel as though the formula for the whole series is pretty bare and repeated in each book: Harry goes to school. Harry gets in trivial fight with Draco (just wait until I get to the name rant). Harry comes across a mystery that has something to do with Voldemort. Harry solves the mystery and comes face to face with Vold (almost always, if not always alone because his friends can't follow him). Harry survives the encounter. Most people are happy. Some people don't trust him. This distrust continues the conflict for the next book. The End.the Name rant: It has always driven me crazy when authors name their characters in ways that shadow their characters. It bothered me with the Decepticons in Transformers and it bothers me here. Slytherin? SLYTHERIN?! I have this overwhelming feeling that she's trying to compare these people to snakes. How subtle.I think I'm done complaining about it for now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Purchased the audio book for my husband for christmas. He listened to it around the end of Jan.(doesnt care to read the book but will listen going back and forth to work but likes the movies) and was left lacking because it contained two of disc 5 and no disc 7(the ending). I have emailed Listening Library but they have never responed to my request to get the 7th disc. I am dissapointed with their customer service."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was just watching the movie for the first book, and something just came to me. before I get to it, I just want to say that if you havent read this book and are not into fantasy etc, you should still check it out. Its a great book and series.Now to the BUTand I should say thisSPOILER FOR SERIESSPOILER FOR SERIES BELOWIn the end of the series we find out that Snape was working for Dumbledore and spying on Voldemort.However, in the first book Prof. Quirrel was trying to snatch the stone, and Prof. Snape was suspicious. Two scenes come to mind. First, when Snape corners Quirrel in the hallway, and the other at the end when Prof. Quirrel was by the mirror of Erise (spel?). The first scene Snape basically threatens Prof. Q. and questions his loyalties. In the second scene, Prof. Q. blatantly states that Snape was on to him and following him....Prof. Q. obviously could communicate with L. Voldemort, and Prof. Q. knew Snape was after him and trying to stop him....So....my point is...How was Snape able to cont. faking his allegiance to Voldemore? Did Prof. Q. not think to tell Lord V.? I mean it seems odd. Just one of those things in the book that Rowling leaves open and makes little sense. Its a great series, but there are issues like this that dont mesh well. Sure P. Snape could have fed Lord V. a bunch of BS, but Rowling never wrote about it, so it makes for a very awkward reading with sloopy loose ends.Greta series but i have to question the planning..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At 51, and in 2009, I am a very late comer to the Harry Potter series. This is the first book of the series, and one of the best. It's a great story with the appropriate amounts of humor, mysticism, and adventure to awaken the spirits of a mature man or woman and perhaps even put some wonder back into our lives. It was a great break from the overly serious stuff that I usually read. I was not too happy about making J.K. Rowling even richer when I purchased the book (used), but she did create a great series. There are plenty of used copies around these days and I am sure the book is also readily available in the library."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After reading the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I really liked it.Harry Potter has a really screwed up life, but at the time he didn't know until there was a note that came to him and his aunt and uncle took it away from him. Then they gave him a better room instead of living in a cupboard. When he got more and more letters, they moved to a light house in the middle of the ocean. Next, a giant came to where they were and gave Harry his letter and let him read it. I said that he was invited to Hogwart's school of witchcraft and wizardry. The main events were: Destoying Voldmort, getting past the dog Fluffy and getting past the course. The main characters were Hermione, Harry, Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Professor Miconagel. The setting is at Hogwarts. The theme is to destroy Voldemort. I recommend this book to anybody that likes magic or really exciting books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The setting takes place in Howarts mostly during the fall and winter. But, at the beggining Harry is living with is uncle Vernon, his aunt Petunia, and his cousin Dudley on Privet Drive. They make up the Dursleys. Harry gets accepted into Hogwarts(a school for wizards/witchs) and isn't allowed to go. But, the key keeper Hagrid comes and tells Harry he is to go to Hogwarts and that he will come with Hagrid to buy school supplies. The Dudleys were to take harry to the train where he is to be taken to Hogwarts. When Harry arrives he meets another wizard named Ron who shows him how to get to his \\"unknown\\" platform.On the train he and Ron meet a witch named Hermione. All of them get drafted into the house of Gryffindor. Later on they find out about a evil sorcerer named Voldemort and a special stone that could make people emortal. The students suspected their potions teacher Snape (who they thought tried to kill Harry in his Quittich match) to be the one who was trying to steal the stone. They began to investigate and went into a chamber where all sorts of wild things went on...Harry then found that the person who was trying to steal the stone wasn't Snape. It turned out to be one of their teachers Quirrell.........This book was excelent and i recommend it to every one. One of my favorite parts was when Quirrell let a troll into the school and harry had to face it in the bathroom."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a ten year old boy who does not know that he is a wizard. In J. K. Rowling's world, magic is the key which individuals use to unlock their true selves. So when Harry's aunt and uncle hide him away in a cupboard and refuse to let him go to wizard school, they are denying him the specific right to achieve his individual potential.With the help of a friendly giant, Harry arrives at Hogwarts school of Magic and begins his journey to self-understanding. That a ten year old boy would have this as his goal makes the character charming and a hero the reader comes to care about deeply. Unlike his rival, a boy named Draco Malfoy who seeks popularity, Harry remains humble. When he learns he has a talent for flying and becomes a star in a wizard sport, he does not become arrogant. Harry only hopes he can live up to everyone's expectations of him.But the wizarding world also has a dark side, for some use magic to further their greed and need for power over others. Harry confronts many interesting monsters and villains in the book, yet they are not too scary or graphic for young children. In fact they lend an air of importance to Harry's quest. Rowling crafts her story so well that young readers quickly understand how saving the Sorcerer's Stone at the heart of the school is linked with Harry's belief in himself.Harry has many adventures during his first year at Hogwarts. At the heart of every scene is a young boy learning more about himself and the world around him. Magic helps to unlock his perspective and abilities, but his true growth comes through his continued development of self-understanding. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone teaches us that through courage and humility we come to greater wisdom and individuality. What makes this book both wildly popular and a present day classic is the entertaining way in which the author presents the literary themes.In the end these themes are what set one book above another. A book may tell a wonderful story, but a true work of literature is held together by important and universal ideas. Courage, humility and the power of an individual to make choices are so important to us that many adults are moved by Harry's story. I recommend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to anyone who has a child, eight and up. In giving this book, you will be sharing a positive and magical introduction to the world of reading.D. S.

It's a series that has it all: mystery, humor, etc. It has great charactors that you really feel like you know, and it has a great moral too: good over evil.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book #1) is about a boy, Harry Potter, who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. One day he finds out that he is a wizard. He goes to a school of magic, Hogwarts, and learns how to cast spells and stuff like that. Then he finds out that the he is famous in the magical world! The most powerful and evil wizard, Voldemort, killed his parents and tried to kill Harry, but Harry survived. Nobody had ever survived Voldemort before. That's why Harry's famous.

When book 4 came out, I was the first in line to get one. Then when book 5 and 6 were announced to be coming out soon, I preordered mine and went into a histerical panick when the shipment of my book 6 was delayed due to hurricane Fabian (i live in Bermuda).

I watched the movie and listened to my wife tell me how great the books were. Still I put off reading it. I finally got around to reading it, and for one of the few times i can remember, the book lived up to all my expectations.For those living under a rock, or stone (pardon the pun), this book is about the story of a young wizard, Harry, who is destined for great things. After dealing with a miserable foster family his destiny catches up with him, and he goes off to wizard school. Then the adventures begin - just the way you'd imagine a year at a wizard school would be.The book is written in a very easy-to-read fashion, as it's targeted at both children and adults.

I usually hate reading, but when I stared reading I just couldn't put the book down. I wanted to know what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With the first movie having been through my player at least every other month since I bought it, I wondered how the book was, and it was an engaging read. It is an enchanting part-fantasy, part-mystery, part-adventure, with lots of light relief. The ideas J.K. Rowling came up with blew me away--Platform 9 3/4, staircases that move, Bertie Bott's Many-Flavoured Beans, where did she come up with this? There's nothing wrong with Rowling's writing at all. In fact, she's quite a magician herself in order to create the Hogwarts world. Which House does she belong to, I wonder?The story of Voldemort and wizards going to the dark side is reminiscent of the Dark Jedi in Star Wars. Unicorns and Fluffy, a variation on Cerberus, and the invisible cape are taken from fairytales and mythology. And many of the spells are Latin-derived. Rowling's use of comparatives and colours is also ingenious. Here's how Uncle Vernon reacts when he sees the first letter Harry gets from Hogwarts: \\"His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\\"There are some aspects of the real world in Hogwarts as well, such as nasty teachers and nasty students. However, things have a way of working out. For example, yes, Harry, Hermione, and Neville get detention for going on the grounds in the evening, but they get to help Hagrid for detention so that's not too bad.What also makes Harry appealing is that he's thin, bespectacled, but intelligent and gifted. Not only that but after eleven years of living miserably under his uncle's roof, he is amazed to find that everybody in the wizard world knows who he is because he is \\"the boy who lived\\" through Voldemort's reign of terror. This gives hope to many downtrodden youngsters who read the book, because Harry can be someone to relate to. If Harry were a muscular blonde-haired jock who got the pretty girls and drove the fast brooms, he wouldn't be appealing at all. Somehow I don't think the average kid could relate to someone like that.Hermione's character gives a shot in the arm to the virtues of dedicated reading and studying, something impossible in this world with all these video game systems. True, she does sit on the side of the caution and finds security in obeying the laws but when the chips are down, she's ready to stick by Harry no matter what.Draco Malfoy, who becomes Harry's main antagonist, proves that yes, there are jerks in any setting--it's how to handle them that counts. If best, don't get into fights, but sometimes, it's necessary to fight them.The kindly and reliable headmaster Dumbledore and the whale-sized gameskeeper Hagrid are two other favourable characters who look out after Harry and friends and check to see if they're doing all right. And despite being a stern disciplinarian, Professor MacGonagall is fair and can be generous.Mary Grandpre's illustrations above each chapter heading add extra spice. Check out the ones for Fluffy and Norbert. She does the cover illustration too, BTW.There's one additional comment here. This book is rightly categorized as fantasy. There's something in here besides wizards, witches, spells, magic, Quidditch, and pictures that move that make this book a fantasy. That something is people who are generous, stick with you in times of trouble, and take a stand on the side of right, sometimes when unconventionality is called for. That's something that seems to have gone on the way side in the real world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you like witches and wizards this is a book for you.

I'm no stranger to Delillo, Pynchon, Gaddis, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, etc. I enjoy good literature. And it just so happens that some of the most enjoyable books i have read in years are the Harry Potter books. So there's no stream of consciousness, deep political or social subtext, or heavy symbolism, it's still one of the best reads out there. Rowling can weave a story that is both well-constructed and entertaining without sacrificing intelligence for the reader's benefit. I read The Sorcerer's Stone to see what all the fuss was about, and I was amazed. Here I was, reading a 'children's book' but it hardly seemed like it. Trust me, this book is for anyone who likes to read, or just likes a good story.

I wanted to cover the audio versions specifically.I'm an avid reader, but my husband prefers other pursuits, so I got the audio version for a car trip when we could both experience it. It was fabulous! Jim Dale, the reader for the series, couldn't be better at giving the characters life and keeping the British flavor this book was written with. Our drive was over before the book, and that's where the trouble began. We listened to the book on our commute to work and would sit in the car at journey's end waiting for the chapter to end. We were so hooked that we brought the tapes into the house and played them each night while we sat quietly in the family room with the lights dimmed. We're both confirmed Harry Potter fans now, having run out to get the second, then the third and fourth books on tape as soon as we finished the last one.I highly recommend these audio books.

This book is probably the favorite of children of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The beginning of the most loved series in the world. J. K. Rowling is an absolute expert on creating a world of wonder and amasement for people of all ages. Harry Potter is as contagious as the common cold. J. K. Rowling has won many awards and turned quite a many heads. She is the brains behind encouraging many kids to hit the books. Though over 300 pages kids will read this book again and again. If your are an adult you may even find your self engulfed in this superior book. So give it a try. Fall in love with Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the others, while you read this suspenseful yet fun book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Never one to fall for fads, I was wary when JK Rowling's series hit the best sellers lists everywhere. I resisted reading them for a long time before I heard my brother read a chapter to his son, and then I was hooked. Now, my entire family has read the books -ages 5 to 55- and loved them. This is a classic for all ages. So, just give in: I know you'll love them too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love all the Harry books, but I adore the 1st book. The reason being is that everything is new, fresh and exciting. It's the first time the reader learns about Hogwarts, Every flavour beans, wizards, and one of my favourite things...wizard chess. Awesome book. The reader is with Harry for the first time. Read the others...you won't want to stop."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit, before I read this (first of the Harry Potter books I ever read) I used to hate reading books. But when my mom forced me to read this (THANK YOU MOM) I LOVE READING NOW THANKS TO HARRY POTTER!!!This book is so well done. Were should I start? Well first of all the characters are LOVEABLE. They ALWAYS stick to their personalities, and are good or evil characters in the right way. Some people gave this a lower rating because they hated the Dursleys. Well, YOU\`RE SUPPOSED TO HATE THE DURSLEYS, THAT\`S WHAT MAKES THE CHARACTERS SO REAL AND LOVEABLE.The plot is VERY well developed and has great followthrough. I can\`t think of any moment in the book where I felt like putting the book down. The mysteries (I won\`t reveal them) are revealed at the very end and are so well hidden, the reader is only given very small hints and the surprises are very rewarding. The style is excellent, dialogue great, this book is very original, I could go on forever about how revolutionary this book is and how this book and the rest of the books in the series will influence fantasy writers for centuries to come.....GO BUY THIS AND THE WHOLE HARRY POTTER SERIES NOW!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ive read the book two times and have enjoyed reading every minute of it.I have read the other harry potter books and have found that the sorcerers stone was the second best."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was very good.

I have now read every book in the series. This book is well worth the acclaim it has received. I know that many Christians have heard terrible things about this book, but they are untrue. I found this book to he a touching story about a little boy to whom I greatly relate. I understand that there is magic and wizardry in the book, but I personally found it no more objectionable than what I found in Tolkein or C.S. Lewis. Although the book does not have the Christian symbolism of &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; or &quot;Chronicles of Narnia,&quot; it still is a great story of a boy who is shunned for being different and overcomes adversity. A good lesson for anyone. If you are a Christian parent, read this book and judge for yourself after having read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have had this book on the shelf to read for a while and finally picked it up and read it.

I think you'll love Harry Potter if your into witchcraft and mysteries. Harry is a wizard just like his parents. When Harry was one year old his dad and mom got killed by the darkest wizard, He-who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. Eleven years later Harry found out he was a wizard, and that there was a school for witches and wizards. That's were he met Ron and Hermione, at Hogwarts. If you love challenging words you'll also love Harry Potter. I recomend this to anyone who will let their imagination flow."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We think that Harry Potter was a very interesting book.The words in the book may sound like they are weird but they are actually words that made the book a top hit. In the book we liked the parts about the conflict between Harry and the Dursleys. One example that we thought, that the book was good is the way that she used action to tell the story. We also liked when Hagrid broke into the houseboat and made Dudley have a tail, and when Hagrid told Harry his past.When Harry went into the &quot;keep out&quot; room it really touched my heart,seeing them keep a three-headed dog keep up by itself guarding a hidden trap door.Another example we thought as we read the book was, she did a good job putting all those words together to make a really good story. The End of the story gives a good beginning in the next book when Harry defeats the Two-Faced Voldamont (You-Know-Who) disappeared when Harry and Hermione defeated him. We liked it when Harry was playing chess with a life size chess pawns that talked to him in the hidden room in Hogwarts. We also liked it when Malfoy got jealous when Harry got the Nimbiss 2000 Broomstick."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was recently recommnded by my friends to read this book so i did.

If you want to read a book that is the best for anyone, you should get Harry Potter and The Sorcers Stone or any of the other Harry Potter books in the store. This is truely the best book ever"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All the rage in the US and in the UK, Ms. Rowling has managed upon a theme, a protagonist, and a good old fashioned story to produce the Harry Potter books. After reading this I now see why these books have spread around the country like a wild fire - prompting families to turn off their tvs and read together. Harry Potter, our young (11) hero has the classic fairy tale existence: the magnificent and loving (and now horribly deceased) parents, the evil step- or &quot;non&quot; parents, the odd-ball collection of somewhat magical friends, a world that exists as sort of a parallel universe, and in general, a life that while unbelievably magical still contains the usual collection of miserable pre-teen events (from being picked on at school, to the auguish involved in being chosen for a sports team or being accepted by a teacher or older classmate). In this particular book (episode? And I openly admit I feel the urge to purchase or somehow otherwise get ahold of the next one, yes, I'm dying to see what happens to Harry next!) Harry discovers he is, in fact, the child of a witch and a warlock ( very GOOD ones, of course) and is, himself magic. His life changes dramatically (an understatement) when he finds he is enrolled in the Hogwarts School where first year students are NOT permitted to bring their broomsticks. An excellently written book, Ms. Rowling is a very talented writer - the ability to amuse, entertain, and teach children and adults alike is found so rarely (Roahl Dahl comes to mind) that is must be cherished. And Harry is already becoming a part of the culture."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"From my son, Alex (six years old): &quot;When I first saw the cover of Harry Potter, I didn't think I would like it; but when I started reading it, I thought it was great because Harry Potter kept getting into great adventures.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have always loved the Harry Potter series.

Rowling, Harry Potter feels like there is no hope for him while he is living with his unbelievably cruel and unfair aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. Oh! How could I forget about his selfish, ignorant, stubborn, crybaby of a cousin, Dudley. You can't help to feel sorry for Harry...until a surprising arrival of a letter is addressed to \\"Mr. H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs\\" (Rowling 34). Uncle Vernon refused to let Harry open his letter. Thousands of thousands of letters quickly arrive at the Dursley household for Harry. Moving away to avoid the continuous letters Harry gets a visitor, Rubeus Hagrid. Harry is told he is a wizard which surprises his \\"family\\" more than anyone. Harry is sent to a school for wizards where he learns all different types of wizardry such as flying a broomstick, different spells, and potions.J.K. Rowling does a fantastic job of foreshadowing what is going to happen. Harry is basically bowed down to as a great wizard without even knowing anything about the wizard world and the fact that there is an antagonist named vol- or I mean he who remains unnamed, a great wizard at a point who went rogue, you can tell that at some point the two will meet. J.K. Rowling also uses theme to show how a young boy overcomes adversity.This novel is fit for everyone it has the cool, majestic ideals of a young child and is written well enough to keep an adult's attention throughout the book. Grab your brooms and join Harry on his adventures through Hogwarts, his new school."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's a very good read more for the younger to late teen....but if u like mystery and excitement through out you will enjoy this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book and was so intrigued that I picked up the book the next day.

Ok,ok,ok, I admit I have done that a lot. Trust me this book will grab you just like(i hope)this review title grabbed you. Don't worry,unlike some of my fellow reviewers, I will NOT tell you everything that happened in the book. I HATE that. Anyways, this book is a very wonderful start to the series. My gosh people, I was 9 when I read this, and I thought I was going to hate it. I'm so not into things the main populous love( ok, so i was a LITTLE mature for my age. So what if i read Pride and Prejudice in 2nd Grade?)I had to read it for this College for kids thing, which I can go to since I'm supposed to be a gifted child, capable of a high IQ. So like I was saying, I thought I was going to hate it. Man, was I wrong. This book could be read by people of all ages. I'm not saying a person without an imagination could love it. Yep, they'd say it stunk up the Book Industry. Well to them I say don't waste your money. But for those of you kids, read this book and get swept up in a world where magic lives, and anything is possible. And as for you adults, you really have to read this.Inside J.K.

I look forward to seeing what Harry Potter and his friends do in the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, I certainly enjoy listening to my daughter (13) go on and on about these books! And when i bought them, i was afriad she wouldn't read them! But every night i would find her in her room reading them. And she wouldn't look up! I find myself reading them these days. I'm on the beginning of the third book and i cant WAIT to see what happens to Harry next! Believe me, these are a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really think that writing a book takes imagination and talent,and J.K. rowling showed all of that and more in &quot;the sorcerers stone&quot;, a book about the courage +determination of 11 year old Harry Potter and his friends who attend Hogwarts, a school of magic.When evil wizards decide to steal the sorcerers stone ,its up to Harry Potter to get it back!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Had just finished Atlantis Found and RipTide and was looking for something else to read. My sister loaned me all Harry Potter books.At first, I was a bit skeptical considering that they were suppose to be for kids (I'm 37). Finally I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and I was hooked after the first chapter.Just finished reading The Prisoner of Azkaban the other night and now can't wait for the next Harry Potter book.These books are really fun. The characters and story line keep you turning the pages until the end. When you reach the end, you automatically want to reach for the next book so you can continue the story.J. K. Rowling did a fantastic job with the characters and story. Hogwarts is such a wonderful place and I can see why Harry loves going back so much.These books may be for kids but also great for adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book has captured my heart and imagination. I began to read this book to my 7 year old son, but soon, my 17 yr old daughter was also listening, hooked. The character, Harry Potter, is a hero that our kids can look up to. Harry is kind, considerate to others, humble, and genuinely cares for the underdog (he knows how it feels), and never tries to save his own skin by turning his back on a friend. My kids begged &quot;just one more chapter&quot; till the book was over. Finally, my 17 yr old was too anxious to wait for me to read, so read the next two books in the series in 3 days! This book is a non-stop page turner for kids and adults alike. Our Family LOVES Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My name is Laura Ahearn and I'm in the 8th grade. I think The Sorcerers Stone was a wonderful book. The author of the first Harry Potter book is J.K. Rowling. This fictional story is about a boy named Harry who realizes he is a wizard. He has many adventures, like when Harry and his new friends Hermonie and Ron meet up with a three-headed dog. (This is also my favorite part in the book.) I would recommend this book because it is a funny tale that everyone can relate to, with trouble, mystery, and magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first i heard all about these books everywere but i thought they wwouldnt be that good. when i checked one out of the libary at my school and read the first few chapters i then noticed why it was so good.

The best was the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, who could argue with the 2000 reviews before me. However, when one reads this they will know exactly how perfect this story is. Harry Potter and his unknown past abot his parents and his &quot;evil&quot; aunt and uncle who raise him. Well told in an easy format for anyone to enjoy, kids and adults alike. Potter being the most likeable character to come around in some time. From start to finish, this book is one to be treasured for quite some time. Reccommended for Everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 25 year old engineer.

You should definatly read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am really impressed with this series. Usually i read \\"Grown up\\" fantasy books like Jordan, goodkind and GRR Martin - but Harry Potter has certainly been an appriciated diversion. Its been so long sine i was a child and believed in magic but J.K. Rowlings brings me back to that more innocent time. I am not going to review the plot - there are over 3000 reviews for that - I just wanted to Thank Mrs. Rowlings for doing something that should have been done a long time ago. It may sound kind of strange - but i almost feel like i have attended hogwarts. As i read these books i was in a new city away from my friends and going to law school. I know its not quite the same... but anyone who has ever studued law knows that there is a lot of strange words [usually latin]and scary proffesors galore. I swear my administrative law professor is the spitting image of professor umbridge, and my contracts prof is Snape re-incarnated... Maybe its just hopw great of storytelelr Rowlings is that makes me believe...Thankfully, soon i will be done law school, but sadly, someday, this series will come to an end.I highly suggest reading it - the first book is almost a chilrens book, but they grow darker as time goes on. [not unlike real life]Anyone who reads fantasy and does not read these books is a disgrace to the genre. I place this series with Tolkien, Dragonlance, and the Song of Ice and Fire.Thanks Mrs. Rowlings! And Thanks Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the first in a series of seven books. It's a great start and a wonderful way to introduce the characters, the setting, and the conflict. The next books in the series are better in that they start to more fully develop the characters, intensify the danger, and darken the conflict. I have read this book many, many times, including reading it in other languages, and I am well into my 30's. It's a nice way to lose yourself for a few hours into a fantasy world that you can just almost believe is real."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Here I am, one of the last of the people to jump on the Harry Potter \\"train.\\" I'm also one of the many who thought the whole idea was ridicolous (even though I love any and everything fantasy), and would never give the book a try. I was eventually coaxed by some co-workers that I should open myself to the Potter world, and I finally gave them and Potter a chance. I can say I'm not at all dissapointed. I was instantly thrown into the world, and glad to say I enjoyed it.The biggest thing that enthralled me was all of the history, research, ideas, and characters (with which you fall in love with or begin to hate) that Rowling introduced in such a short book. A lot is established within such a short space that it makes me completely curious as to how much more Rowling introduces in further books. And now on to see about it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've read this book at least three time since I bought it when it first came out, before Harry Potter was a big thing. I loved it then, and I love it now.J.K. Rowling introduces readers to the fascinating world of Harry Potter, which is charming and intriguing without being too cute or unbelievable. I was hooked from the moment I read the first lines about the Dursleys and number four Privet Drive. What makes Harry Potter great is not only the world Rowling has created, but also her use of language, which sets just the right tone in the Potter books.Book one introduces us to Harry Potter, who finds out that he is a wizard, and a rather famous one at that, for surviving an attack by a dark wizard when he was a baby. Harry lives with his comically nasty relatives the Dursleys until he goes off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There, he meets friends Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger. The rest of the book chronicles Harry's first year at Hogwarts and the group's adventures.For me, the reason the HP books are so appealing is that unlike most fantasy, they offer bits of humor and lightheartedness here and there, and yet they aren't at all childish books.J.K. Rowling is a wonderful author, and reading this first book, it is easy to see why the series has had such fantastic success."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In this book this kid named harry potter survived a very evil spell that killed both his parents. harry is still a little baby and a wizard put him on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle. when he turned 13 letters from a wizard school showed up for harry his uncle tried to keep the letters from harry so he wouldn't find out he was a wizard. the letters come in the thousands until finally his uncle takes them to live on a island in the sea. because harry hasn't seen these letters one night this giant knocks down the door and takes harry to buy books at a place througha brick wall. finally its time to board the train to the wizard school hogwarts. when he gets there there are 6 different dorms or houses of students he was picked to be in griffindor. he meets two ron and herminy and theybecome great friends. they heardabout the sorcerers stone. they thought one of the teacher wrer tring to still it . one night they went looking for it. on there trip to find it ron got hurt and hermione stayed with ron.harry went on to find the sorcerers stone but when he got there the evil wizard that tried to kill him was there.somehow the stone appeared in his pocket .the evil wizard tried to get the stone from harry but when he touched harry he turned into ashes. harry woke up in the nurses wing with the head master.i would recommend this book to any one who likes to read science fiction."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I borrowed \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" on audiobook to play for my kids on a long car trip, and after hearing it I proceeded to buy each subsequent audiobook in the series (I'm now up to \\"Order of the Phoenix\\"). Jim Dale is the best audiobook reader I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, and I've listened to countless audiobooks. We often go on rather lengthy car trips as a family, and these tapes have made the hours fly by for all of us.It's amazing how Jim Dale is able to give a distinctive voice to all of the many characters in each book. As soon as each character begins speaking, it's immediately obvious who it is even without context. My kids are younger, and I'm waiting until I feel they're ready to hear books 3 and up, but nevertheless I've listened to all of the books on my own--I couldn't wait that long! I told my husband I bought them to save for the kids, but really it was just an excuse.It's difficult enough to wait for the next installment of the series in book form, but waiting for the next Jim Dale rendition of the new book makes it that much harder!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My kids like adventure and liked this book. In fact my 8 year old told me that he only has two favorite books. This is one of them.

I recommend both these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Short and sweet - the book is very interesting, the CD is fantastic.When I found myself facing a formidable road trip (18 hours each way) I wondered how to pass the time and decided to find out what this Harry Potter phenomenon was all about. So I picked up the first 3 HP books and took Jim Dale along for the ride. The voices, the intonations, the emotions, the tones - the best I've ever heard. I was so enthralled listening how he made the story come to life that I almost ran out of gas. A tour de force. I almost want to make the trip again so I can buy the next 2 volumes!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Is it possible to lace books with addictive substances? Because I am now thoroughly addicted to the Harry Potter Universe. My best friend calls is \\"brain candy\\" and that's just what it is! If \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" is a fine dining experience at a super fine restaurant, rich, dense and satisfying, then Harry Potter is the Raspberry Meringue dessert that follows (the *real*, English, raspberry meringue, not this hard, tooth-breaking imitation) - it is fluffy, light, happy, sweet, and all with a tinge of a hint of darkness to come (*whispers* Voldemort!!)I believe that you do NOT have to like one or the other, Lord of the Rings vs Harry Potter. They're completely different things. You cannot compare Filet Mignon to Creme Brulee (forgive the food comparisons, but it works). The two are *equally good*, but are completely different!I am in the camp that believes you can love and appreciate BOTH.And I do. I'm a die hard \\"Ringer\\" (nasty, vile expression, IMNSHO) and have been for years, nay, a decade. And I was reluctant to pick up Harry Potter, as a defence against a roommate I abhorred, who loved it. I was persuaded, 3 years later, to read the first, and I LOVED it!It is fun, has a great plot, has wonderful characters, and we rejoice that poor Harry finally gets friends! It has a great plot, too, I'm happy to say, and I love how things end up not quite how Harry thought they were! And, this book is soooo... English! and I love that. And I am buying the proper books, from Amazon.co.uk, with the pre-Scholastic changes. I want to read it the way it was meant to be read - as \\"Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER'S stone\\" (as everyone who is in love with fantastical things will tell you, Alchemist used the philosopher's stone to change lead to gold. no such thing as a sorcerer's stone. tsk tsk, Scholastic!), with all appropriate British slang and all. =)I commend JK Rowling for her fabulous, first, fantastic book, and love her \\"success overnight\\" story.And now am eagerly beginning book 2!!Yay!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is the cutest little boy I have ever met in a book.

Now that I have fineshed the book, I can't wait to buy the next book in the series. When I first started reading, I thought the book was going to be predictable. But it wasn't at all.

Harry and his friends were out doing daring things. I like how my heart starts to bounding hard because of the different adventures. The main characters are Harry,Ron,Hermonie and their enemy Malfoy. I likedthem because Harry,Ron,Hermonie were always up to something. Malfoy is a main charater to me because he is always trying to get Harry and his friends in trouble. The best part of the book is when Malfoy was trying to get Harry in trouble by flying on a broomstick and Malfoy was trying to get Harry to go up there with him when they where not to be on the broomsticks. Harry did not get in trouble for flying on a broomstick but got rewarded. I liked the end of the book because it was different then I thought. I thought the ending of the book was great.

Of course, author J.K. Rowling is great at creating unforgettable characters and writing wonderful dialogue. Where she really excels, however, is in shaping the book's plot. The book is a real page-turner. Everyone I know who has read the book, be they child or adult, has been unable to put it down. While there are some other decent authors of children's fantasy, none of them have ever been as skillful at creating suspense as Rowling is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the book that started it all, the Harry Potter-mania. In this first novel of the epic series of seven, J.K. Rowling introduces us to the world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts.Basically summed up, this is the story of Harry Potter, a young boy who grew up in an abusive home with his aunt and uncle, not thinking there was anything special about himself but in fact discovers that he is perhaps (to his utter surprise) the most famous wizard of modern times, bound by destiny to the most powerful and evil wizard of all time.The book (and in the fact the rest of the series) follows Harry's adventures with his friends Ron and Hermione and fellow classmates as they make there way through 7 years of wizards school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, surviving treacherous schoolyard bullies and rivals, an interesting assortment of teachers and classmates and just the pure subtleties of adolescence - all the while battling the forces of evil. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces the story and follows his adventures in his first year of school.Enthralling and funny and very much captivating, Rowling's writing style is refreshing. Like a good mystery and a thriller, Rowling leaves on the edge of your seat as you, along with Harry and his friends, attempt to discover \\"who-done-it.\\" In this case, Harry and friends uncover a plot by an evil wizard trying to attempt to steal a powerful stone that may very well bring back to power the most evil wizard known to man.As is the case in all of Rowling's books, all is not as it seems. The Harry Potter books have truly achieved a pop culture icon status over the last few years and reading through the books it is easy to see why. They are simply that good. Whether you are a child or an adult, you'll love Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as all the other books in the series.My total read time: 9 hours, 1 night.Total pages: 308.Highest Recommendation"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got the first Harry Potter book for Christmas this year, and read it all in a day. I was skeptical of the books before, because they didn't look to interesting, but after reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I regret the fact that I didn't get into the books earlier. J.K. Rowling does a fantastic job providing strong imagery trhough her choice of words, and this gives the reader no choice but to keep turning the pages. The imagination that Rowling used to create the ideas in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone are awesome!! Every one should pick up a Harry Potter book as soon as possible, no matter how old you are, or what religion you may be! I am a Christian and I found many Christian principles displayed in the novel. Look beyond the magic and see Harry as a self-sacrificing individual with outstanding courage to fight evil."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't believe this!! I'm 21 years old and an avid reader of all sorts of books. But I'd say this book got me hooked right from the first page and I loved it more than any book I've read in the past ten years!Its just Awesome! And, I've finished the other three books too. A MUST READ. Bravo!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"From the moment I began reading this book, I could barely put it down. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. It's been a long time since I've read a children's book, but as I read this, all the fond memories of my favorite childhood books came flooding back, making me quite giddy.Harry is an outcast in his own family - he lives with his unloving aunt and uncle and a repulsive cousin, his needs barely taken care of. He doesn't come across as bitter, though. He's accepted his fate. But, on his 11th birthday, things change. He's been accepted at Hogwarts, a school for witches and warlocks and from then on, Harry's life becomes a magical adventure.This book has everything that attracts many young readers - a hero who overcomes being an outcast; a cast of quirky, loyal friends; some school bullies; a mean teacher; caring, firm adults and of course, an evil villian. Not to mention all the magic and whimsical creatures - unruly ghosts and poltergeists, centaurs, owls, etc.This story reminds me of several stories from my childhood: Alice in Wonderland, The Magic Talisman, A Wrinkle in Time, and even Star Wars, the movie. Harry struck me as a kind of Luke Skywalker, while his friends Ron and Hermione, were much like Han Solo and Princess Leia. Younger of course.In my opinion, this deserves no less than 5 stars and I'm keeping my books for my daughter to read when she's older."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a fantastic book. Full of story, imagination and it keeps you turning the page. I was hooked within the first chapter. The book brought me back to being a child...with an open mind and saying out loud 'wow' simply by getting lost in the Hogwarts and magic, wizardry world. When one grows up, I think one losses the simpleness of imagination and where it can take us.This is a book for children AND adults and I recommend the book for all. J.K. Rowling did wonderful job with well written books. And these books will be made for history for generations to come...I cannot wait until I get into book #2, 3 &amp;4 and then when books #5, 6, &amp; 7 comes out. I look forward to other books from Rowling as well..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'll be 50 in 2002, and I loved &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; It's full of imagination, excitement, fun and suspense -- I couldn't put it down. That's high praise for a book written for children coming from an adult. But the best children's books are good enough for adults, I've found. This one certainly is and I can't wait to read the next three that are out there.What I read is apparently the American version of Scottish author J.K. Rowling's first novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone.&quot; The title isn't the only thing they changed for the U.S. market, I think. (They did this title-switching thing many times to Agatha Christie -- just why, I don't know and I don't know why they changed Harry Potter either.) The Philosopher's Stone as a concept has been around for hundreds of years at a minimum -- medieval alchemists sought it -- and I think this would have been a good way to introduce children to an historically mythological icon. Go figure. Perhaps they thought American parents might not be up to answering the question &quot;Mommy,what's a philosopher?&quot;And in that same vein, I noticed a good many Americanisms that I think editors put in, figuring U.S. children wouldn't understand the Briticisms they replaced. I've never heard a Brit use the term &quot;parking lot&quot; -- they typically say &quot;car park&quot; on that side of the pond -- but you'll find &quot;parking lot&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot; (not &quot;Mum&quot;) and children being asked to form a &quot;line&quot; (rather than a &quot;queue&quot;), among other terms I don't think Ms. Rowling wrote. Perhaps the editors were right in doing that for kids here in the states, but I'm not entirely sure. (When the British movie &quot;The Madness of King George III&quot; was shown in the U.S., they changed the title to &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; because they thought Americans would think it was a sequel to &quot;The Madness of King George I&quot; and also &quot;The Madness of King George II.&quot;Since I'm not a kid and I'm bothered that I'm reading something other than what the author wrote, I'm going to order a set of the Harry Potter books from amazon.co.uk so I can read the originals.But don't let that stop you -- or your kids -- from reading &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; It is for our time what &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was in the latter 19th century. I think the children of today will pass on the Harry Potter novels to their own children one day, and even their grandchildren."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was a kid (okay, so I'm still only 17 now, but shhhh, you'll spoil the mood), my favorite books were always those by one Roald Dahl. Now, years later, I've finally found a wonderfully mature work that gives me the delicious pleasure of being a kid again without treating me like one. For all the younger fans that worship young Mr Potter, the series itself is surprisingly mature and will undoubtably appeal to all ages. Myself, who escaped the Pokemon tidal wave, was instantly suckered in by this wonderful, vivid world (and I usually only read Robert Jordan, Stephen King and the like!) and I don't regret it. Although there are quite a few people in my age bracket who will badmouth these books, most of them are people who haven't even read them theirselves. I suppose they feel it would be babyish to become involved in a series that's read by so many younger children. I, however, have become too deeply immersed in this fascinating series to care. The characters are as real as your next door neighbour or the kids you babysit, and such detail is described and given that you could almost will yourself to believe that in some distant land Hogwarts DOES nestle against a snowy mountain. And once you're done reading one, close it and find yourself back in the dreary land of the mundane, you realize just how much it had a hold of you. These make wonderful books to read to your child or to yourself for that matter. There's nothing wrong with rekindling the beauty of imagination that so many of us seem to have lost in today's world. Miss Rowling is a powerful and strong writer, and if she keeps on the way she has, as I know she will, years from now the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione will have reached the same elite status as the Hobbit. Now, if you'll excuse me, I myself have read my copies to tatters, and I'm afraid I must go about purchasing some more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Things that hit with a bang generally tend to have a wide base of appeal--say, scooters and Pok&eacute;mon, for example (of course, I'm kidding). When it comes to these things, the people not marketed to can either be cynical, or they can adopt a passive, albeit respectful stance to view things from--given, of course, that the item in question isn't a two-wheeled death machine that entrances everyone ranging from age one to sixty-seven.But Harry Potter is different, in the sense that it's not a product that's targeted to only a certain demographic; it's proof of the powerful allure of innocence, and is so whimsical and harmless at its core that it's difficult to imagine a world where such a product could not be so delectable to both children and adults. The reasons for the attachment to Rowling's series are entirely different for each age group, though: adults are charmed by the cute, satiric little details, whereas children are more provoked by the adventurous, mischievous flame that sparks in the three protagonists. Make no mistake, though--every detail of this novel is going to find a way to burrow deep into your inner child, and though two or three particulars may cling more strongly to you than the others, there's hardly anything here that will entice you to shut the covers for any activity save sleeping (unless you have no obligations and can afford to sleep two hours a day--in which case, I envy you).The icing on the top: though this is a children's book, Rowling plays around with enough elevated vernacular to not make anyone over the age of twelve ashamed to be reading this book. The spoiled berry: anyone over the age of twelve who has adopted a contemptuous attitude on life, and therefore lost their imagination, will have a hard time coming to grips with Rowling's evasive tactics for describing her settings. Sure, I love to see &quot;he said crossly,&quot; but when you see things such as &quot;large oak doors&quot; and &quot;the room had four large tables&quot; used to describe key scenes, it's a little disappointing to see so little care given to one of the more important elements of the story. But I guess that since this is a children's book, and therefore commands use of one's imagination, I really can't be too harsh on this particular aspect (word of advice, however: don't read this after finishing a Nabokov novel).One way or the other, the characterization is spot-on, the basic story a step up from the drab, meandering tripe that is most school-life literature, and the promise for future success is big, big, big. The only salient problem with &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is that the rest of the series just keeps getting better and better; in retrospect, the first chapter of Harry's adventures just doesn't begin to compare."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There are many great fantasy books on shelves today. They are written by authors such as Orson Card, Philip Pullman, Madeleine L'Engle, and J.R.R. Tolkien. Now, add to this list of authors J.K. Rowling. Rowling's contribution? Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It is an excellent book.For one thing the book is quite humorous. Descriptions of Harry's cousin are hilarious. He supposedly looks and acts like a pig. The groundskeeper, Hagrid, is also amusing. He insists on doing strange things, most notably attempting to raise a baby fire breathing dragon, and refuses to see that there is anything wrong with his odd habits.The best part of the book is the plot. It is entertaining and doesn't get boring in the middle like many books. Instead, the bizare story keeps the pages turning. It was really difficult to put the book down... even after it was over. I just kept wishing there was more. In fact I don't see how it would be possible to read through Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone without feeling inclined to go buy the second one.To conclude, the first book in the Harry Potter series was excellent. It was funny and next to imposible to put down. Goofy characters and an odd story kept the pages flipping at tremendous speed. Go buy it!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the most unbelievable and phenomenal book I have ever read.

Harry is so lifelike. I could always feel how the charactors felt and know how they were going to feel before it was even written down. I admit I'm a fast reader, but that book only took me about four hours in all to finish! But thats only because it was so exciting. Usally it takes me at least a day to finish a 200 page book. Harry is also very smart and athletic I thought he would be smart and horribly at sports, but I was wrong again. As you see this book has lots of surprises. In conclusion READ THIS BOOK IT'S GREAT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Jim Dale does a fun and incredible job as narrator of the Harry Potter books. After listening to Sorcerer's Stone I immediately picked up the rest of the series. I admire how he comes up with different accents for the many characters. I even ordered the UK version from ..., and nice as those are, I think Jim Dale's version takes the cake - or pumpkin pasties!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being an adult, constantly reading about Harry Potter in the newspaper, seeing Harry Potter on the television, in the bookstores, the video store, etc. etc...I just had to see what all the hype was about! The series came HIGHLY RECOMMENDED from a dear friend (as well as from myself, after reading the books!) and was definitely due the praise. The adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were spectacular. I had such trouble putting the book down, for I wanted to read more and more and see what adventure was up next!I love Rowling's writing style and I thought her characters had just the right amount of \\"depth\\" (the other adult reviewers have beaten the lack-of-depth concept (as well as the witchcraft concept, evil ways concept, etc. etc.) to a pulp!). Rowling's descriptions of the hallways, classrooms, dining halls, etc. at Hogwarts, the \\"special\\" platform at the train station, Quidditch (!), the treacherous Dursley's home, Hagrid's humble home, etc. etc. led my imagination to heights it hasn't seen in quite a while!I felt like a kid again when I read this book, so I recommend you pick it up and share the adventures with Harry, Ron and Hermione! Remember: we do not stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I won't lie and say that I never liked reading and this book made me want to read. Although I did change me, and I'm sure it has many others, to make them read and helping them write, it wasn't that exact way for me.When I was little, I used to love reading. I still do, but that's not my point. On day at the Library when I was seven, I was browsing the shelves when my mom called me to go. Before I went to check out my other books, I saw one sitting in the magazine rack that sat at the end of the rows. It was a thick book, but I like thing that challenged me. Needless to say, I got the book.A few days later, when the books were due, I can remember telling my mom: \\"But mo-ommmmm, I'm reading this really great book! It's about this kid named Harry, who's a wizard. And mom! He acts like a normal kid! And all the great things are happening...\\" The funny thing is, I cannot remember any of the other books I got from the Library. There was something about Harry that seemed uniquely normal compared to the other fantasy books I've read. In fact, all of Rowling's books feel natural and completly logical despite their flair for magical beings and secret castles.It makes you feel that if something like this could ever happen, that's how it would happen. The words fit perfectly and flawlessly into the book, creating a vivid movie in your mind and leaving you hopelessly grasping for words to describe it to those who haven't read yet, as if you're trying to explain colors to a blind man. And even if we caught those words and could lay them out for everyone to see, for book burners and angry preachers and for children and adults who had trouble reading or couldn't, I can tell you right now it would be more than a \\"maximum of 1,000 words\\". In fact, the explination would be long enough to be a book of it's own.So go on, read the book, read the series. You know you want to. And for those muggles who turn this book down: You don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I turned eleven the month that Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone came out in the US. Harry Potter was not yet famous here...nobody had ever heard of Harry, nobody knew what Quidditch was, and not a single person had any idea how to pronounce \\"Hermione.\\" I bought the book at a book fair because I thought the cover looked very nice. I read it about six times before I found out that there was more to come...in the version of six more books. Every day of my eleventh year, I hoped and prayed for a parchment envelope with my name on it in green ink, beckoning me to a school of witchcraft and wizardry. But the letter never came. I turned twelve, and Hogwarts was forever closed to me. But the story was not, and it continued. Each year Harry turned a year older, so did I. Harry has always been my age, every time a new book comes out, I just have time to catch up with him. When he finishes his story in the seventh book, it will be hard to pass him by, knowing that I will be leaving him behind, that he will never catch up. But the magic won't leave the books, they will always be waiting. And the first one, the one that began it all, the tale that brought 11-year-old Harry to Hogwarts and started his long adventure, will still be lying on the shelf, holding within its covers a story that has created magic where once none lay. It is the book that created Harry, that brought the fantasy of a secret world to life, and it is why now 'Harry Potter' seems more like an expression that means delightful thrills than a name. So what more could a reader wish for, than to see the delightful collector's addition waiting for them under a Christmas tree or in a colorfully wrapped package? Its whole exterior vibrates of Hogwarts and wizarding, from the emerald leather to the golden gilding and the glittering lightning bolt spelling out Harry's name. The interior...well, what more needs to be said? Harry Potter is a magical being who exists only on paper, some say. But all who have avidly followed his every move for the past four years know better...Harry may not be seen by others, but we know that he is there, whether in the kindly librarian who points out his shelf or the small child that weeps when Harry vainly tries to contact his lost parents in the Mirror of Erised...or in the man walking down the street, who barely comes up to your waist and has on a tall top-hat, complaining loudly about the comotion made by Muggles. The book needs only opening, and it will do the rest on its own. The Magic Awaits."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"From the moment I began to read I was transported to a magical world that you really can believe.

While never wavering from her entirely readable prose, the author flawlessly interweaves endless references, allusions, and myriad other techniques and devices which move her work from the merely grand books for the \`tweenage to something considerably more literate and \\"critically sound,\\" in its most erudite and arrogant connotation. Plot. Character. Incredible settings. It's all there, but thankfully, blessedly, there's so much more. Authors like Rowling and the wickedly wondrous Lemony Snicket are raising the standard for quality children's literature to where it should always have been, identical to that of any great writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My 8 year old nephew and I started a 'book club' together - our first book was HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE.

Poor Harry is forced to live with people who really don't want him and a cousin Dudley who is very mean and cruel. After many years of this abuse - Harry finds out that he has magical powers and is being sent to wizard's school.

In all seriousness though, I was hesitant to begin reading this series when it first came out, as I enjoy carrying my books in my purse and the Harry Potter books were too cumbersome to do as such. However, my recent purchase of a Kindle and the availability of the series in e-reader format gave the perfect opportunity. After finishing book one in less than two days, I can see that I will be continuing and finishing the entire series in no time. More than anything, I am excited to watch each film after finishing the book to compare and find similarities.

I have always enjoyed fantasies and magical things, that I can read about. Every now and then people need to break away from the norm and let themselves relax and dive into another world, sort of like a miny vacation. When the brain is forced to eat health food all day, it can't help but crave some sweets at the end. This is exactly how I define Harry Potter books. They are candy for the brain. It's an easy read that allows you to have fun with your imagination. J.K. Rowling did a wonderful job of developing her characters and keeping the reader involved in the story. She obviously put alot of meticulous work into this book, it definately showed through her research on all of the mythical creatures.

The book is a classic good versus evil book, and from the very beginning Harry is our hero. Beginning the book, I was first introduced to Harry and his past in the first few chapters. Following that, we are taken to Harry's first year at a new wizarding school and are easily swept up in his life there. As the plot unraveled, we were introduced to a past evil (Voldemort) and a new present evil. The book gains momentum and suspense until the end, where a satisfying climax awaits the reader. The main characters are not perfect, but flawed, making them more real to the reader. Even Dumbledore, the wise headmaster at Hogwarts, has a sense of humor. The Harry Potter books have been written for young kids, and therefore, easy for anyone to read. Once alerted of a mystery at Hogwarts, I was easily caught up in the story. The book is such a fast read. Coming home from school, I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in just one day.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor,including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. His parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is a famous survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence. Soon enough,however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure humorous, haunting, and that's when the suspense begins. This book came of interest to me because of it's mithical illusions and twists. I become attatched to books with extreme amounts of visuals and wild, creative adventures. I recommend this book to anyone interested in impulsive adventures."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was about ten years old, I picked up a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone reluctantly: everyone had told me to read it. I hated reading. Never could stand it. No matter what anyone said there was no such thing as a good book. It was always going to be that way too. I opened up the book and read the first page with very little motivation. In order to keep myself reading, I forced myself to read it aloud. As little as I wished to keep reading it, I couldn't put it down, and by the last line of the first paragraph, I needed to continue. The first paragraph itself was so amazing that I reread it two, three, four times. I flipped the page, finally onto the next chapter, and got more and more drawn in. Before long, I was on a magic journey, I was at a London zoo where a boaconstrictor had gotten free from its aquarium, I was purchasing books like Beginner's Transfiguration and One Thousand and One Magical Herbs and Fungi at Flourish and Blotts, I was soaring after the Golden Snitch on a Cleansweep 4, I was staring into the Mirror of Erised, and I was sneaking past a gigantic three headed dog named Fluffy to get through a trap door beneath its feet. Less than a year had gone by and before I knew it, I had read this book 40 times. For my eleventh birthday, I was given the second book and became even more obssessed. My friends began to call me Harriet Potter, and I had been given awards for being able to recite the first 200 pages of the first book (I was able to recite the entire book, but I tripped up on a sentence on page 203 and lost the ability to continue).While not all of you might be as obsessively enthusiastic about this book as I have been, I guarentee that each and every one of you would adore it and all of the books that followed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must admit, before 1 month ago I was completely ignorant about every aspect of Harry Potterdom. I had never turned a page in a Harry Potter novel, and never rented any of the Harry Potter movies. I assumed the Harry Potter series was for children under 12, and had no inclination to read a children's novel.Then my world changed.My oldest daughter, now nearly 7, had watched a Harry Potter movie at a friend's house, and was now becoming a Harry Potter fan. She wanted to watch the movies over and over again. I watched the movies with her to make sure that there wasn't anything too scary (she gets scared easily with monsters and such), and I became hooked.I decided to purchase Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and read it. The book reviews revealed to me that adults were reading the Potter series, so I gave it a try.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone contains an immersive fantasy world. The book is very easy to read, and very difficult to put down. And understand, the prose is not juvenile in the sense that I felt like I was reading a children's book. Quite the opposite. I was left wishing that other authors would learn from JK Rowling's ability to craft a story and create likable characters.After the 300-ish pages were done, I immediately wanted to read the second book in the series.If you are an adult who has never considered reading Harry Potter I recommend that you give it a try. It is not childish in the least, and is a very fascinating and enjoyable read.And from the viewpoint of a parent, I find the Harry Potter universe to be wonderful for my 7 year old daughter. The fantasy aspects challenge her to expand her concept of what is possible, and the stories end with good triumphing over evil."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first read \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" when I was about the age of 10. J.K. Rowling's magical writing immediately engulfed me, and I couldn't put the book down until I had read every last word. The style Rowling used to illustrate her created world of witchcraft and wizardry was too wonderful to describe.Six years after I first dove into the world of Harry Potter, I decided to pick up \\"The Socerer's Stone\\" for a second read through. The magic was still there, even if some of the writing was clearly simplified to appeal to children. This is a book for kids, there is no denying that, and the writing quality is nowhere near as distinguished as the newer Potter installments. However, anyone at any age, be it 10 years old or 40 years old, can read \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" for the aspects that might appeal to their particular age group. For example, the 10 year old may enjoy the lighter qualities of the wizarding world, such as chocolate frogs, magic wands, and invisibility cloaks, while the 40 year old may appreciate how smoothly Rowling pulls off character development or how she precisely and clearly describes the scenery at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At the same time, anyone can enjoy the backstory that exists throughout all of the current six Harry Potter episodes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In 1997, as a student in Canada I had heard all the hype surrounding a book called _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_.

It wouldnt be a stretch to say that if it wasnt for harry potter, literature, at least among my generation, would be DEAD. thats right, DEAD. friends i have that are my age that are super-ditzes, friends who probably would never have picked up a book in their life swear by harry potter's stories. (and to the recent reviewer who said music and literature are dying, well, u have the music wrong my friend, i know badgers with herpes that can play better than new found glory...try music that isnt corporately created garbage-tool, pearl jam, smashing pumpkins...i could go on for hours)-you all know the plot of harry potter, boy wizard, dursleys torment him, parents killed by voldemort, etc etc etc we all know the story...its modern day mythology! this is the kinda stuff we'll remember as fondly as mark twain and other childrens authors of yesteryear...to bypass the tedious analysation, harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is the most kid-friendly, traditional, and all-in-all happy ending kind of book in the series. however, this is not the best book in the series by far...in fact, it is a testament to how good the series is-the worst in the series is considered a new-age literary classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Good: This book is an easy read. You just can't put it down. The vocabulary is not simple, but the book is well-written enough that a caveman could enjoy this book (&quot;NOT COOL!&quot; /geicoreference). The characters are fully realized, all speaking with their own cadence and dialect; the good guys aren't perfect, and the bad guys aren't hopelessly flawed (many, in fact, are more cunning than the good guys). The plot is nicely complex, but not convoluted. And the messages are good, too: good people and bad people both get what they deserve; you have to work at things to do well; and all people are worthy of your respect until they *prove* they aren't.The Bad: The book is perhaps a little *too* simplistically written, but then I am legally able to drink alcoholic beverages, vote, and join an organization that allows me to legally kill people, and this is written for people of Harry's age (roughly 11). As well, at the end of the book, by necessity due to the number of twists, &quot;exposition syndrome&quot; rears its ugly head.The Ugly: Rereading it a few years after I first did, and after reading Order of the Phoenix quite recently, there are a number of fascinating references to future books that are just throwaway references in the book. The problem with Rowling's mysteries is that they're always like that--you have to take a few very tiny clues she mentions only once and then read for inferences between the lines.The Verdict: Read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is an excellent book to read written by J.K. Rowling. This book is called Harry Potter And The Sorcerers stone.This book is about a kid name harry potter. Harry had been spending most of his life time with the dreadful family called the dursley family. Then one day Harry has receive a letter from Hogwarts the school of wich crafts and wizards. He was really confused when he met the big giant guy name hagrid. Hagrid told harry that he was a wizard. Harry was so confused but he had to accept it. Well i think im giving out too much of what is happening in this book so if you want to know what happens next read this the most and excellent fantasy world book! I Love this book. I have to tell ya all, that when i read this book the first time i never wanted to put the book down but instead i wanted to keep reading on until it was done. so read this book i gurantee that you will love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"50-some years old, left brained and typically interested in non-fiction, I started reading the Harry Potter books because I admired so that they made kids interested in reading. I believe reading is the key to a child's futures and I wanted to understand the motivation these books were giving young people. So far, I've loved 5 of the Potter books and the 6th one is on order. I also gave the Potter fever to my 74-year-old Dad and brother, a tough 34-year-old in prison who read and then passed them around to other inmates! He said, \\"Now I see why Mom loved to read.\\" Then I found and read the Wisdom of Harry Potter by Edmund Kern, drawn by the great art on the cover, subtitle and Table of Contents - not to mention Kern's credentials and Introduction. Kern's easy-to-read, educated analysis allows us to relive the stories while seeing how they build confidence and self-understanding through Harry's choices, based on values rather than outside pressure. The Wisdom of Harry Potter made me feel great for \\"choosing\\" to delve into Rowling's stories. Mr. Kern deserves 10 stars for sharing his brilliance so delightfully. I'll read Rowling's and Kern's books again!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is very good for children who like adventure and magic and sometimes scarey. The book is about a boy named Harry whose parents are killed and now Harry has to live with his anut and uncle and their spoiled son Dudly. One day Harry founds out by a letter that he is execpted at Hogwarts the school of witch craft and wizardy. There he meets some new friends Ron and Hermione and some founds dangers that lay ahead for Harry. He also finds out more about his parents and his own life as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, so you probably know about the plot by now: Young mildly abused boy discovers that there is a secret world of witches and wizards, that he's not only one of them but he's revered among them, and to top it off that his parents never died in a car crash as he had been told all his life. So, he goes off to have adventures in a haunted castle-come-school full of everything magical and mysterious.Maybe you liked books like 'The Famous Five' as a child, but will you like this kind of stuff now? Well, look at it like this: You like having a light read once in a while, don't you? You probably even catch yourself from time to time intently following some cartoon or children's programme that you have come across by random on the TV? So, put these two things together and it's safe to say you'll find the book to be an enjoyable and light-hearted diversion to your otherwise busy day, if nothing else.But 'Harry Potter' is to 'The Famous Five' what 'Star Wars III' is to old re-runs of 'Lost in Space'. Things are simply a lot more intense these days, and Rowling keeps it as intense as it gets. This review might just as well apply to all the books that are currently in the series (five, until very shortly), and they each get more involved, more intense, and even more sinister as the plot thickens. By the third book (my favourite so far), the plot is beginning to get satisfyingly complex, and the fifth book leaves you counting the days to 16 July. This book transcends most systems of classification, as, if you don't normally like kids' books, it's still for you; if you don't normally like fantasy, it's still for you; if you don't normally like light reads, it's still for you; and if you don't normally follow everyone's insistence that something's for you, it's still for you!!!

He loves it and the discussion group!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found the Harry Potter series to be ok, but for me it went on too long, and the series could have been pared down a little. The first book was fairly entertaining, with all the magical scenes taking place at Hogwarts, and there was some nice humor and interesting characters, but it all became a little bland after awhile. For a much better read, I recommend Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone by Ralph Rathbone. It's very entertaining and basically has all the boring bits taken out, so it's an exciting read from start to finish. You get the sense sometimes that Rowling knew she had to fill up numerous books, so things drag on a bit. In Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone, things don't drag at all, and it's non-stop magical action which keeps you wanting to turn the page and find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unfortunately, I ordered this book thinking I was getting the full size hardcover book.

However, I wouldn't exactly call it \\"literature.\\" The non-stop adventure does keep you entertained, but there's little depth to the story.

When I was reading the book, I felt like I was really in the book for real life. The book was a great fantasy. There were kids riding on broom sticks and wearing invisible coats.

If you enjoyed these books and are aching for more, I recommend The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, the Wizard of Oz books by L.

My favorite part was when Neville won griffindor 10 points when they were tied with Slytherin in the house cup then Neville Longbottom Won Griffindor 10 points for standing up to his frind's when they got in troble."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are thinking of reading this book start right now because this is the best book ever wirten! Their is so much fantsy, magic and comedy you feel as though you are right there next to Harry watching it all happen!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My name is Grant. I really enjoyed this book, It's very exciting and interesting. My favorte part of this book is when Harry Potter meets &quot;You Know Who.&quot; I thank my teacher, Mrs. Johnson, for reading this book to us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Incredible imagination interwoven into a fully developed, heartwarming story. J.K. Rowling provides all the excitement and intrigue that make for fun reading, but she also gives us complete characters, friendship, fear and love. You laugh some, you may cry a little bit, but you certainly cannot put the book down. This was a story for my eight-year-old, and I loved it every much as he did. It's lucky for us that J.K. Rowling's scraps of paper made it to the publisher."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although the story is somewhat predictable, when you are reading it, you'd find yourself like a child reading a fiction ten or twenty years ago, totally escaped from the cruel &quot;adult&quot; world, nothing to worry about."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was younger you couldn't find me without a fantasy or a sci-fi novel in hand. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone marks my long-anticipated return to this genre. I must say, it was not all that I had hoped for. It is possible that as I have grown older I have lost some of my appreciation for these works of fantasy, but I do not think that is the problem. Rather, I think that J.K. Rowling has taken a great idea but done only a fair job of carrying it through. No doubt, the story is fun and exciting, and I credit Rowling for not patronizing her young readers all that much... she gives them proper credit and allows them to puzzle some of the secrets out for themselves. However, I grew up on the fantasy books of C.S. Lewis, Peirs Anthony, Lloyd Alexander, and the grandfather of the fantasy genre: J.R.R. Tolkien. I feel as though these authors did better jobs of creating unique fantasy universes... Rowling gives her readers all the old standys: flying broomsticks, magic wands, etc. Granted, Rowling has a more difficult task in staking out new ground in the fanstasy world than her predecessors had, but I would have preferred something a little more atypical. Of course I understand why these books are so popular: unlike a book like 'The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,' the Harry Potter books are about a young wizard who attends a wizardry school, and by including the typical school elements (the school bully, the unfair teacher, playground antics, the girl who always has to get an A on her tests, etc.) Rowling gives her young school-going readers something to identify with. Of course the story moves quickly and is written quite cleanly, and that doesn't hurt either."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is great! The only bad thing about this book is that some chapters are VERY boring!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With all of the hype surrounding Harry Potter, I would bet that many people will pass over these books as nothing more than a fad. That would be unfortunate. I was one of the people who bought them on a whim. I was taking a friend of mine to the Atlanta airport, when I noticed &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; on the shelf at a bookstore. Knowing that they would fly off the shelves if I didn't grab a copy (I had heard about the book on the news that evening), I bought a copy. Not only that, but I bought a copy of each of them (I'm one of those people who, in the heat of the moment, believes that if I don't get one now, I'll never be able to!)I decided I would give them to my 8 year old niece for Christmas. Now, I heard the stories about how &quot;evil&quot; the books were supposed to be, so I decided to read the first one - just to see. I was HOOKED.I read all the books the week I bought them. I gave my niece a card and $20.00 for Christmas.Sure, these books may be the epitome of mass market publication. And you might get sick of seeing Harry Potter everywhere. But when it comes down to it, the books are good. Ignore the trinkets, the bookends, posters, glasses, stuffed animals and all the hype. Buy the books. take it from this 30+ year old kid - they are every bit as enjoyable as they are made out to be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcere's Stone by J.K. Rowling was a good book. It was the longest book I've ever read. The whole wizard and witch thing was very fascinating. In this book there were many exiting adventures. Because Harry and his friends were always being nosey, they got into a lot of trouble. Hagrid, Harry's gamekeeper, was sort of watching over him. There are many lessons I've learned by reading this book. One of them is, not to play with magic because if you do you might find yourself in trouble. Reading it may take a while but it's worth it. All of the characters are very unique and weird. Some of them have names I couldn't pronounce. This book kept me on the edge of my seat!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was the best book I have read;it never got boring. The book is about a eleven year old kid whose parents died. His mom's sister recieved him on their doorstep. When he grew up his new parents told him that his parents died of a car crash. His new family also had a kid who was a spoiled bratand beat up poor Harry. One day on his eleventh birthday he was visited by a wizard named Hagrid who told him he was a wizard and found out that his parents lied to him.He later on in the book went to a famous wizard and witch school. In the school he finds a secret room and learns about the Sorcerer's Stone. The book is an exciting and is a very good book to read I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have you ever spent 10 years of your life in a cubord? Well thats what Harry did. He slept in a cubord for 10 years of his life. His Aunt and uncle didn't like him so when they would take Dudly somewhere they would leave Harry with a sitter so Harry wouldn't ruin Dudlys day. Then one day they had to take Harry with them for Dudlys birthday because the sitter got relly sick. Dudly had a fitt because Harry had to go. So they went to the zoo. Then in the reptiel section the glass in front of the snake vanished and a bowconstrictor came crawling out. Dudly and Mrs.Dursly scremed and Harry just stood there. Then as the snake was leaving Harry thought it said thanks.THE END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a delightful series. I inherited the books from my mother. I hadn't planned to read them, I was to save them for my children.The first book was fun and interesting, but I felt that the ending was a little of a last minute decision and the twist was edited back into the story. I don't think the 9-12 age group would feel this way, but as an adult reading it that's what it seemed like.I have read all 4 books over a 2 week period, so evidiently they kept my interest. What I have found wonderful is that the story is very well developed from book to book. It builds upon the previous books and the author's plot twists become better developed in each installment.I have read series novels before and was sadly disappointed when the plot left you hanging very awkwardly. J.K. Rowling tells a wonderful story within each book and when all is done you know an entire portion of Harry Potter's story. At the end of each book, my interest was peaked for the next installment. In other series novels, I felt as though the story was just cut off because the publisher/author hit the desired number of pages for a decent novel. I can't wait until my children are old enough to read these and I'll be happy to see installment number 5."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have honestly seen better books. I love fantasy, but the old classics really reign supreme over today's stuff. Except for Brian Jacques' work.He is an awesome writer!T. A. Barron is also very good. OK, shoot me. I mean, a kid who lives under the stairs,goes to a magic school at age 11 and has some adventures. Whatever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In the novel, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone&quot;, Harry Potter is portrayed as a young magician, who has wonderful powers. He has to stay with his evil aunt and uncle and spoiled cousin, &quot;Dudley.&quot; Harry has to sleep in the basement with all the rats and rodents running around 24-7. One day, Harry gets an unexpected letter from Hagird, the friendly giant. It stated,&quot; We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at the Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. Of course Mr. Dursely wasn't too pleased. He wasn't going to pay for Harry to go to a school where a &quot;crackpot&quot; taught him magic tricks. This was the start of many letters to come. Day by day, night by night, they constantly came. So they decided to leave. First, they went to a hotel about a mile away. They kept coming. They then went to a small hut on an island. They constantly came. In the middle of the nigh, they heard a loud banging in the middle of the night. Who else could it be, but Hagrid. He has come to take Harry school shopping. As Harry goes to the school of Hogwarts, he meets some great friends. Some were friendly, and some were mean. Like Voldemort. He and Harry batter it all throughout his time at Hogwarts. Voldemort, is very jealous of Harry and tries his hardest to get him in trouble. You must buy this wonderful book to read the ending. I recommend this book to the child who is very interested in wonderful fantasies, about monsters and hidden dragons. It will amaze you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I started reading this book to my 6 year old son. we only got through two chapters before his bedtime. It,however, was too good for me to put down I stayed up half the night to finish it and I am enjoying reading the rest for him. He is just learning to read now and is excited about discovering such wonderful stories for himself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book, fantastic! And I can see why it is everyone's favorite. I have read Harry potter And The Sorcerers Stone twice already, and can't wait for the next book. But nothing can compare with Patricia C. Wrede's books. so, when you finish harry potter, read one of Patricia's books!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was amazing. I felt like I was actually in the book with Harry. Espessialy when Harry, Ron and Hermoine were in the bathroom with the troll. Also when Professor Snape was making Harry's broom go bonkers at the Quidditch match. While I was reading that I was holding my breath, waiting to see if he would survive. I'm glad he did. My favorite part of the book is, no doubt, the part when Hagrid put a pig's tail on Dudley.

Rowling for creating such a wonderful little guy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I received this book as a present for my 30th birthday, and completely and utterly enjoyed it. Most days, I spend my time reading about the law, which tends to grind thoughts of wizards, dragons, and flying broomsticks out of the imagination. This book served as a wonderful diversion from an otherwise awful week at work, and I am grateful to its author. I'll be reading the lot of them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book, with a well-developed plot and very well developed characters, is a must to read. I've never seen such a unique book, and the author's creativity is admirable. I've never seen a book like the ones in the Harry Potter series. It also has a very interesting, unexpected twist, as all harry Potter books do."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a wonderful book for children and adults alike. Anyone who has been through the English Public (i.e. private) School System will identify with many of the jokes. BUT WHY was the title changed for the American market? The book's UK title is &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;. Is the US public too stupid to be able to handle that title? In any event there is no such item in mythology/alchemy as a &quot;Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; We are insulted."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A very very well writen book I can't put it down!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i loved this book! i't is a graet story for kids and, well it's great for just about every one! it's funny and i think it's the best book i've ever read! i'll read it over and over and over agian!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Warner Bros., 1998, 309pp., $6.99J. K. Rowling ISBN 0-590-35342-XHarry Potter's life stinks. He lives on #4 Privet Drive with his evil aunt, uncle, and cousin. Their lives are perfectly normal. Regular jobs, schools, home... everything. Harry has never even been allowed to say the word \`magic'.But that is all about to change when a letter arrives by owl messenger.

Something secret, waiting just around the corner.This book had a slow start, but once it got going I couldn't put it down. This is a mysterious and an adventurous story. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes a good story.-Tyler Summitt"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first read this book in fourth grade, I thought \\"Wow.\\" I wished that I could be a wizard! The series never loses its uniquness, and the first book is great.Simply put, this book is a great book because it is creative to no end and a great book to sit down on a weekend while it's raining and read, read read! It's one of those books you can read in one (long) sitting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you like fictional stories alive with mythical beings and magic,you'll love Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. J.K. Rowling paints thestory brilliantly in each chapter. From the normal muggles to thefantastic wizard world, you feel as though you yourself might someday obtainmagical powers as well. When I read this story I felt a pang of envy andjealousy. I wish I could fly in a train to school, walk through aninvisible wall, test out for my perfect wand, and watch my deliciouschocolate frog hop away from me, well maybe not that last one. I might settlefor our normal muggle sweets, easier to KEEP my snack, and the thought ofplacing a wriggly frog in my mouth is just ew, Though this book wasmeant for younger children, I found myself falling in love with it. Never adull moment in each page, I could hardly place my book down. Thoughfantasy, this book seems almost possible. Harry faced with the sameproblems we might face now, but find escape into the magical Hogswart. Thisbook has the works, the magical flying brooms, dragons, giants, cauldrons,you name it. But they add some spice to it with quidditch, the magicaldiagon alley, and the goblin banking systems. If you are looking for anescape from reality, that's not too unbelievable, you'll find every formof magic in this book. I love the way you see Harry grow as he battleshe-who-must-not-be-named while at the same time finding much meaning tohis life. He plays a difficult role as a muggle, a fresh wizard, friend,hero, enemy to the most feared wizard, and find time to do his studiesand learn more magic. As you read Harry's experiences and watch himlearn, you learn as well and experience just as much as he does. J.K. Rowlingreally captures the reader into this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book for people of all ages. Its a book for children who are looking for fun and adventure. It is a book for adults who are looking for fun and adventure. It is a book for anyone and everyone. This is JK Rowling's first book and is probably one of the best freshmen novels in years.Harry Potter is the least likely person in the world to be a hero. He's small, skinny, pale, wears baggy clothing and broken glasses. He gets beaten up by his cousin Dudley, and, indeed, he appears to be rather normal. But he's not. Harry Potter is a legend in a small community that is unknown to the average preson. In fact, Harry Potter, only eleven, is in a number of text books, though he did not know so.So what's so special about skinny, downtrodden Harry Potter. Well, Harry is a wizard. Harry is the only wizard to ever survive a curse by the greatest dark wizard for a century, lord Voldemort, who, though gone for 11 years, is still feared, and referred to as \\"He Who Must Not Be Named\\" or \\"You Know Who.\\"Harry's aunt and uncle try to keep him from knowing, but the story comes out in the end, and Harry takes up his place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts, Harry encounters giants and trolls, new friends and enemies, centaurs and ghosts. But all is not well at Hogwarts, for Voldemort is still at large; he is still cunning, still devious, still bent on causing mayhem. At the end of Harry's first year, he manages to stop Voldemort's evil plot, but for how long? Voldemort will return, but when? How?The world of Harry Potter is intriguing and complex, whimsical and enthralling. I read the first three novels in two days, one summer, because I couldn't put the books down.
