My kids and I love them! This book is a short compilation of stories that seem to have a song to them that the reader doesn't understand. It would be better as a music cd/book set because the stories by themselves aren't that interesting, cute or funny. Wish I hadn't bought it. I recommend Boynton's \\"Philadelphia Chickens\\" music cd & book set over this book."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"We have a few of her books and my daughter really loves them so I thought a bedtime collection would be great. While the stories are short which is nice, a few of them are kind of boring and just odd. She wasn't a fan. We have maybe read the whole thing 2 times in the 2 years we've owned it."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Should hold up to wear and tear through several kids. Wipe clean material. Set is small but easy to read."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This book is certainly a hit in our home! Our daughter loves the green, blue and purple tabs the best. She will sit and listen through the others but loves how we read the green tab as a rap and how we yell SNORE with the purple--she gets so excited! It is the first book she grabs for night time. Plus, the rhymes are easily remembered. :) Would recommend this book to any parent."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I usually like Sandra Boynton's books and was hoping this would encourage my toddler to go to sleep (or at least to entertain her) but it was not stimulating or motivating in the least bit. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My wife would not even consider letting go of this book that we have had since our kids were little. They are now teenagers and would revolt if we read it to them ... but we kept it in our collection. It is a very fun book for kids up to 5 or 6 years old (and those of us who may still be kids at heart)."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"So much fun to read to my little guy. Great for long days with tired kids who need to go to bed pronto! :)"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Colorful and fun to read.

I have several of Sandra Boynyon's books."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Seven of Sanders Boynton's stories are packed into this sturdy little book. I bought one for each of the babies in my extended family."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I am familiar with the Boynton books and have purchased others.

Perfect for bedtime, good luck only reading one story though."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This is a very cute book for kids.

Kids love them! Boynton's books are some of my favorite. Durable material."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This book makes for great bedtime reading and has help my daughter to go to sleep on many a night. Six cute little stories about bedtime and a nonsense song make up the contents which are illustrated by a whole bunch of Boynton animals. The contents are as follows:Snoozers - A story of the Snoozers who can sleep anywhere and anytime (except bedtime).I'm Not Tired - A little bear puts himself to sleep by fussing about not being tired.The Big Yawn - Just what the title says. Beware.Pajamas - Different animals like different types of pajamas. What kind of animal are you? My son is a piggy and my daughter is a moose (so am I).Six Sleepy Sheep - A poem of the evening activities of the title characters as they get ready for sleep.Night Sounds - All of the snores of the jungle as the animals sleep until...Silly Lullaby - A really silly song."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I found this book in an airport on a week long trip my son was determined to spend awake, or that's how it seemed at bedtime. This book did the trick to get him to sleep without a fuss--both that night, and every &quot;I'm not tired&quot; night since then. Both the stories and the format are perfect for giving the little ones the illusion of control--they choose which stories to read from the &quot;table of contents&quot; tabs on the side, and in which order. The number of stories is just right to make kids feel like they've gotten you to keep reading a long time, even though the entire book only takes minutes to finish. Bravo to Boynton!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Although we have a history of liking Boynton books, this was not very interesting for my child, age 2.5. This book has seven bedtime stories set up on two pages each. Each page spread is one story, somewhere between 16 and 20 lines of text. That's it, not much of a story. The rhymes are cute, but in two of the stories the rhyme seems very forced. The pictures, as always, are great. But the &quot;stories&quot; are more like nursery rhymes, an alternative to Mother Goose.What do we like about it? The tab system that lets my child count as we go through the book. She also recognized a couple of characters from the Going to Bed Book, which I think is a better bedtime Boynton book, in the pajamas page.I think if you've been reading more substantial story books, like Seuss or Sendak, or other classics, this is probably too elementary, unless you are still doing short books at night. Based on the reviews, I thought this was a sure hit; but I didn't realize what the actual content would be."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This is not just a favorite at bedtime, but all day long. My 13-month-old will bring it to me during the day and &quot;throws&quot; it at me until I read it. He especially loves the &quot;snore&quot; page --making the noises along with me."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This was the first book my busy toddler really loved. Now she's 4 and can read it herself, and she still loves it. And what's more, I'm not even tired of it! The humor, the rhymes, and the dialogue that invites participation are all great. &quot;Meatier&quot; than the smaller Boynton board books, but still in just-right bite-sized chunks. In my opinion, the best Boynton's done (unless you count Rhinoceros Tap, which play to a somewhat older audience but is also a huge winner)."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Boynton is always fresh and original. Her illustrations are cute and the animal characters are very expressive, for cartoons. The stories are each worth a smile, but the &quot;Silly Song&quot; (music included) on the last page is worth the price alone. (Sneakers in the freezer? An owl that whispers &quot;moo&quot;?) I think it's appropriate for ages higher than the typical &quot;board book&quot; crowd - my six year old is learning to play the silly song on the piano, and she often comes into the bedroom of her younger sister when I am reading it to her. Our whole family enjoys this book."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"We bought this book for my son when he was 1 year old. He love it. He chatters along as we read it and the tabs on the pages make it easy for him to turn them. He love the colors, the cartoon animals and we often find this book in bed with him. Thanks again Sandra Boynton for another great book"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"We bought this book as a &quot;before bedtime&quot; wind-down read (parents of other 2 year olds will be familiar with this ploy.) It was read to our daughter numerous times cover-to-cover each night, but has now become a firm &quot;first thing in the morning&quot; read (whilst she's having her bottle.) She very quickly caught on to the little hiding teddy (and his &quot;I'm not tired&quot; refrain...funny about that...) Lots of fun for Boynton fans."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My husband reads to our 9 month old before bed and a night never goes by without Snoozers. I have to remind my husband that we have other books for him to read. Our son loves the colorful pages and can turn the pages on his own."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I love this book, and it's a good thing because I read it EVERY night!! Boynton's humor is infectious and zany. It's just the right length to allow my six month old daughter to relax in her crib before falling asleep. It's easy to memorize (for 'reading' in the dark), and the illustrations are so colorful for enjoying all day long. So buy the book and send YOUR zoodles to sleep!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This is the perfect go to bed quick with a story book I have found. My little one, who is 4, loves getting to choose the tab for the story and goes to bed much more willingly with a story (even if it is super quick)! We usually read two so she feels extra special. It's not the lenghth that counts, it's the snuggle."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"These very brief stories are perfect for my son, who has problems with attention at bedtime. He can skip around the book and have two or three brief stories instead of trying to keep still through one long one. Boyton stories are always a delight, and these are no exception!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"OK, as an adult I first looked at this book and wondered &quot;what is the big deal?&quot; The stories are short, silly and simple. The illustrations are typical Sandra Boynton. Well... just give a two year old a chance with it. My daughter is 2, and has half of them memorized. We have to do the snore sounds for every animal just right, and the ridiculous song at the end of the book is a huge hit! Let your child be the judge.I've ordered three more copies to store in my gift cupboard. Who would have known?!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Our family are tremendous book lovers, with thousands of books in our collection, and our daughter's collection alone has hundreds upon hundreds of books. But the book she loves the most and without a doubt has gotten the MOST use of is SNOOZERS.We purchased this book when our daughter was 2, and three years later we're STILL reading it to her at bedtime EVERY night. We've tried to add other stories to the bedtime ritual, but she keeps requesting this one. And you know what? We don't mind a bit! The stories are fun, the pictures are adorable, and it's always been giggles and a quick, no fuss, trip to sleep for our daughter. To keep our own adult sanity for this long, we've been reading the stories at different tempos and with really silly voices. Now that she's about to turn 6, we're not sure how much longer this will continue...but it may very well become a special bedtime ritual she will want to hold onto throughout her childhood. (There's no signs of it gathering dust on the bookshelf anytime soon.) No doubt about it, this book is a hit -- It would be a bargain at twice the price!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"For the mother who said &quot;Thanks a lot for giving us Curious George Flies a Kite -- it's 70 pages long!&quot; here's the answer. Snoozers is short, real short, and as bright and cheery as a fistful of greeting cards. The individual stories revolve around bedtime themes and are just the right length for little ones to memorize and &quot;read&quot; themselves, and the board-style pages are sturdy enough to withstand all manner of abuse, even teething. Best of all, it's Boynton!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Seven nonsense rhymes with cute illustrations of animals in pajamas are entertainng nighttime fare. Some of the rhymes do seem forced but the colored tabs are a great idea and the tone is sweet."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My 3 children all loved this book when they were younger. Even now (even though they are ages 7, 9 &amp; 11) they will all curl up with me and we read it together."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"what you see is what you getas you'd expect of this product. overall, we are fairly happy with this."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"These are a favorite line of books by Sandra Boynton. Little ones like to turn the pages, which are easy to do since they are board book. I highly recommend these."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Okay, my kids have short attention spans, but nothing about this book actually draws them in. The concepts are cute and creative, but each short snippet could make a nice separate board book. The humor isn't as overt as in many of her other wonderful books."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"i have found the quality of any boynton product to be good and the books are great for little ones. we have quite a few books and have started with the plush toys.. all are a big hit for the child and adults.. thank you karen colucci"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My 19 month old loves this book! She even sings along to the silly lullabye. I think this book is great."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I usually love Sandra Boynton books, but I think she missed here. My kids didn't like this book, despite loving Blue Hat, Green Hat (or is it Green Hat, Blue Hat?), Barnyard Dance and others. The vignettes are just too short and the text doesn't really work either."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I'm a huge Boynton fan. Some of her childrens' books are pure magic and I still smile when I read them again and again (such as Barnyard Dance, Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaur and the Going to Bed Book). This one just didn't do anything for me. I love her silliness and whimsy but the total nonsense lullaby at the end was the worst. If it didn't cost so much to send it back, I would.It also didn't hold my girls attention at all.Oh well... I'll keep trying her other books. There's bound to be more gems out there."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"There aren't enough nice things I could say about this author. Everything she writes is pure enjoyment for me and my kids. They love this book and I enjoy reading it. Although, it doesn't make it any easier to put them to sleep :o)"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Love this author. This book is in the typical Boynton fashion. Great illustrations, great rhymes and cute overall stories. These are VERY short stories, but they are all great!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"A very cute and interesting story. The art work is very good. My grand daughter is one and she enjoys to read."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This was (and still is) a favorite bedtime book in our house! We have kids ranging from 4-11. I still read this to our four year old. \\"I'm Not Tired\\" and \\"Snoozers\\" are our two favorites out of this book, but they are all good! You cannot go wrong with Sandra Boynton! I have given this as a baby shower gift and for toddler birthday gifts."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Super stories for wee ones with short attention spans. Sandra Boynton is the author of many children-loved books, and this is not the least of them. Funny stories with illustrations that are clear and colorful."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This is the perfect bedtime book. I purchased it 12 years ago for my daughter (she still has it) and again this month for my 2-year old great niece. It has durable cardboard pages and seven quick, sweet, easy-to-say short stories so the kid feels like they're getting more than one bedtime story. All I can say is buy it. Boy or girl, doesn't matter. Great buy, lasts forever, and my now 13-year old can still recite the lines."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My little 3 year old loves this book. It gives him the option of picking which story he wants read for the evening - although, we do end up having to read the whole book. He loves the night sound story the best and makes the sounds himself and if I even try to do it with him, we end up starting over."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"my kids call this 'the funny book'. it's fun reading for bed time.Pajama Time is also a really good one!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My children enjoy books and always look foward to receiving new ones.This book was a big hit with my two and three year old.I'm sure it is also good reading for kids who are older than three."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"One of our ALL TIME favorites! And if you have the CD, you can actually sing some of these songs/stories to your children. They'll love it! We give our daughter a choice. \\"Would you like us to sing it, or read it?\\" (She always has us sing it...)"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Book is solid. Pages are thick and the book and the tabs are durable. It survived a 1yr old stomping on it without any damage. The stories have lots of colors and great art work to keep their attention. The stories seem like they will become happy memories for the child and can be read over and over.$10 may seem a bit high for a childrens book. To each their own, though."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"We love the song \\"Snoozers\\" so we were very excited to add this book to our collection of Sandra Boynton books!! Cute and fun to read:)"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Sandra Boynton is one of the best writers for the very young. Her illustrations, themes, and rhyming prose are loved by every child I've gifted with her stories. (And that is quite a few) I have started my youngest niece's library (1 yr)and she pulls the books out and 'reads' them to herself, no greater praise!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This is a 16 page board book with seven stories in it. Two of the pages are the table of contents.The stories are, of course, short. In fact, they are \\"short short\\", as advertized!If your kid has moved past board books and is now well into the world of long books like Green Eggs and Ham or, dare I say it, War and Peace, this one might be a little *too* short short for him or her.If your kid is in the target age for these books, baby or toddler, then it should be just long enough to hold his or her attention until beddybye.The stories are typically funny, in Boynton's style. We especially like \\"I'm Not Tired\\" around here, and the silly lullaby at the end!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My daughter, who is 2 1/2 LOVES this book. Because the rhymes are easy and fun to read, she has memorized the entire book and now she has more fun 'reading' it to me. So it helps with her enunciation and gives her quite the sense of accomplishment! Every night we must read 'noozers' before going to bed. I would recommend this book for any age child, especially the independent ones who like to be 'in charge' (which seems to be pretty much all toddlers!)"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"if you love sandra boynton, this is sure to please. seven 1 to 2 page stories... one of which is a funny song.... all to induce an end of the day sort of mood. illustrations are colorfull and fun."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Sandra Boynton is without a doubt a superstar among writers for children's books. Her books are great entertainments for our kids and they definitely foster a love of books.In my humble opinion, this is Boynton's best book. The conceit of the book is that it is seven stories, each a page long. PERFECT for 18m to 3yo. In these seven short pages, you get a counting story, a lullaby, a kid-participation story, an animal snoring story with funny noises, a pajama story, a dinosaur-yawning story, etc. All of them are fun, all of them are sleep-oriented, and they all point to one place: bed.Everything is underscored with Boynton's playful sense of humor and her adorable drawings. Over the last two years, this book has been in heavy rotation at bedtime and we're not tired of it.I think all of Boynton's books are great, but this one is really wonderful. Highly, highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I'm really surprised by some of the poor opinions some have of this. My 23-month-old loves this book. She wants to hear \\"I'm Not Tired\\" again and again and again. The \\"Snoozers\\" and \\"Silly Lullaby\\" are both in the book/CD \\"Philadelphia Chickens,\\" which is the only reason I give this a 4 -- while it's fun to know the tunes that go to those stories, it would have been better to give those two songs more illustrations in their own books. But in general, \\"I'm Not Tired\\" and the Pajamas story are well worth it to this mom."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My little girl (3-1/2 years) and I read books before bedtime every night. This has proven to be a favorite. It is really nice to read a sleep story, kinda puts her in the \\"mood\\" for sleep. \\"I'm not tired\\" is fun, we read it together!!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"At 13 months old, our little girl loves \\"Snoozers.\\" For the past two weeks, she searches and finds it among the dozens of books on her bookshelf, and pulls it out for us every night. She won't even let me read the first few -- she turns directly to the last one, and wants to hear the animals snore!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I love the book.

Great for little hands."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I love Sandra Boynton books for my toddler.

There are 7 very short stories with funny pictures for them to look at.

This book is a great addition to our little one's collection. Would definetly reccomend others to purchase this authors books."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"We've had this book for a few years - my son is 5 now and it is one that he comes back to again and again. Each story is fun to read with Sandra Boynton's cute little character illustrations. We never tire of reading it to him... it's one of our favorites!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This is a very cute little book. Not sure if I would actually consider it a \\"bedtime book\\". Maybe my 20 month old granddaughter either is too old or too young for this book, but she doesn't care about the pictures in it and she NEVER asks for it to be read again, much less read at all! I pick it up to read to her, and she shakes her head and tells me \\"NO\\" ! If I open the pages, SHE closes them, and I have to choose a different book!. Maybe another 6 months to a year, she MIGHT enjoy it more. Also, I didn't realize there are \\"tabs\\" on the pages and she likes to chew on them and then bend or tear them."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My daughter was getting bored with the bedtime books that I currently read. I needed something new and this book with 7 stories is a blessing in disquise."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I am a new grandmother and very exciting for the opportunity to read to my grandson! These books are perfect. I remember them from when my girls were young - still just as fun!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"I bought this book for my baby's first birthday, but it is my 6 year old and 4 year old who LOVE it. They think it is hilarious. They love to recite the stories. The book definately grows on you."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My 14 month old love this. We've been reading it to him for at least 6 months. The pajama story is the funniest. Thanks Sandra for another great book!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"This was one of my favorite books to read to my daughter when she was 1. I could recite all the stories verbatim. We loved the animals' sounds of sleep; the cheetah = &quot;chee-chee-taah', the monkeys = &quot;chatter-choo chatter-choo&quot;. There's even a little silly lullaby you can sing at the end. Now my daughter, 2, can pick the stories she wants to hear from the tabs."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Our 8-month-old hears the delightful short stories in \\"Snoozers\\" each night as part of his bedtime routine. The book always holds his attention and interest. One of the stories calls for a second voice to help tell it. We've had lots of fun experimenting with this second voice. While one of us reads to our son, the other is tidying up or putting away laundry in his room or the neighboring room. As long as that person is within earshot as the story is being told, they chime in at all the right times. Some nights the voice is unexpectedly boisterous; other nights it's sweet and subtle. One never knows what to expect!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Cute book for bed that is nice and fast for those children that don't SIT for books!!!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"These short, short, wonderful rhymes are almost too much fun for bedtime reading. My son laughs and laughs and we have to read 2 or 3 of them 2 or 3 times each and then he giggles himself to sleep. Thank Heaven it's a book that I'm not nearly tired of, either - and we've almost worn out our copy."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"My 13month old wants me to read the book to him all the time - it's easy for him to turn the pages (a real plus, since he can also look at it by himself), because it is designed like a file-folder. I love the stories and knew them by heart right away. The pictures are colorful and it's easy to point and label the different animals. We both really love it and I recommend it to every parent."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Good bedtime reading. I especially like the 6 Sleepy Sheep short story. It would rate 5 stars for me if not for the Silly Lullabye which I don't like at the end of the book. My daughter loves to turn the pages!"},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"As usual, the Boynton poems and pictures are delightfully entertaining. This book is a little too long to read to your &quot;lively little kid&quot; in one sitting, but you can ask your child which color he/she wants to choose and then just read the story that corresponds to the color chosen. For the last story, &quot;Silly Lullaby,&quot; you need to be able to read music, have a keyboard handy, or have a lively imagination. In my humble opinion, the very best story of the lot is &quot;Pajamas.&quot; Your child will have it memorized in no time. The last line is: &quot;You've GOT to have buttons if you're a moose.&quot; Think about it. If you can't figure out why a moose needs buttons on his or her pajamas, then you'll just have to buy the book."},{"Title":"Snoozers : 7 Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids","review":"Sandra Boynton is my favorite author of board books, but this one just didn't deliver. Usually her stories are good fun for the tiniest member of the family, but this one had no kick! I recommend choosing another one of her titles or collections."},{"Title":"Talking about music: Symphonies, concertos and sonatas","review":"I had the privilege of listening to Hopkins on the BBC presenting his series with the same name as the book : Talking About Music. The book is based on these shows but Hopkins unleashes his talent by getting more involved in print than on the air. Hopkins introduces the work by giving a bit of background. He then proceeds to analyze each movement in a manner suitable for advanced beginners. If you are very well trained in music and in the analysis of compositions, this book is not for you. The simplicity with which he introduces technical issues to non musicians is without equal. Right after the first page, you feel that you want to get to your hifi and listen to the music in parallel with the text. This is a book for the listening room. I wish he would write a sequel."},{"Title":"Seeing Law Differently: Views from a Spiritual Path","review":"Excellent book to give us a total different view of law and its role in human development and relationship, I wished it was part of every law school curiculum."},{"Title":"Acting With an Accent, Stage Dialect Instruction: British North Country","review":"David Stern is amazingly good at conveying how to shape your tongue/month to produce certain sounds.

The book also contains a bunch of C++ topics such as the obligatory object/class and inheritance material, templates, exceptions, STL, windows programming topics, and some useful material on processes and threads.The book is not designed to be read through for a comprehensive understanding of any of the logical areas. Hence it is not suitable as a beginner's book. Rather it is designed for the programmer who is familiar, but not entirely proficient with C and just wants to know how to accomplish some very focused task: &quot;gee, what's one way to spawn a process?&quot;I program in C a fair amount, but am not a guru at it by any means, and so I have found this book to be very useful as a resource when I wanted to do something new. I hate wading through all the nonsense you get with most C references which are slanted towards beginners and not toward those of us who have to do something real, and really quick.

This book provides all of those things.I haven't had the chance to check all the code samples included within the book so I cannot confirm or deny of the validity of the complaints registered by other users. However, to those who deride this book because its disorganized and hard to read cover to cover: Its a REFERENCE BOOK. You aren't supposed to read it cover to cover. Any disorganization of material is more than made up for with the books excellent index (the best one I've seen in a reference book).I looked at MANY C++ references in Barnes &amp; Noble.

Some of the examples are general enough to lead me to the correct man page, but not enough.The book's organization and style of writing is surprisingly horrible. Just about every &quot;tip&quot; has the phrase &quot;as you learned&quot; and refers to another tip. Removing all the yous, yours, &quot;as you have learned&quot;s, and &quot;In tip #, you learned that&quot;s would probably cut the book length by a quarter.

The problem other books are unorganized, poorly written, and to often, just plain wrong. This book has none of those problems. Very few of the examples had errors, you can't expect perfection from a book so large. The few errors I found were simple to correct (extra parenthesis for example). After reading this book everythign &quot;clicked&quot; and I no longer spend hours lookign for solutions in my other books, because after learning from this book I am now able to develop my own solutions. This book is also so well organized that when I do occasionally have to look up something I can find a solution in seconds. I would highly recommend this book for anyone from begginer to advanced."},{"Title":"Jamsa's C/C++ Programmer's Bible","review":"This book, one of many written on C and C++ gives a summary of the structure and syntax of these two languages, and gives an introduction to the Standard Template Library and Windows programming. It is best used as a reference and not as a textbook, since there are no exercises or coding problems in the book. Some of it is out-dated, particularly the section on Windows programming, and an overview of that topic is best done with a book on the latest version of Visual C++. The authors do attempt to be comprehensive, and treat most of the main features of C and C++, but some important topics, such as performance issues with C++ versus C, are not discussed. It is a suitable reference for those who have considerable expertise in these two languages.The first 800 paragraphs cover the C programming language, and the authors do a pretty good job of summarizing the main properties of the language. Some of the strong points in the discussion include: type modifiers, compiler pragmas, preprocessor condition testing, the functions atof, atoi, and atoll, formal versus actual parameters, function overhead, call by value and (pointer) reference, recursion, calling assembly language functions, the va_arg, va_start, and va_end macros, tradeoff between arrays and dynamic memory, quick sort, pointer arithmetic, DOS and BIOS services, memory management, memory models, the tzset function, the MAKE utility, linked lists, child processes, interrupts, invariant code, inlining, fast function calls, and code compaction. The authors give a large amount of sample code to illustrate these concepts.The next 450 paragraphs give an overview of the C++ programming language, emphasizing it as an extension of C, and not as an independent object-oriented language. There are very effective discussions on: anonymous unions, the global resolution operator, lazy evaluation (this was particularly helpful), the 3 different ways to pass parameters in C++, the inline keyword, operator overloading, the scope resolution operator, when to use inline and out-of-line functions, friend classes, constructor functions, overloading with friend functions, multiple inheritance, mutual friend classes, inline assembly language statements in method functions (particularly useful discussion), the THIS pointer, implementing polymorphism, generic functions, exception handling, namespaces, the doubly linked list class, containers, iterators, and the vector class (very well written!).I will omit reviewing the last part of the book on Windows programming since it is out of date and is treated more effectively elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jamsa's C/C++ Programmer's Bible","review":"As a beginning C/C++ programmer I find this book to be very helpful.

If do not know how to program in C/C++ and want to learn how, I would not recommend this book as it's layout suggests. It is more of a reference manual than a beginners guide. I am sure there are plenty of beginning books out there that are easier to digestTo be honest I already knew C/C++ before I got this book and I haven't read it chronologically at all. I initially purchased this book because it looked like a decent quick and dirty C/C++ reference guide. Don't understand how 'printf' can take multiple parameters? And you want to implement something similar in one of your own functions? This book has got it. Admittedly it won't have everything and I was looking for just a straight C reference not C++ or Win32 programming (have other books for that). But I found so far it has fit my needs as a C reference nearly perfectly in that respect. The only thing I wish it had was some information on network programming.The C programming in some sections seems to be geared towards DOS platform and not general ANSI C. Be aware of this. As most of that kind of stuff is outdated unless you still use DOS. I haven't done DOS programming in ages but so far with what I have read he tries to adhere to ANSI compliance on the majority of topics."},{"Title":"Jamsa's C/C++ Programmer's Bible","review":"I am suprised that this didn't receive 5 stars overall.

It stumbled me quite a bit, that it used &quot;custom macro's&quot; but forgot to tell you later as you were reading it these were MACRO's rather then the actual code. So when you try to use some of the I/O it's stuck saying there is no command/macro with that name, but with all the examples you get used to the custom ones, rather then the real ones. And then you have to find it by hand. I reccemend this for people who like challenges and who are more familiar with this kind of language.. Not for beginners..But it has some REALLY good examples.

Unfortunately, some of the arguments have not been considered, and the Windows section is obsolete respect to the current compilers available today.

In depth discussions, when necessary, were lacking, and when not necessary I fell asleep reading. When I would start getting interested in some particular function, I usually (80% of the time) ran into a missing code piece or poorly coded samples. Sometime the sample programs were just not there.Most of the samples would not compile under Visual C++. There were so many tiny mistakes, I found it was taking me too much time to debug the darn things and fix the same simple mistakes over, and over, and over, and ..... well you get the point.

Several times over the past year. Needless to say the website is nothing more than a self glorifying monument to the authors. I never once recieved a reply to my email.I don't know these people personally, but it seems to me that Ph.D.s , especially those who have published over 70 computer books, should not go around publishing barely useful books with a CD full of erronious source code.

Let's get to the review:This book is organized into tips(think of headers to sections being numbered), rather than pages. This may seem ackward at first, but it becomes irrelevant as you begin reading it.This book is a bit outdated, I don't remember whether or not it complies with the C99 or ANSI C++98 Standard. This book is based mostly on Win32 programming(both shell[dos] and graphical).This book covers EVERYTHING. There are some things in this book that you will NOT find in any other C/C++ book. It pretty much shows you every system call/function in standard C/C++ and Win32. It even covers using the ANSI driver(which can also be used in Linux) to create colored text within a prompt[I know, big deal, but find another book that covers that minute detail].Overall, I believe this book is worth 5 stars.

Using this book and the help of other programmers I was able to get where I wanted to go. I found this book quite inclusive but also quite disjointed, especially for one just learning C. If I had no other programming experience, this book would have been very tough to grasp. To me, it presents the building blocks of the C language very well, but its hard to fit all these blocks together without some initial outside assistance. I agree that some of the author's wording is repetitive (&quot;As you have learned&quot; must have been his first phrase he was taught in school); and some of the examples don't compile- although some are meant not to compile and the user is left to straighten them out using information from previous readings in the book. I use 2 C compilers (the one in the text and one in my FORTRAN for WINDOWS suite); its interesting that some code compiles in the older compiler but not in the newer WINDOWS compiler; usually because older DOS functions are no longer supported in the newer compiler. Quite interesting since the WINDOWS C compiler is older than the book.

One example: I saw the &quot;*&quot; that appeared in some functions but only after one hour of searching in the code , did I understand that these meant POINTERS !

I learned DOS from one of his books, way back in the days when a 12mhz '286 was a ripping fast expensive piece of computing iron. A lot of the criticism is true; the code has errors and in many cases seems not to have ever been tested. The book is much too large for it's gum binding and will definitely fall apart in time. I'm thinking of cutting it in half with a razor so that I get to at least choose where it falls apart. There are 1500 'tips' but many of the divisions are so arbitrary as to be laughable. I have no need of the included compiler and haven't tried it. All that said, as a working programmer/tech I find the book interesting and useful. Just don't pay full price for it like I did, I see I could have saved $10 bucks by getting it here at Amazon and that puts it closer to what it's really worth. It's not meant to teach C or C++. It's just a good book for those times when you think &quot;how do I implement that derived constructor again?&quot; or just for something to open at random and ponder. Sort of a programmers coffee table book. Just don't trust the code to be right until you've tested it yourself. I went to Jamsa Press website after buying the book and I see that Kris has sold the company. If this book is any indication of his level of interest, it's a good thing that he's apparently gone off to pursue his degree in financial planning.

A bit overstated, perhaps, but not by much if Bullen is to be believed. I enjoyed the writing about, if not the fact of killing, whales which evan Bullen regreted occassionally between recounting with enthusiasm the joy of killing and surviving danger and harsh conditions. Life on the ocean, hard work, adventure, loyalty, courage, man's right to dominate nature and Anglo-Saxon man's right to dominate all others is the gist of this life and book, as far as I can tell. Small wonder that it was included in the Boy Scout Edition (1913) of Every Boy's Library, eh? Some things have changed and most readers today might disavow the racism, chauvanism, species-ism call it what you will of Bullen's views but it is a good read on the times and the nature of man, humankind and the political correctness of the late 19th. century. At least that's my view for what it's worth. Dated, but still readable especially for it's candid picture of life in the last century.

Johnson while he was a Commanding General, and then to serve two years as his personal aide while he was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. Sorley has done a magnificient job of research and reporting on the life of the most dedicated American military leader in recent history. General Johnson was a unique man, humbled by his roots, molded by his experience as a POW, and a man whose personal moral standards never waivered. I think the author has portrayed General Johnson as the man I knew. My only difference with the portrayal is the implication of &quot;resignation in protest&quot; on a number of occasions. General Johnson held the view that his function was to advise the President, and that the President had no obligation to accept that advice. I would accept the &quot;resignation&quot; theory only if it portrayed General Johnson as considering resignation because he felt his advice was inadequate or that his articulation ! of that advice was inadequate. The idea of resignation would have been because he felt someone else could perhaps do it better. He was such a private man that I also doubt he would have shared that thought with others, particularly junior to him.

Now he has one -- and Lewis Sorley has proven up to the task. This is a major work of biography on one of America's finest soldiers. Obviously the result of years of research, Sorley's vivid recounting of Johnson's agonizing years of imprisonment under the Japanese, his heroism in the bloody combat of Korea, and his climb to the top of the Army's command ladder sets the standard for biographical excellence. I have not read a better biography of any military figure since Bruce Catton's treatment of Grant. This is an exceptionally fine book that leaves only one unanswered question: when does Sorley's next work come out?"},{"Title":"Honorable Warrior: General Harold K. Johnson and the Ethics of Command (Modern War Studies)","review":"Harold K. Johnson was a soldier's soldier who had the misfortune to have his career bookended by a pair of tragedies. As a young officer at the beginning of World War II, he was captured by the Japanese on Bataan and his sense of duty forced him to abandon thoughts of escape in order to look after his men. Then, as Chief of Staff of the Army, he was forced to watch the civilian leadership ignore his advice and make a hash of a winnable war. Again, his sense of duty to his men forced him to swallow his anger and abandon plans of resigning and going public with his criticisms.Lest one think that something other than duty led him to these painful decisions, the core of his career reveals a brilliant, courageous soldier for whom duty was his watchword. Sorley writes with objectivity and sensitivity about Johnson's career and this book becomes a virtual primer on duty. Selflessness marked all of Johnson's actions and while one would have preferred seeing a happier conclusion to the career of this fine man, Honorable Warrior shows you why the best people in America are sometimes forced to live with the consequences of someone else's muddled decisions.Sorley's book succeeds as top notch military history, a thoughtful biography of a good man and a philosophical meditation on the nature of duty."},{"Title":"Honorable Warrior: General Harold K.

Johnson and the Ethics of Command (Modern War Studies)","review":"I'm four-fifths done with &quot;Honorable Warrior&quot;, and about the same amount done with &quot;A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam&quot; by Neil Sheehan, and I'm terribly afraid, in fact, I'm pretty sure (I looked at the ending) that Mr. Sorley will duck the question that his subject could not duck..quite. That question was whether the military effort was going to work. General Johnson was averse to Phoenix-style assassination programs and to unrestrained bombardment. He thought local policing and interdiction of infiltration would answer things. This assumes (on his part) that the South Vietnamese regime would use this breathing space to flourish in democracy, rectitude, and mercy. Why did he assume this? His cherished analytical principle, Mr. Sorley informs us, was &quot;challenge the assertion&quot;. For instance, the General tore to shreds, anaylytically, one of McNamara's &quot;Systems Anaylysis&quot; monster-reports on Vietnam by pointing out that it had been cobbled together out of twenty-eight other analyses, each of which had different assumptions. As my history professor would say, &quot;scissors and paste&quot; or &quot;daisy-chaining&quot; does not good history make. My question is whether the General was rigorous enough in evaluating his own thought, his own assertions. The question is directed to Mr. Sorley, who says in his conclusion that the war was actually against mere &quot;surrogates&quot; of China and the Soviet Union. By that logic, we would have been morally authorized to kill every Vietnamese, since they were only inert instruments of the source of the belligerency. Trying to look through Mr. Sorley's somewhat blood-misted eyes, I take seriously his suggestion that the General was often tempted to quit and that he had paralyzing doubts about the war, which he justified to himself as bringing freedom to the people of Vietnam. Did the General end up believing, in the words of the U.S. officer so often quoted, that in order to save the nation of Vietnam it was necessary to destroy it? No, I hear his fans shouting, he was too moral! But was he moral enough to realize that it was immoral to police and interdict a viable political regime (sponsored by Ho) to death in the hope that another regime would spring up from the morally toxic swamps of Saigon? (This concept of viability of regime is the standard upheld by so-called international law in determining which of competing regimes deserves recognition). Could he make that leap of faith in good conscience? Or did he in fact drape his moral doubt in words like &quot;anti-communism&quot; and &quot;security&quot;, and leave it to someone else to decide if the whole thing was going to work? My suggestion for a moral lesson is that if you're called on to do something by someone who is farther from the action than you are to the extent that you're confident that you know more about the moral questions raised than your &quot;superior&quot; does, so much so that your sense of obligation to this superior evaporates, you cannot dress up your feeling of emptiness with some slogans, much less with the claim that you're only following orders, but must do something to rectify the malfeasance of your own superiors. In the words of Matthew Ridgeway, words that the Army put on a leadership poster ten years ago, &quot;If you are confident that your orders are mistaken, you are obliged to attempt to fix things.&quot; Not his exact words. I don't think he just said to bring it to the attention of your superiors. I suppose that leaves disobedience, resignation, and forceful advocacy. It is the lack of forceful advocacy by the General, and lack of concern by Mr. Sorley over the General's lack of forceful advocacy, that makes the life of the General, as Mr. Sorley tells it, only worth four stars out of five. I mean, you can't just blame everything on General Westmoreland, especially when he worked for General Johnson, traditions of lattitude for field commanders notwithstanding. Alright, how do I know the General wasn't forceful enough since I haven't finished the book? He could have ordered Westmoreland to fix things: whatever, invade Laos, install U.S. commanders in all ARVN units, take over the administration of the South Vietnamese civil population, which is the same as taking over the Saigon regime, whatever it would have taken in his mind to win (&quot;the freedom of the South Vietnamese people&quot;, remember) and then suffered the consequences. The President could have fired him. The fact that the President didn't fire him is proof to me that he didn't advocate forcefully enough. That is crude of me. Romantic. Duel at Diablo. End of story. Soul intact. It is so easy in a bureaucracy to adopt the attitude of &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;, but they pay you and respect you for doing hard things. In the words of the New Testament parable, we are worthless servants when we only do what we are told. If the General had no doubt that his conduct of the war -- he was plumb in the middle of the road of the chain of command, it was on his watch -- was ethical, we cannot second-guess God's judgment of him. To quote the previous reviewer, however, it seems that he thought that his job was to follow orders. That is not ethical. That is, in the final analysis, stupid. We don't creates lines of authority to multiply our stupidity, but to diminish it. If, when you give somebody an order, there is no implicit &quot;or am I being stupid&quot; which they feel free to confirm or deny, you are not getting the best out of that subordinate and the people are not getting its best out of you. This applies the more so, the higher up you go. Hey?"},{"Title":"Lord of Thunder","review":"Lord of Thunder (1962) is the second SF novel in the Beast Master series, followingThe Beast Masteritself. In the previous volume, Hosteen Storm rescues Brad and Logan Quade from the Nitras, defeats the Xik aper Coll Bister, and is taken to the main Quade ranch to recover from his wounds. At last he confronts Brad Quade, only to discover that his grandfather, Na-Ta-Hay, had lied to him. His mother had married Brad Quade and Logan Quade was his half-brother. Storm has found another home.In this novel, Storm is returning to the Quade place after staking his claim within the Peaks country. It's the Big Dry season, so nobody rides during the heat of the day. He takes shelter in a cave and finds the Norbie warrior Gorgol there before him.Gorgol is working for Storm this season. Storm expected him to be back at the Quade spread watching the horses. After explaining that he had left the horses in the Quade corral, Gorgol tells Storm that all the natives have been recalled to their clans for medicine talk.Storm knows better than to probe too deeply into medicine talk, but he is quite puzzled by the recalls. Usually the Norbies urge warriors to hire on with the settlers during Big Dry season, if for no other reason than to reduce the number of thirsty mouths drinking scarce water. Of course, these warriors are commonly paid in horses and the clans are always short of the offworld creatures.This recall puts a cramp in a lot of plans. Most settlers in the Peaks will be short of riders with the natives gone back to their clans. After the land cools down, Gorgol heads into the mountains and Storm rides toward the Quade ranch.Upon returning home, Storm finds Brad Quade hosting an impromptu settler conclave on the native recall. Rig Dumaroy is busily running his mouth about native uprisings, although he is finding fewer settlers willing to listen to him after his mistaken accusations during the Xik attacks a few months ago. Brad Quade, the Lancin brothers and a few other level-headed settlers are more concerned about the shortage of riders.During this conversation, Storm learns that the natives have moved out of their home ranges and are heading into the Blue range. No settler knows much about that section of mountains, although Logan -- Storm's half-brother -- probably knows more than anyone else. But Logan has not returned from his visit with the Shosonna clan and is probably traveling with them toward the meeting.When The conclave ends, Brad Quade points out that Storm has a claim to file. The next day, he should take a 'copter into Galwadi to make his claim and then he can find some extra riders to hire. He could also try to meet with Kelson and learn what the Peace Officer knows about this strange native behavior.In this story, Storm only finds one man available for hire. After failing to reach Kelson, Storm treats himself to some long awaited offworld food. While he is ordering his favorites, Kelson shows up and then introduces a central worlds gentlehomo named Widders. It seems that this man's son has probably been stranded in a lifeboat within the Blue range. This situation would give Storm a very good excuse to go poking around in those mountains, but his chances of surviving would be extremely slim.When Widders asks him to lead an expedition to find his son, Storm refuses the request and returns to his home. After Storm completes his report to Brad Quade, Kelson shows up with Widders in tow. Gentlehomo Widders has heard that Quade has a son who is familiar with the natives and their mountains. Pointing out that he has two sons, one of whom has already refused him, Quade tells Widders that Logan is not presently available.Widders makes another appeal and this time mentions a few things that he will be able to furnish to make the excursion more likely to succeed. Quade, Kelson and Storm start making some detailed plans based on the additional equipment and supplies. Storm clearly states that he will go alone until he can find native guides and that only he will decide whether to go the whole route. Widders agrees to these terms.This story involves the ever present risk of inciting the Arzor natives into an uprising. Naturally, Widders has no intentions of following Storm's instructions and his casual treatment of native sensibilities causes all kinds of troubles. At the same time, another influence is stirring up the natives. Will the Patrol have to occupy the planet to put down a native insurrection? Why should Widders care as long as he gets his son back?Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of alien psychology, colonial politics, and exotic technology.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Lord of Thunder","review":"The sequel to _Beast Master_, this book is a good continuation of that storyline. Picking up several months after Storm and his team dealt with the alien presence on the planet Arzor, Storm's new home, this book starts out with a mysterious migration of the native Norbies. They are gathering in large numbers, ignoring old enmities with other tribes, and traveling to forbidden regions. Storm is engaged to search for a crashed human ship at the same time, in the forbidden regions. What follows deals less with the environment of Arzor than in _Beast Master_, focusing instead on the hidden caverns of the ancient race which once peopled this planet. There were ruins of their presence on Arzor in the previous book, but nothing like that which is found in this one. Storm endures a great deal in his attempt to locate potential survivors of the crash, including facing angry Norbies and dealing with hostile creatures and machinery.I like this book, as with the first one, because those parts which are not understood by the characters are not described. It is really a 3rd person limited POV, and very well done by the Grand Master Norton. Given that after a 40 year separation Norton has produced some new Beast Master stories, I felt a review of the original stories were in order. On a side note, the story as presented in these two books is far superior to that of the movies and TV show. These are much more of a sf focus, with some mystical elements (primarily Amerindian and Norbie &quot;medicine&quot;) added in very nicely."},{"Title":"Lord of Thunder","review":"This book is a continuation of the Beast Master. I was only able to read it 2 or 3 times and now I cannot find a copy. The book continues with the adventures of Storm and his companions.

I also enjoyed the conclusion with the final battle between the Nitra, Storm, and the Lord of Thunder. I hope that there are further books in the series."},{"Title":"Lord of Thunder","review":"\\"The Lord of Thunder\\" (1962) by Andre Norton (1912-2005) is a sequel to her novel \\"The Beast Hunter\\" (1959). Interested readers may ask is it absolutely necessary that I read \\"Beast Hunter\\" before \\"Lord of Thunder\\"? If you can you should. \\"Beast Hunters\\" provided a substantial amount of background information concerning the central characters that play important roles in \\"Lord of Thunder\\". Is it absolute necessary? - no, but it would be very helpful nonetheless.In \\"The Beast Hunter\\" the readers become acquainted with Hosteen Storm a Navajo Indian and cashiered veteran of an interstellar war and his exploits on the planet Arzor dealing with enemy aliens, exploring an ancient civilization and befriending the humanoid intelligent natives called the Norbies.Most of the story in \\"Lord of Thunder\\" concerns a quest to find a missing person and then a crazed earthman through seemingly endless underground caverns full of mysterious artifacts, flashing lights and humming machines. Whenever Hosteen Storm appears to be trapped and about to face his demise a friend, native, constable or one of his trained beast shows up to rescue him and keep the plot moving.I am a great admirer of Andre Norton books but I was disappointed with \\"Lord of Thunder\\". The narrative appeared to be forced, paragraphs were greatly extended with generic descriptions of traveling throught gloomy caves adding little to the story and, honestly, I found myself skimming down pages - something I have never done before reading a story by Ms Norton. \\"Lord of Thunder\\" while utilizing the same characters adds very little to the fascinating story of Arzor it's history or it's peoples.

Ascension is the story of Franklin Parric's grandson Orion Parric, son of Dorin Parric and brother to Mathew Parric.Rear cover synopsis:\\"Dorrin [sic] Parric is dead, and his son Orion has sworn to avenge him. But first he must run a gauntlet of human assassins, blood-crazed androids and aging, paranoid dictators. Petty tyrants rule the few straggling settlements where mankind holds out against the darkness. Time and again Parric eludes the strange traps set for him by the forces of decay. But his luck is running out. At the end of the road is Philayork, a bewildering metropolis wracked by far and evil. Whatever had killed Orion Parric's father was also waiting for him in the ruins of earth's last great city.\\"The Shadow of Alpha set the stage of the apocalypse, where humans died by the millions and the human that did live were hunted down by the crazed androids, which the Plaguewind altered. The only sanctuaries left to humans were force-field reinforced domes and the remote enclaves of well-armed Hunters. Orion's father Dorin set upon a mission with William Dix (the same unaffected android friend of Franklin Parric) to visit the once grand city of Philayork to see what was left of humanity and its once miraculous technologies. However, Franklin was killed in mysterious circumstances and was carried back to Central by Dix. Orion has taken it upon himself to seek out the same city and murder the man who spilled his father's blood.The synopsis is a tad extreme, highlighting the action sequences when in reality, the novel is written with an interest in exploring what has happened to the world outside the protective dome of Central. Grant writes of how nature has recovered from the Plaguewind and how humans must herd flocks of birds to their fields of grain in order to control the insects. He also explores the ruins of Philayork, where windows have been shattered, moving walkways have been torn up, stores of food have been ransacked, and heaps of clothing mark the place where people have died in situ. While his descriptions aren't as vivid as what my imagination has concocted for the year 2247 A.D., he gets the message across that the world has taken an ugly turn for the worse. While there aren't' many \\"human assassins\\" andblood-crazed androids\\" found in the 220 pages, the action which does take place is often the duck-and-shoot kind of action... nothing worth mentioning.Characterization was weak in the prior novel, but Grant seems to have taken in interest in developing his characters in Ascension. Orion is a bitter man, always on the edge of an angry outburst whose rage sometimes gets the bets of him: \\"The dispassionate manner of their conversation grated, an impersonal abrasive that made him want to grab for the nearest tree and yank it out by the roots.\\" (25) He also has an internal sense of sarcasm which grates him into stinging internal dialogue: \\"...no supplications for libations for Parric's godlike intrusion. The voice was dead. Rising from a dead space.\\" (21)One problem with The Shadow of Alpha was that the spaceship Alpha was only ever mentioned in passing; no detail of the mission or the importance ever cropping up. Alpha became a symbol of hope for Franklin Parric, establishing within himself a need to resurrect humanity for the return of the crew of Alpha. Likewise, Orion Parric maintains Franklin's desire to rid humanity of its barbarous ways so that the crew of Alpha can return to a civilized society. While this symbol of hope continues, so does the absence of any explanation of what Alpha is or what it was sent out to do.Ascension is an interesting contrast to The Shadow of Alpha but, like its predecessor, it may have set a pretty good scene but failed to really create a plot which ties in directly to the lumbering giant which is mentioned in both books- The Alpha. A series isn't really a series when sequences, characters, and objects are chronologically separated and nearly forgotten about. Book three of the series (according to ISFDB) is also the last...Legion. How will Grant organize his sequences, characters, and objects to culminate into a finale?"},{"Title":"To Love a Cowboy (Silhouette Intimate Moments, No. 834) (Harlequin Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"Rafe Kellard is a bronc busting, bull riding cowboy -- Uh-huh! one nasty bull tried to do him in.

Not as hard core as Ron Silliman's In the American Tree, it manages to successfully convey the beauty &amp; lyricism of a difficult genre. The book is split into 4 &quot;gatherings&quot;. Starting (surprisingly) with the Objectivists (Reznikoff, Rakosi, Niedecker, Zukofsky &amp; Oppen), whom the editor argues were seminal, along with Olson (who is also included in the first gathering), in inspiring the poetry from the younger authors. (There is no William's or Pound, mainly because the anthology starts at 1960, &amp; also because their work is so well known anyway.) The second gathering is mainly the New York School - Guest, O'Hara, Ashbery etc, ending (each gathering is organized chronologically) with Alice Notley &amp; Diane Ward. The third gathering concentrates on language &amp; reader - starting with Creeley (whom Messerli sensibly pulls away from his Black mountain colleagues with whom he never really stylistically belonged), thru Hannah Weiner, Bromige, Coolidge, Hejinian, Grenier &amp; most of the well known LANGUAGE poets. The forth gathering is poets associated with performance, voice etc - Cage, McLow, Elmslie, Rothenberg, thru Bruce Andrews, Steve Benson to Carla Harryman (the last poet in the book). Each poet is well represented - everyone having at least 10 pages &amp; some more than 30, &amp; each poet was consulted by Messerli with his list of what he considered their most important work, &amp; a compromise was met with them. There are some glaring ommissions - the most obvious being a section from Zukofsky's A-23 which proved so influential &amp; groundbreaking. But despite this this book is a giant in every way. Messerli is probably the person best equipped to edit such a work, having published almost all the poets represented with his Sun &amp; Moon Press. The poetry is enormously various, but all of it is GOOD &amp; some of it is truly GREAT. I can't recommend the book enough."},{"Title":"From the Other Side of the Century: A New American Poetry 1960-1990 (Sun & Moon Classics)","review":"book in perfect conditionthank youi was looking for this book long time"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"We've read this book to our son and he has really enjoyed it.

I can understand what they are saying, but I think what you have to keep in mind is that while we are here on earth and in our day and age we do not physically see Christ. He was once here walking and living on this earth, but He is now in heaven. He uses other means now to maintain a personal relationship with us. For example, we can know Christ through His word and through prayer. Just as in the book, He often also sends other Christians along in our life to help us and encourage us. This book is a good example of a walk of faith. We can't see and physically touch Christ right now, but when we are in heaven we WILL see Him just as Bunyan talks about in the book.

[July note: Penguin is again listing it as current!] Most of my comments are specific to this edition, and a few other closely related text editions.Back in, I think, the early 1970s, I was taking a course in seventeenth century English literature, and encountered a library copy of Roger Sharrock's 1960 Oxford English Texts edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come,\\" an immensely impressive editorial treatment of the famous allegory of the Christian life, but fairly expensive, and, I think, out of print. (There was a revised printing in 1975; it seems to be out of print for now.) Sharrock's edition was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey, but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies. It returned for its base text for Part One to the first edition of 1678, drawing on the second (also 1678) and third (1679) editions only for Bunyan's additions to the text. (For Part Two, published in 1684, only its first printing has any claim to authority.)This decision was based on the recognition that printing house practices had rather quickly denatured Bunyan's highly personal, colloquial, and even regional (Bedfordshire) English, turning it into what typesetters thought of as acceptably genteel, beginning as early as the second printing. The progress of textual corruption had continued through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite several attempts to provide scholarly editions. Close study of Bunyan's other, rather extensive, and generally less frequently printed, writings, helped to establish a clearer idea of his use of English, as against that of the printers. For the first time in centuries, Bunyan's most famous book was available in (almost) exactly his own words, as nearly as possible as he had set it on paper. Since Bunyan's vocabulary and style of punctuation reflected the speaking voice of an accomplished preacher (the \\"crime\\" for which he was imprisoned for twelve years), this almost amounted to restoring the correct meter to a poem long printed with incorrect versification.Fortunately, or so it seemed, Roger Sharrock had also edited a very slightly modernized text, without the full critical apparatus and notes, for the Penguin English Library (1965). It was not readily available at the campus bookstore, and the student-oriented stores in the area were already being replaced by chains, but there was a religious --- excuse me, a *Christian* -- bookstore in the neighborhood, which had a good selection, and generally well-informed and helpful clerks. I was bemused to find an unfamiliar member of the staff, who was quite enthusiastic about the King James Bible, in what is in fact Elizabethan English, but dubious about an unmodernized version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" The book's language is almost a century closer to us in time, and it claims only to be the work of a \\"Tinker and a Poor Man\\" (as the title of American editions of Christopher Hill's biography reminds us), not divine revelation. Still, she assured me, an original-spelling edition of it would be just \\"too hard to understand.\\" Surely I would be better off with one of the many nice adaptations or retellings? See the children's' section. (I had a sudden image of a special angel assigned to each and every copy of the King James Version, to supply linguistic information to its readers, lest they go astray over the unfamiliar words and grammar, but decided not to confide this to the clerk, who was trying to be helpful.)In the end, it turned out the Penguin English Library edition was unavailable; I eventually found a used copy, years too late for the course, but worth having. I don't find Bunyan an edifying guide to the religious life (see below), but he is in many ways an appealing human being, and a remarkable writer, the author of the last great medieval allegories in English, which are at the same time among the first modern novels.In 1986, however, Penguin reissued Sharrock's popular edition in the Penguin Classics series, and even gave it a revised edition in 1987, as well as a splendid new cover (from William Blake's illustration of a scene in the book). In the meantime, the Oxford text as such formed the basis of a World's Classics edition, edited by H.N. Keeble, with a new introduction, helpful notes, and a chronology of Bunyan's life based on the latest research (1984). That edition went through a number of printings, and was reissued in slightly larger format when the World's Classics line was revamped as the Oxford World's Classics. Keeble's edition has just been replaced by a new version by W.R. Owens, likewise following Sharrock's critical edition, but restoring a few more (specified) first edition readings which, in Owens' view, make sense as they stand; I have reviewed this last separately.It should be made clear that I have written this review as a reader with an interest in seventeenth century English literature and history, and a concern with the combination of realism of style and incident with a narrative of marvels and adventures. As far as what John Bunyan considered most important about his work, I am probably a less than ideal reader. Although coming from a secularized Jewish background instead of an Orthodox one, I tend to agree with David Daiches that the Pilgrim, Christian, seems to spend far too much time worrying \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" in the World to Come, and too little asking \\"What ought I to do?\\" in this world. Still, I find Bunyan's sincerity, and willingness to work out the implications of his theology, impressive in their own right."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys.

But diving into each of the characters and their virtues/vices has kept me up late since I received the book. Lots of personal questioning, lots of views that I hadn't considered. I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"I can't pretend to understand the historical milieu from which this book arose, or the theological underpinnings that led to its writing. Instead, I come to the book as a modern and secular reader, trying to learn more about Western thought and literary tradition. Despite its archaic language and sometimes tedious preaching, I found my time well rewarded. The familiar aspects showed me as much as the unfamiliar ones did.Among the unfamiliar ones, I was struck by the pervasiveness of the religious sense in Bunyan's world. Seemingly ever action was seen in terms defined by religion. It almost appeared as the sole source of light in that world, without which nothing could really be seen, and tinting everything with its own color. Likewise, the literary tool of \\"morality play\\" naming sounded odd to my modern ear. Writers still use names in many ways, but characters names like Hope, Atheist, or Mr. Money-Love come across as heavy handed. Perhaps that mechanism helped in a semi-literate society, where subtlety of reading could not be counted on; perhaps it acted as a short-hand, invoking values shared consensually across a fairly homogeneous society.More familiar aspects of the storytelling also struck me, possibly because of their contrast to the ones no longer used in modern writing. Christian's journey, for example, has been copied repeatedly and in many variations by writers ever since. Not just allegory for seeking, it provides a natural way to expose the protagonist to a series of other characters and challenges, and foreshadows some destination for the story. The \\"journey\\" has been refined over the years since Bunyan and rarely takes such a central spot in more recent texts, but I enjoyed seeing it in this relatively pure and primitive form.In itself, 'The Pilgrim's Progress' holds only slight interest for me. As an historical document, reflecting the religious sense of its time, and as an ancestor of modern writing, I found it fascinating.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"This book was packaged in a plastic rap which was very nice as I am giving it as a gift to my Pastor and his wife.

Rich in Biblical theology, it is the best-known allegory of the Christian's life. It tells the story of a pilgrim named Christian as he walked a journey from the City of Destruction (where he lived before his conversion) to the Celestial City (an allegory of heaven), sharing with us the many challenges, obstacles, comfort, and encouragement Christian encountered in his long journey. This book reminds me that I, too, am walking in a similar spiritual journey as Christian did.When I read of Christian passing through the Valley of Humility and falling into the Swamp of Despondence, I'm reminded of those times when I, too, was in such a swamp and valley, and how God graciously used those trials to humble, comfort, and rescue me.The Pilgrim's Progress reminds me and encourages me with the Biblical promise that regardless of what deep valleys I may be in, whatever swamps I fall into, whatever rough roads I tread, whatever rivers to ford, or whichever steep hills I may be climbing in my own life journey ... my Guide is ever watchful, my Deliverer unfailing, and He is indeed faithful in keeping and persevering all of His elect in the faith till they arrive to their final destination at the Celestial City--that glorious, everlasting City that is so different than the one I've traveled from and \\"built not by the hands of man.\\" Every Christian can learn and be encouraged from the Biblical doctrines taught in this story."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"I give this book away every chance i get $$$ enough to do so.The first time i read it i was amazed at how i was on this adventure and it was changing the way i thought of things.and how it influenced my dreams was amazing as well; being that the story is a telling of a dream, made me even more in wonder.than i read it a second time and could not believe the amount of detail that comes out of this little book. if you know your Scriptures you will see them jump off the pages and here they are with visual application.If you don't know Scripture and find it hard to understand what The Bible is saying, here is a story that puts it in perspective.I love this book and can now understand why it has been so poplular for so many many years.i will read this book again and again as medicine for my soulHigh five for John Bunjan"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"This past year in school my class studied &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;.

Perhaps a bit too widely. While the book itself is stunning, having seen, heard, or read so many attempts to imitate it, I found that the original effect of the story was lessened for me.By all means, this book should be read -- it is in itself a great work of literature, and it is a prime example of Puritan thought. Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story!

The price was very competitive and it made a great gift to a dear friend."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is without a doubt one of the true classics of time--an allegory that has remained a best seller years after its introduction.My first introduction to Pilgrim's Progress was as a child in parochial school. I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way. An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life. The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form. Don't distort the beauty of the old English language with a modern translation."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"In this classic work, John Bunyan paints a detailed picture of the Christian life/walk, giving true-to-life insights and experiences. The despair, sorrows, trials and temptations that a believer may face are depicted in an allegorical manner, as well as the hope, joy, and salvation found in Jesus Christ. The main character Christian (once named Graceless) sets out on a lifelong journey from the City of Destruction, where his family disowned him, and encounters many persons and difficulties along the way to the Celestial City (heaven). The characters he meets are given names that reflect their mindset or what temptation they bring. At times he stumbles and at times he perseveres, but all by the grace of God. The second portion of the book tells of the conversion and subsequent sojourn of the wife (Christiana) and children of Christian. The discussions of Christian in the first part and Christiana and her companions in the second part are very interesting, as they defend their faith and explain their purpose to those they meet along the way. The book is quite different from your ordinary novel, and has many interesting words of wisdom for the Christian life. Readers should be aware that some of the language is antiquated and has unfamiliar usages, so its a little bit of an adjustment to read."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"A letter to Marvin Minsky about this book:I urge you tolook at a remarkable book by the English Puritain John Bunyan(1628-1688), \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\", which is one of the great evangelical Christian classics, though clearly that is not why it interests me and should interest you (although I AM interested in the puzzle that is the religious sense, which even the irreligious feel, and this book can give remarkable insight into that as well).Rather its fascination lies in the pilgrimage it depicts, or in the fact that human traits, vices, virtues, &amp;c are PERSONIFIED as particular individuals who are their living and speaking epitome, and who are encountered along the way in revealing situations.Bunyan's hero is appropriately named Christian. Someone once wrote that \\"Christian's journey is timeless as he travels from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, meeting such characters as Pliable, Talkative, Giant Despair, Evangelist, Worldly-Wiseman, Faithful, Ignorance and Hopeful.\\"At first this personification is merely amusing, even a bit annoying (as caricatures or truly stereotypical people can be); but after a while I found myself enthralled because I realized that the effect of this odd literary device was to give unmatched insight into the nature of such traits. The force of the whole thing comes from the fact that one journeys about in - literally INSIDE of - what is both a comprehensive and finite moral and psychological landscape (a \\"psycho-topography\\"), very much as though one were INSIDE the human mind and your \\"Society of the Mind\\" was embodied in the set of actors. This is more or less the opposite or an inversion of the \`real world' of real people, who merely SHARE those attributes or of whom the attributes are merely PIECES; in \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", by contrast, the attributes are confined in their occurrence to the actors who are their entire, unique, pure, and active embodiment, and humanness, to be recognized at all, has to be rederived or mentally reconstructed from the essential types.The effect, for me, was something like experiencing a multidimensional scaling map that depicts the space of the set of human personality types, by being injected directly - mentally and bodily - into it by means of virtual reality technology.So Bunyan's book has something of the interest to a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher that Edwin Abbot's \\"Flatland\\" has to a mathematician.I don't mean to overpraise \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", of course; it was written for theological rather than scientific purposes, and has conspicuous limitations for that reason. But its interest to a student of the mind who looks at it at from the right point of view can be profound.- Patrick Gunkel"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Pilgrim's Progress. Despite the fact that I usually like all sorts of folk art and corny stuff in general, this ham-fisted allegory just seemed too weird---too kooky.Yet Edward de Souza's *reading* of the text turns the thing into a work of art. I'm a voracious consumer of audiobooks, and I have to say that De Souza's performance for Naxos here is the best I've ever heard. The dramatic pause---almost as if perhaps he's thinking up the name---just before he tells you the goofy name of each new character, turns what I used to consider the most annoying aspect of the book, into the most charming instead. Bravo.And it's not just this book. From the opening strains of the fine, authentic 17th century music, you're at once made to know that Naxos has thankfully brought the art of the audiobook out of the dark ages.

I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, &quot;What shall I do?&quot;In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: &quot;O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.&quot; -John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's ProgressPilgrim's Progress, though hardly anyone reads it anymore, is one of the best-selling books of all time and was enormously influential for several centuries; in fact, we are still living under its influence. However, like Dante's Inferno, it has passed out of favor in recent years, not because of its pedantry and antiquated style, but because much of its message is simply too harsh for the tenor of our times.The narrator relates an allegorical dream in which Christian, having received knowledge that his city is to be destroyed by heavenly fire, leaves his wife and children and sets out on a quest for salvation which takes him to the Celestial City. In the Second Book, his wife, Christiana, and the kids follow. In their travels, they must pass through such places as The Valley of Humiliation and Death, the Slough of Despond, and Vanity Fair, and must resist the blandishments of folks like Ignorance and Hypocrisy. Ultimately, all of the pilgrims do make it and enter through the gates of the City, saved by their unbroken faith.It's easy to see why the story was so popular. First, it's an exciting tale of adventure; one reviewer aptly refers to Christian as a Protestant Indiana Jones. Second, it is triumphant, with Christian overcoming all the odds to arrive in the Celestial City, nor is there ever any real doubt that he is going to succeed. Bunyan, who had become a Baptist preacher after a lifetime of tormenting dreams and struggles with doubt, wrote the story (and an autobiography) during two periods of imprisonment, one lasting twelve years, for holding services that were not in accordance with the teachings of the Church of England. Especially in light of the author's circumstances, he expresses a bold certainty that Christian's path is in fact the path to Heaven.But it's here that we see why the book is no longer popular. Start with the idea that God's judgment is coming and that most of us face the fire this time. Then add in the concept that Christian's are embattled by temptation and the sinners around them, and that many will succumb. Top it all off with the notion that it is only by following in the Pilgrim's footsteps that you can attain salvation, that everyone else is doomed to Hell. These aren't exactly the humanistic, inclusive, permissive doctrines which inform modernity are they ?But there's one crucial tenet of Nonconformist Protestantism which Pilgrim's Progress captures and which is both the religion's greatest gift and worst legacy to modern times : the primacy of the individual. John Bunyan experienced the struggle for faith as an intensely personal battle and his protagonist, Christian, likewise makes his pilgrimage alone. It shocks our sensibilities for him to abandon his family and friends to their fiery fate, but such is his desire for &quot;eternal life&quot; that abandon them he does. Here lies the two-edged sword of the radical Protestantism of the 16th and 17th centuries, for if it is true (and I think it is) that this emphasis on the individual in religious matters also spread to economic and political matters and brought about the concurrent rise of protestantism, democracy and capitalism, it is also true that this emphasis on the individual, if unchecked by morality, ethics and institutions, leads to the complete atomization of society and a cult of selfishness which undermines the very free society that it creates. Personal freedom has been the greatest engine of progress that mankind has ever known, and it has been generated in large part by the Protestantism of which Bunyan was a part; but that same freedom, if torn loose from the laws, responsibilities and moral precepts out of which it grew, becomes mere license. The individual, though paramount, is not sufficient. Freedom, though vital, is not everything. In particular, extreme individualism and liberty are inadequate ideals around which to build a civil society.Christian's pilgrimage conveys the message that faith is the most important quality we bring to our approach towards God. As theology, this doctrine of &quot;salvation through faith alone&quot; is harmless enough, and for all we know it is absolutely correct. But in organizing Man's affairs here on Earth, we have to emphasize works as well as faith--works which manifest themselves in following the law, accepting one's responsibilities to one's fellow men, and behaving morally. Otherwise, come Judgment Day, God won't have to smite us with heavenly fire, we'll have destroyed ourselves already.Bunyan's book, besides being a rousing adventure tale, should be read both because of the influence it has exerted in shaping the modern world and because the issues it raises, of individualism and the like, are still just as important today, when they have gone to far, as they were when he was writing, and they had not come far enough. It is a brilliant, though flawed, work, one who's impact on English Literature and Western Culture can not be overstated.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is an important religious work, and should be read for that reason alone. It can be heavy going at times because of the moralizing and preaching that goes on throughout, but in spite of that there is a pretty good story here. Bunyan does preach and moralize, but he tells a darn good story too. This book is a product of the Protestant Reformation (published in 1684) just after the release of the King James Version of The Bible. The book is a religious and political allegory that symbolizes particular qualities and actions that should form the cornerstone of a Christian's life. It is a book about the hero Christian's flight from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City.

I am making plans right now to read it to my kids (right after we get through with the Chronicles of Narnia series). Though this book is old (published 1682) it is still one of the best descriptions of the Christian life available in either fiction or non-fiction form. The mental image that has stuck with me since the day I first read this book is of Christian coming up on the cross. &quot;He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do so, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad with a merry heart. He hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death. Then he stood still a while, to look and wonder, for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden.&quot; Unfortunately I have met some who won't read this book due to it's length and archaic language, and this is a great loss for them. Truly this is a book that warms the heart, rekindles our affection for Christ, and provides encouragement for us in our own journey to the Celestial City."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"I read this book about 8 years ago and still have it in memory. I cannnot recollect everything the book said vividly as at now. However, I still recollect what the story entails: a guy named christian who decided to leave his home to the celestial city. Basing all his actions on his strong faith in God, he went through a lot of up's and down's. I remember at one time he gave up and decided to return but he had a change of mind on the way and decided to pursue his journey. This is a great book and I'll encourage anyone who gets the opportunity to spend a little time reading it. It is highly inspirational."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"The Pilgrim's Progress is perhaps one of the most enduring allegories ever written; it has set the form for several more recent works (Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hind's Feet on High Places,\\" most notably). Bunyan's work was, for 18th century Christians, a companion to the Bible. The theology is a perfect example of Reformation thought, and were it not for a major flaw in the allegory, this work would be just about perfect.Setting out from the City of Destruction, Christian makes his journey throughout many perils and temptations, eventually finding his way (through death) to the Celestial City, to live with Christ and the saints. Along the way he learns much about evading temptation, and much practical advise on escaping sin is given to the reader through his discussions with travelling companions Faithful and Hopeful.However, by no means is Christian's journey representative of the Christian life as it is meant to be lived. Two stunning flaws stand out - first, that Christian in no way has any direct contact with Christ, until after his death; secondly, that Christian's life is devoid of relationships, outside of his two travelling companions.These two realities of the novel are startling, especially given that the Christian life is, first and foremost, relational-primarily, the Christian lives in relation to God, and then in relation to his neighbor. The Christian is not an island; he is to evade the world, but love those in it. Bunyan entirely misses this key point.Not only is the life Bunyan paints theologically incorrect, but it is entirely undesireable. It would be unimaginable for the Christian to live an entire life without, along the way, enjoying intimacy with Christ. Indeed, it is these moments of intimacy in spite of imperfection, which drive the Christian's soul onward. And it hardly needs mentioning that a Christian who, rather than reaching out and loving those around him, dismisses them as sinners and leaves them behind, is more reminiscent of Pharasitical hypocrisy, than Christian love.If one is looking for a challenging allegory, they need look no further than Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hinds Feet on High Places;\\" its protagonist, Much Afraid, is throughout her journey often in direct contact with Christ, and her redemption comes not through death, but through Christ making her able to go out into the world and love. Though \\"Hind's Feet\\" is not as theologically rich as Bunyan's allegory, its practical application is far more uplifting, hopeful, and correct."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"Other than the Bible this book has sold more copies than any other book in history.

Hendrickson Christian Classics. ISBN 156563134X. (Due to Amazon's tendency to post reviews of one edition of a book on another edition's product page, make sure you're viewing the product page for ISBN 156563134X.)This review focuses on the edition only, as the Pilgrim's Progress itself needs no review. The hardcover binding is handsome and tasteful, and looks well on the shelf. The typeface is very readable. It would in fact be a perfect inexpensive edition of a great allegory, if not for two relatively minor flaws.The first is no \\"Note on the Text,\\" or even the name of an editor (of this volume; I believe the series may have a general editor). From what edition was this text edited? What other editions were consulted? What is the history of the text of the Pilgrim's Progress? A Note on the Text wouldn't have been much trouble, and would have raised this edition up a notch or two.The second is the glossing of words such as \\"I trow\\" which the unknown editor considers difficult for modern English readers. Glossing should properly be done either with footnotes or in the margins, but in this edition, the glosses are in brackets immediately following the word glossed. E.g. \\". . . I trow [believe] . . .\\" I find the procedure annoying; other readers might find it helpful. And if glosses in brackets make a great work of English literature accessible to more readers, then I suppose the editor is justified.Other than that, it's an excellent edition. I commend Hendrickson for bringing out their line of \\"Christian Classics\\" in handsome bindings for very low prices."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"This is a Christian classic that is my favorite of all Christian works, bar none (except the bible of course). Possibly the second most published work outside the bible, it has been highly regarded by many, and was once widely taught in the schools.I wish my school had taught it. I first read this book a year ago, and I feel as if I've been deprived all my life.Pilgrim's Progress is written by a mature Christian, with insights that you will not get from anyone other than a mature Christian. Few people are capable of writing such a book.And the book shines with great quotes. Two of my favorites are:What means this? The Interpreter answered, 'This is Christ, who continually with the oil of grace maintains the work already begun in the heart, by the means of which, notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. AND IN THAT THOU sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire, this is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.And this: Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in this passionate speech. 'What a fool', quoth he, 'am I , thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty. I have a key in my bosom, called promise, that will (I am persuaded) open any lock in Doubting-Castle.'A key called promise.. great thoughts.There are many editions to Pilgrim's Progress, and I haven't found one I am happy with yet. Try to get one with the original wording, and the references to passages in the bible. Many versions delete the references to passages in the bible, which are, of course, the most useful to Christians and of least use to the world.ISBN 0140430040 appears to be true to the original wording of the classic. On the other hand, it lacks the biblical passage references, chapter divisions, and is a paperback with (quite frankly) an ugly cover.ISBN 0785242228 is a modern spelling version. However comparing it to the original shows that a lot more than just the spelling has been changed, and it doesn't read nearly as well. This is a nicely bound hardback with quality paper and chapter divisions, and some (but not all) the references to the bible. Character names are annoyingly abbrievated throughout book.ISBN 1557480990 is a children's version of Pilgrim's Progress. While a children's book, it remains true to the original and is worth getting. The illustrations are great.There are also many etext versions of Pilgrim's Progress that include the original text and all the references the text makes to passages in the bible.I recommend you take your time reading the book, and reflect on what is being said. Also, if you have a full version of this book, with the references to passages in the bible, you could use it as part of a bible study.BTW: the phrase 'vanity fair' comes from this book."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"In contrast to Dante, Bunyan fills his allegory with real people, not just stereotypes - or even archetypes. Though his characters have names like &quot;Honest,&quot; &quot;Feeble-mind,&quot; and &quot;Ignorance,&quot; they come across as real people given a nickname. The names apply to some extent, of course, but not to the point of making caricatures out of the characters.This volume contains parts I and II of Pilgrim's progress. The first part concerns the journey of a pilgrim named &quot;Christian,&quot; while the second describes the journey of his wife, Christiana. Both start from the City of Destruction and both encounter many of the same obstacles - the Slough of Despond, the Vanity Fair, the Castle Doubt - before reaching the gates of the Celestial City. Other than that, their journeys are rather different, for Christian travels on his own, with a bit of help here and there, and with one or another traveling companion, but his progress is almost entirely his own. Christiana, by contrast, travels as part of an ever growing company, who support one another and who are defended by one or two powerful champions.You never lose sight of the allegory, but this work is not a mere tract. The story itself and the characters entertain - even today."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"This book is essential reading for any Christian who wants to &quot;fight the good fight&quot; and to finish the race well. The excellent thing about this book is that it helps to give the big picture of life and what small events that happen in life can mean in the scheme of things. The first book is about about a man named Christian (you can see that the allegory isn't too hard to understand) and the things that happen to him after he starts on the journey on the road that leads to Heaven. We see how with each step and misstep along the way Christian has the option of continuing on the road to Heaven or giving up, and that helps us readers to realize that the same thing is true in our own lives. Another thing I really like about this book is how even when Christian totally goes off the path and in the wrong direction, God extends grace to him and he is able to return once again to the road to Heaven. The second book is about Christian's wife and family, and is also worth a read. One thing to note though, unless you are extremely comfortable reading old English (which I am not), it would be a good idea to get the modern language version instead of the original; because I read the original and there were several times when I thought about how I probably would prefer a more readable, modern translation. But whichever version you choose, make sure you read this book. It will help you to thoughtfully consider the here and now and also your final destination."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"Everyone should read Pilgrim's Progress. I read it for the first time last week. It is a book about a journey by the main character, Christian. It will also set you on your own journey through the Bible. John Bunyan writes that his allegory contains \\"nothing but sound and honest Gospel strains\\" and he includes references to Bible verses on nearly every page. I found it easy to understand Christian's journey by looking up these verses in my Bible as I came to them. By doing this, Bunyan was giving me fresh guidance because I had not read many of these verses recently. The references also allow me to keep Bunyan accountable for his words by comparing them to Scripture.Reading a book is a journey in itself, especially when it is read along with the Bible. It was also a literal journey for me because I was reading Pilgrim's Progress while on an airplane. In one sense I was meeting John Bunyan for the first time through his book while at the same time my flight from Los Angeles to London was taking me closer to Bunyan literally. On City Street in London is a cemetery called Bunhill Fields which is full of non-conformist preachers (Puritans and others who severed their ties from the Anglican church establish by Charles II). This is where John Bunyan is buried. Last night when I finished the book I came across a related quote by Charles Spurgeon:Go into Bunhill-fields, and stand by the memorial of John Bunyan, and you will say, \\"Ah! there lies the head that contained the brain which thought out that wondrous dream of the Pilgrim's Progress from the City of Destruction to the Better land. There lies the finger that wrote those wondrous lines which depict the story of him who came at last to the land Beulah, and waded through the flood, and entered into the celestial city.\\"So the day after finishing Pilgrim's Progress I took Spurgeon's advice and went into Bunhill Fields to see Bunyan's tomb (as well as John Owens). It is ironic that a man whose life and thoughts so greatly followed and conformed to the Word of God would receive the reputation of non-conformist. It's clear from the story where Bunyan's loyalties lie:Ignorance: What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?Christian: Such as agree with the Word of God.Ignorance: When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of God?Christian: When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves which the Word passes...Ignorance: What are good thoughts concerning God?Christian: Even, as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts of God do agree with what the Word saith of him.I appreciate Bunyan's regard for the truth. He clearly shows that we all are born into the City of Destruction wearing nothing but rags. He insists that the only road to the Celestrial City is through the Narrow Gate. He portrays the progression of our sanctification as a grueling journey, but one that is nevertheless fueled by God's grace. The true nature of worldliness is portrayed in Vanity Fayre, Satan's schemes are encountered and explained, and numerous actions, attitudes, and feelings are examined.Pilgrim's Progress is about the ultimate journey of life of pursuing a pure heart through faith in Jesus. By modeling faithfulness and perseverance, its characters illustrate the trials and tribulations by which God works His good in us. This book is a classic and I hope it remains in print for a long time so many more generations can learn and be encouraged by it."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"\\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" is a classic Christian text written by John Bunyan. Written in an allegorical format, the two-part story focuses first on \\"Christian\\", then on his wife \\"Christiana\\" and sons. Convicted of their own sinfulness, the characters set out on the journey to salvation at the Heavenly Gate. Characters such as \\"Honesty\\", \\"Great-Heart\\", and \\"Faithful\\" aid the pilgrims on their journey, whereas they face trials from the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.Getting through the book takes some work, less because of the story and more because of the depth of the allegory. Also, the dialogues between characters regarding salvation and righteousness often require a careful read. However, the story is exceptionally creative and thought-provoking, and the lessons that can be gleaned from it are timeless and worth the effort that needs to be expended. I recommend reading this one at least twice."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"John Bunyan confronts the world head on in his allegory The Pilgrim's Progress. Using the journey, conversations, actions, and interactions of his main character, Christian, Bunyan draws contrasts between true Christianity and the vast array of opposing philosophies and opinions offered by the rest of the world. Each contrast demonstrates the superiority of Christianity to the perspectives and beliefs of the fallen world.The story is told through the use of a narrative device. That devise is that of the narrator himself recounting his dream in which Christian makes his way to the Celestial City. The device serves to put the action of the story in context as well as a way break up the story into manageable segments. A key phrase often used in service of this device is: &quot;then I saw in my dream&quot;. The narrator's dream begins in the City of Destruction; which is Christian's homeland. As Christian Journeys to the celestial city, he encounters many people and trials. Each one is representative of various worldly, or otherworldly philosophies or beliefs.Bunyan has in all these encounters faced the problem of the truth of Christianity. If Christianity is true, how come there are all these alternative ideas in the world. Bunyan successfully exposes the weaknesses of the alternative ideas by refuting them one by one in the context of his pilgrimage allegory. Through his characters, Bunyan agrees with the apostle Paul. His argument is that our best weapon as Christians (once we have accepted Christ as our Savior and realized that only his grace is sufficient to save us) is to keep our eyes on God and the things of heaven (Colossians 3:2). All the arguments presented by the characters contrary to Christianity in this book add up to meaningless noise compared to the word of God and the truth expressed therein.Bunyan takes great care to steer clear of the idea that Christians are somehow intrinsically better than other people. He is careful to express that only God's grace working within them makes them capable of withstanding the trials of life. He demonstrates time and again that Christian suffers from the same weaknesses as normal people and is therefore prone to failure. It is only the love and assistance of God that allow Christian to reach his destination.God's grace and God's grace alone are sufficient to save Christian from the perils he encounters in his journey. Any time Christian attempts to do something of his own accord, his plans go horribly wrong and God must rescue him.The second part is about the travels and trials of Christian's wife: Christiana. It too is very instructive and entertaining.Pilgrim's Progress is insightful as an allegory. It is instructive and would be useful reading for anyone currently alive and making there way through our current sojourn or &quot;pilgrimage&quot; here on earth. Anyone going to the real Celestial City would profit from taking a glance at this book as they walk along the narrow path. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress (Hodder Christian Audio)","review":"Pilgrim's Progress has been accepted by the world as a classic piece of literature. However, just as Handel's Messiah is recognised as a magnificent work without people really appreciating the message it brings so Pilgrim's Progress can suffer from its own fame. Here we have the stories of believers moving towards heaven. They have ups and downs. They suffer pain and experience pleasure. All the time the christian reader is being led forward into experimental practical christian avenues. Despair, doubt, backsliding, the temptations of the world, helps from above and support from others on the Way all make this work so vital and relevant. Both parts, Christian's journey and Christiana's are wonderful in their own ways. For the past four years I have preferred the second part. Read it every year at least once.

I liked the characters' personalities and how they interacted with one another - it made the story more than just a suspenseful quest. The book also described the undead appropriately - not too graphic, but in good detail. It worked the suspense rather than the gruesome. Overall, this was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, Book 1","review":"Having never read any of Richard C. White's previous works, I have to say that not only was I fairly impressed with this book, I was thoroughly enthralled in the fantasy world of Gauntlet: Dark Legacy.Anyone who grew up in the 1980's and can remember the classic arcade games will surely appreciate this exciting fantasy story involving Morgan (the Wizard), Layla (the Valkyrie), Orlando (the Warrior) and Kore (the Elven Archer). I'll try not to spoil too much but I will say that this is a fast-paced action-packed story centering on the quartet, as they embark on a quest to gather the shards/runestones in order to banish the mysterious Dark Lord. The book reads like playing the video game; fast-moving and lots of fight scenes. White's detailed descriptions of the various back drops/environments (from a country town village being over-run by undead zombies, to claustrophobic mausoleums to ancient, primeval forests long abandoned by elves, etc.) are well done and his characterizations of all 4 characters are dead-on (the back-and-forth banter between Orlando and Layla got to be a little too much at times)...my favorite character being Kore the little-known elven maiden who succeeded Gauntlet's original *famous* elf, Questor. Poor Kore...for years, she took a lot of grief from die-hard old-school Gauntlet video gamers for being the elf who replaced Questor. Ever since Gauntlet: Legends, she was always living in Questor's shadow, never being able to live up to the legacy of Gauntlet's most famous Elven bowman...but here in this story, Kore comes into her own; she really steals the show here, with her keen elven senses and tracking/scouting skills and skill with the crossbow--she's easily the coolest character in the entire novel. We also see appearances from Sumner, a dryad, a crazed priest, and much more. Okay, I'm starting to give away too much.Anyways, my hope is that in &quot;Book 2&quot; or whatever the sequel to this novel will be, we see the introduction of the *other* 4 characters from Gauntlet: Dark Legacy (Phineas the Knight, the Sorceress, the Jester, and the Dwarf)...and wouldn't that be a kick if we saw cameos from the original Gauntlet heroes: Thor, Thyra, Questor, and Merlin?All in all, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, Book 1 - Paths of Evil is an awesome, fun read. Is it the greatest piece of literature ever? No...if you want that, go read the SILMARILLION. In fact, it's actually very simply written and pretty reader-friendly (as a Tolkien die-hard, this was a welcome vacation! :)). And no, it's not original; afterall, the &quot;wizard, warrior, elf, and valkryie party embarking on a quest&quot; scenario has been done to death in many a fantasy story and movie (or something similar to that scenario). The greatest appeal of this story is seeing the 4 characters COME TO LIFE via White's incredible characterizations. Morgan is the cool-headed leader who holds everthing together, Orlando is the hot-headed, dim-witted muscle head, Layla is the amazon who likes to taunt him, and Kore is the &quot;silent but deadly&quot; elf sniper who is still learning the nuances of human kind. Gauntlet is also an enjoyable, over-the-top fantasy-realm romp that any fan of the genre would like. If you're a fan of any of the Gauntlet video games, you should pick this book up. Heck, even if you're not a Gauntlet fan, but still like the fantasy/sword and sorcery genre of stories, you still should give it a try. A good first effort by Richard C. White.

I adore the Gauntlet franchise, and I'm not the snerky sort of fan who can never be satisfied with any adaptation - I knew any author was going to have to take liberties with the game to make it work as a book. I just wanted to see what somebody would do with this universe, wanted to see the requisite number of cute inside jokes referencing the games, and to see what someone would do with the not-too-deep Gauntlet universe. This book did none of those things well and was so full of technical errors I sometimes had to stop to think about what the author was trying to convey. I guarantee that right now there are Gauntlet fan fictions on the 'net which blow this away.This is the worst-edited novel I've ever read. The characters change into the anthropomorphic animal forms from Legends/Dark Legacy twice; the second time the author neglected to state that they had changed back and I gathered they'd reverted because the author started referring to the characters by name again instead of the names of the animal shapes. There are grammar, spelling, punctuation and logic errors everywhere. Once I just couldn't understand a passage after a few tries and gave up. Oh yes, and there was an ellipsis used... for dramatic effect!One of the characters mentioned in passing was named Nausicaa, which rightfully irritated my husband the Miyazaki buff; in all fairness, before ranting about this seemingly unoriginal name I did research and find that the name is from Greek mythology. That said, the name was spelled ''Naussica'' the second time it appeared. Other names changed spelling; some were obviously typos, some were inexplicable. The word ''lightening'' [bolt] was consistent throughout the book.The brightest spot in the book was an allusion to the change from the Elf class in the original Gauntlet games to the elven female Archer class. Not masterful, but appreciated. The author does appear to have a decent grasp of the games themselves, but the execution is boring and sometimes grindingly slow as the party sneaks around doing covert ops for hours or days. The only inside joke I was really looking forward to was the inevitable ''needs food badly'' line, and it was executed in a painfully unfunny way with the protagonists laughing scriptedly.The ending is so open-ended in anticipation of you buying the next books in the series that the first book feels like a waste. So far the protagonists have been a minor annoyance to the Larger Evil (TM) and gathered a small fraction of the game-based artifacts which they were directed to at the beginning of the book. As the book wore on and it became obvious the characters were only going to accomplish a small amount of their main goal, I got queasy thinking of how the series is pacing itself for a total of four books. Please, no. Have I mentioned that although nothing really got resolved and we receive barely any reward for our little trip other than the promise of more books, the book has TWO epilogues?Again, this book is at the level of a fanfic, and a bad fanfic at that. If you don't like Gauntlet, you'll probably hate this book. If you do like Gauntlet, you'll probably hate this book."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"John Dos Passos wrote three novels that are encapsulated by the title: &amp;quot;USA.&amp;quot;These novels are beautiful and sublime in their composition. While reading of some sad stories as well as some humorous ones, the readers is taken on a journey through the 1920's in America. We get a sense of what it was like then. His chapters begin and often end in a &amp;quot;NEWSREEL&amp;quot; imitation. In an age where we as readers have so much &amp;quot;bit&amp;quot; information flashed before our eyes, this mode works well at getting the snapshot ideas he is alluding to in the novels.Dos Passos is a genius of words-- I recommend taking this one to the beach, especially if you are an American city history buff."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I'm just rereading this book, after having read it once about ten years ago. I was very impressed then by its scope and depth, and I'm more impressed now by just how modern it was (for its time). If you compare it to Ulysses, you can clearly see similarities in style, though Dos Passos did go even further with his montage technique.The writing is a bit dated, and the themes are a bit out of date, but the similarities between that period - with unions and socialism rising in the US - and now, are striking. Dos Passos was a very political person, and a lot of what is in this book comes from his beliefs and experiences, but the realism of the characters and the modernist approach make it a must read."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I first came to Hunter Thompson because what teenager does not? Then I came to Charles Bukowski because what twenty year old can resist him. When I was in my thirties and my children came to me, I found John Fante. Thompson told me of Bukowski, Bukowski told me of Fante, Fante told me of Passos. Now I am grey and Hunter is dead, Bukowski is a T-shirt, and Fante lingers in my brain as a blinded diabetic whose eyes glimmered in ways his heart could not speak of. But Passos...Passos sits above them all. Sits above Celine even, sits above Vonnegu (whoa almost went too far there).I first came to John Passos because what fully grown American man does not? He wrote in the frenzy of contemporary modernity when commerce and technology was first beginning to nail the coffin lid down on freedom and movement.Great American storyteller who you may not have heard of, but who writes and is remembered."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Yes, it's unusual for an Amazon review to be prefaced by five stars, but U.S.A. deserves the celestial quintet. In these three books, Dos Passos created the first people's history of the United States, one that drives forward relentlessly, throws its characters all over the United States and brings the limits of the American Dream to public view -- for all to view painfully.Mac, Richard Ellsworth Savage, Ben Compton, Charley Anderson, Joe and Janey Williams -- by the end of &quot;The Big Money,&quot; these are people you know and feel for, people you hate to leave. They seem human in way that seems foreign to fiction of the 1930s.Read it yourself. The work is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

Intertwining history and fiction he takes his unusual style to new hights in this work.

It tells the tales of numerous individuals as they are buffeted by the currents of history around the early part of the 20th century. The format of the novels is uncoventional: interspersed among the passages about the characters in the book are news headlines, vignettes of historical figures and autobiographical sketches. There is no single plot, and there is no tidy ending for many of the charactersThe lives are consumed by the search for money, alcohol and sex. The most passionate people are the lrft-wing activists, who are presented sympathetically in their struggles for the working class. However, despite the exacting detail of the lives of the main players, conspicuously absent - except for brief instances - is love. Without this particular quality, the characters' lives seem purposeless.This is a monumental work, a great American novel. It is long, and there are many characters and details to remember; however it is well worth the effort to read."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"No doubt about it, the best part of these novels are the biographies that pop up every so often. Never before have the lives of Americans held so much power and majesty in my eyes"},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Before reading U.S.A. it would help to learn something about John Dos Passos. At the back of this edition is a Chronology which serves this purpose. The wealth of experience Dos Passos obtained in America and abroad, from his earliest childhood until his death in 1970, serves to illustrate that the trilogy was written with an air of authenticity and expertise that very few works of historical fiction possess. Knowing about the author's experiences before, during, and after WW1, his social and political leanings, his personal friendships, successes, and failures, help the reader not only in understanding the inspiration for some of the fictional characters in the books, but to understand the choices made (and biases for or against) the historical figures presented in fairly extensive vignettes that are interspersed between the fictional narratives throughout the work. It also aids in understanding the \\"Camera Eye\\" sections..personal musings of Dos Passos, in stream of consciousness style, about events that transpired in his own life during the time in question. He had his finger on the pulse of America during a critical time in it's history.U.S.A. was not originally intended as a trilogy, but as 3 individual novels..The 42nd Parallel, 1919, and The Big Money. The idea to publish the 3 books as a trilogy, was made by the author and his publisher in 1938 (2 years after The Big Money was published). The work in total covers the first 3 decades of the 20th century, spanning the period from just after the Spanish American War to the great Crash of 1929, with the 1st World War serving as a pivot point upon which much of the action revolves. Highlighted within this time frame are events and circumstances which affected Dos Passos deeply..not only the Great War in Europe where he drove an ambulance and witnessed first hand the horrors of war, but the growth of organized labor in the U.S. (Dos Passos was a supporter of the Wobblies), the Sacco and Vanzetti case (Dos Passos interviewed both and firmly believed in their innocence), the rise of Soviet Communism (which the author soon came to reject as it polluted the labor movement), and the economic imbalances during the boom period of the Roaring 20s which led inevitably to the big Crash. The narrative isn't linear and straightforward, but experienced through the lives of various fictional characters in the books, some of which intersect in later parts of the work. In this manner the telling of history is enriched through the intellectual and emotional raveling of a range of minds, some ordinary, some a bit more than ordinary, as they mature..struggle to survive, succeed, and fail in relationships and in careers..as they dream, and see those dreams shattered..as they live and sometimes die, oblivious to the slow, cold grip of circumstance tightening around them..and through this method, we as readers can relate to them, can empathize with them, even if at times, we find ourselves despising them.The 3 novels can stand alone, but the full effect is only experienced together. The only quibble I have is that you get so wrapped up in these individual characters that you miss some of the early ones that disappear in the later books. For example, the character of Mac dominates The 42nd Parallel, but his story ends somewhere in Mexico at the end of that volume. I yearned to know what happened to him later. It would have been nice to have a coda at the end of U.S.A. describe what happened to the characters who survived. It also is difficult leaving the narrative of one character, and getting back to another whose story was interrupted much earlier in the book. You often have to go back and read the last page or pages of that character's earlier narrative to refresh your memory of what happened.U.S.A. is arguably the greatest literary work concerning the early 20th century American experience. It has been called The Great American Novel, although that is certainly open to debate. Some critics find it too ambitious, comprehensive, bloated, and prejudiced to have earned that accolade. Criticism is subjective of course, but to me, U.S.A. is a great and important piece of art and history, and anyone who cares about such things should read it and come to their own conclusion."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I'm not sure how I managed to avoid the works of John dos Passos during high school, college, graduate school, and the ensuing 35 years of adult life, but I did. In high school I read John Brunner's \\"Stand on Zanzibar\\", a memorable and ground-breaking work of science fiction. Much later, I found out that Brunner had borrowed the organization of the book from dos Passos' \\"USA Trilogy\\". So I thought maybe I should read the original source.USA Trilogy is simply a remarkable piece of writing, so intense in its imagery that I found I couldn't read more than 50 or 60 pages at a sitting. But it was so good, in so many ways, that I'm sorry that I've finished it.As other reviewers have noted, this is the story of twelve different characters, not all of whom are followed all the way through the three novels, which cover the period from the turn of the 20th Century to the beginning of the Great Depression. It's a wild time, full of social disruptions, strikes, and of course a major war. In the first two novels, there is a strong undercurrent of sympathy for the oppressed of the Earth, and a lot of talk of the coming revolution of the workers. But by the third novel, dos Passos appears to lose his vision. There are too many examples of men (and women) who came to America with nothing and hit \\"the big money\\". It becomes difficult to sustain the narrative that the rich will inexorably grow richer and oppress the poor, when poor men like Andrew Carnegie or Samuel Insull come to America with nothing and become very rich indeed.So the books are flawed, in that the writer begins to lose his focus on the workers' revolution and gains some sympathy for those who worked hard and were rewarded (but of course there are always many who work hard and are NOT rewarded). But they are a marvelous read, a trip back in time to an era in some ways startlingly different from our own and in some ways not so very different. The characters are beautifully drawn, the writing is full of little details that make the reader feel he/she is on the trains, in the automobiles, at the speakeasies where the characters spend so much time. Dos Passos interrupts his narrative frequently with short biographies of important people (including Thomas Edison and Isadora Duncan), snippets of news called \\"Newsreel\\", and short stream-of-consciousness meditations on current events called \\"The Camera Eye\\". This format influenced many later writers and poets, including Christopher Isherwood (\\"The Berlin Stories\\") and Hart Crane (the long poem, \\"The Bridge\\").The story is not really a novel in the sense that it simply follows the various characters through their lives, and eventually ends in what appears to be 1929, with stocks soaring but with the world clearly heading for a fall. A great book, and a wonderful close look at a fascinating period in America's history."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"There is no praise that is too great for this trilogy. It blends creative techniques (although not all of them succeed completely) with compelling storytelling and an acute political sensibility that lifts it far beyond a mere tract. Sartre called Dos Passos the greatest American writer, and with this body of work, at least, it is hard to find fault."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Dos Passos writes in a style unknown to America before his time. His use of &quot;Newsreel&quot;s and &quot;Camera Eye&quot;s make the plot more interesting. He also &quot;sticks in&quot; a few biographys of prominent Americans, e.g., LaFayette and Ford.

Mr. Dos Passos pulls out all the stops with experimental techniques as well as traditional story telling.

U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America) I however, do not particularly like hardcover books of many pages - they hurt my left wrist as I read. Therefore, I did not buy the entire trilogy in hard cover. I was also covering my bases. Had I not liked the first novel of the trilogy, The 42nd Parallel, I would not be burdened by having bought and thus \`having' to read the whole 1000 pages of the three books. I thought I was saving money, but now I wish I had bought the whole thing to begin with.Dos Passos is something of a leftist radicalized, American version of Joyce. If that sounds good to you, get the book(s). He does something interesting here about the nature of storytelling and history in the early part of the twentieth century. He weaves together bits and pieces of history and fiction and song and poetry to get at what was real about that time. Some of the bits take you out of the narrative he's stringing together for your elucidation, but they help give you (and reinforce) context of the time. Dos Passos' strength is in creating characters. Too many books that try to bring several characters and have them serve as narrative centers for a time suffer a common weakness: some of the characters are stronger than others. Dos Passos does not suffer from this deficit, and his storytelling benefits as a result. All the characters are rounded out and have a life you want to see played out.Part Two:The bottom line is this: if you liked The 42nd Parallel: Volume One of the U.S.A. Trilogy, you will like _1919_.I liked both books. They are structurally similar, with Dos Passos weaving a tapestry of American life in the early part of the last century, with news and biography and longer stories of individual characters representing many parts of the socio-political milieu in the covered period.The longer stories weave in and out of each other with multiple points of intersection. While this is interesting, it is sometimes hard to keep the momentum going as a reader. At the section ends, this is an easy book to put down. This is partly because there is no larger narrative created except for the grand sweep of history. Some of the characters are more sympathetic than others but you get the feeling Dos Passos wasn't trying for a nice story; he blends naturalism with modernism and leaves me wanting more.Part Three:The bottom line is this: if you liked The 42nd Parallel: Volume One of the U.S.A.

Dos Passos found the America of 1910-1930 and gave it to us, in almost 1300 pages spread across three novels - all collected in this one volume. He presents it to us as a tapestry, woven from four types of thread: stories focused on any of the 12 principle characters, actual news items from the period, biographical sketches of key figures from that time, and stream-of-consciousness narratives. It's dark and smoky, gritty and real. It's America.As the focus moves from character to character, we fall in love with all twelve of them, despite their flaws. They take us all over North America, and even to Europe for World War I. Rich and poor, male and female, worker, labor organizer, aviation millionaire or government official, all have their own stories to tell, and each represents a bit of America.Such a grand fabric contains many themes: drink destroys the great and the small alike, illicit sex seduces people into giving up their money, their families, and their health, and everyone takes advantage of the working man - even his so-called friends. Nevertheless, the book never seems to be making a moral point, and the characters don't come across as good or evil, heroes or villains; they're just people.One does become uncomfortably aware much the America of 100 years ago resembles the Third World countries of today. Read Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" to compare and contrast.This edition of USA (Library of America, Hardcover) combines all three novels into a single handy volume with decent explanatory notes, a built-in silk bookmark, and - best of all - a sewn binding that lies flat, despite the nearly 1300 pages."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Dos Passos' trilogy is important reading for anyone intersted in American History. In particular, Dos Passos chronicles the history of the labor movement in the US and the revolt of working class worldwide.It is intersting to note that at the time that this book was written, Dos Passos was a frevent socialist/communist. By the time of his death, he had renounced the communist idealogies for a more conservatine viewpoint.Although, the fictional prose is simplistic and the dialogue somewhat cliched, a powerful story is told. The world is seen through the eyes of several ordinary citizens, all with different backgrounds and from different classes. The characters lives interwave through important world events such as labor unrest, Mexican revolution, World War 1, and the Russian Revolution.Interwoven throughout the fiction are snippets that attempt to educate the reader. The 'Camera Eye' passages are newspaper headlines and attempt to capture the mood of the day. There are sections of Dos Passos's own thoughts of the day, some of them written as Dos Passos as a child might have seen them. My favorite sections were the short autobiographies of important citizens- among them Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Eugene Debs, Woodrow Wilsoon, and Emma Goldberg.If you are lookiong for a passionate or suspenseful fictional story, this is not the book for you. But if you are intersted in history, especially American History, this book is excellent in capturing the mood of first third of the 20th century."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I read this book first in 1967 while in high school, given to me by a teacher who wanted me to understand the real American History. When he told me an American general marched on World War One veterans in Washington, DC after WW I and killed many who were looking for veterans benefits I knew this book would be special. It delivers history in a most compelling and unique way, unlike any other book I've read. Americans don't know the whole truth of US History. These three books pick a period and educate, entertain, horrify and overwhelm you with our culture, our past, our politics. It is a must read for anyone remotely interested in US history. One of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Now this is not to say that USA is relatively 'the best American Novel' (alas, it is only among them within the unique tapestry of Great American Writers), but when defining the concept as 'American Novel', what more could anyone aspire toward?These three novels are brilliant seperately (in my college days I was asigned 1919 by itself in a course on 'the radical novel'; nevertheless I recall being immensely impressed), and yet seem even more overwhelming taken as a whole. The structure provides a random consecutiveness--as in one long story chronicling the stages of life of numerous fully developed characters, the random swirl of existence buzzing in the text never content to stop introducing another. At nearly 1300 pages (shortened immensely by a short-story detail sped up by experimental prose poetry and detailed biographical editorials on life and the times of the American world spinning around both character and reader from the turn of the 19th century until the economic collapse of 1929, as well as frequent, crudely effective illustrations that serve more as a break, as a magazine article complete with pictures) the quick pacing and exciting narrative will blaze you through to the end of each section, hungry to scrape in just a few more pages before the inevitability of unconsciousness.The politics of the book are varied: clearly opinionated yet with a rational outlook that includes the validity of opposing belief. As a result it comes across as remarkably open to human experience and the ways different people take the same things happening to them. I found it endlessly fascinating and have annoyed several people (no doubt by this time including several of you)with endless, endless raves . . .Okay--I don't take it quite as seriously as that, but more as a document of a time from as many possible angles as a human mind could presume about others."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"What does history mean to you? For every college student who has taken an American literature class that covers the early twentieth century, they will come across excerpts of THE USA TRILOGY: 42nd Parallel, 1919, and BIG MONEY. Through out the reading of John Dos Passos' THE USA TRILOGY, this question may penetrate through the mind of each reader that encounters these three books, which were quite innovative during the time in which they were published. This three-volume publication is rich with historical references that pertain to the Civil War, WWI, Industrial Age, and the Russian Revolution. This may be a travel log through Post Modern twentieth century history when writers spontaneously wrote about every bit of observation and engraved them in large volumes of text. Dos Passos was one of those novelists that evolved during the post-WWI age.Dos Passos wrote about the ever-changing American landscape after World War I that affected the politics as well as the social structure that occurred as a result of the inclusion and exclusion of immigrants that erupted with much nationalistic and xenophobic fervor as well as paranoia. Historians may consider this period in history as the first wave of the Cold War. However, his topics concentrate on the build up of urban development and union formation in the city versus break down of rural and small town constructs of the country. From New York to the coastline of Hampton Roads, Dos Passos covers a wide terrain.With its experimental poetry and newsreel and newspaper headline layout, the book reads like countless interruptions or intermissions between the narratives. Dos Passos creates a tremendous amount of vivid images that may create a mental picture of the words conveyed in the book. There are splashes of imagery and symbolism that represent the atmosphere in which Dos Passos experienced, which resembles a biographical and bibliographical array of experiences that influenced what he wrote. Therefore, the reading of this fine text takes both an objective and subjective point of view because of its creative nonfiction slant.Dos Passos' work may be critiqued by literary academics, but speaking from a historical perspective, this set of novels have the history of the early twentieth century in the form of snapshots of the period from narratives that resemble oral histories to commentaries of US history that span from regions divided by the war of the states to the upheaval of the Great Depression. This book is recommended for those who are enticed with US history in the form of a novel. It may take months or a summer to seriously read, but it will be worth the read."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"This is the true American Epic.Dos Passos wrote this trilogy almost as a documentary. It is a history lesson, with newspaper articles, biographical sketches, beautiful train of thought prose poems, and, in the midst of it all, fictional but brutally realistic characters who each experience the times through a unique set of eyes.Since I have read this book it has become one of my favorites, and there are few titles with more meaning to me than _U.S.A_."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"If ever there has been a truly great epic, this is it.USA is a work about the people. Every character that Dos Passos introduces has his or her own ideas and philosophies as well as short fallings and errant natures. So broad is his scope of writing that I feel he covers nearly everything in this somewhat immense trilogy. USA is also an enjoyable history lesson. As Dos Passos weaves the lives of his characters together and apart again, he adds short snippets about influential Americans such as Ford and Edison.You don't have to agree with the extreme left wing and anti-war ideas to enjoy this book. Nor should you turn it away because of its size.An excellent novel, more than deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Author John Dos Passos painted a masterpiece on the Lost Generation in his novels which comprised the USA Trilogy.His use of snapshots to chronicle scenes and the introduction of material through headlines was revolutionary in American fiction; with the mechanics of presentation arguably overshadowing the oftentimes narrow and shrill angle of political thought.Though the impact from Dos Passos continues to be overshadowed by contemporary icons like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, the USA Trilogy - difficult to find in one volume like this Library of America release - is a voice from characters whose lives were too often ignored or quickly forgotten."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"Long heralded as a monumental portrait of American society in the early decades of the 20th century, John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy is, if nothing else, an amazing display of intellectual endurance. Few novels that I have come across are more ambitious or broader in scope. In 1240 pages, Dos Passos attempts to characterize a vast, growing nation in one of its most dynamic periods in history. While he gloriously succeeds as a sociological study, it is unfortunately at the expense of producing a mediocre work of literature.It is important to point out that while the three installments of this trilogy were written several years apart from each other, this is most definitely one book, not three. The first and second books, The 42nd Parallel and 1919, have no proper conclusion, and The Big Money, the trilogy's final installment, is a logical progression in terms of style and chronology, if not plot. So reading any of these books on their own, or reading them all out of sequence, would be a thoroughly unsatisfying experience.It is clear from early on that Dos Passos has bitten off more than he can chew, at least from a literary perspective. His goal is to capture the essence of an America caught in the throws of industrialization and fervent capitalism, and the inevitable wealth gap and social class struggle that result from this economic expansion. He also tackles the difficult task of explaining this country's painful ambivolence towards the war in Europe and the sense of euphoria in the years following it's conclusion. But these themes are vast and unwieldy, far bigger than any one character in the novel, and as a result, the characters themselves become forgettable and quickly get lost. In a sense, there is only one main character in this novel, and it is America herself.But America is not a person, it is a country and society, and as such the U.S.A. trilogy at times takes on the feel of a social inquiry more than a work of fiction. The other characters, through whose experiences we study the social landscape and fabric of early 20th century America, lack depth and dimension. They are mere stereotypes chosen by Dos Passos to represent various segments of society. There is the down-and-out vagabond, wandering the country and living hand-to-mouth, bitterly condemning the economic wealth all around him from which he is excluded. You have the quintessential rags-to-riches success story, the boy who started with little more than a dollar in his pocket and a whole lot of ambition, and amassed an economic fortune, but at the expense of his humanity and health. We also find the New York socialites, the Communist activists, the labor union organizers, the proud and rowdy GI soldier. But there are no real people, as such characters would not serve the greater purpose of defining American society in the way that Dos Passos sees it. And as a result, the experiences and interactions among these characters are also stereotypical.Despite its shortcomings, the U.S.A. trilogy is worth reading, as it constitutes an important contribution to the understanding of our nation and its history. And in many ways, the great ambition of this novel encouraged other writers to strive to create works of fiction that were not just of literary merit, but also of important social significance. However, for a far more satisfying literary experience, Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy accomplishes on a micro-level what Dos Passos attempted to achieve on a broader scale. But unlike the U.S.A. trilogy, Dreiser's work is a true pleasure to read."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I believe that the USA trilogy presented here (thankfully, under one roof- when I first read it I had to scrounge around for the third book-The Big Money) was the first time that I had read a novel than used the literary devices that the author John Dos Passos used here. Vignettes, bits of poetry, snap biographies, headline banners all are employed here to great effect to both set up the drama of the narrative (such as it is) and interplay between the various characters. Today we are all very familiar with the device; as the modern reader has E.L. Doctorow to rely on to continue this tradition as he has done in his works such as Ragtime and The Book of Daniel. But back then it was rather an unusual and one that today's literary scholars have taken apart piece by piece in their efforts to discount this work as a worthy insight into a slice of Americana in the first third of the 20th century.The stories here cross between the exploits of the rich (and their wannabes) and the exploitation of poor (and their gonnabes). As is natural in a novel, modern or otherwise, we also have the search for love, the trauma of lost love, the inevitable longings for love and the occasional betrayal of that emotion. We have hustlers (in high and low places), drifters, grifters and midnight shifters. In short, a regular cross-section of the white native and recetn immigrant population of that period. We see them in America and the other noted spots of the period, such as Mexico, Europe and Russia. We see them as political, anti-political, non-political and clueless, wise or broken. In some 1300 pages we get a companion as much as a novel. For those of a certain generation, including this writer's these characters- creative designers, high powered executives, labor organizers, scabs, revolutionaries were types we were at least familiar with from stories in childhood. Well, friends they are back here in this edition. So take your time and get re-introduced to a slice of America that is long gone and ain't coming back.A short comment on the author- at this period in his life (the 1920's) he was an ardent leftist of some persuasion. (I have asked around but nobody believes that he was actually in the American Communist Party although in Spain in the 1936-37 he was, according to my sources, close to some of the Americans in the International Brigade and wrote some good articles on their exploits and their trials and tribulations.) All this is by way of saying that I think that youthful leftist political slant helped fuel the book and gave it a vitality lacking in some of his latter work when he got old and cranky about politics and became a 'spiritual godfather' for the right wing Young Americans for Freedom in the early 1960's."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I began reading this trilogy, but I must say that I was ultimately pleased. Very clean writing style and interesting subject matter. Dos Passos takes us to a time of our country's political history that has not been well known by many (me, at least). This novel is significant in understanding the mindset of many in the beginning of the century."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I first have to say that I am very glad to have read the USA Trilogy. Dos Passos has ingenuously conveyed the lifestyle, hopes and dreams of Americana during the first quarter of the 20th century. And similar to James Michener novels, I've found it to be an education rather than just a collection of stories woven into a novel.But, surprisingly, it's hard to recommend this trilogy. After several hundred pages the interwoven stories format get a bit tiresome, with some stories concluding unsatisfactorily (ie, you wonder why he bothered at all). This is sad because the overall effect of the trilogy is one of awe. And a couple of the stories are very gritty and sad, along the lines of F. Scott Fitzgerald novels.However if you are keenly interested in the early labor movement in America, especially the darker side on how businesmen/politicians treated labor organizers, then this book is compulsory reading."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I cannot believe this book is not better known.

His works parallel Kerouac's, Steinbeck's and Whitman's. A must read!"},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"USA is billed as a trilogy, but I defy anyone to read The 42nd Parallel, 1919, or The Big Money as a stand-alone book and come away satisfied that they've read a story. Indeed, it's difficult to milk a plot out of the combination. Dos Passos presents a steady stream of characters throughout the \\"trilogy\\" whose paths occasionally cross. But, the interaction of characters doesn't ensure a plotline and USA singularly fails to develop one. What there is instead are sequential experiences of men and women in the early 20th century either battling it out with the evils of capitalism or, far less frequently, riding high upon it's rising tide.Dos Passos wrote these books while in total thrall with socialism and, not surprisingly, somewhat taken with the communists. Accordingly, he offers a gritty, pessimistic, cynical rendition of America that is more artifice than actual. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to find a Dos Passos character making something as mundane as a wise decision. All too often, his creations choose the path that is destined to end in personal tragedy. As the reader, I often felt I was privy to a 1920's version of Jerry Springer with the never ending supply of relentless drunks, STD sufferers, deserters, suicides, serial adulterers, batterers, and child molesters. Interwoven within these character \\"studies\\" are abbreviated newreel clips (largely obscure), real-life contemporary bios (well done), and autobiographical stream of consciousness bits that work on some levels, but not on most.Though there's no doubt that many industrial labor practices of the early 1900's were abhorrent by any reasonable standard, Dos Passos might have preferred our progress thereafter to Solzhenitsyn's gulags. Far less sanguine about the prospects of communism, he undoubtedly would have created a less cynical American novel. Indeed, by 1964 Dos Passos had completed an ideological 180 with his support of Barry Goldwater. Though some may think this a pendulum swing too far, such political nimbleness might explain the strong whiff of subjectivity emanating from his earlier social commentary. 3 stars."},{"Title":"U.S.A.: The 42nd Parallel / 1919 / The Big Money (Library of America)","review":"I read this as a teenager - big mistake! What a depressing libel on America that never looks at the humanity of the people, the warmth in people's hearts, the successes of the free enterprise system and their open politics. It took me a few years of working for a living to realize how distorted dos Passos' vision was.Certainly there where injustices in the country at the time but no story purporting to encompass the nation should be so imbalanced. Of course, a harsh look at the insipient fascism of the Wilson administration was prescient (see Goldberg's \\"Liberal Fascism\\" for a more sober analysis.)While there are memorable passages, mostly it was boring if not for the repeated portraits of sleaze and low life. What attracted me to the trilogy was the short piece on Steinmetz, an electrical genius comparable to, but saner than Tesla. Working in real engineering, it was nothing like what the picture dos Passos painted and never could have been.I can't see recommending anyone wasting their time on these volumes today. Today's leftists would enjoy the reinforcement of their anti-Americanisms but that's like recommending heroin to Percodan addicts."},{"Title":"Mirgorod: Four Tales by Nikolai Gogol","review":"This collection, from the late 1830s, gives four earlier tales, the rural and Ukrainian folk background of Gogol rather than his urban and bureaucratic satirical \\"Petersburg Tales.\\" These four tales are uneven. I searched this out to read \\"Taras Bulba\\" after having found out about it in Jane Smiley's \\"13 Ways of Looking at the Novel\\" as one of the 101 examples she summarizes. As Smiley notes, the descriptions are often powerful.But the novella's simple tale of Cossack slaughter, glory, gore, and revenge seems almost more like \\"lad lit\\" would have been circa 1840! Less sexual lust, although it's suggested, but lots of bloodlust. There's not a lot of nuance or subtlety, although you can easily picture the vivid backdrops and shouts and dust and panoplies. The supporting Jewish characters offer as an aside a fascinating depiction from the Christian side of how that minority managed to survive amidst so much prejudice and persecution; it gives a balance to the Yiddishkeit that so many Eastern European Jewish writers chronicled from within the ghettoes and shetls. Even if this is not the most complicated mini-saga, it's fleshed out enough to depict a time few of us know but a sentence or two about. Gogol would have made a great screenwriter if he had lived a century later. This tale begs to be re-made on the big screen.The other stories: \\"The Old-World Landowners\\" pairs off a quarrelsome couple who somehow keep their affection beneath unendingly barbed banter; \\"Viy\\" starts off well in its depiction of rowdy seminarists, but the ghost tale that emerges failed to sustain itself. \\"The story of how Ivan Ivanovich quarrelled with Ivan Nikiforovich\\" becomes tedious. David Marganshack adds a helpful preface; his style of translation is rather mannered, in the echo of Constance Garnett perhaps, but the slightly musty air he evokes fits the fictional ambiance. All three of these show the softer side of Ukrainian folk, early 19c., and still convey, if not the most gripping of tales, the texture, conversational pace, and beliefs of the people Gogol memorializes from his own youth."},{"Title":"Garnishing","review":"I got this to go with my garnishing tools i got for christmas.

The voice or voices which informed the thirteen year old that he was being chosen amongst 400 other 'geniuses' were described by Jack himself as 'distant, cold, metallic'. Such a tone should have been a red, hammer and sickle flag to the boy or at least his mother who eventually told the callers to leave him alone, that there was probably no compassion to be brought forth in the mysterious mission that he was being chosen for. No emotion, no feeling, no love-the very things that science is in short supply/dire need of these days. As a predominantly feeling and intuitive person, I only make this point because I tried my damnedest to make my way through Sarfatti's braggadocio tome Destiny Matrix, only to run into the Wailing Wall of his Star Gate equations which first emerge into the third dimension on page 122. This is not a criticism of the author himself, born of my inability to understand such physics, lumpen-innumerate that I am, but rather of Jack's rather fuzzy intent for even publishing the book in the first place. Did he do it to geometrodynamically dazzle us in Mensa fashion? Or does he sincerely want to inform us about what could possibly be the means to a truly liberatory omega point hidden within post quantum physics? He does fancy himself a 'theatrical physicist' as the subtitle of the book confesses. We only need to get a clearer bead on exactly what kind of script he is following, who is staging/directing the production, who his handlers are and whether his ongoing, off Broadway run is a classified Top Secret MK / Black Psy Ops project or not.At a loss at how to approach reviewing Destiny Matrix, I did my fair share of reality checks with other writers and editors who have come across the book and/or the author. One writer, who will remain unnamed, hints at the possibility of Destiny Matrix containing high level disinformation which would prevent those competent in physics (and ethics) from producing truly free energy, instantaneous transport to other universes, etc., etc. Such vectoric disinformation certainly exists on the Leading Edge website and in their own series of so called 'matrix' books edited by the pseudonymous and sleep inducing Val Valerian. Another writer, also who will remained unnamed is convicinced that Jack has been 'programmed by the military'. I'm obviously not qualified to say whether or not this is true-but just remember the voices from Sarfatti's past, or future as the case may be: cold...metallic....distant. I'd trust the author's quantum summations more if the voices on the Cold War phone had been warm, fluid, and intimate. I'd trust his work even more if he was summonsed into action by Namagiri-the Hindu goddess who inspired the mathematician Ramanujan to conjure up equations which startled the pasty faced Cambridge Apostles.(see the book, The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan by R. Kanigel)Physics desperately needs to integrate some poetic metaphors into its realm, to help bridge the gap, primarily between the cold/analytical and the warm/ intuitive. Paul LaViolette in his book Earth Under Fire does a fairly impressive job of using the major arcana of the tarot to describe cosmological phenomena and posits the theory that the cards were solely designed for use as esoteric transmitters of such knowledge in the first place. The late Itzhak Bentov also comes to mind. He did his best to break free of establishment science in a heart centered way, trying to make his own heretical insights available to us nonscientific folk. In his most well known work, Stalking the Wild Pendulum, Bentov combines his analytic erudition with humorous and enlightening cartoons which inspire us to understand such things as iso-electric fields, the interactions between white and black holes and other universal peculiarities. A Brief Tour of Higher Consciousness: a Cosmic Book on the Mechanics of Creation goes even further in making metaphysical and scientific things more accessible to the analytically challenged. It is along these lines that I was hoping Destiny Matrix would follow, but Jack's warp speed megalomania just plain gets in the way all throughout. Instead of such informative renderings as described above, we get page after page of Sarfatti posing with famous people such as Francis Ford Coppola, Sukie Sedgewick and other physicist groupies as well. I'm glad to see that Jack loves to party with the beautiful people. However, flaunting his high society connections as he does in the book (and on his website as well), does nothing for the average reader in terms of encouraging at least a remedial understanding of post quantum physics. Aside from a most helpful illustration of M.C. Escher's 'Drawing Hands' which assisted me somewhat in understanding the 'post quantum principle of self creation', heuristic illustrations are sorely lacking throughout Destiny Matrix. Perhaps some Asuric or Ahrimanic savant in another dimension is manipulating the false shell of personality in the author, thus sabotaging the possibly world transforming potential of post quantum physics. If Sarfatti were really street smart, he'd transcend all of this relentless fanfare crap he throws at his fans, market some Destiny Matrix flashcards which would burn his bewildering equations, in an elementary way, into our neurocircuits and we would have no choice but to fully comprehend them. I sincerely think there are gems to be extracted from Destiny Matrix but the egotistical briar patch the author fertilizes with his ongoing rodomontade, makes the quest even more difficult than it should be.Recommended Reading:Stalking the Wild Pendulum andA Brief Tour of Higher Consciousnessby Itzhak BentovTrialogues at the Edge of the West:Chaos,Creativity, and the Re-Sacralization of the WorldandThe Evolutionary Mindby Terence McKenna, Rupert Sheldrakeand Ralph AbrahamThe Quantum and the Lotus byTrinh Xuan Thuan andMatthieu RicardArt and Physics by Leonard SchlainThe Spiritual Universe by Fred Alan WolfThe Life Divine by Sri Aurobindo"},{"Title":"Destiny Matrix","review":"Destiny Matrix isn't so much a book as a compilation of random one or two page ramblings about Jack Sarfatti's life that are thrown together in no discernible order. The jumps between the sections are very jarring. Different things coexist with no real connection.....equations about quantum mechanics are put near sections on girls that Sarfatti liked and pages and pages of his work for Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program are put in the middle of ramblings. Did I mention that he has a unique political perspective? Although known from \\"Cosmic Trigger\\" there's a reason why he willingly contributed to Reagan's Star Wars program.I hate to say it but this book represents the weakness of print on demand self publishing in that any sort of editor would have demanded that some overarching structure be imposed on the book."},{"Title":"Destiny Matrix","review":"Destiny Matrix establishes for the record Dr. Jack Sarfatti's historic influence on what has become known as \\"the new physics\\". The San Francisco community of North Beach is ground zero and Cafe Trieste, a portal into a bizarre world where time flows from the future into the present, and we are drawn to our destiny by \\" the invisible police officer of the Fates (Melville). For those not familiar with Jack's wild internet presence, this book will serve as a thorough introduction.Sarfattti presents fresh ideas, in an off-beat manner, regarding our newly discovered accelerating universe and he is among the few in physics with the courage to take on issues of UFO's, time travel and psychic phenomenon, and to work within the framework of established relativistic and quantum theory.Destiny Matrix is a fascinating read and full of intrigue, but be warned, this book was not written for the general audience and much of the language is that of theoretical physics.So if you like-a da coffee ah?.....coffee gooood ah? Then reada the book and drinka da coffee. The book is a good, but I can not read it without-a da coffee. When I getta to equations, I drinka da rum and put-a down the book.

Another book that rocks is \\"Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed\\", by Phillip C. Plait."},{"Title":"Destiny Matrix","review":"For those readers unfamiliar with mathematical process coding aka physics matrix equations, this book gives a lively demonstration model of how one person (the author:Dr. Jack Sarfatti) moves along a timeline directed by the mind pilot and destiny fields of those individuals whose actions and ideas augment, impinge or interrupt his progress. The effect is much like finding a scrapbook in a drawer, with photos, old college papers, essays by friends, famous sonnets, physics formulae and whatnot else stuck onto the bulding pages. For, in the physics theories of Sarfatti, one can travel in time, opening the scrapbook from the future to peek at the past or in the past take a peek at the future.For those familiar with physics,Jack Sarfatti is a controversial figure since his theories challange the separation of mind and matter by assuming there is a global significance to each micro or macro event.This is similar to the thinking of physicist David Bohm in his book &quot;The Implicate Order&quot;. Yet Dr. Sarfatti speculates in more dimensions than Bohm in asserting a shared &quot;Destiny Matrix&quot; which is to some extent malleable in the sense of group interaction causing a response or &quot;presponse&quot; which alters collective destiny.This sense of collective identity--all of us humans plus intelligences from Other Worlds--embedded in a co-dependent matrix can be slightly unsettling to the conventional reader as the book shifts between narrations of super kids of the 1950's, philosophical tracts,heart-wrenching society liasons, espionage,sleeping Beatnik poets,a variety of intello-tractive ladies &amp; gents, sidewalk Sufis and whatnot else, finally arriving at several final chapters chock full of diagrams and equations. But, hey! This is the age of expanding communications awareness and anyone may need to develop their own process map to handle events which have happened to include them.In fact,the author of this review is included briefly in the book &quot;Destiny Matrix&quot; and also wrote the book &quot;Doing Business In The Adirondacks:True Tales Of The Bizarre And Supernatural&quot; (2003)which includes certain supernatural and espionage-related events relevant to issues raised by the concept of mind/matter interaction."},{"Title":"Destiny Matrix","review":"Sarfatti's book fills a much-needed gap in the literature.--Nick Herbert, author of &quot;Quantum Reality&quot; and &quot;Physics on All Fours&quot;"},{"Title":"Destiny Matrix","review":"Dr. Sarfatti takes the reader on a ride that you hope will continue to the end of time.

IMAGINE offers them the chance to explore not only some of the great works of art by American artists, but their own ideas about the story the artist is wanting to tell us. From Winslow Homer's \\"Two Girls Looking at a Book\\" to Norman Rockwell's \\"Girl at Mirror,\\" the illustrations provide endless possibilities for sharing their thoughts and emotions as they view the paintings --- and opening the door to a wealth of discussion by putting themselves into the painting and letting their imaginations fly.For example, one lovely painting by Luther Van Gorder entitled \\"Japanese Lanterns\\" portrays two small girls admiring the wonders of paper lanterns being hung in the garden. Their parents are preparing for a party in the year 1895, and the girls are all dressed up to attend this \\"grown-up\\" event. The magical glow of light and the curious smiles of the girls create a joyful picture that makes us recall our own happy discoveries. Can you remember being amazed by something as magical as a Japanese lantern? Feeling the tingle of anticipation before a family party?Each work of art is accompanied by a brief essay that sets the stage for viewing the art, and asks questions to start kids on the path to seeing deeper within themselves. Short biographies on each artist are included in the back. An added bonus --- the cover is designed in the form of a picture frame, allowing the reader to insert their favorite reproduction of some of these paintings from a packet that's included with the book.

I couldn't help visualizing melting Colorforms while waiting for this book to run out of pages, since it had long before run out of story.I must admit, though, that the premise was not nearly as comical as some of the &quot;planted&quot; glowing reviews of this tripe."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"I was delighted when I came across this latest effort from Owl Goingback for two reasons: One, there was something new on the horror shelf besides King and Koontz reprints. And two, I was intrigued to see how Mr. Goingback had matured after his first novel, Crota. (Which I found very entertaining and would recommend, although I wouldn't call it startlingly original.) I'm very happy to report that Darker Than Night is even more entertaining and engaging, (I read the first three chapters before I even drove out of the bookstore parkinglot!) and it further illustrates the talent of this promising author. It's kind of heavy on the cliches, (including the obligatory crazy old man in town that actually isn't crazy but knows the shocking truth behind the horrors) But it has some genuine chills and thrills to it and the ending is a slam-bang nailbiter. One thing I found distracting with this book, however-- so much so that I actually put it down for awhile-- was a dialogue on anti-gun control measures. Normally I would overlook this kind of thing (and politely agree to disagree,) but this was like a PSA from the president of the NRA, Charlton Heston, interrupting a good movie. It even included a Limbaugh-esque finger-pointing at them damn liberals and feminists who were making it so dad-blamed hard for all those hard working Americans to buy a gun. What would our poor forefathers think about this sad state of affairs after writing the right to bear arms into our Constitution? (They'd be holding onto their wigs and running for cover in the freakin'cross-fire, is what they'd be doing.)"},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"This was the first Owl Goingback book that I read and I can say that it was a wonderful read. I bought this book not knowing anything about Goingback or his books and I could not put it down until I had finished reading it. I do not know much about Indians or their rituals, but this book has made me very interested in their culture. I like to read at night before I go to sleep and I am a big fan of Dean Koontz, but Dean has never given me the eerie feeling that Goingback did with this book. I found myself looking over the top of the book, just to make sure nothing was hiding in the shadows. Read this book if you want to know what I am talking about."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"I had read Crota and wanted to read more of Owl Goingback's books, hence I picked up this one.

I can't wait for Owl's next one."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"I try to keep up with all the Stoker Award winners, and this was the first of Goingback's books that I'd read. The story itself was extremely entertaining - the Indian lore, the kachina dolls, etc. - but I think it could have been even better.Too often, the narrative voice takes on a soapbox feel - i.e., a little mini-rant about gun laws. It detracted from the story, and resulted in too much &quot;telling&quot; instead of &quot;showing&quot;. Secondly, there was often an attempt made to switch voices/points of view, and while it was adequately done between the protagonist and the protagonist's wife, the switch was unsuccessful when trying to &quot;speak&quot; from the kids' point of view. There was a section, for instance, that spoke from the younger boy's POV. The voice would be right for one paragraph, but then it would veer off into a very adult voice.

I had just a little bit of trouble with what the author called his monsters. Next time give them a really good Native American name. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Goingback in the future."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"I bought this book because the photo of the author, an American Indian, made me think I'd get a different kind of novel from the usual WASP horror cliches.

Plenty of talented authors fill their novels with interesting detail about the characters, landscapes, historical facts, but Mr. Goingback fails terribly with this ability. The information is mind numbingly repetitive and boring. I prefer detailed, long novels but with \\"Darker Than Night\\" found myself saying out loud \\"My God can we get on with this?\\" This was the first book I've read where I considered putting it down and never cracking the cover again. I didn't trade this one with my friends either...it went into my fireplace. Watching it burn and it was more satisfying than reading it.The author got the basics right and I realize the town mentioned was fictitious but there are notable geographic inaccuracies. I've considered getting the book from the library (I'd never spend another dime on it) and write down every mistake I find and hand deliver them to Owl personally in Florida. I wonder if he has ever even visited Missouri. It would appear that an author should write what they know about...he seems he wasn't really familiar with Missouri.The biggest thing that ticked me off was that I thought the wife; Holly was too gullible being convinced far too easily from the old Indian about the evil spirits and that kachina dolls were what kept the evil spirits at bay. The old Indian even goes as far as to say it may be too late after finding out Holly packed the kachina dolls away. Ok, that bit of IMPACT was completely overlooked by Holly when she went back home. Unpacking the kachina dolls should have been her first priority as soon as she got home since she did believe the old Indian! HUGE gaping hole overlooked! But it had to play into his weak storyline because thousands of evil spirit shadow creature midgets are can now overtake the world because the kachina dolls are no longer at their posts! The solution (SPOILER) is to burn down the house just like the old sawmill. Okay, so why in the hell do ancient evil sprits have to have a man-made building in order to have a gateway into the realm of man? The evil boogers were around before man so why did the boogers have to wait countless eons before man evolves and builds a building? Give me a break! It's not my job to guess why, that's the author's job...a job he failed miserably at.The plot was mildly interesting at best. The character development was weak which is amazing because more time was spent with the characters than the actual evil the book was about. I had to question the motivation many times of various characters because they didn't seem natural. The ending was as disappointing as the rest of the book.My new year's resolution is to never read anything else by Owl Goingback...that's one resolution that I doubt I'll have trouble keeping. In fact, I'll have to teach my granddaughters never to read his children's books either."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"What a letdown!This is the type of book with sentences like this:&quot;There was something in the shadows.

Just dreadful writing, and the husband and wife are CONSTANTLY grinning or smiling at one another.Such as:&quot;Maybe I'll tie the kids up!&quot; he said, grinning.&quot;I'll get you the rope!&quot; she said, laughing.Ugh!"},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"This is the second Horror novel from Owl Goingback and the man is proving to be a master of suspense! Nobody writes a suspenseful passage quite the same way as he does. He really does have a style all his own. He is very light on gore, but he makes up for it with fear. That is right, good old fear. Remember, horror is meant to scare you, not disgust you. This is a great book with great characters.

After they move into the house, they find ample evidence of what they believe to be her &quot;eccentricities.&quot; But after a while, they discover that maybe she knew what she was doing after all.The book had several creepy moments, but also had a lot of predictable ones. Overall though, it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"The only thing creepy about this book was the Author's Note at the end. I couldn't really enjoy the book because I thought the protagonist (not a word I think accurately describes the father of the family by the way) was an absolute jerk. I thought the book would have been better if more time had been spent on the EVIL rather than on characters who were annoyingly pompous, selfish and prejudiced. I wouldn't suggest that readers should avoid DARKER THAN NIGHT at all costs BUT, I am just glad I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste my money. I wish I could really make this book DARKER THAN NIGHT and give it 0 stars."},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"\\"Darker Than Night\\", the second novel by Bram Stoker Award winner, Owl Goingback, has a pretty average plot and is just lukewarm in the area of chills and thrills. That being said, this is still a pretty good read.The plot revolves around the boyhood home of horror writer Michael Anthony who leaves New York to reclaim the home when his grandmother passes away. The townfolk of the rural Missouri community refuse to open their arms to their newest resident because they fear his motives for reclaiming the property. Many of the residents ridiculed Anthony's grandmother as a lunatic who \\"saw things in the night\\". Most are suspicious of his motivation and don't want their community to be used as the site for one of his novels. All Anthony wants is to relocate his family away from the hustle and bustle of New York City.It takes his children a while to warm up to the house and it's surroundings. And, it's not long until the strange sounds and shapes that Anthony's grandmother spoke of seeing begin to appear to the house's new residents. As Anthony and his family begin to question their sanity they soon find themselves in a fight for survival against Indian spirits from an underworld world who are using the old home as a portal into this world.Goingback gives the reader great insight on Indian lore and superstitions. He obviously has done his research in this area and he writes from the heart. It's just that there's not enough action to really drive the plot and the spirits from the underworld (\\"boogers\\" - and isn't that an unfortunate name) don't have enough \\"character\\" to really put the reader into the plot.Owl Goingback IS a promising young author who will write many good books during his career. Here's hoping that his later novels will have more suspense plus a deeper plot than he gives us in \\"Darker Than Night\\".My list of Goingback novels in order of appeal are:1) Crota2) Evil Whispers3) Breed4) Darker Than Night"},{"Title":"Darker Than Night","review":"This book is by far my favorite from Goingback.

As in any great horror novel things degenerate rapidly. The family cat is mutilated and shadows with claws start stalking Michael's kids and wife. Horrible faces appear on the floors and walls, faces of ancient evil spirits who are trying to come up from below to our world.

The author slips into these digressions about several social issues, for example gun control, and I lost the sense that it really had anything to do with the character. In fact, I really didn't like the main character much - I thought he was kind of dopey trying to find all these rational explanations for such weird &quot;goings on&quot;.

Two nurses who journey to a remote mansion to care for a man suffering from a gunshot wound discover a poisonous atmosphere among their hosts and other guests. After the host is killed, suspicion falls on one of the nurses. Clues, some of them false leads, are dropped into the story at intervals. Unsuspected relationships become known. Our narrator, nurse Keate, discovers connections to the German-American Bund. The early phases of World War Two are off screen but contribute to the atmosphere of suspicion. Innuendo plays as big a role as action. The resolution of the mystery is reasonably satisfactory, with a climax that is notably less violent than modern Americans have come to expect.This book is one of a series in which Nurse Keate gets involved in mysteries. The writing is competent, though not brilliant. The biggest problem is the large number of characters; readers may need a list of dramatis personae to keep track."},{"Title":"Wolf in Man's Clothing (Dell Mapback 136)","review":"Mignon Eberhart is always a good read if you enjoy old mysteries with lots of clues and little gore.

Horror Booovies!What's a ghost's favorite fruit? Boo-berries!What do ghosts read? Booo-ks!Where does a ghost go to learn how to cut hair? Booo-ty school!Why did the ghost blow its nose? Because it was full of booo-gers!(Heh-heh. \\"Booo-gers.\\" Sigh. Smile.)Okay...so...on the other hand, because this collection is for younger readers, repetitive punch lines might help your son or daughter guess the answer. Could prove to be very satisfying. And furthermore, the more I think about it, this is a monster joke book. There are only so many angles to be explored.All and all, I'm not sorry I own Yoe's book. I'm not about to pump it up to be more than it is. It is a fun, pocketbook-sized, black & white excursion into ghost & goblin frivolity. That's all. If you're down with that, buy it. I did.P.S.

It was originally edited by the faculty of Theology of Navarra University in Pamplona, Spain.This theological initiative joins three authors that represent, at the same time, three frames of reference in expertise and experience in undertaking a complete and neverending treatise on Jesus Christ.Dr. F. Ocariz is theologist of the Divine Filiation reality of men in Grace, revealed and studied as the trascendental participation in the Natural Filiation through the Son of God (in sense of St. Thomas Aquinas' Metaphysics of Participation).I perceive, in fact, that the contribution and influence of Dr. F. Ocariz in this book has to do with considering Jesus under the prospective of this Filiation: the Human Nature of the Second Person of the Most Holy Trinity is the efficient and exemplary cause (the model) of our particular participated filiation to the Father that not changes our being but enhances and elevates our being to God Father, God Son and God Holy Spirit (relation of origin) instead of only our being to God straightly and affects in real the singular human being in grace state.Dr. L.F. Mateo Seco, is mainly theologist of the Most Holy Trinity (he wrote a book specially dedicated to this matter), and his contribution in this book, having known his other work, is just to deepen in the Verb as Second Person of the Most Holy Trinity and His Life within the Trinity in God and presents the exactness of the phylosophical concept of Person in regard to God (Subsistence within the Divine Nature) and concreted into the Verb.I think Mateo Seco's contribution also helps, throughout the book, to explain straightforwardly (recognizing the Mistery, though) the Self of Jesus and His two Wills. This has deep implications in the ordinary life of the christians, in special when the common man or woman understands that whatever happens in the most ordinary situations and activities is because God wants it (that is the reason of why the situations and things are real and this is because things are good since God wants them) and accepting them is the way as our human will works understanding and assuming them as goods, without, obviously, being detriment of our fight and strenght to overcome any situation or hurdles in order to human Salvation.In Jesus, the Union of His Divine Nature with His Human Nature in the Person of Verb allows us to explain the reason of the existence in Him of the Divine Will and of a Human Will and both are consistent in their object.Dr. J.A. Riestra must have contributed essentially to the theology of Salvation in Christ, and, a fortiori has to do with the Grace. In this arena is where contributions of Dr. Ocariz and Riestra converges since, naturally extending the methaphysics of trascendental participation in Divine Filiation toward the theology of Grace, comes up consistently the participation of human being in Grace in the Capital Grace of the Human Nature of Christ.The book makes use of, without solution of continuity, the Philosophy and Theology employed within the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Augustine of Hipona, together with the documents after Vatican II and the very recent contributions of the Magister of His Holiness John Paul II and obviously the Holy Scriptures.The book is really easy to read even though requires to pay attention on the philosophical concepts and terms involved in."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Jesus Christ (Theology Textbooks)","review":"(The following is cited from my personal endorsement printed on the back cover of this book):\\"In this text professors Ocariz, Mateo Seco, and Riestra seamlessly integrate a discerning command of the history of theological reflection on Jesus Christ with a profoundly systematic penetration into the divinely revealed mystery of the Incanate Word and his work of salvation. Their theological contemplation is oriented both to the knowledge and love of Christ - it is both speculative and existentially relevant - and thus their wok is without peer among recent Christology and soteriology texts.\\""},{"Title":"The Mystery of Jesus Christ (Theology Textbooks)","review":"The Mystery of Jesus Christ is a great textbook to assist you in the study of the truths about Christ and his saving actions. The book brings forth the misunderstandings of the person of Christ and clarifies them using the writings of the Fathers of the Church and a variety of theologians. If you've ever wondered how Jesus could be both perfect God and perfect man, the authors have the answer for you. The writing is clear and straightforward. The topic, of course, is very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Deutsch Na Klar","review":"There's really no point to owning this book if you're enrolled in a German class, and there's absolutely no reason for a self-learner to pick this up otherwise. There's a lot of people who say this book \\"is great if you're in a class / using video / using audio / great teacher / etc etc...\\" and the truth is, when you have that much enrichment anyway, you don't need a very good book (which is the only time when using this book is acceptable). And the \\"listening comprehension\\" CD? It's much more useful as a coaster. A coaster that might cost you a whole paycheck.Gripes:-Never provides ANY blocks of words/pronunciations in chapters (even when it does, it tends to have whole phrases translated, not word-by-word breakdowns like you need, especially in the beginning). You have to learn 90% of your words on your own, and then try to figure out what's going on in the book based on your own knowledge. This is an almost absurd problem considering the price.-Randomly tosses around different dialects of German with little division. Without a professor keeping you informed, you might not even notice some of the differences. My fiancee was dismayed to learn that I wasn't learning the same dialect that she knows (and her dialect is High German, which is the one you're \\"supposed\\" to learn in an introductory class). I think I'm learning a more Southern or Austrian dialect. Is that the book's fault or my professor's? Since the book doesn't help, I have absolutely no clue!-The CD is truly worthless. It barely follows the book, and doesn't provide ANY quick access to any necessary elements. It doesn't have access to very much in the way of pronunciation at all- nearly all of the CD is composed of text application of the words with little or no motivation except as practice for what you should have learned before (except there is no \\"learning before\\"- in the book or CD). Inexcusable.-No answer keys. The book might have you learn new phrases with something like \\"figure out which of the following phrases are greetings or goodbyes\\", and unless you ask a professor, you might never know. Again, it's just amazing that a book would cost so much and not contain something like this.-How can you learn a language when the book never really teaches anything new, and just keeps expecting you to apply knowledge that it doesn't give? It makes no sense!Counterpoints:-It's... kind of pretty. If you don't mind that a lot of the pictures aren't properly explained. And those pictures are example exercises in the chapter... yeah, you'll mind.If you HAVE to have this book for your class, just hope it's a good class. This book seems near-worthless for trying to teach yourself, which as any student knows, is critically important to ANY language class. Listen in class, and don't expect the book to be of much help.So what do I reccomend?Even if you class doesn't reccomend it, try to find the two workbooks/lab manuals that go along with the book. Frankly, I've found that they sometimes do a better job of teaching than the book does. AND they have answer keys to help you check your progress. Sadly, however, the manuals don't come with the necessary listening CDs, so you're still going to be left out in the cold for most of the experience. Again, just ridiculous.Overall:-If you're taking a German class, and this is the book, you don't have much choice anyway.-Which is to say, if you're not taking a class and you're learning on your own, virtually any other book does a better job."},{"Title":"Deutsch Na Klar","review":"I am currently enroled in begining German.

The science covered in the book is left pretty much only half explained and presented in a more &quot;trust me, because I have been doing this for a really long time&quot; attitude.The biggest disappointment was the lack of the &quot;how to&quot; in the book all together. Most of the tips and ideas are nothing short of common sense. Also, the discussion about the equipment was far too brief and not once included a &quot;why we use this&quot; to tie it back to the previously explained science. If you are a beginning paranormal researcher, you would not be served well from this book in getting your feet wet.The only thing I found reasonably sound from this book was the classification of the evidence and the weight that is placed on each catagory. The author also has some interesting ideas on the sources of the ghostly phenomenon. This leads me to believe that the author does understand the basic science, but just didn't translate it very well to his text.I just felt that the entire book was more a validation of the first three words, &quot;Ghosts are real&quot; rather than a practical guide. It is a horrible attempt at trying to legitimize the field."},{"Title":"How to Hunt Ghosts : A Practical Guide","review":"This book has proven to be a very dry read.

I have always viewed things from the skeptical/rational outlook, which I find it odd that some ghost hunters, if they are honestly seeking answers, tend to frown upon. I got into this field to find answers to my own personal questions about ghost/hauntings and I'm looking for truth, not just cool ghost stories. As well this approach should keep you from being gullible and susceptible to would-be pranksters or those with agendas and help retain your credibility as a researcher. Mr. Warren gives you that perspective with this book. And I really appreciated how he gave several possible scientific theories of how hauntings may occur before going into the how-tos of ghost hunting. In short, if you are a new ghost hunter looking for an introduction on the subject of the paranormal or a seasoned vet interested in theories from other researchers and furthering your understanding, you won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"How to Hunt Ghosts : A Practical Guide","review":"When I picked this book up at the store, I literally couldn't put it down.

He takes a very practical and scientific approach to the question, and it is an educational experience to read this book even if you have no interest in the paranormal. He has one chapter devoted as a practical, step by step how to, and it is really concise and complete. I'm sure there are other excellent books out there on this subject, but this book deserves a place in any paranormal library.

It is professional. It's great for those who know next to nothing about ghosts and how to hunt them. The book should be re-titled however. The first half of the book (almost exactly 50%) is nothing more than a study of WHAT GHOSTS ARE. Now, I understand that in order to hunt something, you need to know what you're looking for - and the whole \\"plasma\\" theory was cool - but the book's title is simply \\"How to Hunt Ghosts\\". The title should be \\"Ghosts - What They Are And How To Hunt Them\\". A short introduction on the current theories of what ghosts are would've sufficed. I wish the entire book had gone into a lot more detail about the \\"hunt\\" itself. Joshua should have given much more detail about his actual experiences in his investigations, especially in the use of the equipment. For example: We used such and such piece of equipment at this investigation and got these results, rather than just speaking in generalities about what the equipment does. It definitely needs more focused, detailed info if it's going to be appreciated by anyone but a true novice in the field."},{"Title":"How to Hunt Ghosts : A Practical Guide","review":"Joshua Warren's book is a fascinating look into real-life ghost hunting and paranormal investigation. It is clearly written, and the fact that Warren has really been doing this kind of research for a long time comes through on every page. I heard about the book on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory (Warren has been a guest numerous times, with both Noory and Art Bell), and ordered the book the next day. I got my copy before the release date (pleasant surprise) and found it even better than it had sounded. It has lots of practical advice on equipment to use in hunting ghosts from very simple things most people can use up through sophisticated cameras and scientific equipment. But it also has a section on different kinds of ghosts and hauntings, including some that aren't really ghosts but have other kinds of explanations. It is also filled with lots of anecdotes and examples from Warren's work that makes it a really interesting read.I imagine that its going to get a lot of negative reviews from people who put down anything having to do with the paranormal, but if you have experienced ghostly things yourself or at least have an open mind, give it a try. Warren's approach and the kind of information he presents is definitely not the usual new-agey spiritualism or hokey \\"ghost-hunting\\" book by amateurs. Warren is a pro, and it shows.

Simple for the beginner,dry for the more advanced, and crud written by people looking to make a buck who don't care about the science,or who are of questionable investgative ability to say the least. Joshua Warren has tried to write a book that splits the difference between the simple and advanced, and has done a pretty good job of it. I don't feel it presents the beginners view as well as Southalls book,and it doesn't explain some of the more complicated ideas as well as other books either. However Mr Warren has done a good job presenting information on a varied and complex subject, that unlike some of the scientific disciplines there are no known absolutes. Most of the people investigating out there have their own take that is slightly different from the next. Mr Warren gives you his.

It would have been much better if he had just concentrated on &quot;ghost hunting&quot; instead of summarizing the numerous subjects he tried to cover in his book.I find his analysis of negative hauntings to be especially superficial. I would suggest reading Ed and Lorrain Warren's book, &quot;The Demonologist&quot; for a more proper assessment of negative spiritual situations. I don't think a humidifier is going to do the trick in most situations of this type; although it is a very interesting fact that Joshua Warren discovered.This is all not to say that this is a bad book. I'd say it's slightly better than average, and I would definately give it out to teens and beginners. Actually, it would make a good textbook.I'd like to see what this author does in the future, perhaps in a longer, more focused book. I like his scientific, methodical approach, and he seems like a talented ghost hunter.

Went to Savannah, Georgia, and stayed in a haunted bed and breakfast inn (The 17Hundred90--main ghost named Anna Powers), and then went up to Bay Street to get locked overnight in a haunted pub with 13 other lunatics (two of them from the Savannah MorningNews. a features writer and a photographer). The Inn was interesting. \\"Something\\" walked out of a bathroom for us that night, sat down with a creak in a creaky chair, waited a few, and then creaked its way back across the creaky floor and re-entered the bathroom. Cool, huh? Well the inn had NOTHING on the Moon River Brewery & Pub!!!!! The basement was spook central. Try a water spigot that would defy you and turn itself back on in front of you after you turned it off. Not once. Not twice. THREE times. Then there's the storeroom where you could plainly hear the sound of chairs dragging across the floor. Open the door, flick on the light, and...nothing. But the spook DID like chairs. A most frightening incident was walking from one room to the next and passing some restaurant chairs and bar stools stacked against a far wall and having one of the chairs just launch itself into the air and smash to the floor right in front of the person behind you, the nice little old lady from St. Augustine, Florida. And when I say smash, take that literally. Broke itself upon the floor. Sorry, bubbas, you can't manage that kind of force with funhouse wires, so you can forget that little bit of self-delusional debunkery. Besides. There WEREN'T any wires. We checked. And lastly, there was the stupendous event of a huge crashing noise that shook the building and had three and four-person investigative teams rushing up and down stairwells and bumping into each other, because EACH group \\"heard\\" the crash as coming from the floor either ABOVE or BELOW their own. NOBODY heard it on THEIR floor. And nothing was EVER found as a cause for the noise.And all these doings were looked at with tri-field meters, thermographic sensor guns,digital cameras, night vision viewers, tape recorders, motion detectors, and other kinds of paraphernalia covered by Joshua P. Warren in his book \\"How To Hunt Ghosts\\". So, am I shilling for Warren? No. Wasn't one of his investigations. It was worked by The American Institute of Parapsychology (AIP), out of Florida, and co-cordinated by Savannah Walks, Inc. Fact is, though, everything Warren says in his book matches up with the ideas and methodologies used by AIP in Savannah. Dovetail matches. His assessments of equipment squares with theirs and his concepts of the nature of spirits and hauntings matches up.To my mind Warren has a solid piece of work here and things I have heard about his professionalism in the past lead me to place him up there with Loyd Auerbach, Troy Taylor, Richard Southall, Dave Oester, or any of the other \\"name\\" investigators of \\"things that go bump in the night\\". This is a good book and it deserves a wide readership. Buy it, read it. You'll find it quite practical, level-headed, perceptive, and credible. And then look up the guy's website and order the VHS \\"Alone In A Haunted House\\" from him. In it he takes YOU on an \\"overnight\\" and shows all this equipment in use. Then he shows you the results of the photography sessions and sound recording analyses. You will find it both interesting and informative. And if you don't know what an \\"orb\\" is going into this, you will before the tape is through (at least you'll know what one LOOKS like...\\"paras\\" will argue all day over exactly what it IS!). Watch the tape, read the book. Joshua P. Warren is for real. He can't help it if he looks like your little brother...he's a prodigy whose intellect is a bit out ahead of your run-of-the-mill \\"ghostbuster's\\". And, since he lives and works out of Asheville, NC, only about 55 miles north of me, I think I may hunt him up one of these days and say \\"Let's go hunt some haint's, fella\\"!!!

It has a companion booklet to order separately that includes &quot;all the solutions to the exercises, done step by step and a true Basic software for Pcs or Macs."},{"Title":"Encounters with Chaos","review":"In the field of chaotic dynamics, does there exist _the_ standard textbook for undergrads? I think not. Still, in most colleges, _chaos_ is a subtopic you briefly go through (most of the time just \`skipped' through) while studying differential equations, mathematical physics or classical physics. To be competely honest, my impression is that those \`\`subtopics'' usually don't make a good intro to chaotic dynamics, either. I have read some textbooks targeted at undergraduates and Gulick's was not too bad to skim through what we have in chaotic dynamics. However, Gulick pays too much attention on the basics (analysis and differential equations) and this may seem such a waste of space given the limited number of pages (some two hundreds). Naturally, his explanations are not detailed and gives the impression that things are done rather hastily. But, I must say, this book is superier to some other books that spends time neither on the basics nor the analytic aspects of chaotic dynamics."},{"Title":"Encounters with Chaos","review":"In short, everything that a textbook should be. Granted, I had a very good professor who explained the concepts well, but it follows that he would choose a good textbook. Takes a pure mathematics approach with a strong emphasis on proofs and iterated function maps, rather than applications and differential equations. Nonetheless, the text is extremely accessible and should be understandable to most people with only a minimum (first year) of university-level mathematics, or even to a determined highschool graduate."},{"Title":"Encounters with Chaos","review":"I had to use this book for a class I took at Bryn Mawr college called &quot;Chaotic Dynamical Systems&quot;. There are some mistakes in the book, although I don't remember specifically what they were, and my instructor had to point some of them out. The book, to my knowledge, only covers discrete dynamical systems, and contrary to what the above reviewer says, there is some real analysis involved: i.e. some proofs and definitions involving epsilon and delta. That's about all I can say because I don't remember the book very well, and we only got through about half of it. I recall that most people in my class didn't like the book very much either."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"This series is a wonderful one with vividly drawn and sympathetic characters, interesting plots, and plenty of intrigue. It's just a shame that the U.S. publisher does not keep up with Robb's U.K. publisher. I'm such a big Candace Robb fan, I order her books from Amazon.com.uk and am presently completing The Cross-Legged Knight--the eighth in the series, in case anyone wants to pick it up used before U.S. publication."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I was a little disappointed in Candace Robb's latest. I have always thought that the relationship between Owen and Lucie is what makes the series special, but in A Gift of Sanctuary, Owen is in Wales the whole time, Lucie doesn't appear at all, and Owen hardly even refers to her. The great female characters (Lucie, Magda, Bess) are wholly absent, as is the rivetingly good/evil Archbishop Thoresby. It's nice to spend more time with Geoffrey Chaucer and Sir Robert D'Arby, however, and Michaelo is more complex in the book than is his wont. It was nice to learn more of Owen's family, too, though it would have been nicer to see more of them. My biggest disappointment with the book is that it doesn't really seem to be part of the series. Altogether, A Gift of Sanctuary seems to be a transition of some sort, as if, when we return with Owen to York, it will somehow be completely different."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I can do little but agree with other reviewers who found this book a bit confusing, both for the large number of characters and names (many of which were both similar and unfamiliar) and the overly convoluted and multiple plot lines. In addition, I missed the interaction of Owen with other series \\"regulars\\" such as his wife Lucie, the inn keeper Bess, et. al.Of course, Robb -- even at her weakest to date -- does a decent job of story telling, with authentic details and interesting characterizations. If her previous books hadn't set the bar so high, and raised my expectations, I might have given this book four stars. I'll definitely continue with the series and hope they get back to more familiar and enjoyable ground."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"A dramatis personae would go a long way toward making this book easier to follow. I'm sure there's a historical or literary reason for many of the character names, but for a modern reader, especially one like me who is interrupted frequently by small children, simple names would be better. An editor could have helped Robb more than the Mediev-L listserv. Examples of confusion: Dafydd, Dyfrig and St. David's all introduced in one paragraph on page 23. (I had forgotten that Dafydd had been mysteriously introduced in the prologue because I'd read it on the previous day - oh, the life of a mom). Dafydd surely must be Welsh for David anyway. So what's the point? Then we have Nest &amp; Cadwy, Dafydd's 2 dogs (who didn't need to be named at all) and Madog &amp; Cadwal, Dafydd's 2 servants. I thought Madog &amp; Cadwal were the dogs through the entire book. Well, you get my point about the names. By the way, I did thoroughly enjoy her earlier mysteries."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I have yet to be disappointed by one of Robb's books. She knows her subject perfectly, and uses her knowledge so that the story has just the right amount of the historical in it, along with the rest. Owen Archer is as &quot;real&quot; as ever, though I was a bit sorry not to see more of his life with Lucie and children. I also find the details referring to herbs, the apothecary etc, interesting and was sorry not to have more. Let's hope that Owen stays home in the next one!"},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"Although I missed Lucie and the apothecary motif, Owen's excursion into Wales was extremely interesting, particularly since it allowed Robb to give us the lovely contrast between the traditional Welsh bard and the courtly poet (Chaucer). As usual, Robb does her research and gives a source or two for those interested in delving into the actual history. The mystery itself in satisfyingly complex, and the soul-searching that Owen must do enriches an already sympathetic character. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"In 1370 Owen Archer has mixed feelings about returning to his birthplace Wales, a land he has not visited in years. Owen is not returning for a pleasure visit. Instead, he has been assigned to select forty archers to make up two vintaines to help fight off the expected French invasion. He also escorts his father-in-law on a pilgrimage to the Welsh St. David's Cathedral.John the Gaunt assigns Geoffrey Chaucer to accompany Owen on his quest. While in Wales, they need to determine whether the Duke of Lancaster can stop an invasion. However, even before they arrive, things go wrong. Treachery is everywhere and murders have occurred, leaving it up to Owen to uncover the culprit's identity in order to ascertain who remains loyal to John.A GIFT OF SANCTUARY, the sixth Archer Medieval mystery, is a great and complex who-done-it. The mystery elements and the feel of the era are brilliantly described. The characters add much realism and having Chaucer as a major player blended into story line is a gift that makes the novel seem even more genuine. However, what makes this one of the top tales in this superb series is the incredible execution by Candace Robb is the in depth personalities of Archer's family. This novel is right on target.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I think this is my favorite so far of the Owen Archer series. It certainly gives one much to think about. Although A Gift of Sanctuary takes place in Wales and lacks the Archbishop's Spy Owen's charismatic wife, Lucy, the apothecary, it does expand on the characters of her father Sir Robert D'Arby and of the Archbishop's secretary, the mercurial Brother Michaelo. These are characters with which the reader has become familiar in earlier works. When the elderly knight and the irritating brother are thrown together as companions on pilgrimage to a sacred site in Wales and travel with Owen who is on a mission for the Duke of Lancaster, the reader has the opportunity to know them better. Both individuals grown in depth throughout the story, adding human interest to the story of murder and love betrayed. Indeeed, the story focuses as much on the development of these two people as it does on the mystery itself.Haunting too is the tale of Owen's long separation from his family and of the many changes that are wrought by time in one's absence from home. In the years during which the action takes place, travel is a dangerous pursuit undertaken only rarely and then usually for religious or commercial reasons. Most people had not travelled more than a few miles from their home. For Owen, who left home years before to become an archer for the Duke of Lancaster, returning home to Wales is a bitter sweet experience at best.Interesting too is the reintroduction of the poet Chauce--he appeared in an earlier story as well--and of a Welsh bard (with whose name I am unfamiliar). Both add some comic relief to the story, especially Dafydd ap Gwilym who plays a wise fool throughout. I took a class in Middle English, reading Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, when I was working on my MA in history, and although I struggled through the unfamiliar and vaguely familiar words of the poetry, I never learned much about the man himself. Robb's recreation of his personality, while it may not be perfectly accurate is probably not far from the truth.Again the author provides an interesting summation of the history of the period, including the political climate of the Welsh-English frontier of the 14th Century."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I had a bit of trouble at first sorting out all the characters and relationships, but after that, I really enjoyed the Welsh history and the intricate plot, its twists and the development of Owen Archer as a character. I already had a week's vacation to the UK planned, and this novel inspired me to spend part of it in west Wales, checking out some of the sites in the plot (St. David's Cathedral, the Bishops Palace, Whitesands Bay, Kidwelly). Incredibly beautiful country, and the travelling would indeed be rough going without benefit of modern roads and vehicles. Having read the book helped me imagine life in the earlier times of Wales. It's good historical fiction as well as an engrossing mystery."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I love these books and have read everyone now. This one is as a good as the others. I am glad that Owen has finally returned to Wales for a time. Brother Michelo's growth is fascinating."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"Spring 1369, Owen Archer, one-time soldier and spy is out recruiting archers for the Duke of Lancaster, but he is also on a mission to find out whether the Duke's own steward is betraying him to the Welsh rebels. Trouble goes before them and a body in the Duke's livery is left at the city gates.All of Candace Robb's novels have great appeal to those interested in the medieval period and this one is no exception. Owen Archer is a believable hero and the area of York in which he lived is not too far from my own home which lends a extra dimension to the novels from me."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"I agree totally with the reader who wrote that a simple list of characters would have helped. I too, thought the names were very confusing, Dafydd, Dyfrid, the dogs names so close to the men's names...ahhh. The names were also very long. I found myself having to go backwards to read to figure it all out. It was more work than enjoyment. I have read about 5 other Candance Robb books and I enjoyed this one the least. The others were very good."},{"Title":"Gift of Sanctuary (Owen Archer Mysteries 06)","review":"How do I rate the best thus far in a series of 5-star books?!?! If there were more stars, this book would get them from me. I read it in one day, devoured it like Belgian chocolates. What can I say? I loved the journey through Wales, the pilgrimage. It was great to meet Martin the Fleming again (Jasper's old friend). Sir Robert and Michaelo were wonderful. Tangwystl, yes what a beautiful name. It was fascinating to find out Owen's feelings upon revisiting Wales, crossing the Severn, meeting up with countrymen and family. The author does a phenomenal job of characterizations. The bard Daffyd was fascinating, as were his friends Cadwall and the two dogs. Great books, all of them so far, but this is my favorite.

Being from Rand McNally, it reads like one of their excellent \\"Landmark Books\\" for young people that were very popular back in the 1950s and early 1960s. A note from Cavanah says, \\"In writing the story of Abraham Lincoln, the author depended primarily on Lincoln's own statements and on the statements of his family and friends who had firsthand knowledge of his everyday life. In instances when dialogue had to be imagined, the conversation might logically have taken place in light of known circumstances. Such descriptive details were necessarily added based on authentic accounts of pioneer times.\\" The book begins with Abe's birth on Feb. 12, 1809, and focuses primarily on his younger years, growing up in Kentucky, moving with his family to Indiana, losing his mother Nancy, gaining a step-mother Sarah Bush Lincoln, going to school, taking a raft of goods to New Orleans, then moves on to his settling in Illinois, and finally ends with his winning the Presidency of the United States.

I came away thinking that reading was the key to getting ahead in life - a feeling that has stayed with me to this day. I owe my passion for reading to this book. This passion has stayed with me to this day. Any time I leave the house I carry a book with me so that if there is a delay, I can spend the time in a book.

I highly recommend this book to youngsters."},{"Title":"Abe Lincoln Gets His Chance","review":"When I was in second grade (in about 1959), I belonged to the Weekly Reader book club and this book was one of the selections that was sent to me. I loved it and read it again and again over the years.

It is a good way to introduce children (second through fourth grade, perhaps?) to Abraham Lincoln and the way he grew up. It is a good lesson in making the most of the resources you have (since he had so very little for a good portion of his life). Reading this makes the reader want to learn more about this interesting man---possibly paving the way for more \\"historical\\" accounts of his life as the reader grows up. The format is as promised----it appears to be be typewritten on good quality paper. In lieu of the illustrations you get a notation that the \\"illustration goes here\\" or something to that effect.

It has about 124 pages and it is a biography written in story form. The author uses the third person point of view. This 00.story takes place at Abe's cabin when Abe was a little boy living in Kentucky in the year 1809.This book is based on how Lincoln grew up and what he wanted to be when he grew up. The book is based on authentic accounts of pioneer times and the statements of his family and friends who had firsthand knowledge of his ever day life. I think it is worth reading because it is interesting to learn about one of our presidents who grew up to make the world the way it is now. Most people know him as the guy on the $5.00.One of the main characteristics of Abe was his love of learning. Every night by the fire, he made marks on a wooden shovel to practice his math. Abe worked long hours but still found time to read by staying up late and getting up in the early morning. There was another characteristics described by his cousin Dennis Hanks who said there was something peculiarsome about Abe. Abe liked to walk fifteen miles to Rockport, the country seat, to borrow books from John Pitcher, the town lawyer. His best friend was the person who gave him a book. Abe loved to tell jokes to other people to make everyone feel happy in the valley. Everyone called him honest Abe because he was always honest to everyone and everyone was honest to him.One of the conflicts in this story was when Abe didn't have enough confidence in the fact that people wood vote for him.

He turned this fantasy into a fast paced adventure story about two boys setting out on the camping trip of their lives. Once the boys proved that they were right they could never share their discovery without betraying the bones that they found in the cave at the top of the mountain. David Budbill won the Dortho Canfield Fisher Book Award fo this book. The school children of Vermont voted this book the best on published during 1978 and it has been a popular one here in Vermont ever since.

This book has a dark and atmospheric feel to it, complicated emotional tensions and, yes, a little terror, but nevertheless if your children are bright and courageous readers, you should not deny them the opportunity of going on this adventure. Don't be surprised if they come back from it with a far-away, mature look in their eyes---like the protaganists!"},{"Title":"Bones on Black Spruce Mountain","review":"I have just recently discovered the joys of reading. After being forced to read in grade school and high school, I never really took it upon myself to read for pure enjoyment. Then with College, you read so many textbooks, why would you ever want to pick up a book and read if you're not getting paid or making a grade? Well, it's books like this that you can think back on and relive.Aside from the Hardy Boys and some Stephen King, this is the only book that I chose to read for fun. Remembering back, it was probably the title that grabbed me, as I was always an odd kid that liked metal music from the age of 8 (Metallica and Iron Maiden). I remember really enjoying this book and while I was compiling a list of the very few books I've read in my life, this was the one I couldn't quite remember the title. I knew I read a book (yes, a - one - book) when I was about 11-13, but couldn't quite remember the title. Well, this is it! I typed in \\"bones mountain\\" into a book search engine and this is what popped up. I have since ordered the book and can't wait to read it.As those times that you want to relive some old memories creep up, I'm glad I read this as a kid, cause it's something that I can go back to and enjoy reading again.

By way of full disclosure, I met Neal Petersen on November 3, 2005 and spent five days sailing with him on a passage from Connecticut to Bermuda. That time with him prompted the purchase and reading of this book. He is a fantastic guy with a truly inspiring story. The book recounts Neal's life story and struggle against the odds to reach his dream of racing a sail boat alone around the world. At every turn there are choices. Listen to the naysayers or pursue what appears to be an impossible dream. Throughout the story there are detractors and supporters. This book has drama, adventure, romance, and inspiration. This is a story not only about Neal's adventures sailing, but about how to live life to the fullest. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"Journey Of A Hope Merchant: From Apartheid To The Elite World Of Solo Yacht Racing","review":"If you are a fan of solo ocean sailing, you will enjoy this book. It is an easy read and covers a lot of territory including two OSTAR races, the 1994 BOC Challenge and the 1998 Around Alone. There are several well written accounts of near disaster at sea, such as being run down by a Russian freighter during one OSTAR race and a horrific storm just before rounding Cape Horn during the 1998 Around Alone. It is easy to understand why the author's boat was named \\"No Barriers\\". This is quite an inspiring story of survival and perserverance, especially given the fact that the author is a person of color and grew up in South Africa during the apartheid era. There are other trials and tribulations along the way as well that have nothing to do with sailing, but add greatly to the story and make this more than a good sailing novel."},{"Title":"Journey Of A Hope Merchant: From Apartheid To The Elite World Of Solo Yacht Racing","review":"I heard Neal Petersen speak and by the time I got to the table to by his book, he was sold out.

It is the one rule that dominates the life of its author, Neal Petersen.I had the pleasure of being in an audience where Mr. Petersen happened to be the keynote speaker. An author and motivational presenter, he held the attention of all attendees, especially me.Neal Petersen was born with a physical disability in South Africa during its apartheid years. As a child he was determined to overcome all adversities, a trait that not only guided him through life but also helped him stake his claim as the first black man to race a homemade boat single-handedly around the world.In his book, \\"Journey of a Hope Merchant\\" and recipient of the 2005 National Outdoor Book Award, Mr. Petersen has the reader join him on his journey through life and particularly on this solo journey in the 1998-99 \\"Around Alone\\" yacht race. Throughout the book, the reader is gripped with the determination of Mr. Petersen as well as his endurance, ingenuity and particularly his sense of survival.Right from the book's prologue by his wife, Darlene Kristi-Petersen, one becomes immediately tuned into the reality that Mr. Petersen is a man driven by his dreams. From an impoverished youth to achieving world recognition, two university degrees and author and coauthor of ten books, one can only picture Mr. Petersen as a consummate achiever.As I write this review, I refrain from telling the story of Mr. Petersen's challenges at sea. That I'll save for the reader, as I will the many other chapters in his life where he continues to tell us the importance of dreaming. The importance he teaches us is that dreams are not simply for dreamers but are the roadmaps to be followed, challenged and achieved."},{"Title":"Journey Of A Hope Merchant: From Apartheid To The Elite World Of Solo Yacht Racing","review":"I would not call this a sailing book. Rather it is a story of a crippled boy from Capetown, who found freedom in swimming, diving, and sailing, and had a dream to sail around the world alone in the greatest of all races, inspired by these yachts and racing sailors who visited this port. The Author, who grew up in a middle class neighborhood in South Africa had to endure racism in his struggle to achieve his dream. Along the way, he found many sailors willing to help, and many other people who contributed to his life journey. It will melt you heart to read about the many wonderful people who helped Neal Accomplish this seemingly impoosible goal. It renewed my faith in the best of human nature.This is the sort of book I'd give a young child for inspiration. It is proof that man can overcome most obstacles with only the most basic of tools--literacy. This is a lesson that should be taught to all children.Neal makes his living as a motivational speaker. I finished the book, wanting to hear him speak. And I'd like to sail with him.The book is an easy read. I found myself reading until 3 am and finished it the next day. I give this book 4 stars because it is not the sort of book I would re-read. It is not the sort of book I need to inspire myself. However, a good book to read once and then pass on to your friends.The was one point in the book where I found myself gravely disappointed. I was saddened to read in Neals account that Brad Van Liew, one of this competitors, accused him of cheating by using his engine. Any competitor has a right to face fair competition and ask for an inquiry. If he proved it false then he should let the matter drop instead of whining about it. He also complained that Van Liew stole his sponsors. Should American sponsors support a non-American? Sounds like sour grapes too me.The bottom line is Neal's story is inspirational.

I am very bad at figuring out endings to mysetry novels, but this one was so painfully obvious.

Action happens in the 1870's in Marseilles, France, where a young and naif sailor, back from West Indies, is engaged by a couple of conspirators to smuggle guns and ammunition for the Carlist army, with the idea of putting King Carlos back in the throne of Spain. All this is almost exactly what happened to Conrad, all which is partially narrated in the &quot;Tremolino&quot; chapter of his beatiful book The Mirror of the Sea, as well as in the souvenir book entitled Some Reminiscences. The Arrow of Gold is a book of Conrad's maturity. It was not well received in his time and Conrad himself was not fully happy with it. But it is a deeply moving and funny novel, full of adventures, fascinating ladies, charming crooks, bizarre characters and sharp descritions of places and milieu. All this in a neat prose, now free from the philosophical statements or stylistic refinements that at times burden some of the works of the great Master. In summary, a rather forgotten book by the author of Lord Jim, Nostromo and so many masterpieces, which deserves to be &quot;discovered&quot; by old and new Conrad devotees."},{"Title":"The Arrow of Gold","review":"This is, as another reviewer put it, a different Conrad at work. Contrasted to the detached narration of the classic Nostromo or even Marlowe's insightful presence in Lord Jim, Heart of Darkness, and Chance, Conrad delves much deeper into the story here with a protagonist first person narration. And, this tale of first love seems deeply personal. If you ever thought that there is more to love than three simple words, then read this book. Nowhere else, to my knowledge, has Conrad shared so much of his own views on the mystery and power of love. And, he does so with so many beautiful passages. Or, as Henry James described, so many meandering discourses that surround a thought or idea from all angles, but ultimately fails to fully identify it.Whereas in the Rescue Conrad paired a love story with high adventure, the love story here is the main event. Although the protagonist is running guns, such is only recounted in passing. Consequently, the reader is left with a bare view of the romance (at least from the man's perspective), and I think Conrad's ideas on love come across better than in the Rescue. As with that novel and to a lesser extent Conrad's stories A Smile of Fortune and the Planter of Malata, the reader is left wondering why some things cannot seem to be resolved in Conrad's world between two lovers. In Chance, love conquered the circumstances and personalities, so we know Conrad thought it possible, but the Arrow of Gold suggests his opinion that this is the exception and not the rule. And, maybe that is for the best sometimes.Characteristically, the novel is a slow starter, but once you make it through the first hundred pages or so, you'll be drawn into the psychological, romantic adventure. The dialogue is quite dramatic by today's standards, but it never bothered me. Rather, I was struck by the thoughtfully deliberate speech of the characters. The art of conversation, I suspect, is lost on modern generations, with so much entertainment around us all of the time.The themes and message in The Arrow of Gold rank with Conrad's best efforts, though the dramatic presentation is not as sophisticated or groundbreaking as in Nostromo or Lord Jim. So, while it is not Conrad's masterpiece in terms of the novel itself, I found it to be very powerful narrative worthy of more attention than it has received, which hopefully will change now that the Arrow of Gold is back in print."},{"Title":"The Arrow of Gold","review":"There does seem to be a diminution of power in this novel in comparison with Conrad's better known works (Leavis called it \\"a bad novel, one of Conrad's worst things\\"). One looks in vain for Conrad's trademark intensity. The characters seem to inhabit a landscape bare of Conrad's usual scenery--forests, sunsets, rainfall, the sea: only the mistral blows hauntingly through the action to satisfy the reader's imaginative demands. However, in this novel Conrad seems to be attempting something different: the solitude of the individual soul. Atmospheric effects are subordinate to the narrator's struggle with himself; the outer world barely impinges on the inner drama.It is the story of a young man, the narrator, Monsieur George, who, through a chance meeting with two older men, becomes involved in running guns for the Carlist movement (pretending to the throne of Spain). He falls in love with a woman involved in the movement, Dona Rita, a heiress, formerly a goat-herd. Their passion is consummated, but, in typically Conradian fashion, all falls apart unhappily. Monsieur George is nearly killed in a duel with Captain Blunt, one of the two men who brought Monsieur George into the Carlist movement (Captain Blunt is also in love with Dona Rita); and, when he recovers, Dona Rita leaves him. All that is left to Monsieur George is the arrow of gold, which he loses at sea.In places The Arrow of Gold seems to look forward to Eliot's \\"dead patrol\\" (\\"Little Gidding\\", Four Quartets), but in comparison with Eliot Conrad seems to offer less sense of salvation (\\"all manner of thing shall be well\\"). At the end we seem to be clutching the wretched stalks of disappointment (Larkin). Milton's portrayal of Satan and the evil angels in hell seems to be the progenitor of much of the writing in The Arrow of Gold."},{"Title":"Adobe PageMill 3 f/x and Design: Everything You Need to Know about Designing and Maintaining a Dynamic Web Site","review":"I appreciated the color inserts with examples of good websites.

The attached CD-ROM (to this book) needs a thumbnail or guide to the graphics files that are on it, and an Acrobat file with more detailed explanations of the software enclosed would be a fine addition to the disk.Overall, with this book, the getting started manual and the User Guide (which I printed from the Acrobat file; whew! 200 pages!) I was able to get a fairly sophisticated site out with a minimum of hair-pulling and teeth-gnashing.PageMill 3 F/X could also use a more comprehensive index, and perhaps a PageMill menu map to help novices navigate the program.All in all, a good book that complements the program.

It is not the first time that I learn a program from a textbook and I have generally obtained good results. I also tried to perform the tasks indicated in the projects with the help of more skilled people, so either the CD ROM provided with the book does not work properly or there is something missing in the text.

Along his rise to the top, he has a mental breakdown, and one of his biggest fans, Warrior Angel, comes to save him and put him back on the right trail to stardom. This book was somewhat confusing. I couldn't tell who the narrator was sometimes. Besides that, it's not too long, but it's not too short. I have also read other stories in the series by the same author. In my opinion, the other novels were better. The Contender, The Brave, and The Chief are all more exciting. I think Warrior Angel is not as exciting because it does not have as good of a plot as the others did. It just talks about Sonny Bear's struggle to be the best. The other novels have more problems going on throughout them. Still, if you like action and sports (mainly boxing) you should enjoy this book, but you have to read The Contender first, because Warrior Angel is its sequel. So what do you think, does Sonny Bear make it to the top with the help of Warrior Angel?"},{"Title":"Warrior Angel","review":"I teach the novel The Contender to my 8th grade classes. Every year I have students who want sequels, and since I had previously purchased both The Brave and The Chief, this year I added Warrior Angel to our library. My students who have read it enjoyed it. While The Contender is one of my favorite novels to teach, personally I think Lipsyte should have abandoned this track. The characters are plastic, the action is confusing, and the mystical overtones just don't cut it. Sorry, Mr. Lipsyte. Keep punching!"},{"Title":"On Cabrini Green","review":"If the name Cabrini Green has a familiar ring, it should. It's one of Chicago's infamous housing projects where gangbangers and dope peddlers rule--and even cops don't want to make housecalls there. That's why Chicago PD created a special Task Force assigned only to the projects. Cabrini is foreign turf--no place for fools or innocents.That's also why author Charlie Shafer is able to tell a good tale about Cabrini Green. Before he retired, he wore the TF shoulder patch as a Chicago cop.On Cabrini Green features Sgt. Paul Kostovic, a member of the TF Force. However, he makes a dumb mistake. He loses his gun stopping a carjack/robbery in progress. The driver of the car, a diamond salesman, is robbed. Gunshots are exchanged between Kostovic and the bad guys. A bystander is shot and killed. He turns out to be a Columbian diplomat, which is not good news for him or for Kostovic. Fortunately, the bullet that killed the man wasn't fired from Kostovic's weapon. Unfortunately, his gun is now in the hands of either Dittybop Caldwell or Shoestring Tolliver, &quot;dedicated street thieves.&quot; Kostovic knows them because they live in Cabrini. He also knows they are not smart enough or skilled enough to have planned this carjack and heist alone. Someone put them up to it.The cop talk in this book is authentic but surprisingly, has little hard core swearing. The cop humor--often of the gallows variety--is ladeled out in chuckles, sometimes in belly laughs. Kostovic is not a burned-out cynic, though he is asking the question: why stay on the force? What good is he doing? He's saddled on the case with an inept homicide detective, a baby-faced rookie cop for a partner, and a legal aid volunteer, a public defender in the making. She's very antagonistic toward Kostovic and also very attractive. By way of family backgrounds, it turns out she's Serbian, and he's Croatian--a volatile mix. All of which, does lead to an interesting if not challenging romantic angle.On Cabrini Green provides a fascinating and intriguing slice of cop life. Based on this first book of Shafer's--and his cop column that runs in Blue Murder, a mystery ezine--readers can expect more good stories to follow."},{"Title":"On Cabrini Green","review":"Just reading about the &quot;wagon&quot; men is enough to warrant getting this book. The dialogue alone is worth the price of admission. On Cabrini Green shows the lighter side of a cop's life.

This book was a fun read."},{"Title":"On Cabrini Green","review":"If you're looking for Officer Friendly, don't bother to read Shafer's book.

If you are interested in the &quot;end times&quot; and the invisible (to most) forces that permeate this world, then you will be blown away by what is revealed here. Mr. Danielou offers his reader a truely staggering and comprehensive explanation of the Cycles of Time (we are now living in the Twilight of the most dark and dense cycle, the Kali Yuga or the Age of Conflict &amp; Confusion); a profound understanding of how consciousness creates reality (an ancient metaphysical precept, way before any 'new age'); exact symptoms of the Kali Yuga (including 'pre-cooked food will be readily available' - meaning the ancients knew that fast food would be herald a degenerate civilization); and a list of the events that occur as this final cycle of Time brings the inevitable dissolution of the world.As I have been urging my friends to read this book for years, I have been praying that Inner Traditions would reprint it. While anything that Alain Danielou wrote will open your mind and alter your consciousness, this may have been his most valuable book."},{"Title":"While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind","review":"If the Kali Yuga is the age of false religion then it is up to a chosen few to attempt to penetrate to the true root of an earlier age. If your goal is to cut to the core of the perennial religion then this book will point you closer to that goal then you have ever approached it before. Sometimes it takes a genius outsider to open your eyes.If you have become a comfortable student of the Vedas then this book will dispel that comfort. It will come as a slap in the face. Even if you were quite aware that your Advaita Vedanta was not the primary current of Hinduism in modern India this book will still shake you. One does not expect to hear Sankaracharya described as, \\"a deceitful demon who had perverted the teaching of the Brahma Sutra to lead souls astray.\\" Nor does one expect to hear that Vaishnavism is a relatively new religion- modeled on atheistic Jainism- a flawed religion for the flawed Kali Yuga. Just the story of the false prophet Arihat and the fall of the Assurs makes this a worthwhile book.You see, the Vedas are the teachings of the Aryan Brahmans. It would seem that which is of true value (and there is much of true value) came from the earlier Dravidian culture and their ecstatic, shamanistic, Shiva-based practice. The Apollonian appropriation of the Aryans is intended to protect a conservative and puritanical social order. Anything leading to true God-union was appropriated from the earlier Dravidian culture and its roots in the prior age. This culture survived as a parallel civilization to the Aryan- its teachings by necessity became occult. Indeed Shaivism, Tantricism, the wandering Sadhus, are a stronger living influence on Hinduism than that of Vedas.Read this book for it is like breaking through to an entirely deeper level of understanding. There is so much more here to be assimilated. Next I will have to read the author's SHIVA AND DIONYSUS.Far from having my beliefs shaken I feel that I have tapped a root closer to the Source.

Stilted puritanism supplanted ecstatic mystical communion and rejuvenating eros, and moralistic, materialistic society that restrains the life-principle and individual liberty in the name of the common good and productivity became predominant.If one examines \\"modern yoga\\"--which I have devoted my life to studying and practicing--this \\"degeneration\\" is evidenced in the ascendancy of exclusive-reductive, low (or non)-Energy Hatha, Raja, and Jnana Yoga (Advaita Vedanta), while the superior tantric Dharmas, such as Kashmir Shaivism and Daism , have been marginalized. Divine Yoga, the highest yoga, based on directly, immediately, and ecstatically uniting one's consciousness (siva ) with wild, \\"dancing\\" Light-energy (Shakti) is hardly to be found--probably because this \\"Crazy Wisdom\\" yoga, at its root, threatens the conventional, mainstream values that reflect the Kali Yuga.Even if the Aryan Invasion is a mere myth, as the negative reviewers of this book contend, Danielou's arguments still make for an interesting read. And as the esteemed scholar Thomas Mc Evilley makes clear in the chapter \\"The Aryan Invasion\\" in his marvelous text The Shape of Ancient Thought, compelling arguments can be made that foreign intruders did in fact shape India's spiritual and cultural destiny.Danielou is an esoteric thinker, and this book is teeming with information and insights that I have not encountered elsewhere. If you're looking to have your brain jostled by a brilliant, outside-the-box tantric scholar, you'll find this book a wonderful read."},{"Title":"While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind","review":"Alain Dani&eacute;lou. While The Gods Play. Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions International, 1987. Paperback, 284 pages. ISBN 0892811153.I realized I had made a mistake buying this book when, on reaching page 4, I found that the author actually believed in the \\"Aryan Invasion Theory,\\" a myth for which there is not the slightest shred of evidence, which Indian thinkers have long held in contempt, and which has been scientifically demolished by scholars, for example, of the caliber of Shrikant G. Talageri in hisAryan Invasion Theory (A Reapraisal)(see my review of this book).Danielou, however, ignoring all such scholarship, goes on to base his entire book on the exploded notion that sexually inhibited \\"Aryans\\" from the West invaded and conquered India, bringing with them an arid and puritanical Vedic religion which suppressed but didn't entirely uproot the native, wholesome, and much more fun erotic and orgiastic Shaivite religion.Now then, many years ago as a child I visited India and can distinctly recall marveling wide-eyed, as kids will do, at the Shaivite yogis with their Shiva tridents stuck in the ground beside them as they sat cross-legged by the Ganges chanting \\"namah shivaya\\" - strapping, ash-smeared, matted-haired, handsome young men, naked except for a heavy brass chain around their waist with a bit of cloth slipped through it to cover their private parts and so as not to offend (as Dani&eacute;lou would have it) the more orthodox \\"puritanical\\" Hindus.These young men were an impressive sight indeed, and after reading further and learning that the Shaiva revival was led by a man called Lakulisha, a figure whose representations \\"portray him as a naked yogin ... with his penis erect\\" (p.29), and that in Shaivism \\"there exist no taboos or restrictions concerning the variants of eroticism\\" (p.151) I began to suspect an agenda.This agenda seems to derive out of Dani&eacute;lou's acknowledged 'sexual preference' and has led him throughout the book to make all manner of extravagant assertions which are unsupported by any real evidence and most of which he does not bother to document at all.The book has very few notes, a bibliography which consists largely of obscure Indian texts that have never been translated, and is written in a dull dry plodding and unimaginative style which overwhelms us with potted history and a welter of unfamiliar names but which never actually gets around to presenting any concrete realities - people, objects, places, events - to our imagination, although it is brought home to us that Shaivism clearly has a powerful appeal (at least for a certain type of Westerner) with its handsome naked youths, phallus worship, absence of sexual taboos and ecstatic and orgiastic carryings-on with an occasional human sacrifice (p.28) thrown in for good measure.Thanks, but no thanks.There are many good books on Indian culture. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. It's just too agenda-driven to be trustworthy."},{"Title":"While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind","review":"This is one of the most important books I've ever read. Maybe the most important. The other reviewers detracting from it seem to have a very IRRELEVANT bone to pick with it and nitpick from little glass houses. Ignore them.The author explains our times from something that was passed on and then written down 6,000 years ago (Writing itself is a symptom of this Age. The Vedas weren't written down until the 500s BCE). That's right, millennia ago. It explains the Twilight of our Age, what's going to happen and expect a HARD ride and for most of you complete annihilation. No, he doesn't give you a popsicle and a pat on the head saying \\"Its all better now, Timmy!\\" He just gives his analysis and its very grim. Then again, in some ways not really because how long can we go like we've been? Seriously! Poisoning everything around us, constant never-ending war, pathological lying from humans to NGOs to Corporations to Governments. Its the Age of Confusion ( the End Times). Look at Fukushima and Chernobyl. There are hundreds of these plants all over the world. Fukushima may have killed Japan and even the Pacific if it really goes to hell. Look how ineffectual we are and the stupid incompetence dealing with this. This is in a country that has great discipline and intelligence I can't imagine anywhere else.In my OPINION (mine alone) I think we're doomed. This book explains WHY to a good depth on the subject. We've outlived our usefulness. We are a pox upon creation. We will be eliminated as we are degenerates and deserve out just fates."},{"Title":"While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind","review":"Coming from an old aristocratic French family, Danielou had a strong urge to break out of devout bourgeois circles. He went to India and immersed himself into the study of Hindustani classical music and Sanskrit.So far, so wonderful. But it turns out that Danielou was a nasty human being.He and his life-long lover, the heir of Nestle, intensely hated any struggle for equality and yearned for a cosmic reaffirmation of old hierarchies. Correspondingly, it was not difficult for Danielou to espouse some of the most reactionary interpretations of Indian history. The Kali Yuga that we live in came about because of the intermixture of castes (read \\"classes\\") and only a philosopher-king who would impose an ancient social structure could save us. Incidentally, this is also where the Indological aspect becomes merely a veneer, and Danielou is closer to Plato than he would have liked to admit.In short, this book does not have much to do with Lord Shiva or Shaivism. Don't get me wrong: I'd love a good apocalypse as much as any disillusioned decent person on this planet. But Danielou doesn't want that, and his naked male ascetics have to be refined, not coming from the ranks of hoi polloi. Women and the non-aristocrats have to shut up and be grateful that they're alive. I imagine Shiva on Kailash, playing with Parvati while only wearing a tiger skin, shaking his head: \\"Alain, you had the best of intentions, but try again...\\"If you agree with Danielou politically, by all means enrich whoever inherited the copyright. If you are genuinely interested in Shaivism, I'd recommend you read the works of Kashmiri Shaivism, aka Trika. One page of Abhinavagupta matches a thousand pages by Danielou, even in terms of sheer joy of life, not just theology.PS: As a comment for the reader who is gently telling me to \\"s*ck it up\\". Not to you, sir, and not today.Two points: Danielou's personal and moral failings very much reflect on his scholarship. His former student and devotee, Jean-Louis Gabin, recently wrote a book in which he demonstrates that his former mentor had the tendency to distort any evidence he disliked. A relevant quote:En 2004, \\"Histoire de l'Inde\\" de Dani&eacute;lou est publi&eacute;e aux Etats-Unis, et je vais en porter des exemplaires &agrave; d'anciens disciples de Swmi Karptr, dont le Mahant Veer Bha-dra Mishra, le grand prtre du temple Sankat Mochan, un proche du Shankarshrya, premier pr&eacute;sident du Ram Rajya Parishad [le Conseil du Royaume de Rma], le parti fond&eacute; par Swmi Karptr. Il me rappelle, horrifi&eacute; : \\"Il y a une erreur &eacute;pouvantable...\\" Gravissime, en effet, Dani&eacute;lou faisait du Swmi Karptr le fondateur du Jana Sangh [l'Assembl&eacute;e du Peuple], un parti ultranationaliste, &eacute;manation du RSS [Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sang, Association des Volontaires nationaux] qu'il avait combattu toute sa vie ! Des gens qui n'ont jamais cach&eacute; qu'ils aimeraient faire aux musulmans ce que les nazis ont fait aux juifs. A B&eacute;nar&egrave;s, dans mon quartier, le chef des jeunes du RSS se faisait appeler Hitler...Danielou is an OK musicologist, but an execrable scholar otherwise. Personally, I read Sanskrit and Hindi, and I am not dependent upon his wily interpretations, but I stand by every word here. Back to the kind commentator: as for Ragnarok, methinks you'd feel more at home at a Wagnerian rally than in India. Jedem das Seine, was Herr Danielou schliesslich auch bekommen hat."},{"Title":"Foundations of Vision","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to human vision. It is aimed at students, or engineers who need to deal with human vision, but it can also be interesting for a motivated audience desiring to learn precisely how human vision works. The presentation is very educational, Wandell not only gives the current knowledge about vision, he also explains the method and evidences which lead to these conclusions. This book is a real pleasure to read, which is not always the case for textbooks.It covers the early vision (optical properties, sampling, wavelength), the image representation (retina, cortex, pattern sensitivity, multiresolution) and interpretation (shape, motion, color, depth, illusions)My only concern was that the book puts a lot of emphasis on the notion of linear system, and that this notion is unfortunately explained in a very fuzzy way for my mathematical mind. This comment should be ignored by non mathematician readers."},{"Title":"Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America","review":"Decade of Nightmare chronicles the transformation on 60's liberalism to 80's conservatism. Beginning roughly with the Watergate scandal and continuing through the election of Reagan and into the 80's, Jenkins's sweeps broadly over many of the period's memorable and now forgotten events. The failure of Desert One, Soledad Brother, George Wallace, The Bourne Identity, Anita Bryant, the Wonderland Murders, Granada, Starhawk, NAMBLA, the Scottsboro Boys, and The Illuminatus Trilogy are a mere few of what is touched on. In Jenkins's view other accounts of this time period have not been broad enough focusing on either the political or social histories but not mixing the two, not showing, for example the influence of both conservative politician Daniel Patrick Moynihan and porn star Linda Lovelace had on the growth of conservatism. The public, he says, perceived sexual liberation as leading to porn and snuff films; LSD as leading to the horrors of angel dust; and spiritual experimentation leading to brain washing cults. Far from being the Smiley Face decade, portrayed in films like Dazed and Confused and TV show's like That 70's Show, Jenkins portrays the 70's as a time of stress where the Cold War resurfaced and serial killers were everywhere. This was a decade where Ronald Reagan went from being perceived as an extremist to winning the Presidency. Jenkins provides a context in which to view the major events of the era by reminding us of the forgotten events. For example, the patriotism associated with the US Hockey Team victory against Russia is shown in context with the Iranian hostage crisis, the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, best selling apocalyptic novels, rising inflation, and the unchecked growth of leftist guerillas in Latin America. He also explains how liberals became their own worst enemies by, for example, condemning the Israeli's for their raid into Entebbe, Uganda to rescue a hundred Jewish hostages. The book is a fast and easy read and refreshingly non-partisan. For a subject as loaded as this one, it would be easy to demonize one side or the other, the liberal or conservatives, but Jenkins avoids this trap and doesn't editorialize - with a few possible exceptions that Reagan conservatives may find unappealing. Sometimes it is too easy for Jenkins to draw parallels between the 70's and today although he never blatantly makes such comparison. Considering the subject matter the book could be called breezy since I found myself Googling even Jenkins's barely touches on to find a more detailed account. Overall this is an exceptional book and highly recommended to anyone interested the recent history or understanding the origins of today's politics."},{"Title":"Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America","review":"Actually this book seems to me as more of a cultural than a political study - - (viewing politics as part of and a reaction to cultural trends) - - hence in describing the transition from the \\"radically liberal\\" sixties to the \\"reactionary conservative\\" 80's, Jenkins draws not only from the political events of the era, but also pop culture from movies to TV coverage... The overall arguement being is that the transition was sort of a national hangover. Things seemed out of control - - with the economy in the dumps, and a perception of society breaking down, a wave of domestic and international terror and America feeling isolated on the national stage and on the verge of losing the Cold War. - - The book seems to argue both ways the realities of the national crisises, and at the same time media exploitation of issue made to make people scared as well as identify with a culture of \\"macho\\" and \\"shoot 'em up\\" vs. the cheery idealistic anti-hero. From this perspective we see how Reagan in the eyes of many offering sobering and decisive hope - - whether or not you feel he was the great uniter and saviour of the country or the guy who took from the poor and gave to the rich.All in all, the image of the 70's as being a \\"big hang-over from the 60's\\" has long been a commonly held belief to explain the transition... this is the first book to offer a detailed study of the era beyond mere \\"oil crisis/inflation/hostages\\" - - compared to most the images we have of the 70's - - either in our own memories or by watching VH1, this is the first book to really go into detail.As for what I got out of it -- two words really - - DEJA VU...which in some ways is reassuring (times of trouble may always feel like the end of the world) and other ways scary.Regardless of where you stand on the coin politically, this book will definitely prove interesting, especially if you are old enough to remember some of the events and are now ready to look at them in a (of course debatable!) historical perspective."},{"Title":"Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America","review":"It's a very good history, but I was still a bit disappointed -- Jenkins stayed on the surface of the grimy realities of the 70's, showing us the cultural phenomena and how that phenomena served to create public reaction, but failing to ask to what extent the political revolution of the 70's served to deliberately and callously exploit that public reaction. Any statesman (or aspiring statesman) is aware of the responsibility to educate the public and to ignore its less enlightened notions. The political hack, on the other hand, panders to the public and pretends to do its bidding (passing outrageous legislation, waving the flag, and often doing the bidding of certain moneyed interests).Jenkins gets the facts straight -- yes, the U.S. was in a crisis (Johnson and Nixon, both approximately equal parts statesman and hack, left a very mixed legacy). Yes, Carter was idealistic and, under the circumstances, politically inept. Yes, a variety of manic causes, from imaginary rape statistics to 'the breakdown of traditional values' hit the headlines; Jenkins recounts both the real fears and the hyperbolic reactions. (Contemporary panderers in the media and political office seem to have discovered the trivial issue of obesity; it's the same kind of phenomena Jenkins recounts.) And Jenkins explains how the rhetoric of toughness seemed so desirable under the circumstances.All excellent -- then Jenkins refuses to pass judgment. He does not suggest the possibility of alternative political reactions. The phenomena just 'is' (or was). I suppose I should not complain -- I like reading a work of history rather than a rant. However, I find myself asking if Jenkins is that much of a cultural determinist, and concluding that he may well be. It appears to me Jenkins considers Carter, Reagan, and everything the 70's served to create as inevitable.Again, great summary of the decade, but seems a rather frozen response to what I would see as still 'live' issues."},{"Title":"Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America","review":"I just don't understand the negative first review here.

There are other more definitive studies but this one is fun!

It would have been helpful if the author had decided to follow the evolution of the events in more detail, rather than leave me asking questions like: was this due to a demographic shift due to boomer aging, was it a media circus similar to others in our past or was it the work of a few key individuals with a plan?My final take is that I don't recommend this book, but if he wrote an 800 page book on the same material I would buy it (and read it)."},{"Title":"Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America","review":"Do Americans truly reject \\"a return to the starry-eyed nonjudgmental optimism of the 1960s\\" as Jenkins asserts in his conclusion, or was the 1960s a time of \\"Camelot\\" later destroyed by the politics of innuendo, fear and attack?In the 1950s, President Eisenhower presided over peace, prosperity and progress; in the 1960s. Kennedy added vision, ambition and courage. It was Nixon who shattered this optimism in 1968, and the nation has yet to recover its spiritual soul. The underlying cause is the crushing American defeat in Vietnam, the second time the US suffered such a debacle. Americans lost the War of 1812; then, as now, the response was an inward retreat and a series of devastating wars against isolated and weak enemies. Americans began a systematic destruction of Native American nations and seized more than half of Mexico. After 1975 and the rooftop escape from Saigon, Americans watched US troops storm ashore in countries such as Grenada -- the triumph of the Reagan military build-up -- and watched, with total mystification, the collapse of the Soviet empire.After 1815, the American sense of community based on citizen democracy was lost. Instead, the new focus became a hatred and destruction of outside terrorists, aka Native Americans. Such xenophobia offers a powerful sense of national unity and pride for some; but it doesn't solve internal conflicts. Since 1975, a similar xenophobia has magnified a handful of Islamic terrorists into an international threat. Americans financed IRA terrorists for decades; but are now shocked when facing similar politics of terror.It took almost 50 years for the politics of defeat to blossom into the US Civil War; now, the Iraq debacle, inept domestic policies and a contempt for human rights are leading to equally sharp divisions.The 1960s in America produced a revolution as dynamic as the 1920s in Russia. The legacy of 1815 eventually produced Jefferson Davis who almost destroyed democracy in America. In Russia, Stalin utterly crushed all social reform and innovation. Now, the final casualty of Vietnam may be Bush repressing social reform, justice and equality.It didn't start with Carter, although Jenkins, \\"identifies 1975 to 1986 as the watershed years.\\" Carter kept America at peace, during his presidency America never dropped a bomb, launched a missile strike, started a pre-emptive war or implemented a policy of torture. After 66 hostages were seized, he could have destroyed Iran; instead, he waited even though it cost him the presidency. All hostages came home alive and well. It's worth noting the first oil embargo was during the Nixon years, not during Carter's time.The years of hate came later after Carter. His post-presidential efforts won him the Nobel Peace prize in 2002, an honor Bush is unlikely to ever receive.Jenkins offers a rich feast of events from the past 40 years, but he's a thoroughly selective historian, brilliantly recalling history to prove his case past but not offering a clue about the future. He cites the rise of MADD in the 1970s, ignoring the crackdowns of the 1960s. For some, history is a study of the past to comprehend the promise, hopes and perils of the future; for Jenkins, it is a study of the present to understand the past.It makes interesting reading, especially for those who think Eisenhower was the pinnacle of American politics. Like many Americans, Jenkins can't comprehend defeat; this lack of acumen has produced some of the greatest American triumphs, but can also produce decay. To understand modern America, consider the two decades from John Quincy Adams to Millard Fillmore and the accompanying rise of religious cults, certainties and charlatans.Jenkins doesn't, but the 1820 - 60 period may offer the relevant example he's looking for in terms of mixing theology, history, polemics and the rise of cults.It's a disappointing book, unenlightening and bitter. He could have done much better."},{"Title":"Who's in Charge Here?: Overcoming Power Struggles With Your Kids","review":"This book is excellent.

As in all the books in this series, it is written as a first person narrative, creating an intimacy of style that makes the book all the more compelling and immensely readable. Replete with fascinating period detail, political machinations, public personages, and historical events that were a part of the life of Queen Elizabeth I, the author builds a fascinating, three dimensional portrait of a woman and queen.The author recounts the early years of Elizabeth, a troubled child, unsure of her place in the affections of her father, King Henry VIII. Knowing that he had had her mother, Anne Boleyn, beheaded, an impressionable Elizabeth observed the succession of women who took her mother's place and assessed how they fared at her father's hands.Elizabeth lived through the reign of her younger half-brother, Edward VI, as well as that of her half-sister, Mary, during whose reign Elizabeth would come perilously close to losing her life under allegations of treason. Having survived the reign of her sister, whose legacy would forever enshrine her in history as \\"Bloody Mary\\" for her fanatical persecution of Catholics, Elizabeth would come to the throne as a Protestant with a penchant for religious tolerance towards her Catholic subjects.The author takes the reader through the ascension of Elizabeth to the throne and her glorious reign, making the reader understand why Elizabeth I is revered as one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever known. From the early halcyon days of her reign to the more troubled ones that were to follow, the author fully engages the reader. The author also recounts the story of Elizabeth's close relationship with Robert Dudley, her Master of Horse, whom she would make the Earl of Leicester.Through her, Dudley became one of the most powerful men in her kingdom, as Elizabeth I granted him all but his most fervent wish, which was to have her hand in marriage. This wily and scholarly Queen would not share her power with any man, not even Dudley, a man she professed to love. Nonetheless, she would have a life long relationship with Robert Dudley, and his death, while in his fifties, would mark Elizabeth I for the remainder of her long life.The fractious relationships Elizabeth I would have with some of her courtiers are recounted, as are the ones that were more harmonious. Familial relationships, scandals, and intrigues would also have their impact, not just on Elizabeth I, but on the monarchy and the world, as well. Such is the lot of monarchs, and the reign of Elizabeth I was no different. World events and their effect on England also pepper this book, and at the center of it all was the indomitable Elizabeth I, a queen regnant who made England into a world power with which to be reckoned. Her reign would go down in history as the glorious Elizabethan era.This is a wonderful book that those with a penchant for historical fiction will, no doubt, enjoy. Ms. Plaidy is a master storyteller, seamlessly weaving a tapestry of events and personalities that make this book one to be savored."},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"I've been a Queen Elizabeth I fan since I was a little girl and I enjoy reading or watching anything about her. This book was right up my alley.I do love that this starts from the beginning of her life, as all Jean Plaidy's Queen's of England series do. I like how Plaidy shows how precarious her position was under her father and half-brother and sister, Edward and Mary. She shows how Elizabeth looked to the mistakes of others and learns from them. She even shows the mistakes Elizabeth makes and shows them to be learning points for the queen she is to become.But Elizabeth isn't all glory. She is a vain and selfish person at times and sometimes I felt that was all she was. But in her characteristic style she was able to pull me back into loving her again.I felt that Plaidy has taken a wonderful and great person and made her more human than the history books can. Even though Elizabeth's selfishness sometimes made me want to scream, it was who she was and that gives the book something different from others.In comparision to Phillipa Gregory's novels Plaidy's Elizabeth can think for herself without having men to do all the thinking for her. This is the Elizabeth I've come to love. I do like how Jean Plaidy shows that, although she loved Robert Dudley, she didn't give into thim, and felt that she didn't have to marry and have a king beside her in order to rule. She truly was a woman ahead of her time.We have Queen Elizabeth I to thank for the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the settling of Virginia and William Shakespeare. And in Plaidy's novel all of these things are place in perfect rhythym with Court life, Elizabeth's affections for certain men and her hatred of others.I do feel, however, that her hatred of Lettic Knolly's was really unfounded. I found no reason for her to hate her, other than the fact that she just does.This is a good and meaty book that is sure to give hours of pleasure."},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"Plaidy has done a great job with Elizabeth.

It conformed pretty closely with my own image of Gloriana... a woman who couldn't afford to let herself act like one, and a tempermental, vain, but most of all, very intelligent monarch.I also very much appreciated that Ms. Plaidy didn't choose to dabble in the 'multiple lovers' and 'secret children' nonsense so prevelant among historical fiction accounts. It's so refreshing not to have to wade through the garbage.However, there was one aspect of the story that bothered me... only a little at first, but by the time I finished it had nearly ruined the book: Elizabeth's constant physical violence against nearly everyone. She everlastingly reports 'nipping,' 'pinching,' and 'slapping.' In reality, there are only a few recorded instances of this happening, and I doubt that her ladies would have loved her as much as they did if they had been under unceasing physical attack while performing their duties.Also, I didn't appreciate the furthering of the myth of 'Bloody Mary.' (Cue thunderbolts and scary music.) I think history has pretty well established that Mary was not a monster, nor were her years as queen a waste or a prelude to the time of Elizabeth. Mary Tudor was a sweet, sensitive person who went through unimaginable pain and emotional torment. I think that's quite enough for one person without also being constantly maligned by popular history.In the end, I realize that these are fairly small complaints, when compared with such a very good book.

It is especially interesting to read Plaidy's take on Elizabeth's feelings at certain pivotal times of her life, such as with the death of Amy Robsart.

Though Elizabeth's pattern of surrounding herself with young male courtiers and being notoriously jealous of other women is factually known, I think Plaidy nails it here and maintains a balance between portraying a strong female who was ahead of her time and knew that marriage would mean giving up her control but also one who is vain, jealous and attention seeking.Though Elizabeth was not tyrannical like her father she does share his abilities of self delusion, desperately trying to hang onto their youth and reliving their \\"glory days\\".

Replete with fascinating period detail, political machinations, public personages, and historical events that were a part of the life of Queen Elizabeth I, the author builds a fascinating, three dimensional portrait of a woman and queen.The author recounts the early years of Elizabeth, a troubled child, unsure of her place in the affections of her father, King Henry VIII. Knowing that he had had her mother, Anne Boleyn, beheaded, an impressionable Elizabeth observed the succession of women who took her mother's place and assessed how they fared at her father's hands.Elizabeth lived through the reign of her younger half-brother, Edward VI, as well as that of her half-sister, Mary, during whose reign Elizabeth would come perilously close to losing her life under allegations of treason. Having survived the reign of her sister, whose legacy would forever enshrine her in history as \\"Bloody Mary\\" for her fanatical persecution of Catholics, Elizabeth would come to the throne as a Protestant with a penchant for religious tolerance towards her Catholic subjects.The author takes the reader through the ascension of Elizabeth to the throne and her glorious reign, making the reader understand why Elizabeth I is revered as one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever known. From the early halcyon days of her reign to the more troubled ones that were to follow, the author fully engages the reader. The author also recounts the story of Elizabeth's close relationship with Robert Dudley, her Master of Horse, whom she would make the Earl of Leicester.Through her, Dudley became one of the most powerful men in her kingdom, as Elizabeth I granted him all but his most fervent wish, which was to have her hand in marriage. This wily and scholarly Queen would not share her power with any man, not even Dudley, a man she professed to love. Nonetheless, she would have a life long relationship with Robert Dudley, and his death, while in his fifties, would mark Elizabeth I for the remainder of her long life.The fractious relationships Elizabeth I would have with some of her courtiers are recounted, as are the ones that were more harmonious. Familial relationships, scandals, and intrigues would also have their impact, not just on Elizabeth I, but on the monarchy and the world, as well. Such is the lot of monarchs, and the reign of Elizabeth I was no different. World events and their effect on England also pepper this book, and at the center of it all was the indomitable Elizabeth I, a queen regnant who made England into a world power with which to be reckoned. Her reign would go down in history as the glorious Elizabethan era.This is a wonderful book that those with a penchant for historical fiction will, no doubt, enjoy.

Written as a memoir by Queen Elizabeth, you will learn about her first scandalous love affair with her step-mother, Katherine Parr's, husband and the following life-long, unconsummated love of her life, Robert Dudley. Love and betrayal were all a part of the Queen's life and it often reads like a soap opera!Queen Elizabeth was bold, highly intelligent, supremely vain, and one of the greatest monarchs of England. You will be taken in and enthralled by the story of her close calls with execution at the hand of her sister, Queen Mary, and her fascination with and eventual execution of her cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland, who plotted to claim the English throne as her own for most of her life (her story is told in Royal Road To Fotheringay to be reissued Fall 2004).This is a stellar novel; you won't believe how fascinating history can be to read until you've read Plaidy! She has written over 50 books, most of which are out of print, but can be found in libraries and online. Once you start reading her, you can't stop!"},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"Written in the first person, the novel makes us feel as though we know what Elizabeth Tudor felt &amp; thought. Her historical fame is not glorified; her substantial faults are not understated; but we see possible reasons for both. Above all, we are shown how her incredible scholarship and insecure youth combined, enabling her (and in a man's world) to bring England from bankruptcy &amp; religious strife to its first age great enough to be named for one person: &quot;Elizabethan.&quot;"},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"From the opening lines, \\"When I look over the first twenty-five years of my life and consider the number of times I was in danger of losing it,\\" the reader is swept up into the majestic mind and spirit of the iconic Elizabeth I. Jean Plaidy began writing historical fiction in the fifties, and to the modern-day reader she may seem a tad dated and naive; yet her consummate command of history and ability to effortlessly transition from scene to scene are commanding and refreshing in an era of overheated fiction and an emphasis on the lurid.A friend loaned me this book; I found it captivating and immensely easy to read, even as I learned about Elizabeth and her times. This is a vastly different Elizabeth from the devious narcissist of Philippa Gregory's works or the volatile spirited girl of C.W.Gortner's book, but she is worth exploring all the same."},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"This is the second volume in Jean Plaidy's well-written \\"Queens of England\\" series of books.

History at it's finest"},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"This is the seventh Jean Plaidy novel that I have read. I enjoyed it and read the book within 4 days. I got a good overview of the life of Elizabeth and I think the best part was getting her life in chronological order. Some movies that I have seen recently (such as Elizabeth: The Golden Age) decide to completely disregard her age and the mood of the English people.I gave it four stars because it is very repetitive (which is my main complaint with almost all of Plaidy's novels). She repeats the characterizations of Elizabeth's men numerous times and it is a bit irritating.However, I would recommend it as a good novel for Elizabeth fans. But my 2 favorite Plaidy novels remain The Thistle and the Rose and Mary: Queen of France (about Henry VIII's 2 sisters)."},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"This is the second volume in Jean Plaidy's well-written \\"Queens of England\\" series of books.

However, for those looking for drama, intrigue and a thrilling read, look elsewhere.The book begins on an interesting note as it traces Queen Elizabeth's childhood, which often is not included in movies and other accounts. Her childhood, I might add, was the most entertaining part of the book.As Plaidy takes her readers further into the life of the Queen the yawns from boredom increased. Her novel becomes too technical and spends way too much time talking about who each and every subject related to the Queen is...often at times, even delving into characters that the reader need not know at all.Lastly, I found it most disappointing that Plaidy wrote as if the Queen truly had remained a total and utter virgin (even down to abstaining from any romantic kiss). Yes, Queen Elizabeth was a supreme ruler and an admirable woman, there is no doubt to this fact, but maybe it's just me...I find it hard to believe that a Queen, who had her pick of all the men in Europe, would not once in her 70 years indulge herself romantically. Was she not completely in love with Robert (it is stated as such over and over again in the novel)? I am sure that at least once there was some passion between them. Just don't expect to find any of it in this strictly G rated novel."},{"Title":"Queen of This Realm (Queens of England Series)","review":"I have read a dozen historical novels about Queen Elizabeth I, and this one is by far the best.Comprehensively researched, richly detailed and written in an exciting and vibrant manner, there is not an aspect of Elizabeth's life that the author does not touch on.From her childhood trauma at the execution of her mother when she was three and Elizabeth being branded as a 'bastard' through to her precarious hold onto her life while she came under danger during the reigns of her father, brother and sister.Wonderful examination of her sexual exploitation by her stepfather Sir Thomas Seymour, how she escaped death under the reign of her elder half-sister Bloody Mary, as illustrated by her carving of the words \\"Much suspected by me, Nothing proved can be, Quoth Elizabeth prisoner\\" into a window at Woodstock Manor.The book well illustrates what shaped Elizabeth into the cunning and wily, and vain but not unmerciful ruler.It explores her deep love for Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, her life soul mate,of whom even he, she would not marry, determined to share her throne with no one. also her fascination and adoration of the vain and foolish young Earl of Leicester who she was forced to have executed after his attempts to depose her.Her religious convictions are shown to be of expedience. she would choose the faith her subjects wanted England to be governed by, which was why she was a Protestant in a fervently Protestant England, reeling from the horrors of Mary I's attempt to transfer the Spanish Inquisition to England.The book is sympathetic to Elizabeth, nothing like Philippa Gregory's vilification of her, but at the same time does not gloss over her faults.It portrays her great guilt at the execution of Mary queen of Scots and her finest hour in rallying England to defend her shores and win the great victory against the Spanish Armada that threatened her realm and the freedom of her people-the Spanish ships carried devices of torture designed to bring all of the horrors of the Inquisition to England.Great characterization, realistic and yet fascinating and gripping .

A common response has been \\"I wish I had this book a long time ago- it would have saved me a lot of pain and struggle.\\" I began writing it to clarify my ownexperience and then found that many people could relate. So I have tried to identify the keyrecovery issues for anyone leaving a rigid kind of religion, and Christian fundamentalism inparticular. Since then, I have worked on additional topics related to recovering from religiousindoctrination, such as sexuality and pleasure, reclaiming spirituality, and the impact onrelationships. An issue for many people is how to relate to others who are still \\"in the fold\\"such as parents, friends, or partners.

With each chapter focussing on different stages of recovery, this book gives a compre- hensive understanding of the root causes that often lead to aspects such as: low self-esteem, loss of emotional feelings, loss of critical thinking, the loss of ability to feel natural emotions, among with other painful aspects that can be caused. Most importantly this is not angry book about blaming christianity. This book is primarily a book about recovery and hope. The abuses that fundamental Christianity can cause are addressed, the reader is then showed steps of recovery, that if followed, will lead to a healthier sense of individual identity and a more positive approach towards living life in this world. In summary, if you feel you have been hurt by fundamentalist christianity, I heartily recommend this book. This may be the very book you have been looking for!"},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"Dr. Winell views religious fundamentalism through the lens of psychology and treats it as a valid addiction or disorder. It normalizes and clearly articulates the unfortunate outcomes for those immersed in religious fundamentalism. Rather than &quot;Christian bashing,&quot; Winell's discussion focuses on humane needs that are sorely ignored within the fundamentalist system. Frank, easy to read, well organized, helpful, I think this book is hopefilled for those scarred by the mind control techniques of fundamentalist belief systems. It also provides a wellspring of resources in reading and thinking differently. This book is so spot on, my co-therapist and I will be using it as our model text in our religious recovery/former fundamentalist support group."},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"I am SO glad that Dr. Winell wrote \\"Leaving the Fold\\". I am just starting to read it, and it is uncanny how much I relate to every page.I thought my experiences were unusual, but now I realize that my 23 years of Catholic/Born-Again Christian experiences have really been a form of abuse, one in which I took part in willingly, not realizing until now the extent of the damage done.I am in therapy now, and the book is helping me to realize that my repulsion to religion (in spite of my continued yearning for spirituality) makes sense, given how the church has clouded my thinking.It's amazing how \\"Churchianity\\" has caused and/or exacerbated many of my various issues. I look forward to using the book to help my therapist (who WAS also very religious) and I to help me overcome all that past conditioning, and to reach toward really becoming an adult.The book has helped me realize why I am and \\"adult\\", but still don't feel grown up. The church has fostered a pseudo parent-child relationship with me, and I have been living as a functional \\"adolescent\\" for all these years. Whew! Now I can finally live and think for myself.Thank you...thank you...thank you!!!P.S.

Therefore, people who make the lonely journey out of a literal faith in the Bible often find themselves misunderstood, even by those who are not literalists themselves. There are support groups for other problems, but few ex-Christians find anyone, even a counselor, who can relate. This book provides do-it-yourself counsel from a psychologist who has been there. During the rawest time in my process of walking away from the faith, this book was the only thing that helped me stay sane. This book helps you understand what you attracted you to the faith and what was ultimately lacking in it. Some of the exercises may seem a little childish, but if you take the time to do them, you will find that you have grown in your recovery after finishing the book.

Although the Pythagorean school in Greece had suggested the earth was spherical in 500bc the church could not yet accept such a concept. In the bible it was written that the heavens are above and the earth below.It was then believed that the earth had antipodes or two flat sides top and bottom.Skies,trees and people on top and the underworld below.He was merely suggesting that perhaps distant people lived on the other &quot;side&quot; of the earth as well.The church fathers could not conceive of a biblical heaven both above and below?The sky afterall was &quot;up&quot; therefore how could there be men on the other side of the earth?Wouldnt they fall off?The bible,afterall was the infallible word of God and to hold views that differed was equal to heresy.He merely sought to advance and discover a greater truth about the earth.He never renounced belief in God or heaven &quot;above&quot; yet he was burnt alive by the church in 1327 as an unbeleiver and a heretic.As we now know,There are infact people on the &quot;other&quot; side of the earth. No matter where you tread,the heavens are indeed above and below.You do not deserve to be burned for your explorations.This book will help your journey.Questioning a beleif system can leave a person with little certainty in the once comfortable and familiar systems of support.(church,friends,pastors,youth group leaders)Often family members do not understand the turmoil. A way of thinking and being is undergoing great rebuilding. In somecases a way of being a person had known for an entire lifetime is questioned,tested,strengthened and sometimes shaken to the ground.To question these beleifs can bring about feelings of terror about hell and feelings of utter guilt and helplessness..

I relate to and appreciate it on two distinct levels: 1) Having \\"been there,\\" and 2) Having counseled and taught many people about the emotional, family, and various psychological issues she deals with.I spent even more years than did Dr. Winell in Evangelical Christian circles (churches, Christian college and seminary, and ministry organizations). I eventually (around age 45) found my way to a much broader place, though I continue pursuit of spiritual knowledge and experiences in a non-sectarian, non-dogmatic way. As churches and environments vary, my own experience wasn't quite fully \\"fundamentalist\\" or as emotionally dysfunctional as some situations she discusses or quotes she shares. But I personally shared much of the same and know others who experienced more extreme and troubling aspects or were more personally damaged. So I can vouch that she is not exaggerating. Rather, she's rightly identifying core issues that apply to one person or another. For some people, virtually all of them apply. If either a few or all of the topics she takes on apply to you, there is great guidance here.On the second, professional level, via my counseling work and extensive study of both psychology and theology, I want to affirm everything the author has included in what is an incredible growth guide. She is very clear, very specific in suggesting healing steps to take, and such. And many of these will apply to virtually everyone, regardless of their religious upbringing, or lack of it. For just one example, her two pages of \\"Affirmations from Adult to Child\\" in the chapter, \\"Inner Healing,\\" cover foundational, crucial attitudes and \\"self talk\\" for everyone to give themselves if they struggle with guilt, restrictions on growth, finding happiness or pleasure, etc. But not only are they for oneself, if you are a parent, they are a great reminder and guide for what is important to be feeling and conveying, in various words and actions, toward your children.Dr. Winell's focus is mainly emotional and psychological rather than theological. But along the way, she touches on core theological issues where, again, her insights are spot-on. She knows the Bible well, and spots where interpretive systems of conservative Christianity (beyond just \\"fundamentalism\\") often set up invalid and misleading concepts taken as \\"Bible truth\\" by insiders.This is an aspect of faith that I have studied extensively and written about a bit (Figuring Out Your Faith: How to Discover Truth among Conflicting Claims). The book also lists numerous helpful resources on religious recovery issues and beyond, as to understanding more healthy religion and spirituality.My review title mentions society as well as individuals. My reason is that I am thoroughly convinced, via decades of in-depth study, that positive progress in society is closely tied to its religious concepts and commitments. The US is still very heavily influenced, on many levels including politically, by the kind of overly conservative and often distorting, restrictive mindsets Dr. Winell so well explains and offers healthy counters to.So this book is one I wish everyone would read, not just those seeking clarity and healing from abusive religion. Almost every one of us know people in the situations described here. This book will greatly aid understanding of what is going on in people's minds and in the institutions which they may be a part of. Respectful, polite questioning or offering of alternative, liberating views may often be called for and can actually be a favor to such friends or family members... as long as not pushed on them unwanted. And it can be part of what will build greater harmony and compassion in this pluralistic society where we MUST have greater mutual respect and less reactiveness based on fear, whether from \\"right\\" or \\"left.\\""},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"Dr. Winell is really at the forefront when it comes to addressing the serious psychological harms perpetrated on people by certain toxic religious beliefs. This is not a religion-bashing book, or even a book on how to become an atheist.She takes a serious look at the effects of toxic, fundamentalist relgious belief systems, then lays out a straightforward path of recovery. The book is full of exercises meant to help those who were harmed reclaim their identities and begin facing life without the filter of religion.I recommend this book to the victims of toxic religious belief as well as any therapists who may attempt to counsel someone who is going through this.On a personal note, Dr. Winell is invested in helping this group of people. Her website has many helpful resources for those wanting to learn more."},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"Most of the book is easy to read for the layperson but you do need to be familiar with the following terms: a priori, ethnocentric, tautological, cognitive dissonance, and so forth. Any good dictionary can help you with this.Although I was familiar with fundamentalist Christianity (from having talked to them at various points in my life) I didn't realize how dogmatic, unhealthy, and unreasonable they can be. The author's own experience and those of the others were eye-opening. Although the author still appreciates certain Bible principles such as the Golden Rule, she claims that God was responsible for Job's suffering and also the following:page 90 \\"problem with occasions of Jesus expressing vindictiveness, discourtesy, narrow-mindedness, and ethnic and religious intolerance.\\"page 93 \\"Eve is blamed for bringing sin into the world.\\"I can only attribute this to her fundamentalist upbringing, which apparently didn't teach her how to think about the Bible in a holistic manner. For example, the scriptures blame Adam for bringing sin into the world, even though Eve was the first human to sin. This is because he was created first, had more knowledge and experience, and unlike Eve was not deceived.God allowed Satan to persecute Job. He was not responsible for it.At any rate, the author's suggestions for psychological and spiritual recovery for the fundamentalist Christian who has left dogmaticism are fairly good. Probably the best part of the book are the question and answer checklists, exercises, and the section on humor as healing.She claims that her advice is applicable to former Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, having had them as clients. However, unlike fundamentalists, JWs are not taught \\"hellfire and damnation.\\" I do agree that dogmatic individuals can exist in any group, even among atheists.She includes black and white photos of her art collages, which I found ugly and unnecessary.For Mormons I recommend another book with the same title: Leaving the fold: candid conversations with inactive Mormons. I would love to see a book about inactive Jehovah's Witnesses."},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"Don't read this book unless you want to have your carefully constructed biblical ideas challenged. I found this book extremely helpful in looking at the ways in which I could articulate my concerns with the ridiculous &quot;you can have your cake and eat it too&quot; answers I got from my church. This book is concise, clear and 'nonjudgemental'."},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"One wouldn't expect a fundamentalist religion to touch every aspect of life, would he? Since I left the (frightening) church I grew up in about a year ago, I've gone through monumental amounts of healing. I thought I was further along than I was because I didn't have issues with the usual stuff you'd expect (guilt and shame around sex, frighteningly low self-esteem, nightmares about the Judeo-Christian god, devil, demons, etc.).I'll keep this short. It (\\"It\\" being the echoes of a restrictive religion) goes a lot deeper than you'd expect...and Dr. Winell presents her own story and those of her patients with love and compassion. Even knowing you're not alone will be enough. Receiving permission to let yourself soar will definitely be enough. She strips away all traces of artifice to expose such religions for exactly what they are, showing us the mechanics underneath the skin, yet at the same time remains kind to such religions and those in them. It helped me to let go of my own anger and do the same. It made sense of my childhood and young adulthood, which was rife with confusion, pain, and crazy amounts of cognitive dissonance. Guilt and shame are becoming things of my past.I believe that saying, \\"Woohoo!\\" will suffice here. Thank you, Dr. Winell!!"},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"I have been recommending this book for about a year now, and have gotten several responses from people who say that the book has been of inestimable help to them.... hope the author will appreciate this comment."},{"Title":"Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion","review":"I grew up Christian, but began to break away in my teens.

What stands out about the book is her interaction with academic medicine--such as her treatment on medical education and early ventures in anatomy, and her recognition of the importance of Islamic medicine and scholarship for European medicine in the middle ages and renaissance.The author treats surgery, pathology, anatomy, physiology, and many other subfields of learning and practice. She interacts with the Christian worldview and religious understandings of sickness and health, albeit from a standpoint of elitist medical practitioners. As an expert on Galen, her treatment of his impact in medieval Europe is worth the price alone.For an introduction to medical education and the innovators in medicine (without being just another \\"Garrison\\"), this book is recommended."},{"Title":"Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice","review":"I have read a number of books on historic medicine and diseases, this is a great overview of the ides and practices. to get more specific a person would then need to start buying books about particular people or diseases, some that are only written in Latin, Greek or Arabic."},{"Title":"Young Henry of Navarre","review":"I became fascinated with this era in history after seeing the excellent movie Queen Margot again, and reading Susan Carroll's The Dark Queen and wanted something a bit more substantial.

Expansive, engaging and intelligent; the book only lacks a deep emotional layer and connection with Henry.

In so doing, Etienne Gilson shows the &quot;unity of philosophical experience&quot; through a study of important philosophers.Etienne Gilson was one of the greatest historians of philosophy in the 20th century. His brilliance shows throughout this work and so much could be quoted. For example: &quot;As soon as Descartes published it, it became apparent that, like Caesar's wife, the existence of the world should be above suspicion . . . . Descartes had endeavored to prove something that could not be proved, not beacause it is not true, but on the contrary, beacause it is evident.&quot; (p. 146.)If you are new to the study of philosophy, get this book for an introduction; if you are familiar with philosophy, this is a great &quot;refresher course.&quot;"},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"Lectures given by Etienne Gilson in 1936 at Harvard. Gilson defines the coming war, World War II, as a philosophical war of two different heads of Hegelianism. Communism, which is inspired by a look forward, into what will be, and helping it along (all conjecture of course); and the Hitlarian (Romantic) looking to the past. Thus Hitler's paganism and his desire to rid Europe of all nonindigionious elements, especially Semetic. Christianity, after all, is a conquering force upon the natural purity and indigoniousness of Europe. It is a glorification of what man, or more importantly, a nation (peoples) would be had they been left in their natural state uncorupted by foreign elements. A Darwinian, Rousousian, Kantian mix (among others) that created the ultranationalistic Romanticism. Gilson defines these misguided principles (still the dominant principles of today) as leading to a future tragic bloody war. But it also explains why Japan, in WWII, wished to be rid of Americanism in their culture, and of any foreign influences. Anyway it leads to extreme nationalism that is just an end result of Romanticism. The problems with defining the truth of Hitler to modern minds is we are not far removed from the thesis and antithesis of his metaphyiscal plain.The most important thesis of the book, however, is Gilson's defense that philosophy and more importantly metaphysics is a process and not a conclusion. Once one has made metaphysics a conclusion it ceases to be Metaphysics. Metaphyics can supose a greater truth, like an octagon being closer to a circle than a hexagon, but to incompus all truth is at least a human impossibility. However there have been many cycles in the history were postulations of a \\"metaphysical\\" entirety of truth have lead to philosophical cycles of argumentation, sometimes with real physical consequences. These cycles have turned into philosophical battles between true metaphyics and the false. The most recent false metaphicans have been Hegel, Kant, Carte, Hume, Descartes, and William of Ockham, plus their various disciples. The first cycle, Gilson defines, is that of Thales, 2,600 years ago, claiming all is an absolute of everything being air, followed by Anaximenes claiming everything was not air but water, and then Heraclitus caliming all is fire, then the first synthasis of this absurdity was Anaxaimander saying that the common things of all this stuff was indeterminable.Gilson spends most of his effort, 99% of it, in defining the modern and medieaval cycles of metaphysical certatude and the resulting problems. Any summary of it would not do it justice.The importance of this book to historians and pilosophers and historians of philosophy is immense. I don't know of any other book which so vividly paints a picture of modern thinking and how \\"it\\" got here than this book. Although I must admit I got hopelessly lost in the discriptions of Descarte's postulations, but the thesis of Descartes was made clear. One could go on forever about this book it is a cornicopia of ideas for further study and expansion. Highly recommended for any student of history or philosophy. Gilson brings a view that cannot be ignored. The question I have for Gilson, if I could ask it, is does Gilson agree that error illuminates the truth, as Aquinas did, and further, if error is good.Gilson convincingly argues that there is unity to the philosophical experience and this experience is illuminating on the nature of man and perhaps more."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"After almost missing brilliant Stanley Jaki, Benedictine priest, physicist, and consummate philosopher/historian of science because of his Catholicism; I smartened up. You wouldn't want to miss Einstein or Bertrand Russell either, would you? Okay, ditto for Jaki and Gilson. It was Stanley Jaki who sent me on to Gilson. I am a very fallen away Catholic with all the attendant hostilities, but I learned plenty from Gilson's The Unity of Philosophical Experience. Whatever your persuasions; if you respect intelligenge, methodical realism, and honesty, Jaki and Gilson are well worth your time."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"Gilson's work is composed of four parts. In each of the first three parts he explores the advent and demise of a philosophical system (the Medieval experiment, the Cartesian experiment, the Modern experiment) and identifies the recurring fatal attribute contained in each: the application of a particular science (logic, mathematics, science respectively) to the investigation of first principles. The successive failures of these systems has led to the \\"natural\\" but not \\"logical\\" modern conclusion that metaphysics is impossible. Gilson rejoins that simply because no one has ever succeeded in forming a complete metaphysical system that \\"explains\\" all reality doesn't spell the death of metaphysics. Such an enterprise isn't the goal of metaphysics to begin with, and anyone attempting such an undertaking is doomed before he starts. One cannot start with a method and attempt to encapsulate being since being is inexhaustible. Rather, one must start with being and work his way out. As Gilson observes, \\"Man is not a mind that thinks, but a being who knows other beings as true, who loves them as good, and who enjoys them as beautiful.\\" The metaphysician must accept being a priori and interpret it anew for each generation. Metaphysics is not dead or static, but alive and as new as each succeeding moment. The nihilism which marks the present age is the result of systems imposing themselves upon being which results in frustration and emptiness. It is only when one allows being to reveal itself to us that any meaning can be derived from existence."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"Not too many books in philosophy or about philosophy deserve to be called delightful, but this is one such book. Originally delivered as lectures--and that's when philosophers are at their best--this work is part history of philosophy, part criticism, part positive doctrine. What Gilson succeeds doing better than most is writing a story of Medieval and modern philosophy. A single narrative that weaves through the various thematic threads and keeps them all in sight. We learn about the continuity of thought and what specific concerns a philosopher had with his predecessors. In Medieval philosophy, he concentrates on later and more obscure thinkers. He spends a lot of time--too much--on Descartes, laying out and paraphrasing his method and reactions to it.There's a pattern in the history of philosophy. A pattern of error. One philosopher's enthusiastic and idealistic doctrine will be taken by his followers to its ultimate conclusions, which then leads invariably to skepticism. The way out of skepticism has been mysticism or moralism. The book lays out how this happens in Medieval times, with Descartes, and in Modern philosophy after Descartes. He does not focus much on mysticism because that pertains to religion more than philosophy.He concludes his book by telling us how all these philosophers have erred- repeatedly. And in doing so he gives us the guidelines, the principles, of what a philosopher would have to do in order to avoid repeating the same error again. Such a philosophy would not be devoid of metaphysics, on the contrary, it would be a metaphysics that does not begin by trying to emulate an external method of one of the sciences and thus is not subject to the inexorable reductive degeneration into that science--a degeneration that often not just destroys philosophy, but the science as well.There's a lot here to be learned. The book is very clear and concise and gets to the main ideas of the thinkers it discusses. And it is also very readable. It is a quick read that can be easily accomplished, no preparation--mental or otherwise--is needed. It is at times humorous. It is not very thought-provoking though. Despite dealing with metaphysics, it's not deep, and you won't get lost in it due to overconcentration.Some criticisms: most philosophers are rather parochial. Gilson is no exception. For the most part, his philosophical universe is populated by Frenchmen. His positive teachings occupy perhaps 7 pages or so. I would have been interested in reading more about it. Aquinas is notoriously absent, unless it was assumed that his audience knew him already. Gilson mentiones him often and in glowing terms but he never tells us what Aquinas is all about."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"I found this little book a quarter of a century ago. I have never seen it since, but I've never forgotten it. What Gilson has to say here is simple, sane, important and exciting and just really fun to read. And sturdy too. It holds up. A reviewer below said that he was thrilled to see this is back in print. Well, so am I."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"When Etienne Gilson looked at the history of philosophy he saw a cycle repeated numerous times. To put it entirely too briefly, a new philosophical movement arises out of skepticism, but is corrupted into some form of idealism before plunging back into skepticism and again requiring rescue. In The Unity of Philosophical Experience, Gilson describes that process and follows it through three different periods--or \\"experiments\\"--in the history of philosophy.The problem propelling the cycle is essentially a category error, in which philosophers attempt to \\"do\\" philosophy according to the rules of some other discipline. As C.S. Lewis put it in The Discarded Image, \\"Aristotle had impressed on all who followed him the distinction between disciplines and the propriety of following in each its appropriate method.\\" Failure to do so inevitably leads to a \\"breakdown,\\" resulting in skepticism.So, for instance, as Gilson first examines \\"The Medieval Experiment\\" he shows how Abelard and Ockham undermined the philosophy revived by Aquinas and led to the skepticism of the late Middle Ages/Renaissance. Against that skepticism came mysticism like that of Thomas a Kempis or \\"the moralism of the Humanists,\\" like Erasmus. With philosophy mired in skepticism, the cycle was set to begin again, and Descartes was there to begin it. Descartes's own cycle ended in the skepticism of Hume, and Kant began the latest rotation, \\"The Modern Experiment,\\" which had still not concluded in Gilson's day but was leading quite clearly to disaster. In each case, the philosophers in question forced philosophy into the mold of some other discipline. So Ockham with logic, Bonaventure with theology, Descartes with mathematics, Kant with science, and Comte with sociology. They found that philosophy simply didn't fit, and so jettisoned vital parts of philosophy, like metaphysics.Gilson ends the book with a summary and analysis of the cycle and adds seven conclusions drawn from this history. I found it remarkably moving to read this book, published in 1936, in which Gilson makes it clear that the world is heading toward disaster on the basis of false philosophical premises.I have to concur with a few other reviewers that though this book is excellent, it is not for beginners. Even with a background in medieval philosophy the book was still tough going in places. After all, this book began as a series of lectures to university-level philosophy students, so a certain familiarity with philosophy and the history of philosophy is assumed. That said, though the ideas are sometimes difficult the book is briskly written and immensely rewarding.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"This is a good book. However, it's not the best book ever written on the history of philosophy. For one thing, the focus is mostly on metaphysics, which is only one branch of philosophy. Further, I teach introduction to philosophy and I think this would be a difficult introduction to the subject for the average college freshman. Having some background knowledge of philosophy definitely helps while reading.That being said, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of philosophy, philosophy of science, or metaphysics. The writing is lively, engaging, interesting, at times humorous, and extremely quotable. For example, it is in this work that Gilson comments that philosophy always buries its undertakers.This quote is actually at the heart of his thesis. Gilson shows how metaphysics goes through cycles, always culminating in a philosopher thinking he's solved all the problems of philosophy and the discipline is now dead. Yet, it always turns out things are never that simple. To explore this idea, Gilson goes through several iterations of this cycle throughout history and shows how the same problems keep creeping up. He also draws a parallel with how we handle metaphysics and how we handle science, and the ways in which the two disciplines need one another. In the final section, he lays out several laws of metaphysics that he has derived from the observations he makes of the history of philosophy."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"This book is a deceptively light read. Gilson's writing is so clear that it's easy to miss the profundity of it.Just as he compares the history of philosophy to a scientist's laboratory, I'd like to compare this book to a science class. That is to say, do your homework. When a teacher explains things in class, everything makes perfect sense, but unless you take what the teacher said and see how it applies to different situations, you won't learn very much.This book is great, but I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have time to really think about the things he says. Of course reading it quickly won't hurt, but just like you wouldn't chug a bottle of fine wine, save this one for when you've got time to really appreciate it.One more thing I'd like to mention is how impressed I was by his ability to show the greatest respect to philosophers of previous ages even while he explained why their ideas are hopelessly mistaken."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"I was thrilled that this work is back in print. It is a valuable and, indeed, essential book for any library of a philosopher, historian, or serious scholar. Gilson's book, taken from a series of &quot;lectures&quot; is highly-readable and is philosophically sound. His critique of P. Abailard is accurate."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I regularly recommend it as the best single book in the history of philosophy.

His other translated collections of Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish, and Greek poetry are equally beautiful. It should be noted, though, that \\"Marichiko\\" was in fact a pen name. In his later years, \\"Marichiko\\" was an experiment on Rexroth's part to write completely separated from himself as a central figure, switching culture, gender, and language - and then writing poetry from that new perspective. It wasn't until after his death that it even became clear the two were in fact the same person."},{"Title":"One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese (A New Directions book)","review":"Rexroth must be praised for two reasons.

The work comprises chapters 258 to 275 of the Aranyaka Parvan of the Indic epic \\"Mahabharata\\". But apart from the Ram saga, the book serves as an independent-study resource for students who have completed a basic survey of Sanskrit grammar. Following in the linguistic traditions set forth in the bench mark publication of Sargeant Winthrop's, The Bhagavad Gita, Dr. Scharf provides a liguistic apparatus thatwill delight and amaze even the most astute of Sanskrit scholars.The Devanagari and Roman fonts and the layout of other materials is simply superb on each page. The press of RoutledgeCurzon must be congratulated for bringing forth such a finely edited text. Needless to add such a massive work must include some typographical errors, notably an outstanding one on page 71, but the typographical errors may actually serve to sharpen the astute thinking of students and readers alike. I have no doubts this work will serve as a standard reference source for many years and I hope and pray that other Indic and Sanskrit scholars will emulate this work, to provide in a similar format the entire translations of the the four Vedas, the Mahabharata and the 18 Mahapurans."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"This book is best suited for someone who has at least some Sanskrit, but for the student who has the basics, but is weak on vocabulary, this is an excellent text. The layout is similar to Sargeant's edition of the Bhagavad-Gita, but S gives a more complete syntactic overview and each verse has a prose retelling (in devanagari only), which is quite good for the intermediate student to practice vocabulary, grammar, and reading.With over 700 verses, this is an extensive text. There are some typos, but they should not trouble the average student."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"In addition to the other reviewers I would like to say something about the general set up of the book.The core of the book is the text of the Ramopakhyana (the story of Rama as it appears in the Mahabharata). There is one page (sometimes two) for each verse. Apart from a high quality Devanagari text of each verse you get:- A transcription of the Sanskrit text in the Latin alphabet.- The resolution of the sandhi used, with an interlinear annotation giving the exact grammatical classification of the word in question (for instance: \\"third person, dual. active, perfect\\" in case of a verb).- A glossary, containing all the words that appear in the verse, including the complete derivation (compounds, nominal derivates etc.).- A Sanskrit prose paraphrase.- Grammatical, textual, contextual and other notes.- An English translation.It would seem that you need to be a Sanskrit scholar to be able to appreciate the book, nothing is less true. If you are only able to decipher Sanskrit from a text presented in a Latin transcription, maybe using some grammar and/or dictionary and want to go ahead \\"doing something\\", this is your book. If you want to practice reading Devanagari, this is your book. If you want to practice resolving sandhi, this is your book. If you ... , well, there is a chapter in this book called \\"Suggestions for Use\\", anyway, this is your book!Apart from the text there is an extensive Introduction covering all kind of aspects connected to the text.The Devanagari text contains some typos. The most obvious one is on page 71, the title page of the text part. The \\"o\\" has changed into an \\"a\\", resulting in \\"ramapakhyana\\" instead of \\"ramopakhyana\\". As up to now, this is the only typo I found I don't expect the text to be overloaded with them. Because there is also a latin transcription and a resolution of the sandhi, typos will not be difficult to detect and resolve."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"Scharf's fully annotated edition of the storey of Rama is just mind-blowing and endearing work.He seems he has not spared anything.He gives you Sanskrit script and then with transliteration and the tanslation and lengty explanations.After finishing this book I will continue with Bhagavad Gita published by Suny Series."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"The best I ever met in my studying sanskrit.

Thomas has produced 24 essays defining what it means to be human. Through his fascination with the world, he raises a multitude of questions and points out existing uncertainties. He makes it strikingly clear that the human race has a really long way to go in order to solve the puzzles of this world. He demands solutions and answers; is there some genetic reason for the rituals that occur in nature, such as insects laying their eggs on the branches of specific trees, and then pruning these branches, thus extending the life of the trees and keeping the symbiosis in this world going from generation to generation? What is the explanation for the behavior of bees? How do you explain experiments done on people where, under hypnosis, they are told that their hands are being scalded with an iron, but in fact it is a wooden pencil, and in a short time their whole hand is red and marked? From cells to music, Thomas captures the soul of the reader and opens the door to reality with his thoughts on nature and human consciousness.

A very well written account of one of India's greatest leaders. I have not lived long enough to testify to the truth of everything that is written (my parents could!!) but from what I know of Indian history, and from what I have seen around me, a very accurate potrayal of perhaps India's most charismatic prime minister. The book really charts her rise, fall and re-emergence on the political scene, delves into the feelings behind her every action. I had always wanted more about Indira Gandhi than what was available in the papers and magazines and this book tells me all that I wanted to know. Perhaps the only place where it is lacking is that Ms.Frank deals with the last 2 yrs of her life in very few pages. Perhaps more detail was warranted there, but her early life, her relationships with her husband, Feroze Gandhi, and her father, Nehru, are vividly potrayed and it is these parts, and the story of her rise to power, which makes this book a masterpiece. In my opinion, every Indian, and anyone who is interested in Indian history, should read this book. Better still, buy it!!"},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"This is an exceptional and insightful historical biography. The origin's of Indira's fragile psyche are documented and explain her erratic and unpredictable tenure as India's leader.

If I were to recommend one book for a Western audience on post-colonial India, this book would be it."},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"I have read only a few sections so far and I am mesmerized. I feel as if I am back in Indira's time and place.The research and the annotations make it a very authoritative biography. It contains a must-read account of the ups and downs of her relationship with her husband Feroze (not available anywhere else) and with her father and mother.Indira emerges as a very lonely, tragic figure.I feel energized as I read the progressive views of Nehru. The passages where he describes his expectations for Indira - to work in public life yet also be financially independent are empowering. The great thinkers of that day were more forward-thinking and openminded than most people are even today!This biograhy is long overdue and is comparable in stature to that of John Adams by David McCullough."},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"This is one of the best biographies on Indira Gandhi. Most of the other books on indira authored by Indian journalists tend to focus primarily on her political activities with a brief summary of her childhood and adult years. This is by far the most comprehensive attempt at combining the various threads and presenting the story of a normal human being. Katherine's description of Indira's years at Anand Bhawan, Europe, marriage to Feroze read like a best seller fiction. Meticulous research, analysis and an objective attempt to understand the influences in Indira's life prior to her prime ministership is the hallmark.Missing is the analysis in understanding why a shy, reserved person longing for anonymity suddenly craves for power, and seeks power with scant regard for the institutions set-up by her father, leaders she grew up with. Going by Indira's example,I am disappointed that despite having the best role models (Gandhi, Nehru), best education ( shantiniketan, finishing schools, oxford), global exposure, immense wealth, Indira in her latter years behaved very much like an average middle class Mother, the book unfortunately fails to provide a rationale for this abnormal behavior.Still a great attempt from a non-indian to understand and piece together the life of the most charismatic and powerful Indian leader in the last 30 years."},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"This biography is strong on the first part of Indira's life -- her disjointed childhood and dedication to her father, Nehru, and his democratic ideals. When she becomes prime minister, however, the book becomes a series of facts about her sudden about-face in creating an anti-democratic, power-grabbing, corrupt regime. There is a lot of information but not much interpretation, or at times enough explanation of factions and conflicts that have divided India. Nevertheless, for someone who knows little about the country, this provided an introduction."},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"Indira Ghandi was the prime minister of India from the 1960s and 1980s. She is the daughter of India's first PM, Nehru, and was raised in part by Mahatma Gandhi. Confusingly, however, she married a completely unrelated Feroze Gandhi who granted her that famous last name. This is a monster of a book at over 500 pages, copiously annotated and extremely detailed.The most striking thing I found reading the book was how weak and non-existent Indira seems in her youth and early adulthood. She is unendingly ill with pulmonary diseases, painfully thin, does poorly at school, and floats around Europe and India with her family (she attended the world's first international school, l'Ecole Internationale, in Switzerland for League of Nations brats). She has no normal childhood or youth as the whole Nehru family is deeply involved in the Indian independence movement. They all periodically have to face jail time (a veritable rite-of-passage) for their activities, which the British government calls seditious.She marries an ambitious, hot-headed and energetic Feroze Gandhi in 1942 despite the misgivings of her father Nehru. Though they were sincerely in love and they produced two sons, the marriage proved a miserable one. Indira was more committed to her father's political work (who becomes PM of independent India) than her husband (who quickly begins having a number of a more-or-less open affairs). I was struck by how Indira lives for others, she has no independent personality, not until in 1959, at age *fourty-two*, she deems that she has repaid her debt to her family and must live her own life. Tragically good timing, because both her husband Feroze and her father Nehru would die within the next few years.Then Indira comes into her own, she drifts into the prime ministership in 1966 as the previous once dies. She quickly personalises politics massively: she avoids the party organization her father had created and appeals directly to the people with populist programs such as bank nationalizations and removal of aristocratic privileges. She is massively re-elected in 1967 despite a vast coalition against her running on the motto \\"Remove Indira\\". She skillfully responded with the motto \\"Remove Poverty\\". As the situation in Bangladesh (then a part of Pakistan, though 1,200 km away) degenerated into genocide as the the West Pakistani military elite reasserted its rule in the country in 1971, Indira acted decisively to attract international attention. She eventually fought a brief 2 week war, short and successful, to liberate the country. She became massively popular earning the title \\"Empress of India\\".Though she governed over other successes, the investments of the \\"Green Revolution\\" to make India's food supply self-sufficient were finally paying off and India exploded its first atom bomb (\\"Smiling Buddha\\"), she did not fulfill her promises on poverty. By the mid-70s inflation was rising, strikes were paralyzing the economy and an anti-Indira coalition was making strong headway calling for her extra-constitutional overthrow. Indira had already eroded much of India's democracy, weakening the constitution, politicizing the judiciary and bureaucracy, and circumventing political parties. In response she declared \\"the Emergency\\", effectively making herself dictator, censuring the press, imprisoning thousands of opponents and postponing elections... but trains ran on time and inflation fell. Indira grew increasingly isolated, relying on her corrupt and ambitious son Sanjay whose political influence grew. She eventually relented, holding elections in 1977 and losing badly.Indira, her son Sanjay and their cronies then had to face 3 years of vengeful and badly organized trials on their misdeeds during the Emergency. They emerged basically unscathed, the very unpopular Sanjay died in 1980 just before the elections in an airplane crash which, though it devastated Indira, placed her in a perfect position to win those elections (the sympathy vote counts). Indira seems pretty aimless during her final term, unable to handle the communal violence affecting Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Harijans (also called Dalits or Untouchables, the lowest of Hindu castes), especially in Kashmir and the Sikh-populated Punjab.In 1984 as a Sikh terrorist group had been rampaging across Punjab from their base in the Golden Temple (the holiest of Sikh holy places), she launched a military operation to retake the temple and kill the terrorists. She succeeded, with massive civilian casualties and the temple heavily desecrated. Sikhs around the country were enraged and, a month later, two of her own Sikh bodyguards shot some 30 bullets into her body at point blank range. Her other son, Ranjiv, became the new prime minister. Over the 3 days after Indira's death, some 3,000 Sikhs were killed, tens of thousands more expelled from their neighborhoods, in anti-Sikh pogroms throughout India.Overall Indira comes across as a fairly unimpressive leader. She seems to have been very lucky to have been Nehru's daughter, not had terribly coherent ideas politically and been very dangerous to India's democratic politics. However, she had the ability to really connect with the common Indian and like de Gaulle, another leader with extra-constitutional and authoritarian tendencies, ultimately favored a return to democracy and could not govern without the approval of \\"the nation\\".In the book, Indira and her family appear very flawed but touchingly human, especially as a youth: they have petty disputes and feuds, she reads voraciously, complains of at the size of her nose and the darkness of her skin, she has few friends and her life is distinctly unordered. One word of warning she spoke to a son I thought particularly poignant: \\"There are millions of people in the world but most of them just drift along, afraid of death, and even more afraid of life.\\""},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"This is a very good account of Indira Gandhi's life. I felt very sad after reading it. I knew already about her life and politics as being an Indian. But this book gave me a very comprehensive account of her life, except her last couple of years, which I think werehurried. I think that spicy tidbits of alleged affairs about her, Nehru and her husband should have been avoided as they distract from the larger point and have given her worshippers an excuse to discount the book. Description of India's early life before she became the Prime Minister is very engaging. You can see how the seeds of her later-day paranoia and siege mentality were sown during her unhappy childhood and her estrangement with her husband. You feel sad that in the end that privileged upbringing, lots of potential, education at the best schools and colleges and tutoring by her father in democratic traditions did not amount to much. She achieved little and destroyed much.It is amazing that in a vibrant democracy, she was able to undermine every political institution, which is essential for a democracy. How she instigated conflicts in Assam, Kashmir and Punjab. How she shamelessly went around dismissing democratically elected state govts and playing one group against another. How she let loose her son, Sanjay as an extra-constitutional authority to subvert judiciary and beaurocracy. She surrounded herself with sycophants and boot-lickers. In her own words, she herself admits, \\"men who may not be very bright but on whom I can rely\\"? Only bright spot in her career was the liberation Bangladesh. She used every weapon available to stay in the power. In the end, the forces she helped unleashed consumed her. Even her son Rajiv who became Prime Minister after her violent death was killed Srilankan Tamil Tigers whom she nourished. It might seem like a poetic justice in the end but India was/is the big loser having lost so much and still fighting those forces.History will not be kind to her and I hope that Indian people would not let another Indira immerge on the political scene."},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"Result of an obviously (too) meticulous study, the book reveals a very objective account of one of the leading female figures of the world...

Indira's early years as part of the most prominent family in India post-independence were chaotic--her education was haphazard, her health very poor, her sense of security forever damaged by periodic visits to jail by her father and even once by her tubercular mother. Her life goals were confused--she longed for anonymity as those around her pushed her into the limelight. Her marriage was troubled and she had children against the advice of her doctors.Indira's political life began in my opinion with her decision to separate from her husband and live with her father and become his \\"right hand woman,\\" plus the advent of anti-biotics which cured her own TB for good. She became strong and accustomed to power, but never overcame the fear and suspicion of others and fear of disorder which so tragically played itself out in her own political career.This book is over-sympathetic to Indira during her years in power. Taking advantage of certain constitutional provisions which thank god have no equivalent in the US, she systematically dismantled local governments which were the backbone of this country that is fractured by ethnic and religious conflict. She surrounded herself with loyal but not very wise men, and as the older generation of politicians retired from public life, a new generation of leadership failed to emerge in the corrupt, authoritarian atmosphere she created. She allowed her son Sanjay to roam uncontrolled and sat by as he knocked off enemies, took enormous bribes and payoffs, and perpetrated some of the worst injustices of the Emergency. She was voted out of office in 1977 but amazingly voted back in in 1980, in part because her years in power had allowed her to keep the opposition weak, disorganized and divided.In fairness Indira was faced with intractable problems--conflict in Assam, Sri Lanka and Kashmir, war with Pakistan, unimaginable poverty, illiteracy, Muslim-Hindu strife, the caste system and the tragedy of untouchability, drought and famine. Unfortunately her reaction to these was to eliminate opposition and protect her own position, and in later years do nothing as she was overwhelmed by paranoia and a clear sense of her own imminent assasination.And yet the people loved her. On a recent visit to India I visited Gandhi's house and the garden where he was assinated--it was peaceful and uncrowded. Meanwhile long lines awaited those seeking admission to the garden where Indira was killed and her memorial. She styled herself \\"Mother India,\\" and was idolized by the poor. She spoke to their needs but tragically did little to help them.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Indira, or those looking to gain some understanding of the modern history of India."},{"Title":"Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi","review":"I would definately recommend this book to anyone who whats to get a good insight into the life of Indira Gandhi.

Humorous, instructive stories from everyday life were the favorite subject matter of miniature painters, and these delicate and heart-breakingly beautiful paintings are so rich in minute detail that each is a cultural lesson of the most powerful sort. The miniatures in this volume, which are beautifully reproduced in full color images, tell folk stories - the poet Yusef looking in wonder into a mirror which he received as a gift from a friend who had traveled to Canaan - or they finish poems which are well-known in Persian-Tadjik literature, such as Layla and Mejnun. One miniature in this book depicts Mejnun's arrival at the Kaaba in Mecca as he completes his hadj. Others show Sufi 'whirling' dervishes dancing, a traditional feast in a garden, a herdsman guarding his goats while a graceful young girl watches, and a betrothal ceremony complete with the traditional twin sugar loaves which are set before each guest to symbolize the betrothal rite. All of these miniatures - about 100 in all - are taken from manuscripts in various collections in Russia, most of which are still closed to westerners.

The author also mixes narrative with a lot of opinions and analysis about the facts.

The author is not afraid of polemics and gives new perspectives over matters treated as tabu, like Ben Gurion, Weizman, The Zionist Organization and the Histadrut. Much enfasis is given to Jabotinsky's unstopabble fight for the jewish rights in palestine and abroad, as well as his unfearing steadfastness against anyone who denied the goal of creating a jewish state.

He convinces Donovan to rent Andi a nearby cabin.When Andi and her children move in, Donovan has immediate misgivings about letting them rent the nearby cabin. He likes solitude, working through the night on his book. Children, however, have a way of turning up, and pulling others out of their self imposed shell. Soon he finds himself not only walking through the woods with nine-year-old Cory, or leaving food for a woodchuck with five-year-old Taylor, but also sincerely enjoying their company. He also finds himself irresistibly drawn to their widowed mother. But with grief still fresh after only a year, Andi's not in a hurry to embark upon a new relationship even when passion threatens to erupt between them. And the closer Donovan gets to the truth behind Adam's death, the more they are all placed in danger.Once again author Ruth Langan pens an intriguing romance in RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON. When the prodigal son returns home, Donovan Donovan carries deep shadows left by the dangerous world he inhabited for ten years, and Andi and her children offer the much-needed sunlight of healing. Langan writes with a deep compassion for the blows the heart takes, not just in the dynamics between men and women, but also in family relationships. The struggle with grief is delicately portrayed as a prime motivator for Donovan, who lost his father as a child, mirroring the loss of Andi's children and their father. Donovan finds redemption not just through the love of a woman, but also through reaching out to grieving children. RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Benoni Stinson and the General Baptists","review":"This book is a history of the General Association of General Baptists, and in particular, one of the founding fathers, Benoni Stinson.From the Preface\\"From the preface: The object of this volume is to set Benoni Stinson and the General Baptists in a clearer and stronger light before the public--for they are worthy. They have done a good and a great work, better and greater than even themselves have been aware of. It is fitting, therefore, that their work should be set forth before those who may profit by it. Fortunately, while some parts of Stinson's life, and some parts of General Baptist History, are already hopelessly beyond reach, there are still rather ample materials at hand. Among them are the \\"Sketches,\\" published by Capt. William Reavis in the General Baptist Herald, in 1877 and 8. They contain much that does not come within the scope of this work. But they also contain invaluable matter concerning Mr. Stinson and his people that has been freely used.\\"Though theologically similar to the General Baptists in England and early America, this body of General Baptists arose in the midwestern United States in the 19th century through the work of Benoni Stinson (1789-1869), a United Baptist minister first in Kentucky and then in Indiana. Stinson was ordained in Kentucky in 1821, and evidently was already leaning toward or embracing Arminian theology. Shortly after he moved to Indiana, in 1822 the Wabash District Association decided to divide into two bodies, for convenience sake. Stinson's church would be in the new body, and he labored to have a statement that \\"the preaching that Christ tasted death for every man shall be no bar to fellowship\\" would be included in the articles of faith.The next fall, in 1823, the Liberty Baptist Church of Howell, Indiana was organized with 33 members, and Elder Stinson was called as pastor. Three other churches were soon organized, all in the Evansville, Indiana area. In October 1824, representatives from these four churches came together and organized the Liberty Association of General Baptists. This appears to be the first time the name \\"General\\" was officially associated with this movement. A number of General Baptist local associations were organized from 1824 to 1870. During this period, some attempts were made by the Liberty Association to correspond with the northern Free Will Baptists, but this appears to have eventually proved unsatisfactory to both parties.In 1870, a convention was called to meet with Harmony church, Gallatin County, Illinois, with the idea of organizing a general association comprising all the annual General Baptist associations. Delegates from Liberty, Mt. Olivet and Ohio associations gathered and formed the General Association of General Baptists. This body has grown and developed until it now embraces about 60 associations, 816 churches and more than 73,000 members.The book also contains many excerpts from personal diaries & journals of the day. Along with many biographies of the church founding fathers including pen & ink portraits of them."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"I was doing ok with the book. Not exactly drawing me in but then when Chase is working on his \\"fifty-seven Camaro\\", that was the end for me. I am not a big car buff but thought that sounded way too early for a Camaro. Googled it and in two seconds saw they were first made in sixty-seven.That was the end of the book for me. To me it puts into question any and all facts I expect the author to have checked. Besides again, it just was a bit far fetched."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"It's rare that I find a book so terrible that I write a review about it, but this book just sucks. Maddie is annoying and her brothers are ridiculous. And clearly the writer or the publisher didn't bother with a copy editor -- mistake after mistake after mistake. I'm very, very glad I didn't pay for this. If I had, I would have demanded my money back."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"If you're reading a book called \\"Marry Me, Maddie,\\" chances are you're not looking for something intellectually stimulating. And this book is not.It's full of patriarchal male characters, which other reviewers have found fault with. Understandable, but it's not really clear when this book is set. Also, it takes place in the (relatively) deep South, so that also makes more sense. If you can't stand characters who don't think women can hold a job / should have careers, this book probably isn't for you. It got annoying after a while, but I had to keep in mind that some people ARE like that. I think Maddie handles it with Southern grace and a touch of defiance. She's a typical Savannah lady.There are some pretty steamy sex scenes.My biggest annoyance with this book was the overuse of cliffhangers. The author would 'tell' rather than 'show' plot points, which seemed amateur and got annoying. It got frustrating to the point that I would put my Kindle down after 10 minutes in protest. However, I finished the book. That's saying something.Bottom line: there are annoying parts to 'fight through,' but it's a semi-decent brainless read."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"The book had potential as a good poolside read on a lazy Sunday, and it started off fairly decent. By about 1/3 through, however, it failed miserably. I downloaded it when it was free, which is why I rated it 2-stars, otherwise I would have only given it a 1-star rating.For the most part, I can suspend disbelief in my readings...that is why we read after all, is to get away from our lives for a few hours. However, every character was completely unrealistic, as was every situation. At the end of the day, I felt like I was reading a 16 year-old's diary of what it would be like to lose her virginity and what she would consider porn.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"This could have been good literature, the possibilities were there. The younger sister, her protective older brothers and their friend since childhood. The hidden love between the girl and the friend. But writing a good story was not enough for this author. The book is littered with explicit porn written in 10th grade language. How disappointing."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"This book had too much mush and too little content for me. I could not feel anything but confusion for the characters. Maybe a good read for teenagers, but not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"I knew this would be a shallow, light read, but even for chick lit this book was mediocre. The characters were imaginary - CLEARLY not real people. I cannot believe that a girl who has dated her fiance for like 5 years & didn't have a physical relationship with him - set in modern day! - would suddenly become insatiable with some guy she doesn't even have a clear relationship with. Really? I guess it makes a 'good' story line. Other characters were similarly not acting like real humans. How often to adults REALLY act out the \\"I'm mean to her because I secretly have the biggest crush on her\\"? HOWEVER, if you think of this book like a slightly dirty sit-com, or actually believe people do incredible stupid things for the sake of physical attraction and in the end it naturally results in True Love and Happy Endings, it's not too bad. A quick read, some funny situations, a (unlikely in real life) happy ending."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"When Maddie Summers challenges her boyfriend of four years to &quot;Marry Me or Move On,&quot; on her best friend's talk show, plans backfire and she finds herself single once again. Maddie refuses to forego her own dreams to serve cocktails to any man's business partners in order to elevate him on the social pedestal. So now she plans to play the field, maybe date twenty or thirty men, and have fun. And when she marries, she wants someone who is hot, and someone who won't ask her to trade her independence for his goals.Chase can't help appreciating the changes in Maddie, from her curvaceous figure to her newly single status. But Maddie is his best friends, heck, his blood brother's kid sister. Which means she's practically his own sister, and he has to keep his hands off. Worse, Chase considers himself a jailbird's son, and doesn't believe he should ever marry.Chase had some pretty good pointers on boys when Maddie was twelve, and she tells herself that she's supposed to be forgetting men, not fantasizing about her brothers' best friend. Despite both of their best intentions, however, circumstances throw them together in business and in private. Include Maddie's interfering, yet well meaning, brothers and the result is humorously delightful!Rita Herron's lovable, laughable style sparkles in MARRY ME, MADDIE. From talk shows to a nudist colony, this irrepressible heroine and her over-protective brothers will keep the reader in stitches. The multi-layered plot lends depth without becoming too serious, keeping the pace moving smartly along. The depth of characterization presents believable, imperfect people with big hearts and way of stepping into heated trouble. Without a doubt, Rita Herron's rising star boldly shines in MARRY ME, MADDIE. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"I loved the story line. For them to be freinds and then fall in love with each other is amazing/"},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"This story was a pretty great read. There was also some humor in the story too which made me laugh. Although the end seemed a bit rushed to me, in terms of how feelings got resolved and everyone reconciled.I thought the relationship between the two main characters seemed pretty realistic, and there was good chemistry between them. I really liked Chase's character. You can really see some of his struggles with not wanting a relationship because of how his childhood had been. Maddie seemed like a modern woman that I could relate to and I could find respect for her.Some things that I didn't like/thought could have been better about the story...1) not knowing the age of Chase and the brothers. Maybe just me, but having ages helps me to put some interactions into perspective2) the family secret that the siblings were trying to protect. That didn't really add to the story for me, besides explain why Lance would be wary of Sophie. But it still seemed like some random thing added in. Maybe the other books with the characters will add more to this.3) the bachelor pact. I'm not too clear why the men decided on the bachelor pact. I can see how Chase might not have wanted a family because he believes people can't love him, but for Reid and Lance I didn't see a reason for it.Anyways, overall a pretty good book. The plot wasn't that creative as I've read several other stories about the best friend's little sister, etc. But the writing was pretty good and I liked the characters. Even how the brother's were super protective was fine for me and that made sense as they raised Maddie so they want to keep seeing her as a child."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"I've read Rita Herron's romantic suspense, paranormal, and contemporary novels. She always creates a great plot and more importantly a hero and heroine that I can truly root for! Talk about a woman willing to take matters into her own hands to make sure she gets the HEA she deserves. With a brave heart, good friends, a great sense of humor and the right guy, Maddie totally deserved finding love in the end. Another wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"Really loved this book it had me in tears and it had me laughing out loud.

Wish to read more of Chase and Maddie."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"Marry Me, Maddie was a quick, fluffy romance that was good for passing a lazy Sunday. Maddie gives her boyfriend Jeff an ultimatum on live television which ends with them parting ways. For the best since Jeff is pretty unlikeable and there seemed to be zero chemistry between them! Newly single Maddie realizes she's attracted to her brothers' childhood best friend and business partner, Chase. What unfolds is pretty predictable (down to the villain who was sabotaging their development project). There were some confusing family secrets, behavior from all parties that was frustrating at times, and some downright ridiculous scenarios. Maddie's behavior was implausible for her character given her limited sexual experience. I enjoyed this book for what it was. I thought the chemistry between Maddie and Chase was great. It had a sweet, happy ending."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"If you're looking for a fun, quick and easy read, this is a great book. Read this book in less than a day. Good plot, funny and relatable characters."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"Another LOL romantic romp from Rita Herron. I've read most of her romantic comedies now and I just love her style. They would make such great films. Maddie is fed up with waiting for her long term boyfriend to pop the question so she allows her best friend to set them up on a dating show where she gives him an ultimatum, propose or move on. Unfortunately the worst happens and Maddie is left humiliated, but not as upset as she had thought. Her overprotective older brothers try to make things right with hilarious consequences and their best friend and her childhood crush, Chase, is given the task of keeping and eye on her. Things soon hot up between Maddie and Chase, but for lots of reasons this can't be allowed. They struggle valiantly against their attraction, while Maddie starts a new career as a decorator and Chase tries to keep his business with her brothers from tanking. Lots of laughs, lots of hot sex and a lovely happy ending. If you enjoy chick lit, contemporary romance or romantic comedy you must give this book a try."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

I got about 30% through this book before I gave up.. I tried!

Maybe they're better!"},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"What can I say? This is a story of a hero in angst and a tender hearted virgin. The brothers were distracting in their overzealous protection of their sister. It has a very small and under developed plot. For me it was formulatic, if I can coin a word, and predictable.Also, in my opinion, the Savannah setting could have been more utilized. Having said that, I confess to a love of fiction where the setting almost becomes a supporting character. The references to bayous and voodoo were a bit confusing for me . But I am not very well traveled so what do I know from low country or bayou?It was free. I consider that to be a generous offer. It appears that many people are enjoying this book. Try it for yourself."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"Really surprised by the positive reviews for this book. I usually enjoy books that have sibling dynamics but the 3 brothers in this book went way over the line from the normal over protective.

Unfortunately, her boyfriend is not buying the ultimatum, so Maggie decides to have fun and find someone willing to love her and support her career choice.Maggie has two over protective brothers (a little over the top but there are reasons why they are and written in the storyline quite nicely.), along with their hot childhood best friend Chase.After spending time together, Maggie and Chase begin to see each other in a new light and have some steamy scenes that build up with great anticipation.Chase had a horrible childhood in which his mother abandoned him and he doesn't feel he is good enough for Maggie. Besides, he's \\"blood brothers\\" with Maggie's brothers and feels he will betray them if he allows his desire for Maggie to unfold.There is humor in the form of a nudist colony, a \\"fake\\" hunk, huge misunderstandings and disasters plaguing her brother's business.This is a well written story that kept my attention all the way through.

That days topic is about women who want to marry their boyfriends right then or end the romance. She's been involved with her boyfriend Jeffrey of four years and she's more then ready for him to make a further commitment. When her boyfriend still wants to put off getting married, she leaves the studio and him behind. Instead of feeling as heartbroken about it as she would have thought she would, she feels like a huge weight has been lifted off her shoulders. No longer living part of her life through Jeff like she has done for years she decides to start focusing on some of her own dreams for a change. One of which is starting a decorating business. She decides one of her brother's upcoming projects is the perfect place to start. Her brothers pretend to agree, but hire Chase as a kind of babysitter on the project to make sure she doesn't go to wild on her designing choices. This puts Chase and Maddie in close contact with each other quite a bit and now that Maddie is all grown up, Chase is really starting to see Maddie as a woman for the first time and not the skinny twelve year old he remembers from the past.Lance and Reid are quite over protective of their sister and this leads to a pretty hilarious incident involving the brothers and Chase and a nudist colony. Maddie herself ends up in a hilarious situation or two. Will Lance and Reid lighten up long enough for Maddie to see if the relationship she has with Chase can lead to something real. And will Chase have to choose between a romance with her or his friendship with her brothers. A friendship he developed when he really didn't have anyone else in the world to hang on to. Also is he ready and willing to commit and settle down with just one woman? And is there someone trying to sabotage the brother's business as they have had more then their usual share of problems on their current projects. Is it Jeffrey who could be trying to get revenge for being humiliated on tv or could it be something to do with their paren't secrets? As all three siblings are keeping secrets of things they have discovered about their parents from each other?This was a very entertaining romance and I was excited to find out how everything would work out in the end.

But this one bugged me enough to say something. It wasn't bad writing. And it did have a good amount of humor, I admit to laughing out loud on a few occasions. My problem is that by the time I reached 50% on my Kindle, I was so sick and tired of reading about the same problem over and over and over, it just became annoying. So much so, I stopped reading it altogether. It was the same problems: 3 brothers telling their 23 year old sister, Maddie, you can't do this, you can't do that; and Chase constantly going over why why why he can't be with Maddie. Seriously? How many times did the same set of emotions, the same set of problems have to be rehashed within one book, and in just the first half at that! Sorry, this is one I just could not finish :("},{"Title":"Marry Me, Maddie (Time of Your Life)","review":"What's up with all the great reviews? I couldn't even finish this book. The brothers were just too over the top. I hated them all. Stupid, aggressive, narrow-minded men. When I stopped reading, the hero wasn't much better. A trouble maker who seemed to only have good looks going for him. The attempts at humor were lame. Even Maddie wasn't much, although in her way she was likable. But why such a smart woman would cow-tow to her dumb brothers and adore a less than brilliant man is a mystery to me. I'm sure glad I got this for free. Sorry Maddie, but you'd have been better off telling all those men to kiss off and pursuing a career somewhere far away.

It's chock full of detailed information. We'll be using this for years."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"This is a wonderful book for studying ANY aspect of nature (except ocean life.) Thoroughly discusses all details of any living thing that you could dream of...want to know where a cricket's ears are located? How to tell if you have a male/female? What should you feed your cricket? Ever wondered why a lightning bug &quot;lights up&quot;? How can you tell if you have a male or female? Covers birds, fish, reptiles, wild animals, farm animals, pets, trees, flowers, rocks, weather, stars, etc, ETC!!! Many labled diagrams. A GREAT book, and written to fit in wonderfully with a Charlotte Mason philosophy. Geared towards elementary grades and complete with lessons, questions, projects, etc. Over 800 pages of easily understood information. As the original was published in 1911, be aware that the photos are not in color, nor as clear as modern nature guides, but the book MORE than makes up for this in so many ways! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I have a fairly decent natural science home library, and this book is probably the jewel in the crown. It's packed with information, and even though some data has been updated by recent discoveries (the book was first issued nearly a century ago) much of it is still relevent.The author has a contagious awe for the world around us, from caddis fly larvae to little brown bats (which she recommends keeping for a while in order to observe closely). She wrote this when our society was less urbanized and more hands-on, so a lot of her audience (teachers and their young students) had only to march out into a nearby field to collect specimens. Today, we're more used to sanitized, distilled, controllable nature--and nothing that can't be washed away with antibacterial soap--that we forget how compelling these little anthill or treetop dramas are.Comstock brings us into that wild world, and we don't have to go far to find it, after all. Her anecdotes about her personal experiences and her study questions that end each section keep this book from becoming just another field guide. Even if you don't have young kids with whom to share these adventures, it's great to have this resource at hand.And if you do have young kids, it's fun to go mucking around in a ditch right after a storm, looking for tadpoles. Don't be obsessive about diseases (we all eat a pound of dirt before we die...or so they say) and don't forget to bring this book."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"This book was originally written for elementary school teachers with little knowledge of common plants and animals. The book is as helpful and relevant today as it was when first written in 1911---dandelions, toads, leaves and constellations have changed little since that time! Whether you live in the mountains or on a farm with wide expanses of Nature spread before you, or whether your Nature Study involves the bugs and flowers of a small urban backyard, you'll find easy directions and valuable information about studying firsthand the natural world and it's wonders."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I was afraid when I saw this book that it would be \\"too Big\\" for me to use with my children. It is not it. It includes instructions and suggestions on how to teach nature studies in the chapter 1. The following cover ANIMALS, PLANTS, EARTH AND SKY making it a very complete science text. It is both simple, and very thorough. It was originally published in 1911 by Anna Botsford Comstock, But please do not allow that fact to turn you off either! It is an excellent guide for the study of nature (biology, botony and earth science.) One might wish for it to include colored pictures, however, since you will create your own notebook with illustrations, and since we have ample resources for colored pictures as well as sound bytes on the enternet, I couldn't ask for more."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"My boys love this book, so I decided to try to get it for my Kindle because the larger font size makes it much easier for me to read. So I downloaded a sample, and found that they didn't even bother with a linked TOC in this HUGE book, the formatting is atrocious, and the pictures weren't included.Keep in mind that this book is in the public domain. Ambleside Online provides links to download the book for free, and an internet search would surely provide the same. The ONLY reason to purchase this book rather than just downloading it would be to have a linked TOC, proper formatting, and the pictures.Basically, Amazon took two minutes worth of time to download the free online text, then decided to sell it for a ridiculous price (considering what it lacks).

This book encourages learning and is a great resourse. It's a wonderful addition to anyone's library!!"},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I checked this book out of our local library because it was recommended for homeschoolers and because of the reviews here at Amazon.com. I do agree this is an excellent book BUT not very useful when you live in Hawaii. Seems the animals and plants the writer focusses on are mostly common to the eastcoast of the US. If you live in Hawaii, and possibly other places on the mainland, this book in not very helpful in studying our daily environment."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"While I do not agree with everything the author asserts about teaching methodology, I doubt there is any other book on the market that is as comprehensive as this one. What other textbook can be used with equal effectiveness in both kindergarten and high school? Lessons are short and easy to follow. It covers almost everything including agriculture, wildlife, geology, astronomy, etc. Marine life and oceanography are not included. Some minor flaws. For example, the author confuses selective breeding with evolution theory. However, such flaws can be overlooked and they do not detract from the value of the lessons."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"This is an excellent resource that my family and I take with us when we go out for nature walks. There are lots of pictures that we use to compare what we see along the way. The descriptions and facts help us learn what we never knew before. Great for homeschooling families."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"We purchased this book for our two little ones and have enjoyed running to get the book when we see unusual and interesting bugs, leaves, etc. outside in our natural wonderland of a back yard! We even keep the book on the bookshelves in the kitchen for fast reference! I have noticed that not everything we have wanted to look up is in the book but not everything can be and we are very pleased with the book as a whole. I do wish there were colored pictures to help me identify certain creatures when I'm not 100% sure &quot;that is it&quot;."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"The print quality of this book is horrible. The pictures look like a copy of a copy and are so dark that they are basically indiscernible. The text is amazing though. Very informative and well rounded.

I'm not sure about the edition by Comstock Publishing/Cornell University Press-that edition may be better as well."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I want to first say that The Handbook of Nature Study is one of my very favorite books. I have loved my paperback copy so much that it eventually fell apart (in half actually) and so my husband ordered the hardback copy this time. I was surprised when it came in that the photos were very faint, as if they were xerox copies of the version I had before. The greatest shock, however, came when I went to look something up in Part IV of the book and found that the hardback version has just left that whole section out!! It stops right where Part IV should begin. I am very disappointed in the hardback version and would suggest to everyone to get the paperback version."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"Do not let the size and scope or antiquity of this book dissuade you from having a copy on your shelf - on top of our shelf - easily accessible. This book should be considered the encyclopedia of questions to all things relating to the natural world, those things most easily accessible from your own back yard or county park - and yet those things walked over and not observed. I have enjoyed the questions she gives for each object of nature - as an adult who loves and has studied science - Nature Study brings in a whole completely different level of observation skills. To write - to draw - to photograph - to dissect - to see up close that which we walk over or by from a distance. I would recommend any family - any person - have this book on their shelf next to their dictionary, field guides, and bible."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"This book is just old enough to be a record of how people used to think about going outside and why fresh air/nature experiences were needed in a child's life/education--and yet it is modern enough to still be really useful in the information presented pertaining to birds, plants, weather, and the night sky. I also found the excellent introductory material a challenge to all educators (home, public, and private) to step up and help children relate to the created world better through observing nature all around them. Excellent parent resource!"},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"Critics of the Handbook must know first that this book, approaching 100 years in print 2011, is a classic of nature education, and that the author, Anna Botsford Comstock is considered by many to be the \\"Grandmother of Nature Education\\" Though the names Liberty Hyde Bailey and John Spencer, to whom she dedicated this book, may not mean much to audiences today, we have them and Anna to thank for what is now a growing international movement to get kids and their parents and their teachers outdoors. Reading the foreward by Verne Rockcastle alone should remind us that we hold not just a \\"nature book\\" in our hands but a historical work of science, education and natural history. Yes, the pictures are in black and white and the lessons are dated and regional (New England/Upstate NY)but consider the historical significance and the lifework of this remarkable woman, who is all but forgotten today - well - by most. Those of us who admire her go off and get our PhD's on the many aspects of her life, philosophy and accomplishments."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"This is a book that is so full of valuable nature info that we use it almost daily.

We'll be using and enjoying it for a long time."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I purchased this book to use as a resource in our homeschool. My first impression upon receiving it was that the pictures were kind of grainy. As I continued to look, some of the pictures were almost unrecognizable, dark with very few visible details. Later I happened to see an older printing of this book, and the photos were much superior, many printed on glossy paper, and much easier to compare to actual samples from the wild. The text is fascinating and valuable, even though it is old fashioned at places. But I wish I hadn't paid almost 40 dollars for a \\"field guide\\" with bad pictures. It would be worth it to look around and consider some other editions of this book."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"A significant portion of this book contains study notes and guides for species not found in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e. bird species, flower species, constellations, etc). There is still much to glean from this extensive resource. I am happy to refer to an electronic version when I need inspiration instead of purchasing a large book for which a good half of the shelf space taken is not useable in my country."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I am just so surprised at how many reviewers think this book is perfect for homeschooling. Not that it isn't. However, this book is not written for the homeschooling-exclusives, and I don't want other people to be veered away from it. Two of my children (4, and 5 years old) go to public school. It's October now, and my child is going to the pumpkin patch tomorrow, so we looked up \\"pumpkin\\" in the index and talked about it. The book is a great tool because it is not watered down at all, like most children's books are. The text is way harder than a 4 or 5 year old can really digest, but the information is scientific but relevant to little minds. I am a firm believer that you always need to present material a step up from where your kids are. Even my 4 year old is able to ask intelligent questions after reading with me parts of this book."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"We don't use this book all the time but it is a great book to use for a resource.

You can have the wonderful color photos and quick facts from the guides...and a delightful learning experience from Handbook of Nature Study."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I've no doubt this book is useful in some ways. One of the first passages I read, however, was from the chapter on \\"The Red Squirrel or Chickaree,\\" which I settled for because this book has nothing on gray squirrels, which are common to our area (Minnesota). I'll quote what I found:\\"We ought to yield admiring tribute to those animals which have been able to flourish in our midst despite man and his gun, this weapon being the most cowardly and unfair invention of the human mind. The only time that man has been a fair fighter in combating his four-footed brethren was when he fought them with a weapon which he wielded in his hand. There is nothing in animal comprehension which can take into account a projectile, and much less shot from a gun; but though it does not understand, it experiences a deathly fear at the noise. It is pathetic to note the hush in a forest that follows the sound of a gun; every song, every voice, every movement is stilled and every little heart filled with nameless terror. How any man or boy can feel manly when, with this scientific instrument of death in his hands, he takes the life of a little squirrel, bird or rabbit, is beyond my comprehension. In pioneer days when it was a fight for existence, man against the wilderness, the matter was quite different; but now it seems to me that anyone who hunts what few wild creatures we have left, and which are in nowise injurious, is, whatever he may think of himself, no believer in fair play . . .\\"Now, I know that there are plenty of folks out there who would agree with this viewpoint, but I do not. I come from a family of hunters, and I'm proud of that. We don't hunt because we enjoy killing animals; we hunt for food (elk and deer, mostly), and my brothers and cousins have encountered creatures (while hunting) that were most definitely \\"harmful\\" to man (given the chance). Has Ms. Comstock ever encountered a bear or a mountain lion? Has she ever been grateful when a gun was available with which to protect families with small children from these animals? Probably not.All in all, I may use parts or this book for homeschool, but only by library loan and only after reading the section over myself beforehand. It's something I've gotten used to having to do with many other books (science and history, usually, to avoid the politically-correct drivel that fills many modern textbooks). I won't be investing a penny in this book (not even library late fees, if I can help it). I'm writing this review just to give a heads-up to others who might resent the sanctimonious tone of the author with regards to anyone who happens to hunt or own a gun."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"This is an excellent resource for learning about or refreshing one's knowledge of the plants and animals of the Eastern United States.

You don't need to strap a two hundred pound backpack onto your aching spine and head off into some Blair Witch project area just to teach your younglings about trees and wildlife. Color field guides are extremely helpful, but you certainly don't need an advanced degree in botany to teach your child the difference between a morning glory and a daisy. And almost one hundred years ago, Ms. Comstock recognized that and set about showing others the joy of introducing a child to the natural world with her book, Handbook of Nature Study.The first section covers the how-tos of her method. This method encompasses all the core subject areas and is covered in further detail in the methodology section - a link is provided at the end of this article.Subsequent sections cover the entire spectrum of the natural world. There is an area devoted to animals, which includes subsections on mammals, fish, birds, and other branches of the animal family tree. Another area is devoted to plants and covers trees, wildflowers, crops, and even weeds. But this is not just a biology and botany manual. The third main area is devoted to the earth and sky and includes astronomy, climatology, and geology.Lessons include an information section for the parent/teacher to read followed by observational questions to be asked of the student. Easily utilized in a zoo, botanical garden or local park, even those in the most urban of areas will find incorporating this book into their lives relatively simple. Best used with the 12 and under set, the Handbook of Nature Study should have a place on every homeschooler's bookshelves."},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study","review":"I purchased this book since I loved the original version that I have checked out many times from my local library.

He includes information on his last great battle during that War; his capture, the death march, the 1/2 way camp in Suan called The Mining Camp, and his long imprisonment as a POW. As this author points out, most of our troops were good men doing the best they could to survive and abide the oaths they had taken as a members of our military.

This is a \\"must read\\" book for anyone studying the history of the American Revolution era or anyone studying constitutional law.I also highly recommend Rakove's excellent and concise biography of James Madison, the Father of the Constitution. Search at Amazon.com for \\"James Madison Rakove.\\""},{"Title":"The framing of the Constitution of the United States","review":"This was, in its day, a classic on the Constitutional Convention, held in 1787. Farrand was, indeed, an expert. He had published a four volume set on key records of the Convention, with the fourth volume representing corrections of his original three volumes. Much has happened since in 1913, so this cannot be regarded as the \\"last word\\" in scholarship of the Constitutional Convention. But it is an important point on the historical analysis of the founding document of American government.The work is pretty straightforward in its structure. It begins by laying out the background to calling the Convention in 1787. It proceeds to examine the members selected to represent their states in Philadelphia. Why the desire for a convention to explore the country's governmental structure? It had been claimed that the then-existing constitution, the Articles of Confederation, were not up to the task. Thus, a \\"revision\\" was needed. Needless to say, the Constitutional Convention was a \\"runaway convention\\" as it went beyond its mandate to create an entirely new Constitution.There follows the work of the Convention, considering the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey Plan, and the Compromise that brought contentious debate to a compromise. Then, other issues, such as the nature of the presidency, are explored.All in all, a useful work for understanding the changing views of the Constitution. And, even though it was written long ago, this book still has some value in illuminating the dynamics of the Constitutional Convention."},{"Title":"The framing of the Constitution of the United States","review":"Farrand is an early 20th century Liberal, which is to say he would not recognize any of those who now claim that label.

Stanley's book offers a variety of methods for introducing students and instructors alike to the idea that research is in fact a process, including step-by-step lesson plans and techniques which detail each step in that process, from finding and developing a topic to collecting the information, organizing it, and creating a final project. The book shows exactly how to plan and prepare for teaching students about the research process, a process which is often overlooked in the rush to assign essays and other projects which require a modicum of research.If anything, the book attempts to do too much, with the first sections devoted to very specific instructions for the neophyte library/media specialist. Stanley gets a bit bogged-down in such details as the scheduling of the media center, designing a master calendar, and so forth for the book to be entirely successful at accomplishing its stated goal. In fact, out of the four main sections within the book, only one is devoted to the actual research process, with perhaps a bit too much emphasis placed on the value and importance of note-taking as a part of the process.Still, _Practical Steps to the Research Process for Middle School_, which is primarily aimed at an audience of library/media specialists, is a useful source, with many charts and other graphics that could be taken directly for use as handouts or overheads. In fact, the book would be a useful source for any middle school instructor interested in teaching his/her students more about the research process."},{"Title":"Practical Steps to the Research Process for Middle School (Information Literacy Series)","review":"I have been teaching middle school for close to two decades. This book is one of the best research guides I have ever used. Very practical, as the title suggests."},{"Title":"Mystery Hotel","review":"The dialogue in this book is a little stilted and awkward in some places, but otherwise the book's okay. Jean and Pierre live in the Greenview Hotel, where Jean's father is the manager and Pierre's father is the chef. They are allowed to play in the empty rooms on the thirteenth floor and keep their pet, a black cat, there. All is going well for them until a valuable ruby necklace (with thirteen large rubies and thirteen small rubies) that belongs to a prominent guest disappears. The guest first blames the children, saying that they carelessly left her door unlocked. Then, she becomes convinced that Pierre's father is the culprit and demands that he be arrested and that Jean's father resign from his position because of the theft. To save their fathers, Jean and Pierre must find the rubies and discover who the real thief is. Not a bad mystery for kids who are just getting into chapter books."},{"Title":"Cinema Under the Stars: America's Love Affair with Drive-In Movie Theaters","review":"A reasonable attempt to cover the love that we all have for drive-ins, but unfortunately it misses the mark. The pictures are great but over-all you can tell the authors don't really know the business.Several major inaccuracies exist including a cover of a Castle 8mm and 16mm home movie catalog with the caption \\"Brochure offered by Castle Films for theatre owners\\". Even keen amateurs would know that Castle Films are for home movie use only and their commercial rights are expressly forbidden. Drive-in operators delt with the major distribution companies exclusively and only with 35mm and 70mm film.At the right price it's worth a read, but there are other authors like Don and Susan Sanders and Kerry Seagrave amongst others, who are experts in this genre and deserve your dollars first."},{"Title":"Cinema Under the Stars: America's Love Affair with Drive-In Movie Theaters","review":"Very nicely put together, great graphics throughout (though the Janet Lane paintings are not necessary), nice color section.

Our narrator is a deliciously innocent, well-meaning and attractive vacationer, Nicola Ferris, (think Elizabeth Shue in 'The Saint' not perky Hayley Mills who in the movie of the same name was a burgeoning adolescent--this Nicola is a consummate situation-manager on a mission, accustomed to controlling her life and the people around her)who in refusing to back out of an affair she unwittingly steps into, discovers the one situation she cannot manage without help. It takes the handsome stranger, in the guise of competent English tourist Mark Langley (and yes, a young Peter McEnery will do quite,) to turn the tables on her while pressing her into a less dominant role that she finds she actually likes. Mark's teenaged brother, the kidnapped Colin and his clever forays into the stranger world of British slang, provides an effective comedic foil for the straight-laced Mark and his Greek counterpart, the English-idiom-challenged caique-owner, Lambis. The insiduous-pallikarathes villan, Stratos, one part charm to two parts unstable lethal weapon, the slithering eel-like Tony, and sadly-complaisant, hard-working Sofia, round up the players along with Nicola's older but wiser cousin, Frances.Don't miss this one--the prose alone will have you chucking your stalward life and buying a Greek wildflower guide along with a one-way ticket to Crete just to stand in the presence of those languidly spinning windmills!"},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"After reading Nine Coaches Waiting I went looking for more books by Mary Stewart, and this one somehow caught my attention first. The Moonspinners is awesome, one of Stewart's best.Nicola is a young woman on holiday from her job at the Embassy in Greece, who agrees to meet up with an older friend on Crete. She arrives before her friend, and goes exploring in the mountains above the village where she will be staying. There she finds Mark, who has been wounded by a gunshot, and his Greek friend Lambis, and ends up tending to Mark for a night while Lambis goes back to their boat. Nicola finds out that Mark's brother Colin was kidnapped by Cretan men after they witnessed the possible murder of a Greek man, and Mark himself was wounded and presumed dead by the kidnappers/murderers. Nicola goes down to the village and meets up with her friend Frances, but can't seem to stop thinking about Mark and his brother, and does some sleuthing of her own, though she promised Mark she'd stay out of it.I think what I love most about this book is how subtly the romance between Mark and Nicola develops--they're only together for about twenty or thirty pages of the entire book, but their interest in each other is very believable and not contrived or forced for the sake of the story."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"I, too, was amazed to discover how different the book was from the screen adaptation. As much as I enjoyed the movie, the novel is on another level entirely. After reading it, I would suggest that the movie should bear the sub-title &quot;Roughly suggested by Mary Stewart's novel of the same name&quot;.Nicola may have her moments of weakness, but unlike many other Stewart heroines who seem to go around in a bit of a fog to keep the suspense level higher, she does the best she can mentally with the information at her disposal. Her actions and reactions were uniformly true to her established character, and her courage was both admirable and somehow believeable.The suspense builds steadily right up to the end with no let-down, and unless your satisfaction depends on a heroine who also qualifies as a kind of samauri-warrior, I don't think you'll be disappointed in Nicola's personal involvement in the climactic sequence. (Compare her end-role with that of the heroine in Ms. Stewart's next novel &quot;This Rough Magic&quot; - which bears a striking similarity to &quot;The Moonspinners&quot; - and I think you'll see what I mean.)Personally, I rate the mystery and suspense books I read on a scale from one to ten, and &quot;The Moonspinners&quot; is one of only three that has gotten a 10 from me."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"While the Disney film 'The Moon-Spinners' starring Hayley Mills is a fab movie, it doesn't do this book justice. If you're a viewer of the film and think you know the plot: think again.

It was the first book of hers I had read and it led me to search for and purchase all of her writings. The stories are suspenseful, there is always a hint of romance, and the ending is not always obvious (a problem in some so called mysteries). There is also a movie version of The Moon Spinners, but do not read the book first if you want to enjoy it - it changes too much of the story. Reading The Moon Spinners will induct you into the Mary Stewart fan club. This and Touch Not the Cat are definitely her finest."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"The ancient greek setting in Crete, romance in the air for a young girl, death and mystery await. The spell-binding mysteries and adventure only add to the romance that Mary Stewart has captured in not only this adventurous love affair, but in all of her Historical romances. I have read all of her novels and wish there were more to savor."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"Any time you pick up a book by Mary Stewart you are guaranteed a well written and well researched story with interesting characters and stunning settings. Moonspinners is set in Greece, and you do feel as though you are almost there with the main characters of the story. Nicola Ferris is a secretary at the British Embassy in Athens and she takes off for some R &amp; R on Crete, little knowing that her vacation will bring adventure and danger and of course romance. My only quibble with this book, as well as with other Mary Stewart romance/mysteries is that the heroine tends to depend on her male friend a little too often and also gets rather weepy on occasion. The fact that almost all the characters smoke contantly also dates the story a bit. But all in all its a good book and the perfect companion for holiday reading."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"Mary Stewart is a brilliant author. I've read the Moonspinners several times, and I'm always hooked from the very first line: \\"It was the egret, flying out of the lemon-grove, that started it.\\"Sparks of romance light the way through this unique mystery filled with danger and delight. Swept along with Nicola and Mark--as they risk their lives in the exotic White Mountains of Crete--this story is fresh for me every time!"},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"\\"The Moonspinners\\" is an excellent Mary Stewart adventure novel, first published in 1962. The story features a plucky young Englishwoman named Nicola Ferris, a junior employee at the British Embassy in Athens, who goes on vacation in Crete at a remote location on the coast. While out on a walk, she stumbles into the middle of a deadly situation involving a wounded but dashing young Englishman and his kidnapped younger brother. Over a matter of just days, Nicola will save the life of the wounded man, then search for his missing brother, right under the noses of a deadly gang of Greek thieves. Their Greek enemies will retaliate, leading to a suspenseful final confrontation offshore.Mary Stewart wrote a number of these novels, mixing adventure and romance with proper 1960's decorum. What makes \\"The Moonspinners\\" stand out is her intricate plotting, her almost reverent sense of detail for the scenery and culture of the Greek Isles, and her ability to keep the exploits of her heroes and heroines within the realm of the believable. The result is a crisply written, fast-moving story with adventure around every turn. \\"The Moonspinners\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Mary Stewart and her novels."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"I first read this book when in my teens and have lost track of the number of times I've reread it. Needless to say, this is on the top of my favorites list. Alas, I've always wanted to visit Crete, but haven't been there yet."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"Nicola Ferris is a young English woman working in Athens. She takes a break to go on holiday to Crete. But things go wrong. She gets there before her cousin Frances, gets off course, and encounters two men, one of whom is seriously wounded. It appears that he's witnessed a crime taking place and is now in hiding. The worst part is that his fifteen-year-old brother is missing. Have the killers kidnapped the boy? What is going on in those exotic yet isolated lands? What transpires is something sinister and dangerous indeed, and Nicola will have to deal with both the man she's decided to help and the group of people surrounding them on her own.The Moonspinners, first published in 1962, is my sixth Mary Stewart novel. Three of them I loved, the other two not so much. The sixth one falls into the former. Imagine, if you will, paradise: beautiful and exotic surroundings, no one in sight except you and perhaps a few local shepherds. Then you realize you're on your own and involved in something where you may end up dead. You can't escape; there is no escape, for you're surrounded. Mary Stewart creates the perfect atmosphere for beauty, romance and terror. Her descriptions draw you in from the first page. The Moonspinners, like the other Stewart books I've read, is quite a quick read. You'll wish it were longer. This is one of Stewart's most popular titles. There is even a film loosely based on it (never seen it). She's a great author. Even though most of her novels were romantic suspense, most of them are very unique, not very repetitive. She also chose some rather exotic settings for each book. The Ivy Tree and Thornyhold are the only books of hers I've read so far set in England. I have My Brother Michael and The Rose Cottage on my TBR pile and I can't wait to read them."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"A young English woman who lives in Athens chooses the small town of Agios Georgios, in Crete, for her vacation.

A good example of how to write."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"If you appreciate an 'old fashioned' tale free of graphic intimacy and violence, if you appreciate vivid description, romance and intrigue this is for you. I read all but one of Mary Stewart's books in my early twenty's through late thirties. Now, nearing seventy, I am rereading them and cherishing the stories I read in my young years. I have divested myself of hundreds of books. Mary Stewart's remain a constant. Though I prefer some over others \\"Moonspinners\\" is one of my favorites. It tells of a young girl traveling with her aunt in Crete. I enjoy Ms. Stewart's chapters that open with an English poet's work from Keats to Shakespeare. Moonspinners was made into a Disney film by the same title that did not do the story justice. Like most of Mary Stewart's work there is murder, intrigue and betrayal. This story is no exception."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"I've read all of Mary Stewart's books and owned most of them at least once.

I first got interested when I chanced to see the Disney movie on one night this past summer at two in the morning. I was hooked by the movie, and the book was even better!

Stewart's tale of murder, mystery and romance set on the sunny shores of Greece thrilled me to my very core. I usually don't care for books with much discription, but the vivid detail Stewart gave instantly transported me to Nicky's side as she struggled to find the truth about her new friends and dangerous circumstances. I had never read any of Stewart's books before, but I have not stopped since picking this one up. It stays so fresh and exciting that I never tire of re-reading it."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"Quite simply, Mary Stewart's best book, with an beautiful setting and finely-drawn suspense.

Nicola Ferris takes a vacation from her job at the British Embassy in Athens and plans on meeting her cousin Frances in a small village on the island of Crete. Arriving a day early, she decides to traipse through the White Mountains and in true Stewart fashion soon finds herself in the thick of danger, mystery and of course a hero in need of feminine assistance. Mark Langley and his younger brother Colin had been attacked after witnessing a crime, Mark was wounded and they assume Colin is murdered or been taken hostage. Nicola spends a night tending to Mark as Lambis goes for supplies and she is then forcefully sent on her way to forget what she's seen and continue her holiday. But of course it's not quite as simple as that and once settled into her hotel she recognizes Mark's attackers from the description he gave her and the adventure begins.And that's all I'm going to tell. What follows is a darn-near unputdownable tale of mystery, cat-and-mouse intrigues and unexpected plot turns all leading up to one incredible nail-biting finish (I must get hold of the film now). I really enjoyed Nicola and Mark, they had just the right spark and spunkiness to play off of each other and add a perfect light-heartedness to the story (lol, his comments at the end when she had to wear his brother's slightly too tight pants), and I loved the way she can set up her scenes - everything on the island literally came alive for me from the tiniest flower, to the windmills, the mountains as well as those treacherous rocks alongside the bay. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"Mary Stewart keeps the reader involved through the entire tale. A woman working at a mundane job going on a calming and quiet, mundane vacation is immediately whisked into the mountains and smack dab in the middle of a murder. Working through the murder and events kept me entertained for the most part. 4 stars for one simple reason - secondary character development of the love interest was lacking for me. I know Nicola was instantly intriqued and helpful but she continued because of a love interest (though she denies it most of the way through). I saw it happening however it was such a small fraction of \\"time\\" that I didn't experience it. Other than that, Loved. It."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"A favorite mystery that is worth reading again over time.

The rising action parts were really great too."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"This is one of my favorite books, I've wore out several copies and it's very difficult to find.

I had Mary Stewart's THE MOONSPINNERS. I just returned to it after, ahem, 36 years, and found that in many ways it held up the 14-year-old's original assessment. It is witty, the characters attractive, the action spritely and believable. The scenery of the Greek isle of Crete is rendered intoxicatingly, so much so that I can see why it helped inspire the 14-year-old to become the 16-year-old who went off on her own parentless adventure overseas. The almost 50-year-old is surprised to relearn that the oh-so adult heroine and hero are in their very early twenties. Mere children! Ultimately, the book does not hide its romance genre genes or its era. The heroine, who initially bristles at the male characters' sense of superiority does give in a little to it, and a little gratefully at that, at the end. There is use of the word &quot;greedily&quot; in place of &quot;hungrily&quot;--a pet peeve of mine. The author's ability to quote classic works at the drop of a hat was awe inspiring to the 14-year-old reader; it has all the suspicious cache of Bartlett's to the almost 50-year-old. There is a bit of a nationalist subtext, too: the Brit abroad sees American characters as friendly and nave and the native Cretes as rather primitive and amusing. The 14-year-old went on to read other novels by Mary Stewart and others like her but none matched THE MOONSPINNERS. There is something about it that is better than what I know of its genre, and it may have sent me on the path to serious literature sooner rather than later as much as it sent me abroad."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"It is enough that this novel is by one of my all-time favorite authors.

In other words, this book IMPRINTED on me as a teenager. The mystery, the romance, the foreign location, the beauty, the lushness of the scenery! Notice I didn't even say, the written description of the lushness - you just forget you're reading when you're reading Mary Stewart! It's like a Mary Poppins painting - you step into it and you are there! For her time, one of the best author's alive writing!

The service was extremely fast right during the Christmas rush. The book was in perfect condition."},{"Title":"The Moon-Spinners","review":"I'm always afraid that books I loved many years ago won't stand up to a 21st century reread. I'm delighted to report that The Moonspinners does. Unlike a couple of other novels of romantic suspense published about the same time I've recently reread and thrown across the room, the heroine of this one is independent and resourceful, makes decisions and saves the day.Nicola Ferris is young but courageous. With only a rudimentary knowlege of Greek, she gets a job in the British Embassy in Athens and spends her weekends and holidays exploring the countryside. Of course her language skills improve, but it is that intrepid spirit that sets the scene for The Moonspinners. Enroute to a small village on Crete to meet her cousin for an Easter vacation, Nicola stumbles onto a mystery and the hunky Mark, who's been shot in the shoulder. For safety's sake, he urges her to continue her journey and forget she met him, but that's not our Nicola's way. What follows is a breathless cat and mouse game as Nicola tries to locate Mark's missing younger brother and find out who shot Mark and why. Set in a charming Cretan village, Mary Steward took full advantage of its sights, sounds and smells and her prose is so descriptive, it's like being there.Mary Stewart wrote for educated and civilized readers. Her characters have lovely manners and it's a pleasure to read about them. Another thing I really enjoy about her books is their frequent allusions to classic works of literature, with the assumption the reader will get them. I always learn something from her books, things that stick with me long after I've forgotten the plot and the characters, and I've remembered the story of the Moonspinners since I read the book for the first time. I'm looking forward to rereading all of Ms. Stewart's books. It'll be like meeting up with old friends."},{"Title":"A Primer of Jungian Psychology","review":"I expect to start reading this book in about a week.

At 140 pages in length, the text is an easy read with no wasted words and no convoluted passages to unravel. It addresses Jung's entire system and provides succinct, memorable summaries of each concept.The Book is broken up into seven chapters:1. Carl Gustav Jung (biographical background)2. The Structure of Personality (the psyche, conscious, personal unconscious and collective unconscious)3. The Dynamics of Personality (psychic energy and values, the principles of equivalence and entropy, etc.)4. The Development of Personality (individuation, transcendence and integration, etc.)5. Psychological Types (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuitive)6. Symbols and Dreams7. Jung's Place in Psychology.For more eminently readable Jungian psychology, try Marie-Louise von Franz."},{"Title":"A Primer of Jungian Psychology","review":"This book is so clearly written that reading it becomes a numinous experience. Dr. Jung's unique knowledge of universal themes in myths, tales, and dreams, and of alchemy, and Eastern philosophy brings, together with the scientific Western approach, new elements to the understanding of the human psyche. Consequently, I would say that this analytic psychology's chief aim is individuation and self-realization. Hall and Nordby address this matter very lucidly showing the importance of transcendence and intergration in the process of individuation. Indeed, this process is one of self-knowledge, &quot;Education is drawing out from the person, something that is already there in a nascent state, and not the filling up of an empty container with academic knowledge&quot; (p.83). Altogether, this book is a cromprehensive work addresing concepts such as; the collective unconscious, archetypes, complexes, the shadow, introversion and extroversion, and it even includes a brief description of synchronicity. Undoubtedly, it is worth reading,"},{"Title":"A Primer of Jungian Psychology","review":"This book is absolutly wonderfull; it defines all of Jung's major psychological contributions in layman's terms.

Writing in 1936, before the Second World War, Harold Weinstein examines the question of patriotism (as derived from the French Revolution) among French socialists, and its role in shaping their reaction to the events which culminated in the First World War.

How long does it take because I received the other items."},{"Title":"Wellington (Armed Services edition)","review":"Philip Guedalla wrote \\"The Duke\\" in 1931, when the exploits of the First Duke of Wellington were still generally known to his audience. Wellington is less well known today outside of the circles of military history and Guedall'a knowing biography may be more of a challenge to the modern reader without background in the Napoleonic Wars.In a brisk but witty narrative, Guedalla retraces the life and long career of Arthur Wesley, later Duke of Wellington. Wesley's unpromising youth provides no foreshadowing of his future greatness. Indeed, as told by Guedalla, Wellington become serious about his life and his occupation as a soldier only after his marriage suite for his future wife was turned down by her parents over his indifferent prospects. Guedalla rescues Wellington's highly successful apprenticeship in arms in India from historical obscurity; only Jac Weller has covered that period better. Wellington's successes in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo have been well-documented and Guedalla does not place undue emphasis on this portion of his career. Guedalla does carry the narrative forward into Wellington's long career in government and in politics after Waterloo, where, despite long and faithful public service, he might fairly be said to have outlived his times. Wellington spent a military lifetime defeating the more rabid effects of the French Revolution; as a politicain, he found himself often out of synch with the much more peaceful English Revolution that followed.It is Guedalla's gift as an historian to place Wellington in the context of his times and especially of his social class as a member of the Anglo-Irish nobility. His extensive research into Wellington's correspondence has produced a weath of quotes that help provide a flavor of the man. Guedalla avoids the temptation to speculate; Wellington's worlds and actions are allowed to speak for him. We come away with a sense of Wellington as a strict, disciplined, methodical, and confident military officer endowed with both an enourmous amount of common sense about people and politics and with distinct pride and ambition about his own career.As noted, Guedalla assumes of the reader a solid acquaintance with the history of the Napoleonic Wars and of British history for the period of Wellington's life. A reader without that background may find some of Guedalla's references to be obscure.This book is highly recommended to students of the life of the Duke of Wellington."},{"Title":"Glencoe (IL) (Images of America)","review":"This book provides a wealth of information about the history of Glencoe, IL, and is written by highly skilled authors who are exceptionally knowledgeable about the topic: both have long taken leadership roles on the Board of the Glencoe Historical Society.

He bends facts and contradicts himself several places in this book.Here are a few that jumped out at meMisrepresentation of the facts -Page 89 - The Hyatt collapse wasn't bad design rather the builder changed the construction and inspectors weren't doing their job.281 - He talks about farm implement companies' negative reaction to his walking tractor proposal. Troy-Bilt Rototiller has around since 1937, was and is building a 10 HP tiller very similar to the one pictured.Contradicts himself -Page 6 he says, \\"Design must be meaningful.

He was a very impressive speaker, drawing from a seemingly bottomless well of ecological design ideas. His work has taken him far and wide and in the process allowed him to revamp many of his views on environmental design. This book is an extensively updated version of his seminal book on the subject. It has become a bit dated in the 20 years since its release, especially in regard to computer software design. But, most of the material he covers is still relavent to the present, as we have only begun to scratch the surface of sound ecological ideas.Having read the more recent books on ecological design by Sim Van Der Ryn and William McDonough, I was surprised to see that neither mentioned Papanek, who prefigured many of the ideas they present in their current books. Papanek long ago advocated the lease/use principle, which makes much more sense in a rapidly changing technological world than does the buy/own principle that continues to dominate our social thinking. Papanek notes the many cultural and psychological blocks we have created for ourselves when it comes to ecological design, but also illustrates how we can overcome these blocks with methods such as bisociation, first proposed by Arthur Koestler. But, what really makes this book stand out are the great number of illustrations that Papanek uses to demonstrate his ideas. This is one of the most practical books written on environmental design.While Papanek was an industrial designer, his ideas are equally germaine to the field of architecture and biology. He advocated a multi-disciplinary approach, feeling that our universities had become too compartimentalized and were stifling creativity, which needs cross-pollination in order to thrive. The book is as inpiring as his lectures. Papanek challenges the reader to explore new avenues, not continue to follow the status quo, which only results in creative dead-ends."},{"Title":"Design for the real world: Human ecology and social change","review":"I have just read about V.Papanek's recent death. I can't believe I wrote my past comment just 4 days before his death. I feel very moved, it's a big loss for the design world. I am copying here what the IDSA wrote about him: Victor Papanek Passes Away (1926-1998) Internationally renowned designer, professor and mentor Victor Papanek, IDSA, passed away at age 72 on January 10. His health had been failing him for the past three years. Papanek was widely admired for his advocacy of socially responsible design. He once summed up his chosen field this way: &quot;The only important thing about design is how it relates to people.&quot; In remembering Papanek, Honorary IDSA member Ralph Caplan, remarked that &quot;He was the first industrial designer to really begin to talk critically about design as a force for good and suggesting that, conventionally design wasn't necessarily that.&quot; Papanek was the J.L. Constant Professor of Architecture and Design at the University of Kansas since 1981 and was author of eight books on design. In his revolutionary and best-selling Design for the Real World, first published in 1971, and since translated into 23 languages, Papanek suggested something both startling and prophetic: the necessity for designers to adopt a morally responsible and holistic approach, adapting technology to the individual's real needs and tapping into the wisdom and experience of other societies, particularly those of the Third World. He traveled around the world giving lectures about his ideas on ecologically sound designs to serve the poor, the disabled and the elderly. He was closely connected with folk art and crafts and studied Oriental, Eskimo and American Indian cultures to better understand basic human needs and their relationship to design. &quot;All designed tools and objects are sort of extensions of human abilities, and they do tend to make life richer for us,&quot; Papanek told the Kansas City Star in an interview in 1994. But, he added, &quot;an awful lot of designs, especially in this country, make life a lot more inconvenient. I'm thinking, for instance, of high-fidelity units that have so many switches and toggles and buttons and things that they confuse most people. Papanek was born in Vienna, Austria, and went to public schools in England. He studied design and architecture at the Cooper Union in New York City and did postgraduate studies in design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He taught at many different institutions including the Ontario College of Art and the Royal Academy of Architecture in Copenhagen, Denmark. Before joining the KU faculty, he headed the design departments at the Kansas City Art Institute and the California Institute of Arts. He received numerous awards and honors, such as a Distinguished Designer Fellowship from the NEA and the UN (UNESCO) Award for Outstanding Design of Developing Nations. He created products for such organizations as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and for the World Health Organization. Papanek is survived by his former wife, Harlanne Herdman, and two daughters, Nicolette Papanek and Jennifer Satu Papanek. The family requests donations to Greenpeace and Amnesty International."},{"Title":"Design for the real world: Human ecology and social change","review":"While this book covers the larger focus of industrial design, its message is important for all designers.

I would have studied under him at the University of Kansas, if not for his untimely and unfortunate passing. This book is one of the best books on the principles and ethics of design. It illustrates both the designer's responsibility and the potential to affect real change in the world through design. This most renowned of works by Papanek focuses on industrial design in two parts: How It Is, and How It Could Be. Papanek encourages radical thinking in design, and most of the topics in the book are easily translated to architecture.

After it was published, he took 14 years off from being published and returned a much better writer.The plot of this short novel has Captain Tharkie hired to track down and apprehend the assassin who almost killed the legislative body of the Terran Colony System. Tharkie is a Starover, sort of privateer and bounty hunter rolled into one. Helping Tharkie are his shipmates and fellow Starovers, most veterans of bitter war. And the assassin also fits that bill. Wrapped up with this is a 1000 year old police robot, an amalgam of a telepathic human and \\"psychic incongruity\\" seeking transcendence, a plot to expand the human sphere of space, and a pointless subplot involving an aristocrat and his wife.The novel has far too many inane conversations and descriptions of characters and clothings, an air of pseudo-sophistication in the talk of cocktails, many descriptions of switches being flipped, and lengthy descriptions of starflight.There are hints of the future Barton in the incoherently expressed idea of soldiers and lovers banding against the universe, finding comfort only with each other - even if it's merely the comfort of a polite execution.

However, reading through it I found myself a bit disapointed. The entire book centers around two roles of every relationship: the seeker and the sought. It defines and explores these roles while offering ideas on how to be more satisfied in a relationship. However, that's about all it says. And it has been said before, in better ways.This book deserves some credit. The cartoons are charming and provide a light-hearted contrast to the text. All relationships are covered thoroughly: heterosexual, homosexual, family, friendship.While I wouldn't recommend rushing out to buy it, I can't say it is all bad.

Carolyn writes in a simple but deeply profound way that easily manages to transport you into the desert with her. In that sense, her writing style reminds me of Paulo Coelho. It is easy to feel what she is feeling, see what she is seeing amd enjoy every minute of her delicious experiences.Her understanding of herd dynamics goes beyond anything I've learnt so far and I've studied natural horsemanship and animal communication for some years. Her clear distinctions between horses that are 'leaders' or 'dominant' are just brilliant. Whether you're already knowledgeable or not in this type of horsemanship/animal communicaiton, this is a highly refreshing, deeply moving and very beautiful book that will leave a lasting imprint on your soul. I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone that loves nature, animals and horses and will be ordering some copies for Christmas presents this year. Bravo Carolyn!"},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"I LOVED this book! It expressed my own thoughts and values with horses so very well, and explained why I do so many of the things I already do with them.

It is a collection of stories of Carolyn Resnick's years of working with not only her own horses, but with wild horses, too. Carolyn has devoted her life to helping people learn the language of horses. And, she has been highly successful in doing this. Reading Naked Liberty is an excellent way to start the journey toward developing a highly successful relationship with your horse. In fact, I think it should be required reading for all horse owners. But, to enjoy reading Naked Liberty it is not necessary to own a horse. This is a lively book of true stories that will appeal to many different people and age groups."},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"Read this book if you are a horse person or not.

Her work belongs in every true horseman's collection."},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"After adopting a baby wild horse in Australia which was saved from the slaughterhouse by a wild horse sanctuary, I got my hands on everything related to natural horsemanship. The label is too loosely used after discovering many so called natural horseman/women still use bits, spurs and actually whip their horses when training them to 'mimick' what they call herd responses to correct behavior. I only have a year of experience and knew instinctively in my gut that something was really off everytime I saw or read those things. After finding out about Liberty Training through my own research and in talking to numerous horse people and trainers, I highly recommend Carolyn's book and her DVD The Waterhole Rituals. Don't be surprised if you are confronted by your own ignorance and/or are challenged by years of traditional indoctrination that tells you you must control a horse either on the trail, dressage arena or other competitions, by use of physical dominance and force- as if the horse will be 'getting away with' something if you don't. It will require transformation on your part to read this book, however, once you know, you can't not know.

This creates very close, very deep bonds between horse and human and leads to outstanding performance. There are no gadgets required for this work, no special equipment is used. The horse untacked and at liberty in an area large enough so that he can escape the person's influence if he so chooses. Everything the horse does is done of his own free will. This freedom to choose makes him a very willing, very engaged, very expressive partner.Carolyn learned much of what she teaches directly from horses, particularly from a band of wild horses she joined during three summers in her childhood. These childhood experiences formed the foundation of her current work. Naked Liberty is Carolyn's memoir of that time in her life. It is an amazing true story of a young girl and the horses who molded her into an outstanding trainer.If you love horses, read this book.Kris McCormackNew Paltz, New York"},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"I have been a professional horse trainer (paid to train horses) since the age of 17. I am 60 years next year. I have traveled world wide to do this and have written on this topic myself for publication numerous times. I think Carolyn Resnick's book is far and away the absolute best book on the true nature of horses I have ever read. Legions beyond Monty Roberts' international best seller 'The Man Who Listens to Horses', Resnick's 'Naked Liberty 'addresses the attitudes and paradigms the are most appropriate and correct to attain high level, uncoerced, successful interaction with horses. Through insightful story telling about her early days observing wild horses and relating the occurances she had with the various horses that come into her life, Ms. Resnick gives us a very thorough look into the true nature of horses. I have never heard or read descriptions about equine/human relationships that was more right on track than this is. This book should be required reading for all persons seeking to keep the company of horses. I applaud Carolyn Resnick for her insight, wisdom and the best horse book I have ever read.Thank you....Franklin Levinson, Snowmass, CO ... Maui, HI"},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"This autobiographic reflection of Carolyn Resnick's observations and experiences with horses in the wild, as well as the domesticated horses she's partnered with throughout her life, offers the reader an entertaining view into the world of equine psychology that is sure to manifest a deeper understanding between humans and horses.With genuine humility and earnest love, Ms. Resnick shares her journey, replete with personal anecdotes every horse lover can relate to, those showing her follies as well as her successes. Her successes are built on personal learning experiences coupled with an unerring positive attitude and a willingness to change things within herself that need changing.Honing her capacity to observe Nature and all its inhabitants allowed Ms. Resnick to be accepted into the realm of the wild things and it is within the lessons learned through these diligent studies that the author discovered a world of non-human communication that she could not only see was effective for horses and other creatures, but that she, too, could emulate and participate in.That Ms. Resnick has been able to put her experiences and insights into well worded vignettes is remarkable. It is very difficult to take non-verbal communication between species, (which becomes nothing short of a spirit to spirit understanding) and define it in human language without losing the essence of things. Ms. Resnick not only succeeds in making her experiences comprehensible, but inspires the reader to pursue this type of relationship with his/her own horses.We owe Carolyn Resnick high accolades for pursuing her unique studies with horses and then offering us the benefit of her experiences and insights. NAKED LIBERTY surely leaves readers wanting to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"Naked Liberty by Carolyn ResnickReviewed by Sharon JanusCarolyn Resnick establishes herself as a leader in natural horse training with her book Naked Liberty. Her Midas touch stems from a deep appreciation of horses, years of observing wild horse behaviors, and years spent learning their secret language. She connects with the noble and beautiful animals in more ways than one, celebrating and sharing their secrets with her readers in an effort to help establish harmonious relationships between horses and their handlers. \\"Seeing the similarity of horse and human behavior demystifies training and communicating with horses,\\" she believes.Nothing escapes her keen eye. She has a firm grasp on the reality of equine interactions, noting that herd functions are never static and fixed, but rather always dynamic and evolving. Herd dynamics can't be explained solely by the dominant and submissive behaviors of the members, she asserts. It's much more complex, and she explains how and why with clarity and sincerity. Resnick then outlines the \\"unwritten code,\\" a series of self-imposed regulations to which all equines subscribe. Saddled with such savvy truths, readers get much out of this book, which is as entertaining as it is useful.This is an important work. Dare I say a landmark book? It's committed to building and binding relationships based on trust as the foundation for all future interactions with horses. The author admirably respects, loves and understands equus, showing how success is fostered by communication, bonding and forming partnerships. But best of all, she offers sound advice on how such communication, bonding and partnerships can be achieved by any or all who want to work with horses.Readers will follow this natural born leader as she examines the invisible yet invincible threads that unite horses to their leaders, whether two or four-footed. Horsepower is not about strength and force. It's about knowledge and skill built on mutual respect and trust. Naked Liberty is long overdue."},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"Finally, someone has written a book that addresses what is often lacking in most \\"Natural Horsemanship\\" training programs...the essential need for a horse to learn in an open, free environment. This important element is the basis for Ms. Resnick's extremely useful approach to equine-human relationships.And, this is a lovely book, too. We travel with her and her ponies as she grows up in the desert and in the company of a variety of domestic and wild animals. We learn the lessons she learns, and we begin to understand what is missing in so many of our human-equine relationships. We cannot physically teach horses we cannot mentally reach. Ms. Resnick shows us how.I hope there will soon be another book showing in precise detail how to apply these lessons. Until then, I'll read \\"Naked Liberty\\" yet again. It gets better with each visit."},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"In addition to Ms. Resnick's vast insight about horses, her book Naked Liberty is beautifully written. While curled up in an armchair in front of the fireplace, my \\"inner child\\" accompanied the writer on her incredible journeys through the desert. In a style reminiscent of Annie Dillard, Ms. Resnick writes of her encounters with lizards, honeybees, thunderstorms, spiders, and an Indian shaman. This is a great book on many levels and should appeal to a wide audience of readers, not only avowed horse lovers. Don't judge THIS book by its cover...you will want both to lend it to your friends, and keep it yourself to re-read."},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","review":"Carolyn Resnick not only studied wild mustangs she learned how to be one.

Paul of Tarsus, had rejected the actual teachings of Jesus and the small sect of Jesus followers led by James in Jerusalem, and had CREATED a new religion which rejected the LAW OF GOD outright, and actually cursed the very people who remained obedient to God by following HIS LAW.NOWHERE did Jesus ever say that the LAW was to be abolished, yet Paul, in his zeal to attract as many Romans as possible to HIS NEW RELIGION, abandoned the law totally. When James and Peter and the brethren in Jerusalem attempted to put Paul back on track with Jesus's REAL MESSAGE, this started the long and ongoing war between Paul's NEW religion and Judaism.The blatantly anti-semetic verses from Paul's Epistles and Acts and the Gospel of John are referenced. Sadly Adolf Hitler, like most German/Austrians, were brought up believing this INERRANT MESSAGE about the \\"God Of LOVE\\",and the Holocaust of 6 million Jews (many of whom didn't even know that they were Jews until the Einsatzgruppen arrived), 3 million Poles and more than 250,000 Gypsies was the result of Pauls \\"Gospel Of Love\\".FIVE STARS.

It is considered foundational to much present-day teaching on Christian meditation and prayer. Although it was written for a monk in 14th-century England, this good translation by William Johnston makes it very accessible.Is this book for everybody? No, and the author starts right out by saying so. If you don't care about nurturing your relationship with God in deep prayer, if you have no experience of spending time in God's presence, and don't want to, then you should forget about this book! But, if you want to grow in prayer and experience God in your heart and yourself in God's heart, this is written especially for you.Review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God"},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on the life of prayer, and it has transformed my prayer life. It was originally written as a series of letters to teach mystical prayer to one particular monk. This book tells us that our minds are too small to grasp God, and when we try to approach him intellectually, we freeze up, entering into a &quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot; which our minds can not penetrate. Yet God is approachable - &quot;Because he may well be loved, but not thought. By love he can be caught and held, but by thinking never.&quot; We are told to long for God, to &quot;strike that thick cloud of unknowing with the sharp dart of longing love&quot;. This longing love calls us to give up everything else for the sake of God - &quot;a naked intention directed to God, and himself alone, is wholly sufficient&quot;."},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"It seems only proper to begin a review of this book with the warning given by the anonymous author in his/her prologue. My paraphrase of that warning goes something like this, &quot;In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in the bond of love I beg you not to read, copy, or look at this book unless you are ready. Furthermore I beg you not to copy it, loan it out, or give it to anyone else to read unless they, too, are ready for this depth of spiritual growth, lest they misunderstand the things written herein and fall into error.&quot;In this age of newly rediscovered Christian mysticism I agree with the author. This, almost zen-like book, can lead the novice into an empty, shallow, form of spirituality that misses the substance of our true faith. Do not be misled by sensational experiences. Most people experienced in meditation can put themselves into an &quot;alpha&quot; state almost at will. Do not forget the old saying, &quot;Study without prayer is flat; prayer without study leads to error.&quot;OK . . . NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN THE DISCLAIMER . . .There is another old saying that is relevant here.Let prayer lead to meditation.In meditation allow God to grace you with contemplation.Contemplation, in God's timing, leads to intuition.Intution ushers in oneness with God.This book reminds us that if we have the ability to conmprehend all there is to know about God, our God is too small. When I first read this book, I wasn't ready. It didn't make sense. However one day, years later, while I was praying, all the pieces came together and the book made sense.If you read this book years ago and didn't like it, read it again. If you are a novice in the contemplative life begin with works by Nouwen and Thomas Merton. Then, dig deeper into the writings of St. John of the Cross. Hold on to The Cloud of Unknowing until you are ready for it."},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"The theme of the writings:In short but instructive chapters, the mysterious Briton, who mastered the way of the mystics gave an admirable essay on Christian life and its development through contemplation. Prayer is in fact the core of Christian life, and the backbone of this marvelous work, where he explained conducting oneself with respect to examining and silencing the thoughts with humility. Love is the goal in which a faithful should abide through contemplation.His smaller work \\"the Book of Privy Counseling,\\" is a more mature but moving treatise on attaining salvation by enlightenment through kenosis (self denial). What is left should only be consciousness of the presence of the Lord!Apophatic tradition of the Orientals:Eastern monastics started the root to mysticism, practicing the Macarian arrow prayer (K. Ware, in Study of Spirituality p176), carried to Europe as \\"The Jesus Prayer,\\" through the Praktikos of Evagrius Ponticos.In chapter 38 of the Cloud, this holy English mystic speaks of a little prayer of one syllable Kyriya Elaison (Lord have mercy) that is powerful enough to pierce the heavens.Origen was the initiator of the Apophatic concept (commentary on song of Songs), carrying over from Philo, based on roots that go all the way to Asaph, Ps 73:21-24. But, the crystallization of the whole theology took final shape in the writings of a Syrian monk of early six century of pseudonym Dionysius the Areopagite (who was probably a student or companion of Severus of Antioch), taking to himself the name of St. Paul's Athenian disciple.The wave of Mystical Milieu:During 14th and 15th century Europe, a pilgrimage to the unknown God started by Eckhart and his fellow Dominicans Susa and Tauler based on spiritual poverty. In England, Rolle, Hilton, and Julian of Norwich took the same road. These were all disciples in the school of negation. The influence came through John Scotus who in the ninth century translated the corpus Dionysium into Latin, initiating a chain of commentaries from Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Gallus. The English Counselor translated Dionysius' Mystical Theology under the title\\" Hid Divinity\\"Rowan Williams, wrote in his book (The wound of knowledge); \\"The unknowing Englishman gave a brilliant little summary of the Dionysian ideas\\"Enjoying the way of UnknowingAfter reading the expert introduction by Wm. Johnston, helpful for a reader of some background on the subject, but the seal of the deal is reading his Privy Counselings.

In this state, one transcends words, thoughts and images to enter a state of oneness with God. It silences the noises of daily life, revealing an awareness of God's love which both humbles and exalts. To that end, this 14th century book on the nature of apophatic (mystical) prayer also provides modern audiences with an understanding of the foundation of \\"centering prayer\\".As a practitioner of lectio divinia and contemplative prayer, I found that over time, *The Cloud* enriched my relationship with God. However, it took some time; I wasn't ready when I first tried to read and absorb it.

The book seeks to offer to novices advice about how to achieve a more focused relationship with God in prayer. The monk's first premise is that our active lives intrude upon our ability to focus when we pray: he prescribes that we enter a \\"cloud of forgetting\\" about our everyday, active lives when we enter prayer. His second piece of advice is that we do not know what the future will bring and should not become worried, fearful or stress about the \\"cloud of unknowing.\\" He urges us to focus only upon the present moment and to build a bridge through prayer worthy of oneself and one's deity. He recommends that with suitable mindfulness we can raise the depth of prayerful experience and advises that we are responsible for every minute of our life. I have practiced what the monk preaches and it works -- my time of prayer is more attuned and brings more energy to these spiritual moments. The net effect is that epiphanies or awakenings come more frequently now in which the essential meaning of life is revealed. I find that I am happier through the application of the monk's good advice as spiritual well-being leads to healthier relationships. The health of the interior impacts beneficially one's physical sense of well being. If you seek a higher level of spirituality, then this book can help take you there. \\"The Book Privy Counseling\\" in this edition builds upon his themes and advice aimed at more experienced practitioners seeking higher levels of spiritiuality. Why not take your spiritual awareness of life to the next level and enrich your faith journey through its many benefits?"},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"The \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" is another classic that serious disciples must have in their sacred library. Even if you are not drawn toward mystical Christianity, this timeless classic explores deeply the interior life of Christians often absent in the modern world.Certainly more appropriate for those strong in their faith, \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\" is a challenging read. I would recommend this book be treated as Lectio Divina, with each short chapter an opportunity for meditation and prayer. Trying to read this (or any other \\"mystical\\" work) in an academic fashion will only serve to alienate the reader from Christian experience that is not the typical rational neo-scholastic form - such as much of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.Reviewed by: Dr. Jeffrey Wincel (D.Min), author of \\"ClimbingClimbing The Mountain of God, The Path to Mystical Discipleship\\",Surviving the Fall, America's Second Great DepressionandDefying the Trend: Business Ethics and Corporate Morality from a Faith Perspective"},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"This is a most compelling and etheral writing! Not for all folks, however is immensely gripping."},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"This is a work of immense value, and while I am sure that it is not a book for most people, and it is written only for honestly committed Christians, I do know that for some this book will mark a milestone in their journey of life, faith and love.Long ago, when I was 15, I began to study the Zen approach to (un)reality. A friend, who himself was knowledgeable about such things, gave me his copy of The Cloud of Unknowing and said that it would change my life if I read it seriously and prayerfully, and that I shouldn't think that Christianity lacked what I was seeking in Zen. My friend was something of a mystic, at least to my adolescent mind, and I was impressed by anything he said. Growing up Lutheran, and being a teenager, I was not at all exposed to monasticism or the concept of contemplation. I wasn't sure what reading a book prayerfully even meant, and I had no clue what contemplation meant, but I was trying to live a life of love and prayer, and I was filled with an intense longing for I did not know what, so I gave it a shot. In short, it did change my life. For the first time I began to think of God as not something to be thought about and defined, but to be loved. Later I would learn this to be what the Greek Fathers call apophaticism, or what the Latin Fathers call the via negativa; that sometimes we can say more about something by saying what it is not, to say negative things to a positive effect. Lutherans place a high value on defining everything, which certainly has its positives. But it doesn't often leave room for mystery, which means it doesn't correspond to reality. I know LCMS pastors and seminary grads will rightfully disagree with my description as too simplistic, but on the lay level this holds water. So the change and challenge was liberating. I began to understand that it isn't all about understanding, if that makes sense. For the first time I began to see that God is God, and not my idea of God. And that to draw near to God is not something that I can will to happen as if God is at my beck and call. This all calls to mind Evagrius of Pontus' line, \\"God cannot be grasped by the mind. If he could be grasped, he would not be God.\\"This releasing of our images of God has a great deal to do with the current trends in pop-spirituality and even Eastern/Asian spirituality of the traditional sort, methods and goals that want to disassociate adherents from thoughts and definitions and creeds. But Christianity is not a theology or philosophy of nihilism or reductionism or monism. All is not one and persons actually do exist and love really does unite us to God, Who made matter because matter is a good thing. God reveals Himself in Jesus Christ (John 1:18). He is the Word, the Logos Who reveals the Father (John 10:30). One of the messages of The Cloud, then, is that God reveals God's self to us, and He is not understood through our mental efforts and images. And God even reveals Himself to us as unknowable. This is the opposite of the intellect's inability to conceive of God as God is. That sort of natural apophaticism is a logical deduction as found in Neo-Platonism, Hinduism or Buddhism, but not a divine revelation of the apophaticism of Person (just as our calling God \`Father' by our adoption in Christ is a revealed Name, and not a logical leap, as in Galatians 4:6 and Romans 8:1,5).This is all to say that The Cloud reminds us that our heart's deepest longing is God, and it is put there by God, and that we don't have to and cannot intellectualize our way to God, but to rather allow God's life, by loving our neighbor and bathing in the Word and sacrament (in Greek the word would be translated as \\"mysteries\\"), to draw us into God. Of course this does not force God's hand, but it is what God has Himself said to do, in the same way that a clean mirror reflects the light. The mirror doesn't own the light, but it most a mirror when it is reflecting light. Illumination is neither random nor accidental. There is a condition that is more apt to be illumined than others.Other works of interest, which reinforce the author's point (which actually is about not doing more reading!) would include:Revelations of Divine Love,Dark Night of the Soul (Dover Thrift Editions),The Imitation of Christ (Dover Thrift Editions),The Practice of the Presence of God The Best Rule of Holy Life,New Seeds of Contemplation,Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander,The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality,Dionysius the Areopagite: On the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology,The Mystical Theology of the Eastern ChurchandEncountering the Depths: Prayer, Solitude, and Contemplation.What is a little ironic is that this book has so much to do with apophaticism and just now, as I finish this review, my young son asked me, \\"Why do you want to understand so much about God?\\" Hmmm..."},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"The book was received in excellent condition and expediently.The contents were good, but some of it was a little bit too deep for me.Somebody with a great amount of Christian knowledge could probably handle the book a little easier."},{"Title":"Cloud of Unknowing, The","review":"Many turn to other texts for guidance on contemplative practices in the East.

More than in other books on contemplative work, it is made clear that through contemplation truly amazing things can be done (things that in the modern world would be called &#34;magical&#34;).

The author continually contradicts himself and sometimes what he is trying to say is entirely inaccessible:he condemns &quot;the Devil's contemplatives&quot; who seem to view bodily sensations and the exhilaration of the senses as some sign of God's approval in their discipline. And then, a chapter later, he will approve of certain sensate phenomena as true signs of God. This could be merely the confusion of a novice, but I would say the anonymous author approaches agnosticism with his view as the actual CONTACT we can have with God: &quot;the cloud of unknowing&quot; prevents it entirely, although we must &quot;beat upon it&quot; until, eh, something happens. This is the path of spiritual darkness as a way to the Divine, which is indeed fascinating. The author's recognition of the tenuous and error prone nature of human consciousness could be seen as a precusor to the existentialist view of human life. I would recommend reading St. John of the Cross first, but have fun with this one. Who knows, maybe the whole thing will make perfect sense to me one day. But I doubt it."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"The key idea in this book constitutes sound common-sense advice to any investor: buy a diversified portfolio of out-of-favor stocks with sound underlying businesses (e.g., low P/E firms) and sell when the market recognizes their value. The book is controversial because it slams current academic theories on how the market works, especially the idea of &quot;efficient markets&quot;. Dreman believes that simply because of the way our minds work, the market tends to systematically over-react or under-react to news (especially earnings reports), and this can be exploited forever (because the way our minds are wired is not going to change). Other controversial ideas: 1) don't buy index funds (because the committees which make indexes tend to put in firms which have had a price run-up and drop firms which have had a price decline, so that buying the index involves buying high and selling low); 2) don't buy NASDAQ stocks unless they have great volume (because NASDAQ market-makers are not regulated enough, and will cheat you on the spread); 3) avoid international (non-US) stocks (because international markets have performed much worse than the US stock market over time); 4) equities are a safer way to hold money than treasury bonds or gold or cash (because of inflation and taxes). The author presents fairly detailed statistical evidence to show that his methods have worked over the past several decades. This is actually evidence that even academics are beginning to notice.That said, it should be noted that the author's Kemper-Dreman fund (ticker: KDHAX) has done pretty badly in the last few years. Also, some of the stock picks in his Forbes column have been horrible. The most glaring example would be Prison Realty (ticker: PZN), which is currently hovering on the verge of bankruptcy. Dreman recommended it because of its REIT status and its high dividend yield both of which went away shortly after.My 2c: consider the guy's broad investment strategies with respect, but don't follow his (or anyone else's) picks without putting in your own research."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"This is one of perhaps a handful of books the value-oriented investor will likely find indispensable. The book's indispensability is a product of something for which David Dreman deserves great accolades: his apparent monopoly on an expansive array of statistics --statistics to support buying stocks when they are inexpensive in several different respects, statistics to support the avoidance of stocks priced to perfection, and statistics to support the pathetic fallacy of entrusting valuations and earnings estimates to investment house analysts. The stats compiled by Dreman concerning the latter, especially earnings estimates and a particular issue's probability of meeting these estimates over serial quarters, are particularly impressive and sobering. At the very least, all of these statistics serve as a validation for what the value investor has at least accepted intuitively. Yet the reader will probably also derive new ways of looking at securities from a value perspective. (Incidentally, readers who are expecting a rehash of the Tweedy Browne value studies will be pleasantly surprised...)The two additional sections of the book concern investment strategy and investment psychology. Regarding the former, it is hard to cover strategy satisfactorily in value investing without discussing valuation itself. The central challenge of the value approach is distinguishing what's compellingly cheap from what's cheap for compelling reason. But here Dreman directs readers to other resources, and coyly suggests buying whatever has the largest number of attractive financial ratios. Thus the newcomer to these approaches will likely have ample reading and work to do if he/she really wishes to seriously embrace the task of finding &quot;oversold&quot; securities.The investment psychology section is useful, but could probably be reduced by half. In fact, Dreman's essential shortcoming is his tendency to bludgeon the reader with the same thought, cloaked slightly differently, several hundred times. Of course, in the world of investment literature, there are worse things than relentless proscriptions against doing stupid things in the marketplace."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I have read this book three times now, and intend to do so again. Dreman is obviously an outstanding investor, and his strategies flesh out and arguably \\"modernize\\" the techniques used by the noted fundamental investor Benjamin Graham, who was the mentor to Warren Buffett (although, I might add, this book does not emphasize the study of financial statements, which is something Benjamin Graham did in painstaking detail).Dreman's approach is most notable because of his use of investor psychology and his forceful rejection of the efficient market hypothesis. Instead, Dreman cites any number of studies and examples to support his main thesis: investors over-react to events, and those over-reactions create opportunities for savvy investors to make money. His approach involves a two-part strategy: first, preserve capital, and second, take advantage of market over-reactions to profit. His point is that the market is like a casino, but one in which the odds can favor a knowledgeable investor. In other words, no one can guarantee that a particular stock will do well, but over time, investors who follow a contrarian strategy will outperform the market generally.Dreman's approach to investing is notably different than much of what is considered \\"conventional\\" wisdom within the financial markets (for a good contrasting view, read \\"Expectations Investing\\" by Rappaport and Mauboussin). In particular, Dreman takes the position that experts err predictably and often, and that humans base decisions on a minute portion of the information thrown at them. In this respect, his skepticism differs notably from some other authors (example: Mauboussin in \\"More than What You Know\\").From this, he demonstrates how buying low p/e, high yielding, low price/book, and low price/free cash flow stocks results in higher-than-average returns. Dreman shows how favored stocks tend to underperform the market, while out-of-favor companies tend to outperform. However, reappraisal can happen slowly, even glacially.I found this book to be both enjoyable and informative, and it inspired me to read a couple books about behavioral finance (Paulos, \\"A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market\\" and Belsky and Gilovich \\"Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them\\").In all, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in investing. A few other recommendations (other than those listed above) include:Klarman - \\"Margin of Safety\\" (out of print)Whitman - \\"The Aggressive Convervative Investor\\" and \\"Value Investing\\"Greenblatt - \\"You Can be a Stock Market Genius\\" (horrible title, great book)Graham - \\"Security Analysis\\" and \\"the Intelligent Investor\\"Each of these books sets forth a somewhat different approach to investing, but at the core, each of them shares a skepticism of the principals underlying the efficient market hypothesis."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"The author fails to persuade that his system can really be successfully implemented by the average investor, even assuming one with the requisite resources and endurance to own and manage a 30-40 stock portfolio. Interestingly, his own fund has failed to beat the S&amp;P 500 Index over the last 10 years -- despite his statistics that low PE stocks outpace the market 99% of the time over ten-year periods. Perhaps there is a &quot;slight&quot; problem in actually implementing his strategy even by a mutual fund that charges a steep sales load and a better than 1% annual expense ratio. With those kind of charges, why couldn't the author figure out and implement a low cost index-like stategy as he suggests in his book. Too bad that such fertile thinkers as Dreman and O'Shaughnessy (What Works on Wall Street) can't duplicate the theoretical success of backtesting data in the real world of mutual funds. Is it perhaps that they fall victim to some of the very traps that they discuss in their books - not sticking to mechanical application of the odds based on the data.His belabored (and often confusing) critique of the efficient market theory and randomness of price movements appears to be less than convincing given his own fund's performance over the last 10 years. I'm still waiting for a low cost index-like approach from the mutual fund industry with true market-beating performance using the allegedly can't miss strategies from data mining researchers. Until then, stick with a super low cost diversified portfolio of index funds from Vanguard.At least Dreman provides data to suggest that holding periods longer than one year don't hurt performance in his models, assuming they work at all. Also his take on the superiority of stocks vs. bonds and the definition of risk for long-term investors are helpful."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"As a Managing Director of Dreman Value Management, I work closely with David Dreman in managing our client accounts in accordance to the value strategy outlined in his book. Unfortunately, there are individuals who feel threatened by the robust results outlined in the book and by David Dreman's success in implementing the strategies for his clients. In contrast to claims made by these readers (1) David Dreman has been and remains one of the nation's premier stock-pickers, and has managed the top equity-income fund in the Lipper data base for the past 5 and 10 years; (2) Human nature has not changed much, but our understanding of it has, and Mr. Dreman is a leading expert on the psychology of markets; (3) The book is loaded with new and original research, covering 200 years of stock and bond returns, as well as detailed, original studies on a wide variety of contrarian strategies covering nearly 30 years and ending less than a year before the book went to press;(4) The book, which outlines David Dreman's market-beating strategies, has received universal praise from professional reviewers in such publications as Barrons, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times. (To see the list of more than twenty professional reviews click on \\"reviews\\" at the top left of this page."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Mr. Dreman has given away his secrets on how his fund has been enormously successful over a long period of time. And, following this book, he thinks that a reader also has a good chance of doing it. This is no hyperbole indeed. He has combined finance and psychology better than anyone else has ever done. He has also improved upon his prior work. For a good understanding of not only the stock market, but also the stock-market participants, there is no better book. After reading it, one knows why we encounter so much unreliable advice even from the highly paid financial analysts. If you have ever lost money by investing in a popular stock and you do not want to repeat your mistake, you ought to read this book. The next time you buy a stock that drops in price precipitously, I recommend that you read the book again.The book explains three simple implementable A-B-C rules of contrarian selection supplemented by five fundamental indicators. Furthermore, Mr. Dreman goes beyond the value investing as he exlains the double play -- value and growth by using GARP, Growth at a Reasonable Price. (This is similar to what I think Warren Buffett is practicing.)In this book, he explains what stocks in an industry one should buy (low P/E). And, more importantly, he presents a convincing explanation of when to sell.Mr. Dreman also explains why the strategies explained in the book will not become obsolete for a number of years. I agree with his analysis. The only weakpoint of the book is that he spends much too much space on crticising the efficient market hypothesis. But, you can ignore all that. After all, the efficient market hypothesis is nothing but an argument that it is not easy to make a quick dollar and I think he would agree with that. May be, his reasoning is more psychological than economics."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Dreman makes a persuasive case here that the financial experts and analysts as well as the average investor are terrible in predicting which way the stock market is going. If you want to beat the market, you need to do the opposite of everyone else, by investing in currently out-of-favor value stocks with low P/E ratios.To his credit, Dreman correctly forecast the big market crash of 2000-2002. Published in 1998, Dreman here observed that the market of the late 90's was way overpriced and that a major correction was in the works. He was correct, although the crash was 2 years off when this was published.His whipping boy in this book, as in almost every other investing book on the shelves, is the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). But in truth, his investing strategy does not contradict EMH. In its simplest form, EMH argues that, statistically speaking, the past movements of a stock have no significant relationship to its future movements. Dreman indeed agrees with this, and the assertion has never been disproved.Dreman has lots of fun poking fun at the assertion of EMH that investors are rational and that current stock prices reflect all known information about the company. But the claim that investors are rational is not really controversial: all it adds up to is that investors seek to maximize returns and avoid losing money. Investors may act for poor reasons, but there is always a reason for the movement of a stock. There are good and poor reasons, but those only emerge in hindsight.Dreman also says that Beta is completely worthless as a measure of risk and returns, and that may be true for individual stocks, but for mutual funds it's very useful. The Beta for a small-cap fund will be significantly higher than a large-cap value fund, and investors are generally rewarded for taking on that risk, at least in the long run.All but the most extreme forms of EMH accept that stocks may be undervalued or overvalued *in the short run.* In the long run, the market is in fact completely rational. If it wasn't, there would be no point in investing in the market at all, since stock movements would be completely random. And if there are temporary irrationalities in stock prices, then it follows that investors can profit from those under- or overvaluations. Some theorists argue that it's not wise to try to beat the market, but most EMH theorists advocate a value strategy identical to Dreman's. See for example Larry Swedroe's excellent \\"The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need.\\""},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"There are many interesting ideas in this book. However, this book could have been half its 400+ page length and been much more effective. There are sections through the middle of this book where Dreman repeats himself for 20+ pages. Where was the editor?Having said that, the notion that there is an excess return attributable to contrarian investing is a useful and powerful notion. I would take exception with his definition of contrarian. A contrarian is someone who goes against conventional wisdom and popular ideas. That is not the same strategy over time. At the time of the writing of this book, buying low P/E, low P/Book Value, etc. stocks was a contrarian strategy. However, it is not necessarily always so. Value investing has come into vogue since the bursting of the tech bubble. The US market currently has a historically small spread between the lowest and highest PE sectors in the market. That is not a market that is dramatically discounting low P/E vs. high. It seems unlikely to me that situation will lead to larger than market returns for low PE stocks right now.The section on small cap stocks was outstanding. Dreman shreds the studies that claim small cap stocks have significantly outperform large caps. In fact, what he convincingly shows is that small cap low P/E stocks are the best historical investment. However, as always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.One final caveat, Dreman exhaustively cites statistics supporting low P/E investing. He then recommends modifying the strategy in ways that he has not tested statistically. He shows compellingly that low P/E small caps historically outperformed. He then suggests that we only buy stocks in that category with strong balance sheets and large dividend yields. He never tested that strategy and has no evidence to support it as it is distinct from the strategy tested.All told this is a good book to get one thinking differently from the crowd, a very good thing. However, be careful taking everything in this book at face value."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Some poo poo his ideas of basing investments on techniques that have been proven over the years.

Only flaw is that it is repetative, could be half as long. Buy and profit from the wisdom of the years.

Chapter by chapter, Dreman dissects efficient market arguments that I saw as fact and showed that they were folly. Dreman states that the market is not efficient because investors are many times not rational. In fact, they are predictably irrational. And then Dreman gives data to prove this. He presents research to show that investing in a certain way allows you to beat the market.And he gives more research and data. And more, and more. Some people will complain that this is boring and overwhelming, but he does so to prove the validity of his methods. I've read many investment books, and usually an author will give his guidelines for picking stocks, with return numbers taken at a certain point in time, and holding stocks for a certain period, and maybe a few other stipulations. And in the end, I never trusted the author enough to invest any real money in his strategy.Not so with Dreman. The wealth of research convinced me that Dremans methods were not datamining and were not limited to certain market environments.Its the most imporant investing book I have read. Dremans method is very similiar to value investing preached by a number of other famous investors. The difference is that Dreman proves to you through his research that value investing works.

He present a lot of good stats about contrarian investments strategy.One thing that I would like to mention, I think with his reputation, he is capable to get deeper than what had been illustrated in this book. A low P/E ratio does not means a low &quot;reported accounting&quot; earnings. You need to make adjustments to financial statements. Similar situation also applied to low P/BV.David Dreman's strategy is very similar to those of the Graham and Doddville, especially Tweedy Browne, Michael Price, Peter Cundill and other value investors. His strategy is similar to mine.I give this book a four stars, because I believe that there are level of depth on every books about investments that are written.

Dreman tackles the topic of investing from three angles:1) He emphasizes value investing principles by suggesting that investors look at financial and ratios such as low PE and high cash flow/share. He recommends staying away from sexy growth stocks. This is noteworthy considering that he was writing this stuff during the dot com mania. He obviously was not influenced by the hype.2) He also introduces readers to the field of behavioral economics. Any value investor should be familiar with the psychology involved in investing.3) He also cites lots of statistics on stocks and bonds from the past 100 years to prove his points.With regards to any of the above topics, I believe Dreman does a fine job, but there are better books out there that tackle these issues. For financial analysis and investing based on fundamentals, for example, Greenwald's \\"Value Investing\\" is a much better value. For historical analysis, Dreman cites lots of exhausting data from Jeremy Siegel's book. It is important to know history but I do not agree with his conclusions. After all, Dreman, himself, admits that past performance is no indication of the future. Yet he tries to prove that in the long run, stocks beat bonds. If you are interested in historical analysis, I recommend \\"Bull\\", a book also recommended by Warren Buffett.Dreman also fails to discuss index investing. He does have a multi billion dollar mutual fund that he manages.Overall, good advice mostly - needed to be shorter."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I enjoyed the book & appreciated the fact that Dreman backed most of his assertions with historical & statistical facts.

A plus is that the book offers practical advice and real life examples, but it is somewhat dated since it was written pre-Internet crash.

This goes well beyond Value Investing and this books insight and strategies are absolutely 1st rate!All I can say is those people who bashed this book or said something along the lines of \\"little substance\\" or \\"little strategies\\" either didnt really analyze this book ... or just didnt fully comprehend it.Its kinda dry; so its hard for me to recommend this for beginners. But if you can comprehend it... and believe in its principles ... this is what you have honestly the book you have looking for. Based on my experience I dont even have to test this to know the author is spot on... the concepts to the experienced Value Investor just make absolute sense. Im so glad i found this book and I have never truly said that about any investing book before."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I found this book to be an excellent illustration of value investing. The author says that most investors are aware that in order to succeed, they need to \\"buy low, and sell high,\\" but few of them can do so because it requires going against the crowd. It is common sense: how can you buy low, when everybody else is buying, and how can you sell high when everyone else is selling? It's impossible. But this doesn't mean investors should go against the crowd on every decision. The author recommends investors buy stocks that are out of temporarily out of favor, but these stocks still need to be strong enough fundamentally.He believes that markets tend to overreact by overvaluing and undervaluing stocks. I really liked the metaphor of two rooms in a casino: one green and the other one red. In the green room, there is not much excitement, few people make bets, but chances are stacked in favor of gamblers, and in the red room, there is lots of excitement, but chances are stacked in favor of the house, and therefore, gamblers lose money. The green room is obviously where contrarian investors spend all of their time.I also liked the section in the book where the author analyzes the efficient market theory and proves it to be flawed because of its assumptions. If you are already a value investor, then this book will reinforce your beliefs, but if you are unsure, then you definitely need to read it so that we can all welcome you to the value investing community.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Dreman's book is a very accessable resource for the Value Investor's philosophy on why the market isn't effective at pricing securities and how you can use this to your advantage. Readable, engaging and funny- 400 pages of investment market analysis and theory never went down so easily.With that said, a person already sold on the effectiveness of value investing will find lots of preaching to the choir. D. spills alot of ink to disprove the Efficient Market Hypothesis and discredit the likes of Eugene Fama, and other efficient market advocates. Dreman definitely has an axe, and spends lots of pages grinding it.(see E. Schneider's review)He's both methodical and convincing but boil it down and you get to the same bottom line as Benjamin Graham's \\"Mr. Market\\" metaphor and Buffett's superb essay, \\"The Super Investors of Graham and Doddsville\\": that the markets sometime price things in an inefficient way and buying value securities gives you an edge in the long run.If you are on board already with this line of thinking, other books will help you implement a practical strategy much faster and in more detail: a couple to recommend are Joel Greenblatt's \\"The Little Book the Beats the Market\\" and Seth Klarman's \\"Margin of Safety\\" - to his credit, Dreman says as much if you read long enough.If you are undecided on whether Value Investing works and want to hear a compelling well documented contemporary argument you probably won't find anything better.What you also won't find in Dreman is instructions on exactly HOW to pick these wonderful undervalued securities out, which is a big shortcoming in a book with the word \\"strategy\\" in the title. Aside from some hints that low P/Es and high dividends can be a sign of value you don't get much in the way of practical advice. The titles mentioned above are a better resource for you if practical methods of selecting value securities are what you are after."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"In Mr. Dreman's book, far too many pages are devoted to debunking efficient market theory, and far too few to his actual strategies. I would have preferred more information on why these strategies work, other value strategies that work, and more examples of winners and losers from his past. Also, once I have a list of low PE, cash-flow, and price to book stocks, how do I distinguish between them if I'm not buying the whole list? In all, I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I recently picked up a copy of Mr. Dremans book and can't put it down. It summarizes what I have intuitively know all my life. The experts in many fields, not just finance and investments, are frequently wrong and we as intellegent people, should not put our entire faith in our experts without further checking the facts.David explains the reason for this. Quite simply, man (and I suppose woman too, although he does not differentiate) is not very good at configural reasoning. We are linear thinkers - step by step. I read piles and piles of books in many non-fiction subjects and have not come across this information before.As far as the books usefulness in the investment area, I will reserve judgement until his approach has been tested. I'm certain the information in this book will be of some help in analyzing the markets.

As a professor of psychology as well as a graduate in business administration I am impressed with Dreman s integration of economic and psychological theory and practice and their application to decision making in the stock market. The principles of group think and market conformity are vividly and clearly set out and the discerning reader will be convinced by Dremans contrarian investment strategies. A must for both lay and professional readers!"},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"This guy has no strategy that could not be outlined in a short article. He just whines and whines about Efficient Market Hypothesis like it is the Devil. Yes, I am not a fan of EMH, but you would think that the University of Chicago started WWII or something. This guy clearly has some issues. AS for his strategy, I will some it up for you, buy value stocks and use no fundamental analysis. Aka buy value index funds, which I don't don't disagree with, but I did not have to read 400 page book to figure that out. And where is all the Psychological stuff, he as no solid info on behavior investing. And what is with the rant about Greenspan and China at the end, I don't care about his opinions, how does it hatred for Greenspan and the Chinese make me a better investor, seemed way too political.

There are very few of them that pass the test of time or make absolute sense. David Dreman brings clarity to one such strategy: low PE and value investing. It is found in his new book, \\"Contrarian Investment Strategy: The Next Generation.\\" David Dreman's investment strategy should be the \\"baseline\\" to judge the merits of all others. His book is a must read for the serious investor. - Clay B. Mansfield, former Chief Investment Officer of The Pennsylvania Public School Employee's Retirement System."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it has so much valuable information that every investor should read it. On the other, the structure and organization are just terrible. Topics are revisited multiple times in different chapters. Topics that are well covered as part of one chapter re-appear several chapters later as a chapter of their own. Entire chapters seem out of place or pointless. For example, after 300 pages of dense material, we are treated to a chapter on the basic \\"why investing in stocks is better than bonds, etc.\\" topic. Believe me, if someone waded 300 pages into this book, they already know that.But, having said all that, do yourself a favor and read it. And when you get that deja-vu feeling, just start skimming."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"It's a pity this book is not known and referenced more widely. This is a superb book and I would rate this title as a must have on every Value Investor's bookshelf - right next to \\"The Intelligent Investor\\".Dreman's fundamental thesis is that a basket of low P/E, low P/B stocks always outperforms glamorous Growth stocks. This, of course, should not come as a suprise to the \\"Intelligent Investor\\". But judging from the herd that wants to buy the latest hot internet stock at triple-digit earnings multiples, it's clear that the message hasn't (and will never) sink in.The book really can be divided into 2 parts :- The first part is a detailed analysis that shows that Dreman's contrarian approach indeed works. Dreman does not wave his hands in the air trying to convince the reader. Instead, he presents and analyzes decades of data (in a style reminiscent of Siegel's Stocks for the Long Run) and builds up a very convincing case for contrarian investing.- The second part delves into the Psychology of Investing, and explores the herd's fascination with \\"hot\\" stocks. Dreman is a pioneer in studying the Psychology of the Markets, writing about it before the term \\"Behavioral Finance\\" came into common use.Dreman's demolition of modern academic finance is very satisfying , and makes for good reading.Ben Graham, in \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" talks about \\"the enterprising investor\\" and \\"the defensive investor\\". Dreman's approach to value investing would be a natural approach for the defensive investor to follow. Fortunately, with the advent of ETFs, it is possible for almost any investor to follow the methods outlined in this book (by picking the S&P;/Barra Value index ETFs).I wish I had read this book when it first came out. It would have saved me from losing all that money in the great bubble !"},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Dreman's advice was mostly right on back then and now. Dreman tackles the topic of investing from three angles:1) Yes, you should look at at low PE and high cash flow/share. Even in 2011, the market crashed in 2008 and companies with strong CF stayed a float while others were downsizing, laying off employees, and credit markets tightened. Hence, high CF works during those periods for the long. He recommends staying away from sexy growth stocks. This is noteworthy considering that he was writing this stuff during the dot com mania. He obviously was not influenced by the hype.2) He introduces to the field behavioral economics. This is something I learned while using psychology profiling with COO's and CEO's. In addition, you are able to read between the lines, of what is not stated, hence most stock analysts should be able to pick up on whether companies will have a good or poor quarter.3) Dreman focuses a lot on statistical analysis with stock & bond trends for the past 100+ years.What he doesn't focus on is government laws, politics and how that affects the past hundred years. Maybe he'll look into it for his next book. Very few companies actually analyze this aspect nor do they have a great understanding and grasp of it's affects both domestically as well as internationally.Dreman does a fine job; however there are much better books out there. Dreman cites data from Jeremy Siegel's book and Greenwald's \\"Value Investing\\". In the long run, he drives his point that stocks beat bonds. He has to state this because he owns a mutual fund firm in NJ. Bonds did well early Jan 2009 through Sept 2009. Does the Bond market always perform? No. Did the stock market perform well from Jan-Mar 2009? Not really, it slowly trickled up in Mar 2009 and rallied in Jul 2009.Also, for many of you who do not know much about Dreman. He spends a lot of his time on his yacht in St. Barts and takes conference calls from investigative reporters (i.e. Maria Bartiroma ..etc., to name a few).Basically he has his team doing all the work while he has fun in the sun. Not a bad life, after you have built yourself up. He is successful and made a lot of calls in his day. However, I think his days are numbered and his performance is winding down (i.e. retirement mode/shift). This is typical of men (& women) who have excelled like him and age. He's still very smart, but not as focused as he used to be. His NJ team seems to be taken doing a good job. However, he was the rainmaker in the early days of his career. All in all, he offers good advice; however the focus should be shorter. Because he manages a mutualfund business his viewpoints and data can be quite lengthy due to research work."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"If I had but one book on investing this would be it. The author exposes the many fallacies and mis- c onceptions about investing...take PE's seriously! The author discusses several variation on a value approach to investing. Well researched and validated. I give the book 4 stars due to his short shrift on tech. analysis."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"It sounds trite, but this is one of the best investment books I have read in a long time. David Dremen presents a well researched, intelligent defense of contrarian strategies. The insights regarding bonds and small caps were particularly helpful and offered a fresh perspective on the usual assumptions regarding these investment options.While the books length may seem daunting, I was actually sorry to reach the end. If only more of the investment writing available were as well thought out as this book."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I've written several books on investing and know how much research goes into the final product. David's books have always stood out as outstanding examples of everything a good investment book should be-filled with facts, not opinions; useful for novice and professional alike; and above all, beautifully written and thought out.David's works have stood the test of time and show that while fads may come and go, successful investing always comes back to understanding and controlling human nature. I highly recommend this and all of Dreman's books."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Dremen's name is eponymous with successful contrarian investing and this book methodically shows why (along with the impressive records of the Kemper-Dremen funds). A modern Ben Graham, Dremen is driven by fundamentals and underlying data, an approach that oddly marks him as a contrarian investor in today's emotion-driven markets.Contrarian Investment Strategies provides a clear synthesis of the research that backs value investing. It also packs a good dose of simple executable advice - in essence invest in low P/E, low P/CF, low P/BV and high DY stocks that have strong balance sheets and good defensible business models - nothing new here but he does a great job laying it all out alongside the research.One of the strongest sections of the book showed how value stocks weathered negative earnings surprises and leapt at positive surprises, while growth and concept stocks hardly budged at positive earnings surprises and plummeted on misses. This is something I've noticed anecdotally, but it's pleasing to see in the research - and, of course, provides a big justification for value investing through times of turmoil. Backing up the data is a lengthy but good discussion on investor psychology (along the lines of Shiller's Irrational Exuberance) that goes through the main behavioral biases that provide opportunities for value investors. The book ends by exposing the pitfalls of IPOs, small caps and index investing.All in all, I believe the book remains as relevant today as it was in the mid-90's, particularly as the IPO market gears up again, this time with social networking stocks. It's as good a starting point as any if you're interested in investing in stocks for the long run."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Dreman explains the typical biases of market crowds, supporting each explanation with statistical experiencies. I found this book very useful for someone wanting to beat the market in a \\"smooth\\" and long term way. The suggested technics are not applyable for anyone looking for quick big gains. He stuck to a strategy he found very effective. In fact, he was fired on 2009, March for his losses,at the bottom of the markets decline, when he was screaming buying in that moment was a great opportunity! The book may appear \\"too long\\" but is very scientific, and it's readable for those as me, that find interesting markets psychology. As I bought Kindle version I can state it's got some mistakes; but they are actually few, like \\"missing paragraphs\\" and don't devalue the work."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Of all the investment books I have on my shelves, I would say that this book has been more influential than any other when it comes to investing in stocks.I have read it at least four times over the years and referenced back to it more than that. I will say that not all periods of time are best to be in the stock market. More recently precious metals have been better and that is where I have been instead of stocks. At some point it will be time to switch and be back in stocks and at that time I again will use what David Dreman promotes, buying undervalued out of favor stocks and holding them till they are more dearly valued. Has it worked for me? My 20 years of investing has allowed me to retire at 55 if that is any indication and I have already said that this book has been the most influential of any I have read, so yes, value investing has worked for me. I do not always invest in stocks, but when I do, they are value stocks based on what he teaches. The results have been favorable.Investing is an art rather than a science. Dreman gives one the information needed to help perfect the art of value investing. It is not a paint by numbers book or something that will guarantee success, but good fundamental education and a way of looking at investing. Everyone likes to buy things when they are on sale......except in the stock market where they seem to prefer to pay top price. I like to buy stocks when they are on sale. That is what contrarian investing is all about.There are periods of time when the stock market is not the best investment vehicle to be in. When it is the best place to be, the ideas in this book work, as long as a person has the mental discipline to allow them to work."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Having just gone to 80% cash, and sold all Nasdaq stocks, I found Dreman's 'Contrarian Investing Strategies' an enjoyable read. He's a little disorganized in his presentation, but he's dead right about this market's behavior, particularly since March of 2000... Before that no one wanted to hear the contrarian/value message, and his funds were languishing (i.e.the Kemper Dreman Value... KDHAX). But he admits he's not interested in calling the top of a mania like the one weve just seen.The shoe is on the other foot now, and his 5 year record of 17.3%/yr has beaten the S&amp;P (14.6%/yr) handily. After reading the book, I decided I didnt want to spend that much time on the markets, nor do I want to buy a fund like KDHAX with a 6% load and a 1.2% yearly fee. So I found a couple of similar value funds with no loads and lower fees... The Clipper fund CFIMX (18.9%/yr past 5 years) and the Oakmark Eq Inc fund (16.7%/yr for 5 years).Though right in the long run, contrarians may get too much press this year. The market may overly punish growth stocks, and the Nasdaq could become worth buying again... if it approaches 1000!! Im grateful Dreman for his insights, and staying in cash for now."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Dreman does it again by reconfirming the findings he first penned before the huge bull market kicked off in the early eighties. Somehow through that whole era of wild dealmaking and internet pyrotechnics the strategies remained valid. Not only does the author make the often dry data highly readible with hiswit and humor, but I'll add that David Dreman's position as one of the great contributors to investment theory and literature is tremendously undervalued."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"My review title says it all.

With this latest endeavor, it seems that his simplisitc opinions on investing still abound. I found the book condescending and trivial at points where the author seemed to prefer trashing his competitors rather than proving an investment point. The chapter that encourages people to steer away from all NASDAQ companies was actually a bit frightening. Where would we be without Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco, just to name a few stellar companies that call the NASDAQ home? It can also be argued that many of the studies shown in his book are either not statistically significant or are ambivalant. The old saying, &quot;With statistics you can prove any point&quot; is quite true with this book. While Dreman may have been a succesful investor, I found myself fighting to complete this book before his self-praise became too overwhelming."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"One of the best books on investing and finance the individual investor will ever read.

There might not be anything completely extraordinary or novel, but it's a great collection of ideas and data.

Every investor should be well versed in market psychology, and this book is a great resource for understanding that as well. Ignore the findings of his book at your own peril!"},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"If you read only one book on investing, this is it. Dreman backs up his thesis with experience and facts, and makes the point that companies and economies are unpredictable in the short run (i.e. forget market timing), and discusses risk in a realistic way. His point that stocks selling at low P/E, book value, and dividend yield react to market events in a very different way then high P/E, book value, no dividend stocks is something every investor should be aware of (I'll bet many have already learned the hard way). This book will limit your risk in the stock market and keep you out of investing &quot;bubbles.&quot; You give up the 100%-200% gains per year which happens form time to time but these gains are illusory unless you are a successful market timer which is impossible."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"Though Dreman's tome was written in '97-'98, it has proven prescient. Note that while value investors suffered from '98 to early '00, Dreman has won out in the end with his Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund returning 71% from March 2000 to March 2001 (while the NASDAQ lost 60%+ - a 130% spread), and has beaten the S &amp; P over the long term. As someone who has their master's degree from the University of Chicago, I should take offense at Dreman's thorough and convincing debunking of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, but I don't. In fact, it gives me great pleasure to see the efficient marketers twist and turn, esp. in light of the Nasdaq's crashing and burning, crafting rather facetious and silly reasons as to why the extreme market run-up was in fact &quot;rational.&quot; It reality, it was a bubble of truly unprecedented proportions made up of egregiously priced concept stocks and vastly overpriced companies built on a foundation of momentum investing, greedy delirium and a wide lack of any notion of underlying business valuations among institutional and retail investors alike. Dreman has remained one of the only true disciples of the Graham and Dodd heritage and prefaced the rise of the &quot;behavioral school&quot; of finance, which attempts to explore some of the same ground Dreman has been covering for many years. Dreman points out that human psychology, when it comes to markets, is actually fairly predictable in a macro sense and shows that valuation has and always will matter in the end. Get this book -- you and your portfolio won't regret it. Anybody who even superficially followed suggestions in this book and tracked holdings in Kemper-Dreman easily returned 50%+ in 2000."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"In this book, David Dreman uses psychological analysis combined with normal market research numbers to explain the reasons behind market movements and the effectiveness of contrarian indicators as predictors. Dreman does a great job of keeping this book interesting by not only giving examples and stories of market swings, but he also uses psychological studies to explain these seemingly contradictory moves.The book starts to feel repetitive in later parts, but it can be forgiven as extra reinforcement of these facts is necessary to combat the way most people familiar with the stock market have been taught to read market numbers. I had read another book on contrarian indicators, and while the graphs and numbers it showed were fascinating, it wasn't until reading this book that I was shown WHY those indicators work. So I recommend anyone not familiar with contrarian market indicators read a book on the basics of them, then read this one for an in-depth showing of why the indicators are successful tools."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"If you want to invest in stocks and not just buy mutual funds, Dreman's book is your guide. Current market activity clearly substantiates his opinions. The herd mentality is at work. While Dreman gives too much space to justify his stance, it is good reading for those who have never been contrarian stock pickers. His guidelines not only make good sense, but they've been proven correct over time. Don't buy another stock or fund without reading this book."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"People say the market has changed...it hasn't. People say times are different...they aren't. Dreman gives you the facts and backs them up with historical evidence that the same mistakes and assumptions are made over and over. There is nothing here that every rational investor shouldn't know, but people still buy into the \\"next big thing\\" style of investing. This book is well written, easy to follow, and Dreman repeats the facts you need to hear twice. It simply explains another piece of the investing puzzle. Classic stuff that should be on every investors shelf."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I think of a book like this as being a reference source more than something you read cover to cover. But you have to read this cover to cover to get all the value from it.Dreman talks about a few important value strategies for buying stock. He suggests buying stocks with significantly low price to earnings ratios and or stocks with significantly low price to cash flow ratios. Those are his favorites but he also talks about stocks with low price to book values and he talks about price to dividend strategies but at the heart of this book is that we should buy stocks that have very low p/e ratios.How low? In the lowest 20-25% of the market. Really low! He provides numerous tables and long term studies to support this investment strategy and it's not hard to understand. A careful reading should provide the reader with some nice tools for how to pick quality stocks.Because dreman is a real money manager not some kook or acedemic his strategies have more value. Dreman really is a successful mututal fund manager and his dreman high return fund has delivered solid returns for a long time.Problems with the book? Well it's not organized well. I would rather he just have an entire chapter on each of these major strategies with all the data to support them as well as any drawbacks. But no he revisits them over and over again throughout the book.All in all well worth the price but you can just put money in his mututal fund and do something else. He makes a great case here for value and why buying stocks when they are out of favor(cheap) is the way to go."},{"Title":"Contrarian Investment Strategies - The Classic Edition","review":"I pretty well agree with the other reviews. One thing I found somewhat contradictory was that Dreman gives Graham and Dodd (and fundamentalists) bit of serve in the methods that don't work section.

It felt like Koontz and Gorman were stalling the plot until the third book. I enjoyed the darker and more dangerous feel of this entry and the increase of gore was a welcome addition as well.

The story of Frankenstein continues in this second novel, but doesn't add a lot to the story. It is very amazing how there could be 500 pages worth of novel, but very little happens to advance the story forward.I won't throw any spoilers in, but the only thing that really happens worth note is that the conclusion of the Randal Six storyline comes about. You don't learn much about Harker at all, no one gets any closer to a confrontation with Helios, and the new Erika starts to stray down a similar path as the last.This edition does introduce some new characters to the fold, but at this early juncture, you can't quite tell if they will even matter in another book or two.This is not a bad book by any stretch. The existing characters do develop more (albeit not by much) and it doesn't bore you. But most of the events that happen in this book could have been either eliminated or moved to another book. It feels like this one was written to take up space and fill the 5 book series constraints.The series got off to a great start, but the second book in the series you can skip. It's not worth the time and doesn't really push the story forward."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I loved the first Frankenstein book (and it was actually my second novel of Dean Koontz). I have read a lot of reviews of this one, all the way to the last book in this series. I found that book three has a poorly reviews, but I won't give up to read it.That being said, I've picked up this book, and I couldn't simply turn away. The book dos reviw some parts of the first one, which I thought Dean and his co-writter did a good job (and they didn't over do it that makes you feel like you're reading the entire first book again). I found out that the fist book gave a huge hint what this one was going to be about: Mutations, and the New Race are becoming killers (which they need to be order to kill a person, now they are killing on their own).Plus, I'm not going to spoil, Randal Six has now enter the house, and he is searching for Arnie.Overall, I thought this book delievers like the first did. I really enjoyed it. Even though this mook was much quicker than the first, Dean still gives you hope for the characters. I couldn't let go of this book, it's a page turner. And if you enjoyed the first book, you must get this one."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"From a great first impression to a devastating second impression. Well, devastating for how Carson and Michael look at their once-sane world with terrified new eyes and devastating for Victor's prideful creations that he doesn't know are slipping further away from his grip.And an immense creature that doesn't wish to be known but has to be.What the first book did that was great, this book more to expand on, including a subtle take over revealed through slip-ups. Apparently human nature is, by far, more complex due to being created by Divinity (which is a subtle theme throughout the series) than he thought he could recereated by his hands. His only real creation was Deucalion, which has gone away from him, only to try to pay personal vengeance upon his scarred body and lack of soul. What does manage to creep me out is his thoughts about where each body part came from that he's made of, not a single person he's created from had a good life, nor had a good rep, so it's more of a poetic justice that the prideful creator be pursued by his completely scarred and own fallen creation, along with two cops who know the truth behind Victor's identity and front.And things will only get more complicated for Victor as he does not realize what's happening to his own growing empire.Not done by human hands, but by its own design and programming."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I love Dean Koontz stories and this was a very good book.

As a whole, the story that continues in this one is good. It seems though that the style is a little ... different. The relationship between O'Connor and Maddison makes kind of a rough transition considering O'Connor's take on dating her partner. There is also an excessive repetitiveness in the attempt to \\"remind\\" the reader of previous scenes when switching from chapter to chapter.

Whereas the monster in the first Frankenstein was a lumbering beast with the brain of a killer, the monsters here (yes, plural) are cunning, vicious \\"improvements\\" on humans, just as evil as the original. There have been quite a few books on the Frankenstein theme, but most of them lack the heightened suspense of City of Night- and let's face it, suspense is Koontz's specialty. By creating multiple monsters in our midst- ones not easily identifiable, and beholden to no one- Koontz has added an element of paranoia to the familiar story, a kind of \\"aliens among us\\" sci-fi bend that makes the danger even more palpable. Each short chapter is like a jab or a jolt, designed to make sure you took note of the terrifying things happening, or about to happen soon.If you love to be frightened and dwell on danger, City of Night won't disappoint.One other book with a kind of Frankenstein theme that's also very good is An Audience for Einstein. Set in the near future, Wakely's thoughtful book chronicles the \\"rebirth\\" of a genius by ethically troubling means."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"After reading the first book, I have been checking the bookstores for this next book, which I bought it literally when it came out. The book picks up where it left off from the previous one, but this book seems to have no central plot other than to set it up for the next book. For instance, in the previous book, at least they were chasing Harker (the killer), and the sub-plots and other character development merged well with the central plot; in this book, it just merely describes/continues with the sub-plots and character development, but nothing else. I just felt that it left me wondering what I didn't already know before reading this book. Koontz could have easily merged this with the first book, or the next one, which I hope is more interesting. For this book, I just feel like it was \\"chopped-up\\" with no central plot. Don't get me wrong, I still look forward to the next book, but this one was a little disappointing."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Its a great story.

The characters are funny, often witty and, in my own imagination, all the right side of handsome, yet the repetition in the second book has really annoyed me. I would imagine anyone spending the time to read book number two has already read book one, and so; so much backtracking and re-explanation is completely unnecessary and appears to be filler for the book. The ideas are fantastic. I was reading this book at Earls Court station and seriously considered throwing it under a train it was so patronizing. However the story, amidst the constant repetition, pushed me onward and now finished I know I will be buying the next installment. But COME ON KOONTZ! I remember page twelve, man, I don't need it on thirty, forty seven, fifty one, sixty twelve and seventy seven. Stamping on dead bodies is obviously not a kids book so treat us like the adults we are.

This book was ok, it just didn't hook me as much as his books usually do.I really disliked the dialogue between the woman and man cop, it just got kinda annoying after a while.Nevertheless, i really liked the detail in which monsters are described and the other storylines going on in the book."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"After spending precious few hours on a couple plane trips this past weekend reading book #1 and #2 of this series it is plainly obvious that this \\"trilogy\\" of books is way too little material to justify the three books.These are my first two Koontz books and after book #3 comes out I won't read any more. I still give the two books so far three stars because they are entertaining and allow enough suspension of disbelief to allow the reader to quickly move through them. However, after going through two of the three books now I can safely say that nothing at all has been resolved. Only one plot thread has moved along at all - the silly Randall Six thread - and it has no interaction with plot advancement what so ever.These books have enormous print and at least 30% of the material in no way advances the story or gives meaningful character development. The books constantly remind the reader that the new race is really strong (duh!). It then rehashes events that happened only a few dozen pages back. The books feel written like a soap opera, always assuming the reader must have missed huge sections so they constantly need to be caught back up. The description of the coin flip, the super strength, and the rules of the new race must take up 25% of the books by themselves... over and over and over.I truly believe this entire series could have easily fit within the pages of a single, average size book if it weren't for all the wasted words and huge type. A Lincold and Child book (by no means high-art and still easy reading by any standard) has ten times the meat in a similar number of pages. Heck, I think Harry Potter has more meat per book.In short, these books are entertaining but I truly feel ripped off. I have now read two books with no conclusion at all, and paid good money for both. It feels like a scheme to charge $24 for three books that should have easily fit in the covers of a standard $8 paperback. I'd love to be Koontz' agent and/or accountant - great marketing strategy, just not great books.Yeah, I'll read book #3, and I may even recommend someone pick up the trilogy once all three books are out (although I'll try to get #3 from the library). For now, however, I recommend highly AGAINST reading the first two until the third comes as you will be badly dissatisfied.Just my opinion, however."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I'm half way through this, and really like it.

Why you ask? Because of novels like this, that exercises your imagination and keeps you awake at night saying to yourself... \\"Ok just one more chapter\\"This book picks up right were book one leaves off. It is good vs evil with the classic Frankenstein story mixed in. The beginning did start out a little slow due to the fact that there was a little bit of a review in with the start of the story. Book one ended on such a hot streak and then book two began a little slow to either give people a refresher that hadn't read book one in a while or those who hadn't read book one at all. The story did keep moving just not at an incredible pace. However, after about the first hundred pages we take off again and don't stop until the finish. Including more colorful characters being written in and non stop action that has Deucalion, Michael and Carson trying to figure out how they are going to defeat Victor Frankenstein.Koontz fans must read the Frankenstein series! As of right now the reviews for book three are pretty bad but since I haven't read it, I am very much in love with the Frankenstein series so far and will read book three soon. If you are a fan of Koontz and I dare say a fan of the original Frankenstein novel, read books one and two and enjoy. The characters and the stories are first rate and you will not want to put them down.Grade: A"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"If you are wondering what I mean by \\"very hard to catch up on\\", I mean that if you haven't read the first book in a while you'll spend a moment or two trying to remember the smaller details. It doesn't impair the enjoyment of the book, but it's the smaller details that may get forgotten, such as Karloff & Erika IV. As I kept reading I was able to remember them, but it just took me a while. (I didn't have the 1st book on hand to flip through before I started in on the 2nd book.)This volume picks up where the last one left off (of course), with the death of Harker & the strange thing that burst out of him. There is also the threat of Randall Six, a creature who wants to learn the secret of happiness from Artie or else. All through this you have Carson & Michael, the two cops who got caught up in all of this, who are now being hunted by Helios's assasins. Meanwhile Deucalion is trying to meet his maker & put an end to the threat posed by the New Race & his master.I did enjoy this book greatly, but like I said above... it's best if you read these books in the same time frame. I'd put off reading this one until the 3rd book came out & I'd read the first one over a year ago. The book is still thrilling & entertaining, though. I do have to admit that I got a little impatient with the scenes with the garbage crew of the New Race because so much of it was repetitive, with descriptions of Nick's nose abilities, the lusts of the crew, how they couldn't rebel & the strangeness of what lay beneath the garbage.

A+++++++++++"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I was slightly disappointed in this 2nd book of Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series. Written with Ed Gorman, Koontz just doesn't make this one as intriguing as the first. As a recap (and possible spoiler for the first book) we are introduced to Deucalion in the first book as he journeys from a Tibetan monastery to New Orleans after learning that his creator is still alive. When he arrives, it is to a city full of Victor's creations and a serial killer who is saving people's body parts. Cops, Michael and Carson are on the job though, and after meeting Deucalion, realize there's more than meets the eye.This book takes place almost immediately after the first. Randall 6, one of Victor's creations, has escaped the laboratory and traveled to Carson's house to find out the secret of happiness that he believes Carson's autistic brother knows. We are also introduced to some of Victor's assassins who are after the cops to silence what they know. And to make matters even worse, some of Victor's creations are having trouble with their programming and causing harm to themselves and others.The characters in this aren't really developed much more than the first book. We are introduced to the newest clone wife of Victor's, Ericka 5 and she has quite a bit of detail. But really aside from her there's not much to go on at all. I also didn't see as much of Deucalion in this book as I would have wished.The writing was clear and concise but just lacked the exciting feel that the first book had. It felt as if this book was merely just recapping and setting the story up for the next book without having too much going for it itself. It also still made lots of references to pop-culture (which I don't like). I also felt that the book was rushed as it really only takes place in one day for the majority of the writing. There is some violence and gore so it may not be appropriate for younger readers.I'll still continue on with the series but I hope they go back to being as good as the first book. If they continue like this one, well, that just doesn't hold much interest for me.City of NightCopyright 2005455 pagesReview by M.

I was completely enthralled by book 1, but found book2 to be disinteresting and contrived. Many of the compelling elements of book 1 didn't carry over to the second installment. I may try reading again to see if I missed something, but for me, the Frankenstein series ended after the Prodigal Son."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"In the second of three novels dealing with ancient evil in contemporary New Orleans, Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison are left realing from the discovery that Victor Helios, a billionaire scientist, was once Victor Frankenstein, and that his very first creation, now calling himself Deucalion, has come to the city to save the world. For Victor never stopped making new people--his terrifying \\"New Race.\\" He has created what he THOUGHT was the perfect person...until things go wrong.The New Race, created to be loyal unto Victor and to not believe in God or any form of supersticion, begin having doubts. The New Race are designed not to kill unless ordered by their creator to do so; but their lust to kill (for they hate human beings) is becoming uncontrollable. And several members of the New Race are changing into unthinkable monstrocities, with the sole desire to destroy and wreck havok.As O'Connor, Maddison, and Deucalion race to stop Helios's evil plans, they must face the reality that they are too late: that events have been set in motion that may kill everybody in the city of New Orleans...and possibly the rest of the world.It's a corny idea, to be sure; but then, Koontz has never been afraid to go out on a limb. And, truthfully, only he could turn this ridiculous notion into a horror/suspense novel that's not only readable, it's right up there with his best. Co-written by Ed Gorman (another brilliant horror/suspense writer), \\"City of Night\\" picks up where the first novel left off, and will leave readers hanging on the edge of their seats for the final installment (which doesn't come out for another year, unfortunately)."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Let me start off by saying that I was saddened to find out that book 3 in this series isn't planned for release until winter 2007. I can understand the reasons, but with the way we are left hanging at the end of this book, I want to know what happens now. =)Fans of book 1 will not be disappointed. This book picks up right where the last one left off and hits the ground running from start to finish. There was a recap to what has happened that was subtly mixed in to the first few chapters. This is very nice if, like me, you picked up this book as soon as it came out, but set it on your shelf until you got around to reading it. Overall the book moved VERY quickly and was a nice easy read.I don't want to get too into the plot as I believe the Amazon Editorial Reviews suffice, as do many of the other reviews here, and I don't want to be the one to give away something that may spoil the story for you. I will say that you continue with O'Connor and Michael's often comedic interaction which, in between all the action and events, is very welcome. Deucalion seemed to me to take on a bit of a different role, and he didn't seem to come across as ominous as he had in \\"Prodigal Son\\". At first I was disappointed, but it fit the flow of the story quite well. Victor Frankenstein's character continued to grow and you can truly get a feeling of his madness and conceit in what he does as he becomes more and more reckless.I definitely recommend this book, especially if you enjoyed the first book in the series. I picked up book one because I am a huge fan of everything Frankenstein. This, while being a different twist on the story, has been very good thus far."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Really, how does he classify as a racist? Can people read a book? It is a tremendous reworking/continuation of a literary classic. It breathes new life into the old tale and gives it a 21st century spin. It's the same Koontz style that HIS readers have come to enjoy, and that is not a bad thing at all. There are only a two novelists whose works I will continue to read, Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz. As a law student, my time is scarce and Koontz makes reading more than worth my time. However, reading a trilogy in the works is difficult. If you haven't started the series yet, wait until book 3 comes out and read them in quick succession. I can't wait for the final installment. Do not listen to the negative reviewers, they sound jilted for some personal reason and are not being fair critics."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"The second installment in Koontz's Frankenstein series. It picks up right where the first book left off. O'Conner Carson and Deacullion begin to prepare for Victors attack on mankind. Meanwhile Victor himself is begning to lose control of his New Race.This book wasnt as exciting as the first however is still very good. Its a very good transition to the conclusion of the story (which I believe will be called Dead or Alive). The last few chapters of this book leave you wanting more and craving the third and final installment in Deans take on this classic story.The only problem I've had with this series is the 3rd book was supposed to be out this past summer (06) yet still hasnt been released. According to a UK website its due out there the end of May. Weather this is true for the US I still dont know nor can I seem to find and info on the US release. If you are interested in reading this series I suggest waiting til the 3rd book is released as this one will leave you wanting to read more and waiting for a conclusion on which you dont have any real information on its release is really annoying."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Another page turner from Dean Koontz! Just could not put it down, but was very frustrated by the ending! Just when I thought it was all going to 'kick off' he leaves you hanging. However I have managed to find out that his third book is out in July this year so I suppose it is not to long to wait. The reason that it is a little longer wait for his third book is because he is going it alone as he has found out that he does not 'colaborate well' (his words not mine!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"How is it possible that Koontz can write dozens of books about Odd Thomas (lamer by the minute) dogs (please, there's one in every story now and it's getting old) but can't find the time to finish his best work to date???The Frankenstein story he tells is engaging and fresh yet he keeps postponing release of book three to the benefit of that lame brained Thomas and whatever religious claptrap he seems to love so much these days (the \\"taking\\" anyone?) That too, what's up with the sudden religiosity? does it sell more? seriously get back to your roots, I'll take Strangers over anything he has written in the past 5 years (except for Franky of course)Read Christopher Moore \\"practical demon keeping\\" insteadDisappointed"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Really loved the premise for this trilogy. Book one (Prodigal) is definitely a five star, and the review on this one would have gotten four stars, but we've been waiting quite a while now for the third installment.I can understand how the movie version of Prodigal might have put the author off. (Totally miscast.) Still, I hate to be left hanging on a good story.And I'm sure other loyal readers feel the same way."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"This is the second volume in Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series. It continues the story in the first book. Readers may want to look at my review of the first volume Prodigal Son. Victor Helios is the name that Dr. Victor Frankenstein is using in New Orleans over two hundred years after he created his monster who he thinks is dead. He is manufacturing what he considers new improved beings, a new race, that he intends to use to kill and replace humans. These will be beings that do his bidding. Helios is over confident. Although he has been experimenting for two centuries, his beings, now numbering a couple of thousands, and placed in prominent New Orleans positions after the humans they are replacing are killed, are beginning to fall apart.The first monster he created some 200 years ago is still alive and wants to stop Helios. He has unusual powers as a result of being hit by lightning. He is very strong and can move from one place or continent to another in a second. But Helios programmed him that he can't kill him. So Deucalion, as he calls himself, needs the help of two New Orleans detectives, Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison. The two are sexually attracted to each other, but Carson does not want to pursue their relationship until they settle the Frankenstein matter.Carson has an autistic brother, Arnie. Helios made one of his creatures autistic. This creature, Randal Six, meaning that he is the sixth attempt to create Randal correctly, is one of the many Helios creatures who is disintegrating. He sees a picture of Arnie smiling. Although programmed to remain in his room, Randall leaves to go find Arnie and learn from him how to enjoy living. He decides that either Arnie will tell him or he will kill him. This problem of dissatisfaction with their existence is one of the main reasons why the Helios creatures are falling apart.William, for example, like all the creatures, is programmed not to kill himself, but he begins to chew off his fingers to destroy himself joint by joint. Erica five, who Helios made to be his wife, does not understand why he beats her during sex. Isn't she satisfying him? Christine, a maid, against instructions, advises her to read a psychology book. Cindy and Benny, who were designed to kill humans, go amuck. She wants to have a child even though this is against her programming. The two of them also want to kill people who Helios hasn't designated to be killed. Father Ducaine, another replicant - a replicant is a Helios being who replaces a killed human - begins to feel the presence of God, although programmed not to believe. What will happen to these beings? Will Helios scheme unfold? What part will Deucalion, Carson, and Michael play?"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Dean Koontz has been my favorite author for years. I love every single one of his books, are re-read them frequently. I love that he has taken and old favorite, Frankenstein, and put his wonderful artistic spin on it. I, like other readers here, am eagerly anticipating the third book in the series. I highly recommend this book, the first book in this series, and everything else he has written."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I usually am not a Koontz fan but in the past year I've been picking his books up more and more and enjoying them. It was his first Frankenstein book that got me to start reading his work again. As for this book I am happy to say I enjoyed it just as much. The book continues the telling of Deucalion the first of the \\"new breed\\" that evil, genius Victor Helios (aka VIctor Frankenstein) made hundreds of years ago. It also continues the stories of the 2 cops who have discovered that the \\"new breed\\" actually exists. This book really is just the middle ground between the first book and the finale third one that's supposed to come out next summer, but it's greatest feat is showing how Helios is losing control over the people he has built and that basically the s**t is about to hit the fan. The last few pages involving Victors wife (Erika 6) and the newest abomination was really, really creepy! Liked this book a lot and it makes me even more excited for the third."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I have been a huge Dean Koontz fan for many many years. I found this book and Book One, Prodigal Son, to be very refreshing and very different than his other books. I can't wait for the others in the series. I'm almost as excited as I was waiting for the books in the Stephen King Gunslinger series. It has action, adventure, a little bit of the \\"what-if\\" possibilities and a blossoming love story right smack dab in the middle of it all."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I'd give it 5 stars but I'm a little tired of the \\"witty banter\\" between the 2 cops. Other than that, it's page-turner."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Like a lot of people, I walked out of Dean Koontz's The Taken with mixed emotions... but then I began reading the Frankenstein saga. Book one left me wanting more. Book two... well, the very thought of having to wait until next summer for the conclusion of this trilogy is enough to make me want to scream (in a good way). As with the first book in the series, the Frankenstein monster of yore plays a relatively small role in this book. Some might see that as a bad thing, but trust me when I say that it is not a detriment to the story at all. Instead, the canvas if populated with fascinating characters, some of whom we met in book one and other of whom are new to readers. As the pages turn (and you'll be surprised at just how quickly that happens!), the carefully constructed kingdom of Victor Helios (nee Frankenstein) continues to crumble in the most bizarre and, for readers, delightful of ways. To say more would be... well, to say too much. Simply jump in and enjoy this voyage and hope that book three will be the end of a trilogy, but only the beginning of the series."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed the first installment very much and the second followed suit. The authors delve deeper into the original characters and also offer us more. They have broadened the view on Victor's growing empire, showing bits and shots of just how bad the problem is and how it is getting even worse.The lack of control and the mutations - not to mention the garbage dump scene - all send a forboding signal that when the tenuous grasp this new race has on reality and sanity snaps... all hell is going to break loose.The dialog is good, but in need of some substanance of some communication other than idle jokes or barbs being tossed back and forth. Though to a degree this lack seems moderately acceptable given that it may be the characters way of 'dealing' with something they can't fathom. If that is the case, it would be nice if it were noted.All and all a great book, well worth it. The only reason I didn't alot it a 5 star rating is that I don't think this particular plot had to be done in series form and a lot of the subplots in both books is, it seems, to stretch it into a series."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"This book has so many comparison to God and the way people think about him/her/it/God. Anyway this story is amazing I have been intrigue from the very first one. I find Dean Koontz to be an excellent writer. I want to be Dean Koontz when I am reincarnated. The stories are gripping and well written. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a good book."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I rarely ever read because I get frustrated with how long it takes me to read something because I read at a very slow pace, and I will find myself reading the same sentence over and over again, but I finished this book in under a week. Once I started reading I was completely hooked into it and I only put it down when my vision began to get too blurry to read anymore. This series does a good job of bringing the Frankenstein story into our time and combining it with todays fears about how far is too far when it comes to cloning. I will reccomend this book to anyone who will let me."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I came to Dean Koontz's Frankenstein by a long and twisty (and needless to say, dark) road. We could go so far as to call it an Odd road.What I can tell you is this--that while Koontz's Frankenstein is unspeakably more bloody and peculiar than his difficult but touching Odd Thomas books, it is every bit as satisfying a piece of writing. It is a compulsive read, and it tells the truth within the lie of fiction.It is not for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to think about the existence of evil, and if you are willing to believe that there are still people who give up everything to combat it--if you hope that if need be, you might be one of those people--this frightening series set so perfectly in New-Orleans-That-Was is for you.Deucalion--and Cheez-Its!--forever!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Starting right up where the previous release (Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)left off, we find Carson, Michael, and Deucalion attempting to figure out how to gain access to Victor Helios (aka Frankenstein) and destroy him.As members of the New Race start having breakdowns all over the city, Carson and Michael are fighting off an assassination attempt, trying to keep Carson's brother safe, wondering what officials of the New Orleans government have been replaced by New Race replicants, and how the heck they're going to infiltrate Helios's guarded home to take him down.Koontz is my favorite author of all time, and I've been sucked into the Frankenstein story just like all of his others. I'm anxiously awaiting the conclusion to this story with the third book, and all I have to say is this--Victor better suffer, Deucalion better not die, and Carson and Michael better end up married. After that, Koontz can do what he wants."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"The Monster? No, the book! Dean Koontz has teamed up with Kevin Anderson (of Star Wars fiction fame) and Ed Gorman to produce one of the poorest written books I may have ever had the displeasure to come across. The story is actually not half bad. The basic idea was fairly thought provoking and honestly, the ONLY reason I read the book was because I am currently working on a Frankenstein novel myself and wanted to see what Koontz was doing with the character and story. Quite a bit, I can tell you, and again, the *story* is really pretty good.The writing, however...It reads like two people wrote this sitting in the same chair, fighting over the keyboard. I've never seen more awkward use of tags in dialog. The main police detective characters are absolutely horrible, but ironically, very funny. I was surprised at the amount of humor in \\"City of Night\\" and the Frankenstein monster looks to be a compelling character with numerous layers of depth. I want to know more about him (and the lightening's effect on him when he was created.)Dr. Victor Helios (Victor Frankenstein--he takes on the name of Helios for several reasons) is extremely uninteresting and stereotyped like the blood-n-guts, shoot-first cops I mentioned and I found New Orleans to be a poor setting. Reminds me too much of Rice's vampire town. He should have set the book in Europe, IMHO, but who am I?Koontz (as I've said in other reviews) is hit and miss with me. Some of his stuff (like \\"Odd Thomas\\") is both brilliant AND entertaining. Not this. I haven't read all of Koontz's work yet, but so far this is (mechanically) his worst, in my opinion. I remember a brief note Koontz posted on his web site saying that he was disappointed in the Frankenstein book(s) himself and would finish the series solo. He certainly can't do worse and I suspect the collaboration may be at fault. I've never read Gorman's books, but I'm pretty familiar with Koontz and it just didn't jive with what I had read before. I suspect Book 3 will be very different from Books 1 (\\"Prodigal Son\\") and 2 (\\"City of Night\\"). Let's hope so.\\"Odd Thomas\\", however...you really should read \\"Odd Thomas\\" if you haven't already."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 of Dean Koontz' Frankenstein books.

That said. I do feel that you must read the first in the series (Frankenstein, Book One: Prodigal Son) to get this one. It reminds me of the Stephen King series The Green Mile that kept you hooked until the next one came out. Koontz's book City of the night is as usual written with a surface entertainment value (violence and characters you cannot possibly like) and a more subtle theme (can men and women made by man develop souls? Are they capable of being \\"touched\\" by God and thus ultimately be children of God?) I am richly rewarded by Mr. Koontzs ability to put faith in a horror novel. The good vs. evil once again ping-pongs the reader into speedy page turning. Helios mass produces a hireachy of human replacements with such disrespect for the Ultimate Creator that his plan must surely begin to crumble!?My only regret is that once again I did not have the self control to wait to read this until I had the third one in my hands. Now I HAVE to wait."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"As usual Koontz is a master at story telling.

To date I have completed books I and II; wow, what a disappointment. I am not sure I can give books III and IV the same investment of time. It was a case of the authors never could get the story on the correct track. The character of Deucalion, who is the richest character in the whole story, does not have enough lines to express his wonderful personality. He should be wise and all knowing; not staccato. It is not clear whose story it is. Is it Helios, is it Deucalion, is it Carson/Michael or even the New Race? the plan of story was excellent-take Victor and his monster, transport them 200 years in the future, all old skills for both intact, and new, future skills also intact. I wonder what Books III and IV are like. If I my fellow reviewers indicate some kind of guidance, I won't waste my time and money. I hope Dean Koontz will remain a one person show."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"In Prodigal Son, readers learned of the existence of Victor Helios's (formerly known as Dr. Frankenstein) creatures which he has continued to make over the centuries. In City of Night, readers learn the extent to which these many hundreds of creatures have infiltrated every level of society. They look much like you or I, but are incredibly powerful, and in many ways unstoppable. The creature known as Deucalion - the original monster created by Frankenstein - has returned to New Orleans to try and stop them and end Victor's experiments, along with the help of Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison. Carson and Michael have a growing relationship for each other that aches to stretch beyond the boundaries of professional partners, but they know they have to stop Helios first before they can give into their desires. While Deucalion was programmed to never harm his master, Helios, he infiltrates the complex network, taking down the creatures and freaks, which he has no qualms about doing. City of Night loses the momentum generated by Prodigal Son somewhat with an introduction of many new characters - mostly Helios's creatures - that can befuddle the reader at times, but nevertheless builds to what will hopefully be an epic climax in the third book of the series, Dead and Alive.Originally written on November 23rd, 2009 Alex C.

It feels like Dean Koontz was in full swing here, like book 1 was just the planned introduction to this, and book 3 was the planned conclusion. Books 1 and 3 are the bread of the Frankenstein sandwich and this is the meat.1) The dialogue was much more natural, and nothing struck me as cringe-worthy.2) Some of the characters added or expanded in this book are just great. Even the horribly evil ones are hugely entertaining.3) The relationship between the two main characters is not cheesy, and their exchanges are invariably snappy, fun, and entertaining.3) The plot does not drag.4) There was some resolution with a few of the subplots. Not necessarily final resolution, and obviously it's leading into the next installment in the series, but it felt like there was more resolution than the first book.Unfortunately, I was let down by the next book in the series, but given how much I enjoyed this step, I'm still glad I read the whole thing."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"This is the sequel to Prodigal Son.

Through science and experimentation, he has discovered a way to extend his own life, so now he is centuries old, and still creating monsters.The ending is somewhat of a cliffhanger, though once again that should be expected as this is a series.

Like a lot of authors he has gotten so commercialized that his books are becoming predictable and, in this case, an outright rip-off. First we are told this is a second volume that was preceded by a book written by someone else (and certainly not Mary Shelley). Then, to complete the theme we are left to await the final (maybe) resolution in another separate writing.

For example:1) Plucky girl cop and wisecracking boy cop sidekick. Didn't we see this in Dragon Tears?2) Endless knocks on contemporary American society. OK Mr. Koontz, we get it, the modern world is bad. We're sorry. We promise to try harder. We saw all of this most recently in The Face and the Odd Thomas series.3) Angelic autistic child (or child with some other disability). The Seize the Night series, From the Corner of his Eye, and a lot of other books I can't seem to remember.4) Tortured priest who struggles with an end times calamity and the changes that are happening to his body and psyche.But wait, there is at least a bonus! No thinking super dogs that can save the universe if we all just hugged them more.Koontz tends to go over the top when he talks about contemporary times. Really Mr. Koontz, we're not that bad. This moralizing detracts from the pacing and quality of his work and I wish he would stop.The third Frankenstein book is probably going to be the last Koontz book I will read. While I like most of the characters he's created, and think many of his story lines are interesting, I am tired of being preached at and lectured to.Reader tip: I've noticed on long driving trips that Koontz novels sound better in audio than they do when read."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I'm not a fan of Koontz's work in general, but his update of Frankenstein has some neat ideas. This, the second book of a proposed trilogy, isn't quite as good as the first, but parades out enough monsters and mutants to keep one's interest, while Koontz sets up events for a third book.The main problem is the lack of an ending. I know that there is going to be (at least) one more book, but one of the plots should have wrapped up, like the serial killer plot in the first one. This isn't \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\"Oh, but Koontz, will you lay off the atheists and scientists? We get it, you believe in god. Yawn. Enjoy your cars, pharmaceuticals, airplanes, food, computers, etc that prayer has provided for you. Oh, I meant to say that \\"science\\" has provided for you. Seriously, the amount of atheist-baiting in these books is ridiculous. Funny that in the real world, we don't have to worry about Frankenstein's creations gone amok, but we do have to worry about a \\"god\\" that allows priests to harm children. I guess that's one reason why we have fiction: to provide the world that prayers can not.Who wants to bet that the thing in the glass case is Dracula? Anyone?"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I love Dean Koontz's flair for action packed books.

Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son. I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience.

I've never been disappointed...until now. Is this a joke I thought. I had read book one with such fervent enthusiasm as I have all his books. I couldn't wait to get my hands on book two. I thought the first two chapters were simply a refresher but so was chapter 5, and 8 and 24 and 47 and so on and so on.... I skipped paragraphs, then pages, then whole chapters. I've never read a book so fast. If you've read book one, don't waste your time folks. Unless you like sitting through the same picture show twice. I will look for book 3 though but you can bet I'll go find a corner of the store to sit in and peruse a chapter or two or three first before I take it home. For now though I'll go check out 'Life Expectancy'. :O) Peace"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"What was to be a trilogy, but turned into a five book series, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein continues with book 2 - City of Night. Having read Book 1 in just one week, I immediately picked up Book 2 and finished it in a week as well. While coining books as \\"beach reads\\" is so cliche, it's definitely true because how else could I read two 400+ paged books in two weeks? With its short chapters and light plot development, the books might be lacking in literary merit but they are fun engaging reads.In City of Night, we literally pick up one day later from where the first book ended and with all the same characters. Koontz spends the first 100 pages of the book pretty much recapping everything that happened in the first. Deucalion wants to find Victor. Carson and Michael want to find Victor. Arnie is still building his castle. Randal Six is under the O'Connor house and wants to get in to find Arnie. And the new Ericka finds herself at home alone after Victor leaves for work.As Koontz moves the story lines along, it soon becomes quite obvious that he isn't sure where to go and the book is probably going to build to a lack luster climax, especially since there are still three more books in the series after this one. And I was right. Deucalion disappears from the plot entirely for about another 100 pages, while Carson and Michael end up spending over half the book planning to get sniper guns from a well-known criminal supplier. And Ericka, much like the last one, begins to explore the house and question the motives of Victor.New characters include another priest of the New Race. The one we met in Book One also plays a part in this book. We are also introduced to a group of landfill workers of the New Race who are responsible for burying the bodies of New Race \\"gone-wrongs\\" and Old Race members who Victor has replaced with his minions. And the best ones yet are two assassins of the New Race named Benny and Cindi. Sadly, we also say good-bye to one of the lead characters who is killed off barely before his destiny is even met. I admit I was sad to see him go and almost felt that Koontz just didn't know what should come next for him.The plot builds as Benny and Cindi are assigned to kill our two detectives Carson and Michael and begin to trail them, leading to an intense climax at Carson's house. Deucalion comes back in, meeting with the priest from Book One who informs Deucalion about Victor and brings him one step closer to finding his maker. Meanwhile, Ericka finds Victor's secret lab and becomes obsessed with a figure inside a coffin shaped tank. Victor has his hands busy at his warehouse when one of his guards begins a metamorphosis into a new creature. More chaos ensues as Victor's virtual secretary begins to go out of control, and the landfill workers discover a stranger creature under all of the garbage who appears to have been created out of all the bodies they've been burying.Like the first, this book is not without its dry humor which sometimes makes the characters annoying. Benny and Cindi spend much of their time arguing about babies and sex. Cindi wants to have a baby so bad and even buys baby clothes, despite New Race members being sterile. She begs Benny to keep trying after they kill the detectives. All their banter about sex, babies, and killing makes them so bizarre which is probably what Koontz intended.I'd like to think that Koontz is reserving Deucalion for something much greater to come. His scenes in this book are few and far between despite him being one of the leads. While the story does shift forward quite a bit, this book is just kind of an in-between in the series. Victor's New Race reign is still spiraling out of control with systems going berserk and new creatures being created on their own. There's a surprise new character introduced in the very end which I'm sure will have a big part coming up.Since I'm new to Koontz, I'm reading the series for myself and having fun doing it. Old Koontz fans have had mixed feelings about the series and have said its not his best. All humor aside, I think the plot lines about morality and the New Race members questioning their being and whether or not they have a soul are pretty interesting. It definitely gives the series a fresh essence and shows Koontz's ability to craft good characters. The plot may not have much depth outside of that, but we all need a good read from time to time that doesn't require too much thought or attention. On to book three!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"City of Night takes off right where Prodigal Son ends. All of the characters are back and a couple new ones are added, and the flaws of Helios are becoming more evident. The new objective of Carson, Michael, and Deucalion is to kill Helios, while Helios is still trying to take over the world with his new race.I really liked this book. The short chapters didn't phase me this time, and I thought that they made the story more interesting. The plot was compelling and began to thicken as the story went on. The characters still didn't develop but remained what they were. The story goes more in dept into Helios's life and you get more information as to what his creations are like.I didn't like the abrupt ending. To me, it seemed like Mr. Koontz both books written (and by both I mean City of Night and Dead and Alive) and just randomly picked a spot to end City of Night.All in all I thought that the book was an amazing read but it was lacking in the end."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I strongly recommend reading 'Frankenstein: Prodigal Son' first, since the first books ends in a cliffhanger leading to 'Frankenstein: City Of Night'.As we left the first book in the series, detectives Carson O'Conner and Michael Maddison were hot on the tail of Victor Helios, aka Dr. Frankenstein. Still alive after two hundred and forty years, Victor continues his practice of creating life, but now using new technology to \\"grow\\" his creations rather than piece them together from graveyard corpses. Leaving the last book, Carson's younger, autistic brother was in grave danger from Randal Six, a Helios creation who has unexpectedly thwarted his internal programming.Dr. Frankenstein's original \\"monster\\", naturally immortal from his birth during lightning, has come from the mountains of Tibet to assist in ridding the world of his creator, though through his programming he cannot do it himself. Now calling himself Deucalion, he has joined forces with O'Conner and Maddison, feeding them information on Helios with the hopes that the two detectives can help him.Two new characters are introduced, Benny and Cindi Lovewell. Members of Helios's New Race, they are but Gammas in his hierarchy and programmed to kill O'Conner and Maddison. But something has gone wrong with Cindi. While she still enjoys the thrill of the kill, Cindi has become obsessed with having a baby, something the New Race is incapable of. She yearns for a baby with unnatural desire, and Benny is reluctant to report her for fear of being terminated himself.Erika Five has replaced Erika Four as Victor's wife, but is she going to be the perfect wife he keeps hoping for? Will her idiosyncrasies be more or less annoying than Erika Four? And as for Victor, it seems some of his creations are making mistakes, errors that point to their direct-to-brain downloads going wrong. How many mistakes can Victor tolerate?While in this second installment I felt that too much time was spent rehashing what already happened in Book One, but the additions of new characters and thrilling confrontations keep this second installation alive and well. Deucalion's understanding of the quantum universe is skimmed over, adding more intrigue and dimension to the gigantic and ugly monster. The plot moves slower but is no less intense in anticipation of what's to come. And like the first book, 'City Of Night' also ends in a cliffhanger. I can't wait for Book Three of the series to come out. Highly recommended. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"The basis premise of these novels is fresh and current.

Does anyone know?"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"For book two of his modern-day Frankenstein series, Dean Koontz has a new co-author and a new title, but that's about all that's different from book one. The characters, setting, tone, and basic plot are all the same. Fortunately, the enjoyability factor is also similar to that of the series debut, which makes the second book at least readable, if not exactly on a level with what readers have come to expect from \\"America's storyteller.\\"The story continues right where book one left off, with Deucalion, the original Frankenstein Monster, and New Orleans cops Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison plotting to track down and destroy Victor Helios, aka Frankenstein, before he can unleash his new-and-improved humans upon the city and the world. As the three would-be saviors uncover new layers of Helios's plot, they find that nothing is what is seems and no one can be trusted. Meanwhile, Helios's creations are facing their own issues, as they struggle with free will and their desire to destroy both humans and themselves. And when one of Helios's creations goes horribly wrong, the stage is set for the ultimate showdown between good and evil.City of Night contains plenty of characteristic Dean Koontz philosophizing on everything from the nature of man to issues of good vs. evil to the meaning of free will. And it offers plenty of the same off-the-wall humor and good-natured banter between the two main (human) characters. There's a fair amount of sexual content, though this happily is downplayed from the first book. The sexual tension between the two cops is hardly subtle, yet because they are committed to not acting on their desires (for professional reasons, not moral), the objectionable content, at least between the protagonists, is minimal. There's some violence, as one would expect in a book entitled Frankenstein, but it's mostly of a bizarre rather than grotesque nature.Spiritual content in the book is limited to some rather vague references to an afterlife as characters contemplate what they believe may be their last hours or days before death. There are two interesting scenes that include priests, but the dialog in these scenes, one of which involves a priest contemplating suicide, is more philosophical than religious. Basically, there's just not a lot of depth in the story, spiritual or otherwise.The Frankenstein series will not be remembered as Koontz's best work, and it will probably not rocket his co-authors to fame and fortune. Still, for what it is--B-level horror dressed up as Mary Shelly-esque social commentary--it delivers."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Koontz is briliant in this surprise three book installment and I have always loved him and never expected to be surprised by him.

Victor Frankenstein has always been the apotheosis of 19th Century atheism. He is a man who has seized the means of creation and is intent of making himself the god of the 21st century. Unfortunately, he is also very much a sadistic sociopath who sees his creations as disposable. To be assigned tasks, used until worn out, disposed of if they veer from Frankenstein's compulsive perfectionism. His plot is to replace key officials and flood the world with his manufactured humans. When the time is right these will rise up and slaughter the rest of us.Koontz goes into considerable detail about the nature of Frankenstein's realm. We see first hand the cruelty, disregard, and insane utopianism that are its spirit. And under the surface, we see the mistakes. Frankenstein's genetic manipulation and brain programming aren't perfect. Stranger monsters lurk within the cultivated flesh, and others struggle with unexpected human needs to nurture and be cared for. This is a frightening realm. One that has spilled over into the human world and threatens its very existence.Against the 200-year-old mad doctor (now called Victor Helios) is a desperate and small team. One is Deucalion, the first of Helios' creations - born in murder, left for dead, the intervening years have worked many changes, leaving the monster more human and determined to unravel Helios' plot. Two humans work at his side - Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison. Much of their part in this novel is defensive. As the investigation progresses, Helios becomes aware of the threat to his kingdom, and O'Connor and Maddison find themselves in a struggle to find clues and survive a string of assassination attempts.The writing is a bit more simplistic than in the first volume, possibly due to the use of a different co-author. But even so the narrative runs smoothly. And the characterizations of the citizen's of Helios' dark utopia, the recreation of an almost gothic empire are excellence. Koontz understands that a horror story needs to be more than a catalog of violence to be a complete success. And he also understands the philosophical implications must arise from the story, not drive it. This is a story that can be read at several levels, and works equally well at all of them."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I was going along reading the book and it ended terrible, left too much hanging, you know you will have to buy the next book to wrap everything up."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Let me start by saying that I really liked the first one.

I didn't find it very interesting and found my mind drifting away throughout most of it. I think the thing I liked best about the first book in the series was learning more about the monster but in this book he's more of a secondary character in a cast full of secondary characters. Actually, when I think about it, the action seemed to be more of the main focus of the book than any of the characters and thus was the source of many of my issues with the book.

Anderson, was a fresh and invigorating SF/horror novel with genuinely intriguing ideas and a great set-up. This novel, however, seems frozen in time with hardly any forward progress at all. It's clearly a time-waster in the much larger story, and while it's a quick and easy read, it's a very poor follow-up. At the end of PRODIGAL SON the reader is ready for the big conflict between Dr. Frankenstein and his first creation, the creature now known as Deucalion. It finally does occur here, but not until the very end of the book, and the \\"showdown\\" is put off for another novel for no reason at all. There's a few snide comments passed between creator and creation and then...pffft.

These books of Koontz are like that.My other favorite Koontz book, out of the dozens he has written, is ONE DOOR AWAY FROM HEAVEN.Read the Frankenstein books. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"When I finished Book Two and saw the third, and final, installment isn't due out until Summer, 2006, I almost cursed....not quite, but almost. :) How can I possibly wait an entire year to find out if the world is destroyed by the ghastly New Race, if Frankenstein is finally killed, whether the monster-becoming human Deucalion finds permanent peace within himself at long last, and whether Carson and Michael retire as cops and open a toy store together, while still hoarding their high-caliber weapons? The loose ends are causing me significant agony! For readers who have not yet immersed themselves in Koontz's Frankenstein trilogy, you of course will not understand my angst. Therefore, allow me to invite you to share my pain by joining me, along with the multitude of other readers who are smitten with this trilogy, in reading one of Koontz's finest edge-of-your-seat thrillers.The story picks up where Book One left off....with Frankenstein's two-hundred year old monster, who now calls himself Deucalion (Doo-\`Cay-Lee-Un -- after the mythological Greek son of Prometheus who became the father of the renewed human race), plotting to destroy the eternally young Frankenstein, who now calls himself Victor Helios. The emotional tapestry woven between Deucalion and the other main characters provides a gripping backdrop to the upcoming Apocalypse between mankind (the Old Race) and Frankenstein's engineered super-creations (the New Race) who number in the thousands, have an insatiable desire to kill all humans in the most gruesome way possible, and are all going haywire in various and horrific fashion.I once again applaud Koontz's ability to draw me into each and every chapter....and then leave me hanging in breathless anticipation as he hops back and forth between the mini-plots of other characters. The only frustration I experienced during this unending sense of emotional foreplay was my overwhelming urge to read more about the often tender, poignant, haunted and sometimes brutal Deucalion....in this regard, Koontz's teasing left me frustrated. I fervently hope Deucalion plays a greater role in the final book, as he is indeed the Old Race's Champion, who should be paramount and center stage throughout the upcoming holocaust. My only other request would be that Koontz release Book Three no later than next week!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"With the Frankenstein series, Mr. Koontz has regained his niche for this genre of story telling.

The practice of sharing writing duties with a co-author, as seems to be the current trend, has certainly worked for Dean Koontz and Mr. Ed Gorman. I have liked the concept of taking a well-known story and putting their own twist on the story so as to show what might have happened to its original characters. While the first book in this series, \\"Prodigal Son\\", was good, I think that the second was even better. The first book was darker with minimal depth to the monsters and their activities involving the destruction of selected humans , and of the formation of a New Race to overthrow civilization. While the basic story line is trite, previously told in various alien-type stories of mutant organisms taking over the human body until the point of exploding from within its constraints of flesh, and of replacing various citizens with clones, the manner in which this story is conveyed, and our insight into the quirks and personalities of some of these \\"monsters\\" is what makes this second novel different. Even as we cringe while a creature formed in a tank, and now serving as his master's butler, gnaws off his fingers systematically, we smile at another who craves motherhood, and who believes herself capable of conception as has been promised by resident voodoo entities in modern day New Orleans, where the story takes place. The banter between the two cops (a stifled love interest between Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison ) is witty and funny. Their light-hearted banter helps the story retain a certain amount of levity that was not part of the first novel. Meanwhile, the original Frankenstein monster (sans his flat-footed, mechanical ambulation) appears in the novel as Deucalian, a creature bent on destroying his maker, but unable to do so based on his design. Teaming up with the two cops, Deucalian serves as coach in planning the destruction of Helios, his maker, and of the cloned progeny. I liked the continued story line, but felt that this novel ended too abruptly. I felt it would have been better to end the book as Carson, Michael, and Deucalian are plotting their next moves, and concluding that they will not all survive that particular armageddon. Instead, the story continues for several more pages and adds nothing in the form of a cliff hanger. But having said this, I must admit that I look forward to reading the finale in book three, and recommend this series."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I picked up this book on a lark. I'm a big Koontz fan from the beginning, but, like others, have strayed from reading due to work and home life. I was in an airport last week and wanted something to read on the way from Dallas back to D.C. I couldn't put the book down! When I got home, I continued to read, and finished the book the next night. Every page was a twist, every chapter a reason to read the next. I didn't read the first installment of this trilogy - I'm heading to the shore next week and it's the first thing I'm going to buy before I hit the beach. My family will learn to live without me until I finish that one........"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I would have to call book two-city of night a \\"binder\\". I would have to say that the first book-prodigal son was a great read! And could not wait for book two, however book two did not have that impact that was expected. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the story and felt that it was written with just one purpose-to build the anticpation of book three, that is why I called it a \\"binder\\". It was written not quite like the first, but provided readers with other characters and how \\"all hell is going to break loose\\". Even after finishing the book, I could not even imagine what the ending will be like in book three. I don't think that you can read book one then read book three, you need to go through book two to fully understand the final conclusion-I think. The only thing negative is that you have to wait almost another year for the final book! I might have to read book one and two again just to refresh my memory!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"This book is very good. Deucalion must be one of the most fascinating characters, and paired with Helios, the two create a very interesting conundrum: The human (Helios) as become a monster, while the monster (Deucalion) has learned what it means to be a human.So why three stars? Because other than seeing Carson, Michael and Deucalion preparing for the final showdown with Helios, very little happens in this book. It's interesting character development, but mere character development a book does not make. I need a plot, a climax, and a resolution, even if this is part of a three book series. The first book did it, why can't this one do it too? This one has very little plot, very little climax, and even less resolution, since everything apparently will come down to the next book.So as part of a series, this book is good. It gives you a deeper insight into the minds and the world of the main characters. However, as a stand alone book, it leaves something to be desired.I'd recommend waiting until the final book is out, then reading the final two installments together. It will be a much better read."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Koontz has abaondoned his readers with this series.

After I finished the first one, I was excited and ready to dig into the next book. I picked it up and read a little and then put it down again and did it all over again.Fianlly, I finished and I am disppointed in the book. Not as action packed and not as much history as the first. The first book gave more of a story and history of how the events came to pass, but this one has none of that. Very disppointing ending as well.I'm glad there is another book and hopefully it lives up to the first in the trilogy. Of course, you'll have to read this one in order to finish the series and know what is going on, so try and get through it even if it is tough."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed The Prodigal Son and put the series down for a time. From the moment I started reading City of Night, I felt that I had rekindled my relationship with old friends. The characters which were carried over from one book to the next felt true. The new ones were intriguing . I love the spiritual nature of this series and the tender way Dean exposes it."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I actualy ordered this book for my daughter who had all in the series but this one and got it as a gift to complete her set."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I didn't want to do it. That's what I thought when some friends foisted the first book in this series on me. But after beginning I didn't want to pause. The only thing I didn't like about these books was waiting for Koontz to get the next one out. He's such a tease with the it's &#34;Coming In...&#34;, but NO, it's &#34;Coming In...&#34;, and so on. I bought this copy as a gift.Even if you think, &#34;Frankenstein?, I don't read that stuff.&#34;, check it out. It'll hook ya. This is not Mary Shelley's or Mel Brooks's Frankenstein. The story comes from a sub-world difficult to place in historical perspective with 'modern' day New Orleans as it's backdrop whose citizens are unaware of their encroaching enslavement."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I like the second Frankenstein book by Koontz but I is a bit slow moving and seems to just set up the third book. This sets up the big plot and conflict that Victor is going to face, and we get to know the characters better in this book. It seems to be taking a very interesting turn and has held my attention very well. I wish there was a better ending to this because it just dropped off. It was like one book was written and when Koontz realized it was two long he ripped it in half and made two. I look forward to the third and hope to get a better ending next time."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"The City of Night - Frankenstein, Book 2 by Dean Koontz's was a 2010 Christmas gift.

If your looking for a good book this is the second in the Frankenstein series and well worth the time."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"This is a story I would rather read in one book as opposed to a series. The time it took to explain everything made the first half of the book a little slow. But other than that it was pretty good."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"This book started right where it left off. IF you liked the first, you'll like this one too. Here are the things I didn't paricularly like:Ducalion is in and out. Chapters go by when he isn't there.Next, He takes Arnie to Tebet in what seems like the same night he is back? Time issues there. I though Tebet was a long ways away.I didn't like the gone wrong entity. And I didn't like the garbage keepers of the New Race. They're like dogs.I thought that all the New Race people were cool because they're all messing up, they've all started to go wrong, their programs are flawed and Victor Helios's empire is breaking down fast. I love how Cindi wants a baby and believes in Voodoo. I hope Benny does something cool in the next book.I'm hoping that Ducalion gets his justice against Victor in the third book."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Greatly enjoyed the book (I've always been a Koontz fan). I read it while I was in Birmingham escaping Katrina. It was unusual to be reading about a story located in New Orleans while the storm was distroying the city, but the city will be back before the next installment of the story is out."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I loved the characters, action and story. I started reading and could not put the book down. But, in the end, I was severely disappointed because the book did not have a logical stopping point, it was like the clock turned to 5 pm and he said \\"quittin' time\\". I understand that this is part of a series, but even so, it should be able to stand on its own as a book. This is especially true since book 3 is not available for 9 months. Disappointing. (And, yes, I will read the third book when available -- it was a great read and full of imagination and fantasy -- would be much better to read it with the final book availalbe though.)"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"...from the previous book return and become more ordinary than before. The banter between the (Koontz formula) male and female detectives is weaker as is the dialogue in general. I had read that dialogue was an area in which Koontz was a master. After two full books I am still waiting for more than something longer lasting than the lightning in Deucalion's eyes. Even the publisher's teaser is stretched to the breaking point when it refers to the events in this book as Deucalion never actually meets the horror it implies. The padded plot is very noticeable in the inability of the sub-plots to do more than touch tangentially on the main plot without actually furthering the story. I'm not referring to the weak Erika bits, which are becoming boring excepting the \\"box\\" she discovers, but to the time spent on the serial killer from the first book and the tangential Randall Six sub that traversed, like it's subject, ho-scotch across two novels. Unlike Randall Six though, the sub plot never really reaches a meaningful destination. If these two books were editied down to one, A reader might still be ticked off at having to wait for the \\"second\\" book! Instead we now get to wait until next year for the third installment. Series and multi-part novels are all the rage in publishers, especially if they can attach a \\"big\\" name to it (I'm guessing that's Koontz here) and it is diluted reading for all but big bucks for them. The classic example might be the deluge of books with Ludlum's name on the outside but no Ludlum, sadly, on the inside. I'm actually angry that this concept for the extension of the Frankenstein novel was ever thought up by Koontz. If someone else had conceived and developed it the publishers would not have been so quick to turn it into a stretched out, watered down, padded up, cash cow. They would have made a lesser light than Koontz tighten it up. Instead, they traded on his name and may even encouraged the diulution. We could have had an epic worthy to take it's place on the shelf alongside Shelley's rather than this \\"marketeering\\" monster. Indeed, the story of how this concept became such a disaster might be more interesting reading than what is published here."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I very much enjoyed the first 2 books in this series and have been anxiously awaiting a release date for the 3rd and final book in this trilogy which was promised to us from Koontz in the \\"Summer of 2006\\"... Well, guess what? Now it's Summer 2006 and there has been NO NEW INFORMATION about the final book in this series. I would much rather have had a new \\"Frankenstein\\" instead of another \\"Odd Thomas\\" novel. What a disappointment for us fans. Come on Dean and Bantam Publishing, now that you've got us readers invested in 2/3rds of the trilogy give us some information about the final book. Jerks!!!"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"One of the blurbs about this book says it does not suffer from Second in the Series Doldrums, or something like that; well, it does. The entire book, over 450 pages, covers a few hours of activity and does very little up to the final few pages of advancing the plot.I gave the first in the series 4 stars because I liked it and liked the idea. This one gets 3 stars because it isn't very interesting and fails to meet the promise of the first volume.Strangely the 3rd in the series did not, apparently, come out last year as promised.

However, from the plot, characters, and stytle of this one, it is obvious that he did not write it.The story line (what little there is) is shallow, the characters very predictable, and the little side jokes very juvenile.With no pun intended, Dean, you really need to get yourself a better ghost writer than the character who did this one."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I usually acquire my books from the VA library at the hospital. They have a nice policy of read one, leave one. I would never actually purchase a koontz book anymore unless, like in this case, I needed to pad my purchase amount to qualify for the free shipping. Hence, this book only cost me around $2.00 and so far, through chapter five, it sucks. Don't buy it. Check it out at a library or find it at a yard sale or used book store.

While I am looking forward to the next installment, and am interested in what happens to the characters, I can't help wondering if they would be \\"better\\" if Mr Koontz wrote them alone. The normal Koontz-ian character development doesn't seem as thorough, and the build-up of suspense is not as acute."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Koontz's novels are very uneven, some are very good and some are very bad.

Much better than the first book."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"Not since Silence of the Lambs has a horror story come to life as it has in this series of books. The development of the characters and there inter actions keep you on the edge of your chair. I have listened to the two unabrifged boods twice and each time have found something new each time.

It almost seems surreal to be reading about the impending downfall of New Orleans, when it has already been devastated by Katrina. I wonder if that will have any impact on the finale of the book?This book's storyline just isn't as interesting, and there were more dull parts in this edition, than it's predecessor. For example, Randall Six was far less interesting than Roy Pribeaux.This book was far more horrific in its descriptive design, as there are parts of the book that literally sent chills down my spine.Can't wait to read the 3rd and final part of this series."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"The second segment of this Dean Koontz begins to show Victor starting to loose his control of his zombies.The intensity is there and all the characters are coming togetherwith their strengths and weaknesses.I am looking forward to book three."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"When I first started this series I thought Frankenstein, what else can they write about him!

While not as overall satisfying as its predecessor, PRODIGAL SON, CITY OF NIGHT nevertheless keeps the pace fast and furious, with an interesting mixture of Koontz's usual upbeat atmosphere with the darker edge of Gorman's input. The Frankenstein \\"Monster\\" is back, as are Carson and Michael, the heroic cops; the autistic Randal Six; Erika 5, who this time is as baffling as she is naive; and assorted other characters, most of them part of Dr. Helios' (Frankenstein) New Race. With a lot of bloodletting and some intentionally humorous scenarios, CITY OF NIGHT doesn't let the reader down, and makes one anxious to see how the whole thing resolves in the final part of the trilogy, due out in early 2006."},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","review":"I THOROUGHLY ENJOY DEAN KOONTZ NOVELS ANYWAY BUT HE HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF WITH THE FRANKENSTEIN TRILOGY.

But he never takes himself too seriously.This highly readable book is filled with colorful, and often humorous, stories of the author's own rich experience practicing the paradoxical leadership that is necessary to effectively lead today's more federated, adaptive and highly connected organizations.After an interesting survey of leadership theories and how they relate, or don't relate, to the changes in organizations over the past century, Dr. Robinson zeroes in on the essential traits of 21st-century leaders: paradoxical, secure, inspiring, communicative, virtuous and driven. He ends the book with two helpful chapters on how leaders can successfully change their leadership styles to adopt some of these traits.The title hints at what sets the book, and Dr. Robinson's vision of leadership, apart: Leaders succeed when they connect with the mission and the people at the heart of their organizations and when they join with those they lead in moving the organization forward rather than insisting on being out front or above."},{"Title":"Leading People from the MIddle: The Universal Mission of Heart and Mind","review":"Bill Robinsons book on leading from the middle puts into perspective the real spiritual, moral, and ethical attributes of what a good leader is all about. It is refreshing to read a book that blends the Christian faith with everyday life.

This book is the single most useless source on the subject in print today. Bryant(sorry I don't feel people who dub themselves bishop deserve the title) is an amatuer who should consider the help of a qualified psychologist(for himself not his patients). He sees demons in literally every thing from Pac Man to Junk food. If you want reliable information see Ed and Lorraine Warren, John Zaffis, Father Gabrielle Armoth, or Malachi Martin. These are actual experts on the matter who know the difference between possession and mental illness. Bryant seems to think exorcism is the worlds perfect cure all. Its not and the bible tells you that."},{"Title":"Manual on Demonology: Diary of an Exorcist","review":"I have read the book and have personaly been to one of Bishops bryants prayer deliverence services.Let me tell you this man is truly a man of God you see the LORD Jesus using him in the casting out of demons and i myself am i product of his ministy my life has been better for it.And all you people writing these bad reviews let me give you this hint: SPEAK THAT WHICH YOU KNOW AND TESTIFY TO THAT WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN.I've seen the miracles I've seen demons being cast out first hand this is a very real ministry. also he has documentry that just came out in April of 2006 that will air on tv soon so look out for that Be Blessed always"},{"Title":"Manual on Demonology: Diary of an Exorcist","review":"This book is a great practical book on casting out demons,it also lists real cases where people have been struggling and suffering because demons were in control in their bodies. Many were taught and/or believe that these problems are character flaws, habits, emotional and mental conditions. Psychiatrist and those of the behavior sciences has taught this as well. And as long as one believe that these things are of the natural man alone and the sinful flesh and not demons working in the mind, heart and body of mankind you will always be deceived by satan and his demons. But if you believe that most of these things are originated with satan and his demonic host then perhaps if you seek out someone that is anointed by God to cast out demons.You too can be free in the name of Jesus. There are other books here on Amazon that I recommend as well:Books by Win Worely and Frank and Ida Mae Hammond and any other book on the subject as well. I deem this book as a great practical study. As I mention above most things, because as the author states in his manual some thing or medical and not demonic, that is why sometimes for deliverance and healing to take place sometimes a demon or demons are cast out and sometime a prayer for healing instead of casting out is performed. Please read the book and be blessed and informed. I was highly skeptical when I first heard of the ministry of Bishop Bryant, but God has opened my understanding to the truth of these things through this very book and other teachings of his. Pray before you read and ask God in the name of Jesus for wisdom. God Bless you all. Pastor, James E. Bannister."},{"Title":"Manual on Demonology: Diary of an Exorcist","review":"There is too much negativity in the world already. I have nothing bad to say about this book because only a certain kind of Christian can understand what the writer is trying to convey. There is a such thing as mind battles and humans are too blind to see it. Our world thinks that negative emotions are a normal part of life, but it is not. What got my attention from this book is the focus on lust because I have felt bondage to it and I've never thought that it was a bad spirit until reading some of the pages. When I first picked up the book it looked like some allegory of words and kind of silly. But people do not understand the importance of the book and that demons are not what you see in hollywood movies. Our society and world is truly full of perversion and people think that images do not harm, but they do. This is the ultimate manual on how to wake up and be delivered from negative forces in these last days."},{"Title":"Manual on Demonology: Diary of an Exorcist","review":"For those who truly do not understand how Jesus taught, I suggest you pray before getting this book or else you may not understand the format that this book is written in. When you read Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John you learn that Christ Taught by example, and he used parables and visuals to teach those whom he would meet. He never said this is example A, and these are examples A1, A2, and A3 that are associated with A.It's very obvious that this book is extremely anointed so much so that Satan will use someone who is ignorant of how spirits operate in the body, to spew forth anything negative to deter those who may truly be blessed by it and set free. I encourage anyone who is seeking knowledge of the inner working of spirits and they work together to get this book and get \\"Who's in your Body with you\\" I believe they should be read together.For me this is an awesome study guide to what is truly happening to us as go's children on this earth. We are here for the Glory of the Lord, and must be girded up everyday for spiritual warfare in order to for fill his purpose in our lives.We have so many scientist and doctors who are passing out medical analyses, and medical terms, and quick fix medications to explain the way people behave. We often pass off our emotions to be apart of our character, or the reasons why we do things and treat each other, as it \\"just being the way we were brought up.\\"If you are truly are seeking understanding, I again implore you to pray before getting this book to ask the father if this is right for you. I also pray that you will pray after every chapter you read asking God to give you a spirit of discernment and wisdom as to what is going on inside of you and seek help in receiving the healing power of deliverance. You don't have to seek our Bishop Bryant himself, but seek someone who is gifted in that area as a deliverance minister."},{"Title":"Folktales of the Amur: Stories from the Russian Far East","review":"I first saw this book in Russian years ago and it was a jewel that I couldn't read but the drawings were so exquisite, I loved it anyway.

My 6 year old son was completely taken by our nightly reading of them and by the wonderfully detailed illustrations done by Gennady Pavlishin. Christian parents beware: these are pagan stories that provide opportunities to discuss Christian virtues by their presence or by their complete absence. A couple of the tales were brutal enough to warrant just a bit of editing. The very last story, I believe, is something of an allegory (but deeply concealed as such) of Christianity coming to these peoples of the Amur. Overall, a unique and surprisingly positive reading adventure."},{"Title":"Folktales of the Amur: Stories from the Russian Far East","review":"This is a book of some unique, wonderfully illustrated fairy tales originating from the Nanai people of the Amur region of East Asia. Although the book is constructed as if it's intended for children, lots of the stories involve killing animals and often other people (in fact, in one story the skin of an evil person is made into boots!), so don't consider this as Disney-level child-friendly. But I also just want to clarify that this book was originally put together by Soviet Russians in the 1970s, and there is a very slight pro-Soviet worldview propagated in the tales. This is the most obvious in the very last tale, \\"Kile Bamba and the Loche Bogatyr,\\" in which a powerful white Russian dispels the Nanai's shamanistic beliefs and helps a Nanai village overthrow an evil Chinese merchant."},{"Title":"A Sierra Club Naturalist's Guide to the North Woods of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota (Sierra Club Naturalist's Guides)","review":"When I launched into my MS field work in northeastern Minnesota, I was completely unfamiliar with the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence transitional forest ecosystem, and therefore not a little unprepared! Fortunate indeed that I stumbled onto this little treasure.Like all Sierra Club Naturalist's Guides, &quot;The North Woods&quot; starts with geology and soils, then ventures into plants, animals, and ecosystem structure. Simple photographs and line drawings are provided for some of the most common and especially important plant and animal species. If you're looking for a conventional field guide, however, this ain't it. Instead, &quot;The North Woods&quot; is a guide to communities and ecosystems. An excellent investment, and next to Heinselmann's &quot;Boundary Waters&quot; one of my favorites. -William Adair, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Utah State University"},{"Title":"A Sierra Club Naturalist's Guide to the North Woods of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota (Sierra Club Naturalist's Guides)","review":"This was a gift for my husband.

It needs no defense."},{"Title":"The God who loves","review":"then God is not omni benevolent. This book is nothing more than MacArthur's attempt to have his cake and eat it too. On the one hand he wants to uphold the traditional Reformed idea that God has an elected people that He loves with a special and unconditional love. Yet, on the other hand MacArthur wants to believe that God loves the non-elect as well. MacArthur argues for this by saying that God possesses two types of love: a general and non-saving love, which he gives to all, and a special and saving love He displays only towards the elect. In my opinion there seems to be a disturbing trend taking place in Reformed apologetics these days. Since they can't conform all of Scripture to their teachings, they invent new ideas and doctrines to attempt to compensate for those deficiencies and weaknesses. First, many have begun to argue for the concept that God has two wills, and that God's desire to save all men only pertains to God's first will, which is really not salvific at all. This has been in direct response to criticisms that have demonstrated that the usual Calvinist approach of saying all men means all types of men is not satisfactory and does not make sense of all the Scriptures.Now MacArthur has added another element to the argument by saying that God has two types of love. Does anyone else see the pattern here? First God has two wills and now he commands two types of love as well. I can understand MacArthur's reasoning for writing this book since he desires to stem the tide of young and zealous Reformed initiates who argue that God does not love the reprobate, but in fact hates them. They argue for this from Scripture passages such as Romans 9:13, which they believe validates the idea that God hates the non-elect. Yet, instead of accepting the obvious MacArthur has chosen to develop his own unique and unhistorical idea. When the Scripture speaks of God's love for all mankind it always uses the Greek word agape and never gives any hint of a differentiation. In the gospel of Mark, Jesus loved the rich young ruler even though he didn't accept Christ's message. Are we honestly supposed to believe that the agape spoken of there is some ulterior form of love? I and many others do not believe that to be the case. Moreover, Jesus commands us to love our enemies and do well to those who hate and despise us. Is God calling us to do something that He Himself will not do? Again, I seriously doubt this is the caseFinally, I found many of MacArthur's arguments to be unconvincing. He says that he is willing to accept God's love for the non-elect as a love that is calling them to repentance, giving them sufficient grace, and showering them with earthly blessings, but his argument breaks down when one examines his beliefs. Since MarArthur holds to the traditional Reformed idea of Total Depravity, he believes men are corpses are sin, completely unresponsive, oblivious to the things of God, and unable to do a thing. Now, I wouldn't walk up to a corpse tell him I love him and plead with him to repent because that is just ludicrous. Therefore, I doubt the all-wise omnipotent ruler of the universe would do the same to men that are dead in sin since He is infinitely smarter than humans and knows this will accomplish nothing. MacArthur's view of total depravity completely undercuts his arguments for God's love. If you are really serious about studying and understanding God's love for all of us, then read the Bible and only pick up this book after previous study."},{"Title":"Campaign contributions by political parties: ideology vs. winning.: An article from: Atlantic Economic Journal","review":"This article doesn't include the referenced tables.

There are many worked examples, but no exercises for student practice at the end of the chapters. I have always considered the presence of exercises to be a necessary precondition for me to consider a book for adoption.All of the fundamental concepts that I cover are present and well explained. If the author had included exercises and solutions, then it is quite likely that I would have adopted it for my course in basic statistics."},{"Title":"My Trouble is My English: Asian Students and the American Dream","review":"The first chapter of this book offers a dual lens of this Chineseauthor struggling to comprehend how her American peersread literature. For example, they want to discuss minorthemes or political issues instead of plot. Later, when theauthor enrolls in a graduate school of education program,her lens broadens more, as she observes another philosophyof teaching which emphasizes students making their own meaningbased on experiences and feelings, rather than stressing the sexualityof the characters in the book, or other seemingly irrelevant issues.Fu's observations offer American readers much insight into some of the problemsoften found in schools. Her book should be read by teachers and advancedstudents as a means to learn more about how American culture affects learnerswho are not native, as well as ones who are.My only criticism is that the subsequent chapters sometimes seemed redundant.They focus on Fu's study of four ESL students from Laos, who are often marginalizedby their silence. This is an important book, one I predict will be widely read and discussedin the education field."},{"Title":"My Trouble is My English: Asian Students and the American Dream","review":"I read this book as a course requirement, and I must say, it's very impressive. This ethnography ought to be read by all educators. Not only is it very beautifully written, but it also sheds light on the unique experience of students with different cultural backgrounds and learning styles. What is truly groundbreaking about this book is that the author took the time to not only know the children's challenges as students, but she took the time to really know them as individuals with real hopes and dreams, who must find a balance between Asian and American values and culture. I feel fortunate to have been given such lucid insight into this rich culture from the account of these students' experiences. This is an enlightening book, and it will make you think about what is actually going on in our education system, and from within, how to truly help minority students succeed.

At first I thought it must be written just for sociological college classes, but apparently its not.That doesn't take away the enjoyment or the quality of the book however. The Author has done tons of solid research , including going through and listening to almost every recording Jim Jones ever made. Jones was quite the speaker so that must have been a gargantuan task in itself.What I enjoyed most though and what I have to really commend the Author for is that he proves that Jim Jones and The Peoples Temple had a consistent,sophisticated , cohesive theology and a rich world view.I think most people overlook that preferring instead to believe that the Temple was a group of naive people who believed a bunch of disjointed razzmatazz that Jones picked out of the air.This book explores and analyzes The Peoples Temple theology and few other books have ever done that.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what the members of The Peoples Temple believed, lived for and what some of them willingly died for."},{"Title":"Salvation and Suicide: An Interpretation of Jim Jones, the Peoples Temple, and Jonestown (Religion in North America)","review":"A somewhat difficult read due to the author's extensive use of scholarly sociological terminology; yet, the book is a welcome alternative to the spate of highly emotional and/or polemic treatises against Jim Jones and the Jonestown phenomenon. The author also provides intriguing critiques of the standard pop-cultural tendency to demonize and ostracize the participants of the Jonestown drama and other alternative religious movements."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"I have read a few Wicca text's and I find it hard to finish the books due to depth of the information.

It is written in a generic form that allows the reader to choose their own path and system of wicca. This book describes everything a beginner needs to know about practicing wicca. The down side of this book is that it is basically a rehash of everything solitary from Mr. Buckland's books. If you are a student of wicca and looking for a book with substance, this is not the book for you. This is all in all a very basic book about wicca with no position on traditions, that's the readers decision."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"After reading this totally redundant offering, you have to ask yourself, \\"Is Ray Buckland, one of the most celebrated Wiccan authors, hurting for money?\\" This book really had a hard time keeping my interest. It's got a pretty cover and that's about it as far as I'm concerned.This is just a shortened form of his classic big blue covered \\"Compleat Book of Witchcraft\\" adopted for a singular individual. Whoopee. Definitely NOT worth the price listed in my opinion!The chapters on Magic were culled from his previous works such as \\"Practical Color Magic\\" and his candle magic book. Gods Ray, with all your years of practice and your lifetime of study, can't you offer the Pagan community something more to chew on than this pathetic piece of rehashed material???This shows me that even big name authors lack the balls to delve deeper into the mysteries OR are too damn stingy to share anything deeper than surface knowledge that can be found anywhere else. For instance both Marian Green and Scotty Cunningham both wrote excellent books on the solitary path years ago. Fine time for Mr.Ray to jump on the bandwagon long after the fact.All in all, I rate this book 1 star out of a possible 5 and I'm being MORE than fair here. If I didn't respect Mr. Buckland so much, I'd be calling for him to be drawn and quartered. Save your money and spend it elsewhere. If you already bought this book, give it away to some newbie."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"I have about 60 wicca books but this by far is the best.

Then I got into Aleister Crowley. I found out Wicca was founded by one of Crowley's henchmen and started reading books on witchcraft. I liked this book I got it it was the new Ray Buckland book and had a cool cover. This book again restated that I was practicing it correctly, especially the altar. A fine starting point for a well respected author."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"This is probably one of the best Wicca 101 books that I have read. I had mixed emotions about the first chapter of the book. Buckland talks about TV witches and calls some questionable historical characters as possible witches. But then I proceeded to read the following chapters and I realized that the first chapter must be read without taking it seriously. I think what Buckland attempts is to reach the new wanna-be practitioner on a level that she/he can understand. The rest of the book is filled with plenty of content (no fluffy-bunny Wicca). The book has a good overview of Wicca (there is less focus on magic than in most of Wicca 101 books comming out these days) including rituals, Esbats, rites of passage, Sabbats, Divination, Healing, Prayer and Meditation, and Development. He also includes appendices of magical terms, magical properties of herbs, magical properties of stones, and magical alphabets. They are shallow overviews but more than I have found in many Wicca 101 books and enough for a begginer to decide if they wish to persue any of the topics with deeper study. I would give this book a 4.5 if I could because it is not perfect but it is a great introductory book to Wicca 101 and especially beggining solitary practice for someone who has never been involved with a coven."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"Amongst Wiccans today, Raymond Buckland needs no introduction, as he can fairly be called &quot;the Father of modern Witchcraft in America&quot;. He is the author of many books, this one turning his attention to the situation of the solitary Wiccan, that is: one who is not a member of any coven. He is careful to point out that the path of the solitary Witch is far older than that of coven Witches, and it is one that is both justifiable and fully legitimate. Thus the book is affirming and thoughtfully helpful in the various facets of Wiccan practice that are presented for the Solitary. I particularly enjoyed his debunking of a number of supposed Wiccan &quot;dogmas&quot; and his generally liberating &quot;take&quot; on the Faith and Practice. Given his background in the Garderian Tradition of Wicca(and his age), his flexible approach here was very refreshing. There are also several very good appendices and a bibliography to take the reader further and deeper into the Craft. With his reputation, and the book's quality, this volume by Buckland should be read by every solitary Wiccan!"},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"Long time readers of the Journal will remember that I have a really soft spot in my heart for Raymond Buckland, mainly because he's the founder of my tradition of Wicca. I have a lot to thank him for and a lot to credit him for.Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that he can do no wrong. But I do believe that he gets it right more often than not.This book, however, tends to be a rehash of many of his other books. The only thing that sets this one apart is that it is developed specifically for those who are solitary.All the information in this book has been published before in books such as The Tree and Buckland's Complete Guide to Witchcraft. However, those books, while being excellent sources of information, tend to be centered for those who are going toward covens. This book is modified specifically for those who will be practicing in their own backyards without others to practice with them.I'm giving this a really high score since it has a lot of good information for you and is something that solitary practitioners should have in their library. But I'm also going to advise you all that if you have The Tree and Buckland's Complete Guide to Witchcraft you may want to skip purchasing this unless you have the extra money.I think that this is the logical next step to purchase after Cunningham's books \\"Living Wicca\\" and \\"Wicca, a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\". If those are your only exposure to solitary practice, then you need to buy this book."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"This is one of the first books I picked up to learn about Wiccan spirituality.

However, if you have, they are really on the same level. I had not, I'm almost embarrassed to admit, yet read anything by Buckland and he is one of the greats in on our path. So, this was my first foray. I enjoyed his writing style, but it was not anything I had not read elsewhere. He does get a more involved in details and specific symbolism than Cunningham's book. I will keep this one on my shelf for the 'magical squares' in use in amulets."},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"I treasure Mr. Raymond Buckland's WICCA FOR ONE book, and I have found it to be such a useful guide, to all issues involving witchcraft, that I currently have forty-five bookmark tabs inserted throughout my copy of this most helpful book. Buckland skillfully navigates the reader through an expansive landscape of occult topics, but Buckland's perspective, his clarity of vision, on the genesis and nature of Wicca is a steady compass ensuring the reader is never at risk of becoming confused or lost. His justification of the solitary witch is satisfying, and the numerous tables contained in the appendices are sure useful. I salute you, Mr. Buckland!"},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"A litttle more detailed that Scott Cunningham's version but good all the same.For a beginner I would suggest Cunningham but this one is perfect for a practitioner's library!"},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","review":"The book is well presented and informative.

It was the culmination of a 3-day spiritual journey. My travels took me to New Orleans to Vidalia. I was looking for somethin to read on the return flight home and this book drew my attention. I'm so glad I bought it. Since that time, I have recommended it to several friends who had somehow forgotten or never knew, that God truly does speak to us-- if we take the time to listen. These were friends were \\"mature\\" by all Earthy standards yet they, like so many others, had not taken the time to develop a reigning ear for God. A couple of associate had not even bothered to develop a relationship with God and didn't realize just how long and how much, He had been doing to get their attention. I was told this book helped them learn how important it is to create an environment where we can hear from God. I highly recommend this book as a \\"must-read\\" for who wonder if God speaks to us. For me, this book was confirmation that the trip I took that year was indeed a spiritual journey and a lesson about the joy we experience when we learn to listen to God."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"Joyce Meyer really is an excellent teacher. This book teaches us that we can hear from God, and we can do so in a variety of ways. Many people, even Christians, don't believe this, but it is the truth. Sometimes we just need help knowing how to \\"hear\\". This book will help you to open your self up to recieve the counsel of the Lord. A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"For most of us, if we were honest, often times when it comes to hearing from God, He is really the last person we want to hear from. Why? Because sometimes we don't want to hear what God has to say and we want to do our own thing. To further complicate matters, many of us may not know how to discern God's voice at all. In addition, listening for and to God, as well as obedience, is central to the believer's walk of faith. Meyer provides practical and sound teaching on the many ways God speaks to us and how we can learn to discern the way He speaks. Don't go through life missing God's divine plan for your life. Learn how to hear God's voice and you will have the grace of God that brings freedom and restoration. \\"Be still and know that He is God.\\"Highly- recommended.***** Submitted by M. Lorraine for www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com The GOOD GIRL Book Club"},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"'How to Hear from God' gives great spiritual insight to our personal relationship with God. It shares how God speaks to us through many ways in our lives, and we must be willing to hear by being obedient to do His will so we do not loose the ability to hear His voice in our lives.The book has scripture through each and every two pages and teaching and personal experiences. It is written like a conversation someone would have with a friend who really cared about someones spiritual growth. It is not in the style of a text book, even with all the scriptures throughout it.If you want to know how much you can personally hear from God ~ read this book."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"It's utterly amazing how Joyce Meyer gathered her thoughts and her experiences together so well and trancends all that information into such a well-written book about how we can hear from God Himself. It's obvious that God was guiding her when she did this project and I have no doubts that God really wanted her to write this book for us.As an advertising copywriter, I loved how the book was put together. It's written in simple, everyday english much like a conversation between 2 people. When you read every page, it is as if Joyce Meyer is giving you a private counsel on how to reach out to God. And it is within the pages of this book that God spoke out to me (barely into the end of the first chapter in fact). I was touched and overwhelmed by His presence and His power. And when I finally finished reading this book, I now have a much clearer picture what God expects of me and how I can easily communicate with Him.A very insightful and enlightening book that transports the reader into a realm of self-discovery and self-realization. And at the end of the book, your journey to understand God better will be fulfilled. God wanted me to read this book and I'm sure He will touch you in remarkable ways if you open your heart and read it as well."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"I purchased this book trying to figure out what Meyer would say. As I started to read it I realized that there are a lot of things in my life that I put before God. Hence why I would not be listening. I think this book explains how to listen to God. Joyce Meyer writes her books in such a way that you know you are being taught God's Word in a simple easy to understand way. I would reccomend any of her books."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"This books touches on the many ways God speaks. A casual read of this book will not yield the best benefits, one must read and seek explanation by the Word of God for fullest effect."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"I had an opportunity to read nearly half way through the book (at the time of this comment) and complete the questions at the end of each chapter in the workbook, and have highly recommended this book to many others to purchase. Joyce has touched on a lot of key issues in this book that we take for granted and lose sight of through our hectic days of life. This book helps to bring you back to the basics to allow God to speak to us with a clear mind and heart. The workbook is designed for you to read each given scripture from the bible and answer the question based on your understanding. You will have Joyce's answers in the back to help guide you if you didn't understand the meaning of the scripture. It also shows you the many ways God communicates with us and how to rely on God as our main source and let Him guide our way. I highly recommend this book for everyone to learn how to receive God's best for you."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"After reading several of Joyce Meyers books. This one was very interesting. I love to work with the hardback, the study guide and my Life Application KJV Bible. I love the way the three connect. Two phrases that caught my interest were, \\"Ask God to open your ears and sanctify them so you can be sensitive to His voice,\\" and \\"We must learn to listen, for it is impossible to hear without listening.\\"When we take time to pray and listen for guidance & direction from God, we must realize that He speaks in many ways. We need to learn how to listen with a servants heart and an attentive ear.

I often have heard about people hearing from God, and I never understood what they were talking about. This easy to read, direct and \\"to the point\\", and highly informative book taught me everything I needed to know to trust myself in knowing when I am hearing from God. And that knowledge has greatly enhanced my relationship w/Him. I am so grateful to Joyce Meyer for teaching me how to have a friend in God."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"\\"How to Hear from God\\" is written in a conversational style. Joyce lovingly teaches us, relating to many of her own experiences throughout her walk with God. She has provided an abundance of Scriptures to be studied in-depth within this context.This book is systematically broken into two parts - Part 1: Learning to Listen; and Part 2: Learning to Obey. It shows us what we may be missing in our daily communication, or in our attempt to communicate with God. Many times we talk to God, but we may be failing to hear His answers.Joyce points out the various ways we can hear from God which include these but not limited to: His Word, nature, people, circumstances, peace, wisdom, supernatural intervention, dreams, visions, and \`inner witness'. Part 1 of the book is where these ways are covered extensively. Joyce also places strong emphasis on personal relationship with God and knowing His voice, or we may risk falling back to our old lives.It is important to know that knowing how to listen to God is not complete - we must also obey. This is where Part 2 presses on. By obeying, we will be sure not to miss out God's divine plan for our lives. Joyce gives several examples of obedience, one of which is Abraham. God gave him direction, one step at a time and he obeyed quickly even though he was not sure of the next steps. He placed complete trust in God during uncertainties and as a result, he was greatly blessed. Obeying is not always easy as it often requires sacrifice and perseverance. Therefore, trusting God, praying and confessing His Word in our situations can never be undermined. Faith requires action. The book also dedicates a chapter on hindrances to hearing God: religious ideas, hard-heartedness, worldly viewpoint, unforgiveness, and legalism.It is worth noting that in each chapter, important points stand out from the main text, further reinforcing what we have just read. Some of them are as follows:- We cannot operate properly in faith if we have a guilty conscience- God is not interested in part-time obedience- If we are unwilling to hear in one area, we may be unable to hear in others- God is not obligated to finish anything He didn't originate- He will direct your path one step at a time\\"Questions for Discussion\\" at the end of every chapter encourages us to ponder and reflect. This searching process helps us to apply the answers to our individual lives with our unique set of circumstances. This is not a book for casual reading - it is one that requires study with the Bible - if you are truly serious about hearing from Him."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"The book was informative, as well as, a reminder of things that I already know, especially the note on having a relationship with GOD. I have so many life challenges right now that require wisdom and good decisions. This book helped me to know the many ways GOD answers and in seeking GOD, don't make hasty decisions. I really liked the chapter on \\"God Opens and Shuts Doors of Opportunity\\". I also could relate to \\"being at peace\\" after making a decision. I have experienced peace in past decisions and that's one of the things I'll focus on during my present challenges."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"I really love this book (and love the audiobook even more - because Joyce Meyer really gets the point across with her great personality)I'm not even a Christian and I love this book.

A must read if you are sincere about your spiritual growth."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"So many people want to be able to hear from God, but are not sure how to hear His voice. Joyce Meyer is a fabulous teacher! She breaks it down simply and backs it all up with scripture throughout -- nearly on every page. I have underlined so many things in this book that I think there is writing on nearly every page too. God is speaking to us all the time, but too often we are too busy to be able to hear. By understanding all the different ways that God speaks, it becomes easier to hear Him (through scripture, concious thoughts, prayer, words from others, etc.). Joyce also shares some of the hindrances in our lives to hearing from God. With her wonderful wit and bold examples of her own life of how she's messed up, she helps the reader see that hearing from God is attainable for anyone. I would highly recommend reading this book as a Women's Bible Study. It is so much richer to share experiences with each other about how God speaks to each of us differently and it was so encouraging to hear all the stories about how He works in each person's life around us.I read this book with a group of about 30 women. We found that it worked well in a 6 week session (Kick off session to pass out books -- then 5 weeks of study and discussion: Chapters 1 - 3, 4 - 6, 7 - 9, 10-12 and 13-14 with a final party.)We found that it was helpful to summarize the learning each week in a big group and then break into three separate small groups to discuss the individual questions at the end of the chapter. It was truly a special study. We learned so much, grew into a deeper relationship with God and formed such special friendships along the way. During the course of the study, it was truly amazing to see all the different ways that God spoke to each of us! I would highly recommend it for either reading by yourself to strengthen your personal walk with God or for really rich content for a Bible Study. I don't think you will be disappointed!"},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"Seems like a great deal, I was paying 37.00 a month in rental fees for my sons band class totalking 750.00 in pay out.

God brought me back to Him through power seven years ago after drifting into deep sin and exploring other religions such as Buddhism for years, but I missed hearing from God in the beautiful communion we used to share. Reading this book helped me come back to the place of sweet communion with Christ I longed for so much."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"If having trouble with this, read and learn. She gets to the heart of how we hear from God--many varied and different ways. Another good book by Joyce."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"In the introduction to this book (one of the top-ten best selling religious books of 2003), author Joyce Meyer says, \\"Learning to hear from God and be led by the Holy Spirit is very exciting. God wants to speak to us about the plan He has for our lives. His plan is a good plan, but we are in danger of missing it if we don't learn how to listen to and obey God's voice.\\" (Page vii). This book is Meyer's way of helping the reader learn how to do both.In describing ways of listening to God, Meyer lists many ways in which God speaks to us. Many are ways that we might think of readily, such as through the Bible and prayer. But she has a much longer list of ways that God makes God's desires known to us, from dreams and visions to the wise counsel of others, and does not fail to mention the world around us as a communicator of God's will.Obedience is the visible sign that we hear, love and trust God, and Meyer has a number of insights for Christians who are long on facts but short on respecting what God requires. In fact, it is in this area that Meyer's work shines. For example, there is an excellent section on forgiveness. She says, \\"A woman once share with me that she asked God to give her direction concerning what God wanted her to do. He clearly put in her heart that He wanted her to forgive her sister of an offence.... Over a period of two years, every time she asked for guidance...He gently reminded her, \`I want you to forgive your sister.' Finally, she realized that she would never grow spiritually if she didn't do the last thing God had told her to do.\\" (Page 15). The concept of being disciplined in reading the Word and in prayer, as well as in putting what we hear into practice, is what the book is all about. In fact, its motto might be, as Meyer states: \\"Pray. And obey. Pray. And obey\\".This is intended to be a deeply personal book; by this I mean that the author invites the reader to read, absorb and find spiritual renewal and growth in so doing. Yes, there are questions for discussion at the end of each chapter, so it would also work as a small group study, but in reality, the questions are for the individual reader to ponder. As is the whole book.Joyce Meyer is a popular evangelist and speaker, known for her \\"Life in the Word\\" broadcasts. Joyce Meyer's book is a wonderful encouragement to your faith. If you read it, I believe it will have a rewarding and renewing impact upon your faith journey.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"Anyone who knows Joyce Meyers knows what an excellent teacher she is and this book holds true to that.This is a easy to read book with a lot of information on different ways to hear Gods voice. I would recommend it to everyone no matter what denomination you are. Its not about denomination anyway, its about knowing God. We all need a personal relationship with the Lord and to know His voice."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"I reviewed the audio version for MyShelf.Com.Meyer combines points from her sermons. Her goal is to show Christians how to hear from God, what to expect, and the blessings in so. She talks about hearing from God in various ways, including one's thoughts, the words of others, and even dreams, giving various examples throughout the book.Anyone looking to be a better person in their walk with God should pick up all Joyce Myer's books. Meyer speaks to men and woman in all walks of life. I once heard Queen Latifia--of music and movie fame--mention on TV that she was reading one of Meyer's books for personal improvement. How cool is that!The author narrates the audio version. Although not as dramatic as in her meetings, she still gets all her points across."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"Joyce Meyer is awesome as always. I started reading her books over 2 years ago when I was having trouble with panic attacks. The first book I read of Meyer was \\"Be Anxious For Nothing.\\" What makes her books so good is that she talks about her own past experiences and how she overcame sexual abuse by her father when she was growing up. Everything Joyce talks about in her books; she backs up with the word of God found in the Holy Bible. What is so convenient is being able to listen to the book when you're getting ready for work or when you're in the car driving. This book teaches you about studying the Bible and ultimately knowing the word of God so that when God is speaking to you; you will be able to discern his voice."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"This was one of the most powerful books I have ever read. Many of us refer to that \\"little voice\\" inside but even when we hear it, it can be confusing to recognize - Was that really God? Or is that me? How do I know? Joyce walks you through a myriad of ways that God speaks to his people. And she duly backs up each area with scripture. This is an eye opening and extremely powerful workbook for new and seasoned believers alike. I highly recommend it for anyone desiring to walk closer with God."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"You refer to this book as \\"Mindless Dribble.\\" You are certainly entitled to your opinion. However, I feel that the grounds on which you based your opinion are flawed.Ms. Meyer never tells one to look anywhere other than the \\"Word\\" to find God. In this book she simply shows us what we may be missing in our daily communication with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Her writing is all biblically based. I agree that we should all live by the Word. However, do you not pray? Do you not \\"Talk\\" to God? I know I do. Ms. Meyer simply shows how we may be failing to hear his answers.this book has been immensely helpful in my daily life.Please give it another read."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"This book was excellent and a must read for all Christians. Most pastors and churches do not teach of the Holy Spirit and do not tell you that He is desperately needed in your life. That is why so many people come to christianity and fall right back in their old life. They don't lead Spirit-led lives. And not only that, they don't recognize the spirit and all the different ways God talks to you. There are so MANY different ways God gets His message across to you. And Joyce Meyers did an excellent job of stating them. This is for those who love Jesus and don't understand why their life is not going how they want. Jesus will give you power through the Holy Spirit."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"Wow was I disappointed... I love to hear Joyce preach! I love to read her books! She is so anointed! And she always speaks to me. However, maybe it's just me, but this audiotape wasn't the same. When she read the book she wrote, I found it to be dry and without life. How to Hear from God is another of her great books! Please don't discount the book if you didn't like the audiotape of it being read. I won't get another tape of her reading her books. I'll just continuing listening to her teaching tapes, reading her books, and watching her programs on tv and online."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"I am a baby Christian. I recently was at a Promise Keepers event, and asking a small group from my brother's church how they know when they found God, and how do they know when he speaks? They could'nt really describe it, exept that is is awesome, and that I will know. They reminded me of the verse, &quot;Seek and you will find.&quot; I later prayed for the passion to seek God and for him to come into my heart. Well 2 weeks later I found this book starring at me in WalMart. I have grown so much in so little time, before and after this book...I think more than some many probably do in a lifetime. I think that between this book and The Purpose Driven Life, and of coarse The Bible...you will grow to spiritual maturaty assuming you have the will."},{"Title":"How To Hear From God Audio Book","review":"Divided into two sections: Learning to Listen and Learning to Obey, with discussions questions at the end of each of the fourteen chapters, makes this book a good source for an individual devotional or for a group Bible study.

When her brother finds that she is in this wild western town all by herself he sends their close family friend Thad to watch out for her.This is where a lot of the romance starts but there is also a murderer among them, long held secrets etc... to mention a few things.

At times it will make you laugh and then make you cry. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it."},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater","review":"I only discovered Dorothy Garlock books about a month ago, and have already read four. I've been hitting used book stores for more! This book is set in a oil boom town with Jill sent there to take care of an ill Aunt. I like these books because they are an easy read with twist and turns and of course a spunky romace. I have family from the areas she writes about and can envision them as young vibrant people with hopes and dreams, it makes me want to research my family history more. A great read!"},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater","review":"It was a good book...really it was. I mean, I read it in 2 days. I was just a little disappointed in the end. There wasn't an epiloge (or how ever you spell it!) to tell me what happened to Thad and Jill. That's why I was disappointed. Usually, Garlock tells you what has happened to the characters in an epiloge but this time she didn't. Sigh...I guess I have to make up my own ending. Don't get me wrong though, the book was pretty darn good. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater","review":"If you have read any of Dorothy Garlock's other books, you can probably predict most of what happens in this book. The characters are endearing, the setting and description of history is great, but the plot is so predictable. It is like many of her past books, well to do man in town is always the bad guy, has the wool pulled over the town town, take hero/ine who is from wrong side of tracks to figure it out. I read it because it continues the story of the characters from The Edge of Town, but it isn't as good."},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater","review":"All of Dorothy Garlock's series are excellent. I always read the last in the series wishing there were more.My Mother grew up during this time and in this area so, it is easy to imagine her in the stories."},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater","review":"This book was almost another disappointment for me. In it, we are reintroduced to old characters, Jill, Joe, and Thad from the first book (they, with the exception of Thad are siblings of the main character) and are introduced to several new characters.Jill has traveled to Rainwater, an oil town, to take over the running of a Motel while her namesake Aunt is sick. Not shortly after she arrives, Thad comes along to look after her until her brother Joe gets there.Unfortunately, while she and Thad are out on a walk, they find the headless body of a woman. All signs point to the rich oil baron of the town, at least the signs pointed out by Lloyd Madison, a lawyer with a strange red devil mark on his face.Madison doesn't just cause trouble for the oil baron though, he also seems to like to antagonize Jill's aunt for a reason unknown to all but the aunt. He also likes to stir others into a frenzy when it suits him.The story revolves around finding the killer and the budding romance between Thad and Jill. There's a lot of drama and mystery with just a touch of a love story thrown in.Like the other two novels I've read by her, this one shares a common theme. In each of the three books thus far in the Missouri series, at least one girl is a victim of a rape. There is also a great deal of mentioning breasts. While I can understand these as use for plot motives, does it have to be in every single book? Some variety would be nice. In addition, this one's language and the character's actions still don't fit with the time period.Garlock's writing is nice but I wonder if she wouldn't be better suited to write about a different time period. Her language and the character's actions would much fit better for around the fifties or sixties. She does tend to be pretty crude at times and has no problems with profanity or sexual descriptions in her books.I'm not sure if I'll be reading any more books by Garlock. It might be tempting just to see if she adds the same elements to every other book she writes. But anymore they are just different variations on the same theme.A Place Called RainwaterCopyright 2003404 pages plus notes"},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater","review":"This is a good book about a hotel owner, Justine Bryers, who was raped and had a son with a red mark on his face that was very angry and out for revenge against her.

Treat yourself and read it."},{"Title":"Easy Vietnamese Style Cookery: Australian Women's Weekly Home Library (With measurement conversions for British and North American readers)","review":"I bought this book when my husband was working in Vietnam and said how good the food was there. So imagine how impressed I was when his response to the first thing I cooked was \\"tastes just like up there\\". That was chilli beef and noodles, and has become a staple meal in our family, along with the mild beef curry and the chicken with green beans and noodles. While the recipes sometimes seem to call for a lot of ingredients, once you have bought the basics (and some you may already have, like soy sauce and fish sauce) you probably won't have to make many one off visits to the shops for emergency supplies. The recipes make very generous serves, especially anything with rice and noodles. And I am finding that now that I live in Burma, the recipes are particularly useful for the sort of vegetables I can get cheaply and easily here as well."},{"Title":"Deconstruction Theory and Practice","review":"While you won't fully understand what is going on in deconstructionism after reading this book, you'll probably be closer than most. Deconstructionism is probably the most misunderstood &quot;thing&quot; around. Norris provides an incredibly fair and balanced presentation of the basic issues and main misreadings of the people involved. If you want a basic overview of what is going on that doesn't attempt to reduce everything to pragmatism or relativism, then this is the place to start. This was the first book that made me go, &quot;ah, I at least understand what the problems are.&quot;My only complaint is that I wish Norris spent more time on Heidegger and the roots of deconstructionism. However given how complex Heidegger is, this is understandable. After reading Norris I'd suggest going back to something like _Between the Blinds: A Derrida Reader_. He'll make a whole lot more sense after reading Norris."},{"Title":"Deconstruction Theory and Practice","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to deconstruction in general, as well as to Derrida, the major philosophical figure of the late Twentieth Century. Norris is one of the foremost authorities on Derrida and deconstruction in the English-speaking world, and he writes with great insight. This is emphatically not a lightweight work, although most of it is not beyond the ability of the average literate reader. Much of it is brilliantly written and illuminating. I came away from this book with a pretty good grasp of what deconstruction involves, and the significance of Derrida as a writer and thinker.For anyone interested in the evolution of literary theory over the last century, beginning with the old \\"new criticism\\", structuralism, and then post-structuralism, this book presents an excellent and lucid explanation of all these movements, and the major figures in them: F.R. Leavis, Saussure, Barthes, Derrida, de Man, among others. Norris is completely sympathetic in his treatment of deconstruction; there is no Anglo-American analytic bias against it present anywhere. The understanding is deep, and the writing is (mostly) clear and lucid. The pages devoted to de Man were quite opaque to me, however. (But then, de Man is probably opaque to most everyone, Norris excepted.) In the concluding chapter Norris gives an account of those who have tried to counter deconstruction's influence on the American scene. Norris contends that deconstruction is an important method which has raised genuine and vitally important issues which cannot be lightly dismissed. To do so is to fail to confront it on its own ground."},{"Title":"Deconstruction Theory and Practice","review":"As lucid and concise an exposition as you are likely to find on Derrida and deconstruction. Norris covers an amazing amount of material in this brief book, mostly chronologically (the Sophists put in an appearance along with, of course, fairly extensive treatment of Nietzsche and Heidegger) though with occasionally necessary digressions. Derrida's central concept (to speak metaphysically) of 'supplementarity' is clearly explained, and the sections on Paul De Man and his 'theory of rhetoric' are especially good. Norris goes to great pains to distinguish 'philosophical' deconstruction from the more stylistically 'literary' varieties as propagated by Geoffrey Hartman, J Hillis Miller et al. While clearly sympathetic - - even at times somewhat defensive - - toward deconstruction, Norris is very even-handed in his treatment of the subject, originally concluding the book with a chapter on 'Dissenting Voices' such as John Ellis' cogently-articulated AGAINST DECONSTRUCTION. Originally published in 1982, this later edition has a supplementary (!) 'Afterword' in which Norris mitigates some of his (as he would have it) understatements on speech-act theory and the misunderstandings over what deconstruction 'really' does; that is, the differences between post-modern 'destructive' and 'deconstructive' performance and criticism, using source materials throughout to bolster his points."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"My daughter while pregnaunt wanted this book for her daughters first books.

This was one of my favorite books to read as well as my sister when we were kids and we're in our 30's now. Who would have thought it would still be published and loved by kids now? I read it to my son and he loves it too! It has silly drama from Grover, who is paranoid that you will keep turning pages and get him face to face with a monster. It has great illustrations of brick walls and ropes and other things that Grover builds, along with his pleas, to try to keep you from turning the page.

It is a great, funny, fear calming book.Who wasn't afraid of monsters in the dark as a child?And this illustrates, it is all in ones imagination, so do not be afraid.Grover is silly and cute all the while he is sooo very afraid, which is delightful to all .Excellent book, it is a real classic."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"When I was little this was my favorite book. We would read it over and over, and I would pretend I was struggling to turn the pages that Grover had tied, nailed, and bricked over.So when we had a daughter, this was one of the first books I bought for her. At 2 years old the book sat on the shelves for a while, but she is 3 now, and I recently took it down again to read for her at bedtime. It is now a favorite, we read it every night. I read the pages, then she turns them to give poor old Grover a hard time.One recommendation...this review is for the standard Little Golden Books version, which is great, but we also found a board book version in stores, so the hard pages are great when you have toddlers turning the pages for you every night. They can really 'struggle' against Grover's efforts without hurting the book."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I used to read this book to my own children and bought this copy for my grandchildren.

It is one of their favorite bedtime stories.The first time I read this book they didn't care much for it. That's because I made several mistakes that are very important to making this book fun after repeated readings. Here's the five steps:1. Imitate Grover's voice. The mistake is to make Grover sound too deep. He's more like Yoda with a panic attack. Vibrate the back of your tongue like you're trying to gargle and let your voice climb when Grover is shouting.2. Don't forget the sound effects. There's bricks coming down, boards being hammered into place and Grover panting and screaming on every page.3. Let your children turn the pages while you plead to them to \\"don't turn the page!\\"4. Replace the words. After you read this book 5-6 times, you can spice it right back up by changing the words (e.g. \\"The Naked Gorilla at the End of this Book.\\")5. Use different Sesame Street characters. My sons ask for \\"The Count\\" most often as either a stand-in for Grover or as a companion through the story. \\"Three, three pages left before the end of the book, AH AH AH AH AH!\\""},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I have forgotten all about this book until someone mentioned it in a bookclub that I belong to. She reads it to her son every night. And I remember how much fun I had reading it to my nephew 13 years ago on vacation, so I scurried online and ordered a copy of it. My sons (even though they are probably too old for it) request it every night since it arrived. They think it is a hoot and a hollar. And they beg me to keep turning the pages (I must be raising some fearless boys!) and when they get to the end, they giggle with glee.My advice is, don't wait to buy this book. Get it now and enjoy some reading time with your children. This book is just absolutely fun and I know that it will keep my sons interested in reading. At least they'll remember mom struggling to keep the pages closed ...7/22/08"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This Book was about Grover, from sesame street, who thought he seen a monster at the end of the book so he was trying to get you not to turn the page because he is afraid of monsters. But then at the end of the book the monster was he and he was not so afraid any more and he was embarrassed.I liked this book because it was by Sesame Street and it was funny. I think that a lot of little kids would like to read this book because it was surprising who the monster was really at the end of the book. And it showed you not to be afraid of all monsters and all monsters are not really that bad. I also liked this book because it was short and just about any little kid would enjoy it and they could read it too. I recommend this book for any kid. It is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"My daughters had this book sent to them some 25 years ago by their aunt who lived in Canada at the time, they always found it a thrill to listen to and to take part in.. it was read many time with ever growing groups of children, and it fast became the most favorite book we owned. when my daughters grew up and have families of there own this was one of the first books I tryed to get hold of for my grandson, but sadly couldn't find it in the UK, so when Amazon came avaiable I quickly ordered a number of copies to give to to the family and once again it has become a firm favorite, I am sure it will stay that way for many years to come, I think there should be at least one copy of this book in everyones collection. &quot;Happy Days&quot;"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I teach 3 year olds at a Day Care Center and read this book a few times a week.

I always ask... &quot;Should I turn the page&quot; and they all yell &quot;YES&quot;. They laugh and giggle and act scared... It's pure joy reading it to them and watching them react!

Oh, you don't want me to turn the page? Well, I'm going to anyway...\\" What fun.I do have some concerns with it though: should children really be reading this kind of literature? In a \\"No Means No\\" society, should we be planting such ideas into the fragile, impressionable minds of the future.
