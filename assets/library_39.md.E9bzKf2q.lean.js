The story opens with 8 people from all walks of life traveling to Indian Island, where they have been invited for a summer holiday by the mysterious U.N. Owen. Upon reaching the island, they discover that their mystery host is no where to be found; the only other people on the island are the butler and his wife. The guests are soon confronted with the reason for their invitation: their host knows about the secrets of their pasts, and has decided that justice must be served.Truthfully, of the little Christie that I have read so far, this has been my least favorite. Don't misunderstand, however, I still greatly enjoyed the book! Christie's knack for misdirection is amazing, leading you to believe with utmost certainty who the killer is, at least until the next chapter when she sheds new light on a new suspect, and then you know for sure that they are the killer, again until the next chapter. What I didn't like about this book is the murders seemed too contrived and forced to match up with the nursery rhyme. Of course, these murders needed to fit the pattern of the rhyme, otherwise, what would be the point? It just came across as too convenient for me, yet I did enjoy flipping back and forth to the rhyme at the beginning of the book to try to figure out how the next murder would take place!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Then There Were None, also published as The Ten Little Indians, was one of the most page-turning thrillers I've read.

Each person is persuaded over for various reasons. The longer they stay, the weirder things get. Each day someone is killed, but there is no other people on the island despite a butler. As the members are being killed off, it leaves everyone thinking. Who is the murderer?This book will be the best thriller/mystery book you may read. It's darkness and spookiness keeps you interested.

In fact, I feel \\"And The There Were None\\" is one of Dame Christie's best novels ever written for the following reasons:* Great Storytelling By Dame Agatha Christie.* Quick Read That Is Difficult To Put Down.* Interesting Plot, Which Takes 10 Strangers & Lures Them All To An Island Where Killer Kills All Ten Strangers Off One By One.* All Ten Victims Are Stranded On The Island With No Means Of Leaving The Island Or Communicating With The Outside World, Which Intensifies The Storyline.* Lots of Red Herrings & Misdirection Keeps The Reader Guessing As To Who The Killer Really Is & How The Murders Are Being Executed.* Great Ending."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This may be the greatest mystery ever written.

Of course, Ms. Christie is very good at writing, but to imagine this tale is impressive. It is a simple enough story: ten people are invited to spend some time on an island; they find a poem, a take off of the 'ten little Indians'; then they are all bumped off, one by one. You realize that these people are the subjects of the lines in the poem, but how to find out who is killing them is the question. The answer is supplied, fortuitously, by a letter in a bottle found later. It was a really amazing story."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"You know the feeling, right before the last term of the school year ends you receive (sometimes as an email, sometimes in snail mail) the summer reading list. And boy, is it long. Looking back on the past years, you dread even looking for the books on your list in fear of how thick or how old they are going to be. However, when you do go on your quest to find these inevitably boring works of fiction, you stumble upon \\"And Then There Were None\\" by Agatha Christie. Intrigued by the description on the back, you begin to read the first page. And then the second. and then the third. Until, before you know it, you have finished the book in just a matter of hours. This has never happened before and you're pleasantly surprised at the fact that you finished a summer reading book without being bored to tears.This was exactly how I came into contact with this book, and I have to say, it is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Being intrigued by the murder and mystery that this book and many others like it has to offer, I was captivated by every page. If you're looking for a murder mystery that keeps your heart beating, palms sweating, throat gulping throughout the entire story, this book is for you. Agatha Christie's story includes very unique characters and a very original story line that will keep you guessing with every turn."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Mystery novels are one of the most popular types of fiction. Anyone who loves the genre is, at some point, going to run up to Agatha Christie and her most famous mystery, \\"And Then There Were None\\". Of the eighty books she wrote, this one is the most popular for a reason: it's unlike anything else you'll read.On a sunny August day, ten strangers are summoned to Indian Island. What begins as a holiday in an exciting locale turns deadly when, after dinner, a record is played that incriminates each of the eight guests, along with the butler and his wife, of murder. Each of them has killed another person (or people) in a way that makes them untouchable by the law - a drowning that seems \\"accidental\\", a car accident, a death on the operating table, etc. Shortly after the record is played, one of the guests is found dead. Initially, the others think that is must be suicide, but when the bodies start piling up, they realize that there is a killer in thier midst. And the murderer is using the verses of a nursery rhyme, Ten Little Indians, to determine how each victim dies.As the number of people on the island begins to dwindle, the tension increases. The strangers, who initially cling to each other, begin to turn against one another as they realize the killer is still hunting. But what will happen when there is no one left?This novel is quite different from most of Agatha Christie's work because it does not feature either one of her two most famous characters, Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple. It also has an ingenious way of dealing with the murders - and the murderer. My only beef with the book is that the killer's name is printed in large font on the final page. If you're like me, and you like to see exactly how many pages are in the book you're reading, try to skip it on this one. You don't want to be spoiled for the ending like I was."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is without doubt the best Agatha Christie book, easily one of the best detective stories ever written. Intriguing, evil, suspenceful, with interesting and well drawn characters.

I was very impressed and wished I'd actually taken the time to read her in the past.And Then There Were None was a really good whodunit mystery. The ending kind of amazed me. The murder wasn't who I expected it to be, and the explanation of how they pulled off all the murders was pretty clever. I liked the premise, that all the people on the island were made to be suspect. Through their guilt of things they had done in their past they all had the ability to pull off the murders.The writing was really good. It was very fast-paced but it didn't move so fast that I was lost in what was going on. The murders happened in a way that as soon as I \\"recovered\\" from one another one had happened. That was the greatest part of this book, that it kept the suspense going and didn't really have any down time.I am very glad that I decided to pick up this one. I really enjoyed it and will be getting my hands on more Agatha Christie soon!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"this 2cd radio drama version is based on the original novel, not the stage-play (they have different endings). it's a good production with just a few minor differences from the novel. i recommend."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the first book I have read by Agatha Christie and I can see why it is a classic of the murder mystery genre.

The characters all have their own personalities and are well developed. The 10 guests are invited to Indian Island and are mysteriously accused of murder by U.N. Owen. Soon the guests die one by one, just like the \\"10 Little Indian Boys\\" nursery rhyme. One by one, the little figures disappear. The guests all are haunted by the series of deaths occurring, trusting no one else. Christie is clever in how she matches the deaths to the nursery rhyme. You literally have to read down to the last 2 words of the mystery when it reveals the murderer. The murderer is sneaky but clever in his plans.The mystery is unsolvable! Every detail is paid attention to when the murderer carries out the plan. It is definitely rewarding when getting the resolution of the mystery. I would definitely recommended this book to anyone. It'll get you guessing who's the murder! Definitely deserves being Christie's best-seller!!!! LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I agree with the other reviews, And Then There Were None IS one of the best mystery novels of the 20th century.

No two are alike, even two that have the same detective.\\"And then there were none\\" is in a class all of its own, though. It has been previously published under the name of Ten Little Indians and is set on an island where ten people die. One by one they are killed off by a madman and there is no detective in the main part of the story, and you get to almost the end and think it is going to go unsolved. Until the epilogue that is, where is solved.It is a lot different to the style of Ms Christie's other books, but still enjoyable. I believe this particular story has been made into quite many telemovies. The only telemovie I've actually seen is \\"Death on the Nile\\"."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was great I recommend this to any reader.

I was creeped out and did not guess who the murderer was, but then I usually don't. Christie is always able to show us fascinating characters; this time, none of them are very likable. still, I had some pity for them."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The beginning was a bit confusing but by chapter 3 you never to put the book down.

I look forward to reading her other books."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"There was a time when I loved to read Agatha Chistie. In those times her books meant everything to me, and I almost didn't read another author. In one year, I read 67 of her books. And believe me, among these 67, AN THEN THERE WERE NONE is the best one.The plot is one of those you don't find anymore on detective books. Ten people that don't know each other hide something terrible of their past. They are invited to spend sometime at a man's house - a man that no one know. And suddenly, one by one, they are murdered in a very suspicious sometimes, sometimes terrible and bloody way. Most of all, the ending is one of the best I've ever read. Agatha Christie was really a wonderful writer. Her books will certainly remain forever, since she is the Shakespeare of detective fiction. And this book is for sure her best work. If you haven't read that one yet and you enjoy Agatha's books, hurry up and take that one!Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I haven't read a better novel. The suspense floods you. You would have no idea whodonit without either reading the ENTIRE book or pondering it seriously hard. The book itself has wonderful description.

After you read it, you'll put on a positive review as I did, guaranteed."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The publisher did a terrible job transferring this book to Kindle. Pages appear out of order. Page numbers and headers show up mid text. And odd code-like characters everywhere. Have you ever tried to copy and paste a whole page from PDF? It's that jumbled. I gave up reading this book a few pages in.Update 24 July 2012: to their credit, Amazon issued a refund quickly."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I won't go into the premise of the novel, as so many have already done so.I've delayed reading this one for many years...perhaps because it didn't feature one of Christie's familiar detectives and perhaps because the premise was too unsettling. How or why was one to invest in a story where you can be virtually sure everyone dies and the murderer is never caught? Now that I have read it, I'm sad I cheated myself so long. Somehow there's such atmosphere to it...just a rich, awful suspense that gradually creeps up on you as the plot develops. It was wholly unsettling. It's not that the characters were particularly sympathetic; they weren't, given that the murderer had them all pretty well pegged. But there's something naked and human about anyone looking inevitable death in the face, and especially facing perhaps violent murder. I had to have a black chuckle or two at some of the irony, too.There are a few distinct implausibilities, and somehow it seemed a tinge too easy for the murderer, like these people were just a bunch of sheep that could be cut off one by one from the others and destroyed at will. It was almost as if the murderer were omnipotent. (Given who the murderer is, the insight into people makes some sense but I kept on expecting the characters to do something the murderer didn't anticipate or somehow throw a wrench into the murderer's plans.) One of the things I've appreciated about Christie is how her mysteries were always complicated by real life...unfortunate coincidences the murderer or detective has to cope with, secondary and even tertiary agendas that obscured the truth, even sometimes the murderer's own preconceptions and biases.And yet, I was soon engrossed in the book and any flaws seem pretty minor. My overall impression is of a tightly plotted and even devilishly tricky plot, but something seems to transcend that. What of each of these characters? What does one make of the things they've done and how they've lived with those decisions? What different degrees of guilt are there, and where does the law draw the line? Where should the law draw the line? Can you escape from crossing a moral line, even if the law won't punish you? What of the murderer stalking these victims? Are they getting their just desserts or is someone simply indulging blood lust? Is the murderer any better than the victims? How do people face their end, especially with something on their conscience?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None, the brilliant masterwork by the much imitated Agatha Christie is a complicated yet accessible murder mystery. Ten guests arrive at an island, each with a different secret, and each uniquely mysterious. When all the guests have gathered, a mysterious voice, U.N. Owen??? indicts each for a crime. The bloodletting follows. Good luck solving this mystery. The Denouement is nothing short of brilliant.Required reading or listening for Mystery fans. A 5 star classic!Hugh Fraser does an excellent job with his narration of this novel. He captures the mood and angst perfectly, and does a great job with the various characters."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book makes your hands numb, because you will never be able to let go of this welly-formulated masterpiece. As my school started a reading program, the name Agatha Christie kept flashing. I had heard about Murder on the Orient Express, so I asked for it. It wasn't in stock, so a librarian recommended And Then There Were None. I was still excited for a mysterfy book, since I am a hard core mystery fan. The first chapter was a bewildering opening. Therefore, I had to use CliffNotes. After that chapter, things made 100% sense. The Plot: 8 people, brought by an unknown U.N. Owen to a private island with an enormmous mansion on it. When the 8 people arrive, the U.N. Owen is absent, but the recently hired maid and butler are there, which makes 10 people. After a strange recorder turns on announcing each person's name, then followed by who they each caused the death of. Slowly, the secrets pour out. And slowly, people are murdered, accoarding to a poem called ten little indians. And as each one dies, one of the 10 figurines of indians on the kitchen table dissapear. I bet you are know exhilirated to read this phenomenal novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None is a great book. I recommend it to about 6th and 7th graders. It's a great book to come back to if you're older too. It's very scary with loads of suspense. People dissapearing is my kind of mystery book. I love the setting on the island, with no phone or transportation. Just think, getting stuck on an island with a mad man. That sounds pretty creepy.The suspenseful parts in the book are usually at night. Someone usually stays awake or gets up early. The killer is up too. When the killer murders the person, he gives the crime scene a situation where you don't know if it was suicidal or someone had a little accident. (If you know what I mean.) They have a little discusion afterwards and make the reader think of one person who is or isn't it. I'm not giving that part away.On an island, for a setting, is spooky. A mansion is where the (nine) victims stay. They have a butler stay in a place close to all the murdering spots, so it's likely that it's him. But is he or isn't he? There is almost always a storm, and the power usually goes out. The mystery goes on in the dark, where the masacre continues. If you like scary books, then this is the book for you!And Then There Were None was a wonderful book. I hope you consider reading it. This is my favorite book of all time!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"\\"And Then There Were None,\\" by Agatha Christie is everything it is supposed to be. It is a classic mystery about a series of events that transpire on an island of ten people. I got sucked into this book a few chapters into reading it and stayed awake late one night to finish it.This book has what I consider classic storytelling. I love how the telling of the story is almost basic, and simple, such that my imagination was allowed to fill in all the details. In more recently published mystery and suspense books there is painstaking detail about how the story unfolds. Christie leaves the details to the readers imagination. For example, there is not a lot of detail or descriptions of the deaths of the residents of the island. There are not any vague descriptions from the victims point of view like \\"She now recognized the killer. He took the axe and...\\" Rather the residents of the island found the body and had no idea what happened. This left me backtracking and following the story closer because I was just as clueless as the characters.I do not think I could have deduced who the killer was. I had thoughts throughout the book on who it was; but, of course that changed multiple times.I recommend this book for anyone that is interested in an entry point into the world of mystery created by Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"DO NOT READ THIS IS YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS BOOK:This book is about 10 people on an island, 8 of them invited by the \\"owner\\" of the island.

But little do they know, a little justice is about to be served. Who will die next and can they find the killer before the next one dies?Oh. My. God. This book was frakkin' amazing. I have never been so afraid to go to sleep in my life. I have never had as crazy dreams as I've had when reading this book. I have never stayed up so late on a weeknight finishing a book because I knew it would haunt my dreams and dammit, I had to know who was the murderer!If you peruse through many of my book reviews (specifically the ones of thrillers), you will see the complaint: \\"This was a thriller?!\\" In my opinion, a thriller should be pulse-pounding, look over your shoulder, frantically turn the next page, stay up late into the night finishing the damned book. Basically, everything that this book IS.The characters were varied. Sure, they were all sorts of 1930's stereotypes (but the offensive n-word and \\"Indians\\" were dropped from the title/poem), but they were real, from the religious zealot, Miss Brent, to the slimy captain Lombard, to the officious Justice. I was surprised at how attached I grew to each character (much more than in some more serious character novels I've read), and there were people I desperately hoped to avoid dying.And then we have the mystery, the reason you even read this novel. Oh. My. God. (Damn, this novel has elicited TWO slow-mo OMG's from me!) It is slick, it is crafty, it is interesting, and I TOTALLY didn't see it coming. Every word is a puzzle, a puzzle that you twist and turn and when you finally read the end, you go, \\"Ah ha, so that's how it was done!\\" Christie says in the author's note how much work it was and how proud of it she was, and I must say, she should be. I've not read a novel that surprised me like this one ever.I loved the mood of the novel. I was constantly looking around in my bedroom (at night, big mistake, as I had wickedly weird nightmares one night) as if a murderer would pop out of nowhere. And I totally feel that this should be more prevalent in thrillers.This novel blew my mind, even more than my previous favorite Christie novel, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\". I highly recommend you stop reading my review and hunt down a copy for yourself, so you can start reading!Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book came free with the PC game of the same name (it was originally titled Ten Little Indians) and even though playing the game (specifically, playing the end trailer) does give away the mystery, it was still a good solid read. Though you don't see as much into each of the characters as you might expect, I don't think story is hurt by it. I hesitate to say that it's not a character driven story, because in a way it really is, but the main focus is how the characters interact with one another - not... who they are on the inside, if that makes sense. And though I disagree with a lot of the utterly sexist clap-trap spouted in the book by the male characters, well, you have to remember that it's a much older book! Times have indeed changed. I wouldn't say this tops my list of Agatha Christie books, but it's not bad."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten little soldier boys went out to dine;One chocked his little self and then there were nine.Nine little soldier boys sat up very late;One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight little soldier boys traveling to Devon;One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.Seven little soldier boys chopping sticks;One chopped him in halves and then there were six.Six little soldier boys playing with a hive;A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.Five little soldier boys going in for law;One got in Chancery and then there were four.Four little soldier boys going out to sea;A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.Three little soldier boys walking in the Zoo;A big bear hugged one and then there were two.Two little soldier boys sitting in the sun;One got fizzled up and then there was one.One little soldier boy left all alone;He went and hanged himselfAnd then there were none.I read And Then There Were None over the summer. Agatha Christie wrote it. It was also published as Ten Little Indian. And Then There Were None was published in 1939. The novel is 264 pages. Agatha Christie also wrote many plays, short stories, and poems.In this novel there is one main character that catches my eye impeticular is Mr. and Mrs. Owen. The weird thing about them is that you really never meet them ever. I mean they were talked about for at least half the novel. Telling us about how they know the ten people that came to the island. But, you never find out what they look like. I guess this is why I like them because I didn't have to keep track of them.The setting of And Then There Were None is a very secret location is an island off the shores of Stickle haven. This island costs millions of dollars. There is a huge house on this island even bigger than the houses on Sherwood Heights. In this house there is about twelve rooms. A dinning room and a huge kitchen. With ocean front views I wouldn't mind living there myself.In this novel there is one conflict that makes a billion small ones. The main conflict is someone keeps killing off everyone else. Everyone thinks it's the person sitting next to him or her. It is very confusing to explain. If I tried to explain it would just be a bunch of jibber jabber. So, I guess you are just going to have to read the novel.I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves mysteries. No child younger than thirteen should read this novel because even I got a little freaked out. Also, anyone younger would probably not like the gruesome details. I really loved this novel. Get it!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None is my all time favorite Christie book. In fact, it's the only book of hers that I actually like. I don't normally care for her stories with Ms. Marple or the Inspector Poirot. This mystery was filled with many twists and red herrings,all the while not becoming confusing. It kept you guessing till the end. Maybe that is why I prefer this mystery. It is different than all the rest!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is flat out Agatha's best book ever. Despite the fact someone already spoiled who-dun-it for me, I was still stunned by the outcome. Tightly plotted, masterfully written, this novel has no peer.The premise is simple: ten strangers invited to an island with a newly built mansion for a free weekend. When they arrive, they discover the host is no where to be found, and a recorded message accuses each of them for murder in their shadowy past. And one by one they are picked off, just like the old nursery rhyme. \\"Ten little Indians went out to dine. One choked his little self and then there were nine.\\" As each murder is carried it, everyone slowly suspects each other. And one by one, ten little china Indian dolls dissapear from the dining room... Wonderful, with a gracefull, stunning plot."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"&quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, is a mystery book that is wrote by the author, Agatha Christi, who is by no surprise the number one best seller for mystery books. The book is taken place in Diltisham, Indian Island. Its about a mysterious man named Mr, Owen who invites 10 guests, who don't know eachother to his beautiful house on an Indian Island. Throughout the whole story the 10 guests try to figure out who Mr. Owen could be. Is he on the Island? Is he one of the 10? Or, did he not even come on the Island? ONe by one the 10 people are killed by a murderer's fantasy of a &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; poem. Killing them based on the poem.I thought the book &quot; And Then There Were None&quot;, was very well organized, descriptive, and well written. Agatha Christi does a great job with keeping you guessing till the end, of who the killer is. This book never has a dull moment, there is always something going on. There is a twist in the ending that you would have never expected."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie wrote many mysteries, but And Then There Were None (aka Ten Little Indians) was her best. This is a masterpiece of plot and suspense. Some of her other books may have more memorable characters, or a charming, charismatic, quirky detective, but this book stands alone as her literary monument. It has plot, atmosphere, suspense, irony, economy. Highly recommended to any reader of mystery fiction."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"i love this book man. we had to read it last year for this class and i actually liked it. it was suspenseful and i never woulda guessed the killer who he was. amazing"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"i read this book and did a book report on it ... it was very spooky. it was intriguing too. the first few pages are boring, but as you keep reading you won't want to put the book down. every time i hear that poem, the ten little indians, i think of this book. the poem is the basis of the book. and you don't really know who killed who until the end and it's not who you expect it to be. i liked it and in a way i didn't cause like, one person thinking of how to kill everyone is just kinda pyschotic. and i thought it was weird. but it was coo i guess. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone that's not in highschool. it's too crazy. actually no one should read it cause some ppl might get ideas like that. i plan on renting the movie this week to see it. i'm going to be even more spooked."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Each of the ten guests are invited by U.N. Owen to spend a weekend at Indian Island which is located one mile off the coast of Devon. None of the guests know anything about U.N. Owen but they take the offer anyway. When everyone arrives at the island, U.N. Owen is no where to be found. No one is on the island except Mr. and Mrs. Rogers which are the guest&#65533;s butlers (they are included as the ten guests). Anyway, each of the ten guests spend a little time to get to know one another, and get settled into their rooms. And in each of the ten bedrooms a framed poem hangs on the wall entitled Ten Little Indians. It says:Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;One choked his little self and then there were nine.Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon;One said he&#65533;d stay there and then there were seven.Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks;One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.Six little Indian boys playing with a hive;A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.Five little Indian boys going in for law;One got in Chancery and then there were fourFour little Indian boys going out to sea;A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo;A big bear hugged one and then there were two.Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun;One got frizzled up and then there was one.One little Indian boy left all alone;He went and hanged himself and then there were none.This is pretty much how the entire story goes. Each of the visitors die off one by one (each dying in a way somehow related to the poem) until there are none. After the first death occurs, all the guests prepare to leave on the boat which is supposed to come each morning to deliver food and other goods, but the boat comes once (to bring all the visitors to the Island) and never comes back again. From the very first night all the guests arrive, strange things start to occur. First, they hear a gramophone that accuses each of the guests of committing murder (which for some of the guests is a surprise) and then someone actually dies the first night. At first, everyone thinks the people die from committing suicide, but later they realize that&#65533;s not the case. Someone (one of the guests) is indeed the murderer killing all the houseguests, one by one. And the horrible thing is that there is no chance of escaping the Island because the boat will never return. Who is the murderer killing all of the house guests? Will anyone on Indian Island make it out alive?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was very clever and has a great ending. Once I started reading this I seriously couldn't put it put back down."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I have been a fan of Christie's for years. This is possibly her very best of all. As the figures vanish from the mantelpiece and the characters vanish from the scene one by one, the suspense she builds is almost unbearable. And the solution is dazzling (this from a lady who was an expert at &quot;surprise&quot; endings); you simply won't believe it until you read it! Superb."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book that I have ever read and i plan on readin a lot more. Agatha did an awesome job of keeping the suspence all the way through and I suspected everyone as a murderer at one time or another. a must read!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book seems to capture one's mind; the suspence grips one to never let go of it. The human behavior of the people on the island is perfectly described, creating a clear image in ones mind. Though there are points of dullness in the story, the suspence of the mystery covers it up. This book is one of the best of Agatha Cristie."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is completely original, and the plot is so unpredictable, you will not believe where it leads!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is filled with suspense, horror and everything there is to want in a book.

It has beautiful plot and Christie knows human psychology very well. Only if I hadn't known who'd done it!!!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Having seen the old 1940's movie adaptation and the play (both titled Ten Little Indians), I wanted to read this since I heard the ending was different. Unfortunately, I knew how it would end by the descriptions in the beginning, but still; what an amazing read. It was still able to build tension and fill me with dread. I will highly recommend this book to anyone. It's a quick read but entirely engaging. A must for any mystery buff! Enjoy."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is an awesome book!

This novel is basically about an unknown person named Mr. O.W.N. who sends these 10 ordinary people letters inviting them to stay on this island resort for a certain period of time. However, the person who wrote the letters signed them strangely. The first night gets really interesting as one of the ten characters dies mysteriously and that's just the beginning of the sickening game of this cold-blooded killer. There are plenty of foreshadows in this novel such as the &quot;Ten Little Indian Poem,&quot; which holds a great significance to the entire plot of the story. The characters later present themselves of what kind of persons they tuely are as the plot unravels. This novel gets more and more addictive as you read because you just want to know what is going to happen next and who the possible killer of killers are. This novel is a great classic for mystery lovers because I belive that this has all the elements of a mind grabbing mystery novel: suspense, morives, foreshadows, unpredictable characters, and an unusual enviroment and much more.I am glad my teacher chose this selection for our summer reading because this novel does make reading a lot more exciting than like a boring job your have to do.

Once you pick up the book you can't put it down because of the suspense. You are so eager to find out what happens and who dies. The book was intriguing and really put your brain to the test. The book starts when an unknown person invites ten people to the famous Indian Island. The island is called that because it's shaped like the head of an indian.

One by one, they start to die.When the first few die, you think to yourself, well, ok, this is a mystery novel; one or two of them - perhaps three - die off, one of the rest figures it out, gathers everyone in the living room, the crimes are explained and the murderer cought.But the guests keep on dying, and as they die, your tension grows: which of the ever dwindling party is the guilty one? who will be next? Who (if any) will remain? You feel yourself drawn into the speculations of the living, you form your own theories (only to see them dashed), and you try, much as the characters do, to make sense of what is happening. Surely this must stop at some point? Surely apprehension is just around the next page? Look, we're almost at the end of the book - this _has_ to stop, right? But it doesn't; the end nears, the list of living shrinks, and bewilderment, excitement and tension all grow. And then you read the end.I am a fan of the mystery novel genre, and have read many books of different authors. I must confess, I have _never_ been so blown away as when I've read the ending of \\"And then there were none\\". So shocking and yet - and only in hindsite - so perfectly obvious, that I was absolutely beside myself.The impression this book left in me stayed with me for years. If you read no other book by Christie (or any other mystery writer, for that matter), read this one!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I first read And then there were none in fifth grade (my older brother was reading it for class and I picked it up) and it scared me to death. It was my first Christie novel and although the plot totally freaked me out, I got hooked. Despite everything I loved it and years later when I finally got over my initial fear in middle school I reread it. And I got started on all her other books.Now in high school, I look back on a year where I have made quite a dent into Agatha Christie's mysteries. I have been literally gobbling them up and enjoying each and every one. Some I like better than others, and this one will always be at the top of that list. It was my first and it is my favorite.And then there were none has had an abundance of titles. From 10 Little Indians and something even less appropriate, the title has gradually changed until it settled on this. The story is of ten people, gathered on an island by someone they don't know. One by one they are done away with according to the nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians. (That was the part that really creeped me out but Christie uses the nursery rhyme plot device in quite a few of her mysteries.) The first dies at dinner the first day and everyone else slowly follows suit (according to the rhyme of course). The murders are sometimes quite gruesome. A search of the island reveals that the killer is one of the ten, and tensions mount as ten becomes nine, then eight, then seven...and then there were none.My favorite character from the beginning was Vera, so I was able to stick with the book until the end. It seems slow at some parts, especially in the beginning, but soon it has you hooked as the murders come faster and closer together. Overall, it is a total masterpiece, and I still don't understand how Christie managed it. The solution was just amazing - a total surprise. I never guessed and I doubt anyone else would either without help.One more thing: the book has been blamed for bigotry, etc. If you're really really touchy about it you might want to avoid it, but otherwise put up with it. It was the time period, remember. I didn't catch much of it when I first read it, but I was young, and I'll accept that there's probably some there. So be forewarned, but if you decide to buy or read it, enjoy!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"My class was assigned this book after finishing up &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and have been doing a variaty of activities concering it. Roleplays, placing oursleves inside the minds of the characters and how we feel they would react to the situations given to them helps you to understand the book more. I found myself captured by this book and its unexpected plot twists and the delightfully refreashing discord the characters had been placed in, as well as the colorful backrounds and the constant air of suspence and suspicion on each page. To put it in a simple phrase, this book is just astounding."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book was, no doubt about it, excellent. It was very mysterious and surprising. It had high and low points to it and a cliff hanging ending. Some parts were okay, and others were fantastic. I liked the way how in the indian boys poem, it all made sense with the murders. All the characters fit together with the story, and everything made perfect sense. I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and suspense."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None is a fantastic mystery.

Ten Little Indians is truly suspenseful and frightening. The tale tells of ten people who receive a mysterious letter from a person named \\"Unknown\\" who invites them to spend time at his/her island. Being a predictable mystery story they all decide to travel to this island to meet their \\"Unknown\\" host, which in the end leads to their demise. When one by one people start dropping like flies, they start to realize this is no longer a vacation of rest and relaxation. They start to fight for their lives. Panic strikes them and they all begin to wonder which one of them will be next, and who could be the evil behind all of this.Agatha Christie is a great mystery writer and I love her Hercule Poriot books. But when it came to this book I found that there were way to many characters to keep track of. Although the ending was ultimately great I found the rest of the book to be slow moving. The book is a good read, but if you want non-stop mystery action this book may not be for you."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None, formerly published as &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, goes steadily dull for a while up until the mysterious violence begins.The book begins by describing the numerous characters and how they all are guilty of a crime but were let off the hook.The people invited to an island by an unknown host start to die one by one in strange and unpredictable ways. But when the boat to the mainland doesn't show up the next morning, the several living guests begin to accuse each otherand realize that the deaths aren't accidental.Overall, the story and dialogue is very detailed but the plot line is weak and unrealistic. Although they are numerous, the characters are detailed in depth as though they are being profiled. Seeing that nobody makes a strong attempt to leave the cursed island or create a safe haven makes the story somewhat unbelievable."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is definitively the maximus of maximus in thriller detective novels. It was not the first Agatha Christie novel I have ever read, but this goes over the limits. Actually I thought the english title was &quot;Ten little niggers&quot; as it was published in 1923, but somehow the name changed throughout the decades.The story is developed in the most accurate way, with Agatha's known class and style.

I guess it is not the kind of book i really read. The story is about eight people are invited to a summer holiday on &quot;Indian Island.&quot; As they get to the island they are greeted by a butler and a maid. They tell the guests that the hosts will not be there for the first night. After they arrive the guests take notice that the house in which they are staying is very strange. They go to dinner the first night and one of the guests is killed. Then all of the guests are killed one by one. No one knows who the killer is and there is hardly any evidence and a lot of accusals. At the end of the book you get to find out who the killer is and why they did it. This book was okay in my opinion but it is very laid out and long.

It has a freaky and sinister mood that will frighten some children.

That is the situation that Edward George Armstrong, Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, and eight others are in. To add more intrigue, one by one, the visitors are murdered. Nobody has any idea who the murderer could be, and each of the surviving residents is a prime suspect. This adds a load of tension between all of the characters.I liked this book because the suspense is always rising, and every second could mean death. Clever twists add to the already great plot, so you never know what will happen next. As I read on, every page filled me with a new surprise. The details made it easy to imagine the scene, and I felt as though I was part of the story. The story jumps from one person's mind to another, so you can see the story unravel from each character's perspective.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes first-class mystery thrillers, or is a fan of any other Agatha Christie novels. It would also be good for people who enjoy edge-of-your-seat stories with life or death situations. This book is fairly difficult, probably appropriate for a middle school level reader and up. The storyline is a bit complex, but is made easier if you understand the beginning. Now, the only question is: Can they stop the psycho killer before no one is left?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Although a very predictable plot was conveyed to the reader, there was still a sense of mystery and suspicion in And Then There Were None. The book starts out describing the situations in which the characters received their invitations to go to the gathering on the Island. However, as soon as all the characters had arrived, there was a great sense of mystery due to a record stating they all would die and gave clues as to which order the killings would happen.The killings were very predictable due to a nursery rhyme that stated how the people would die. Although it was predictable it was still exciting due to an exciting twist near the end.And Then There Were None is an overall excellent book because of its plot, well developed characters, setting, and exciting twists. And Then There Were None or, as it is sometimes called Ten Little Indians is a great book for all age groups, old to young. I highly suggest you read it if you want a great edge-of-your-seat thriller!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None id s great book, and my favorite Agatha Christie.

Ten strangers who each, in his or her own way, have gotten away with murder gather by invitation at an isolated mansion. Then their unknown host systematically and mockingly murders them one by one. The idea was adapted into a film in 1945, 1965, 1974, and 1989, as well as a TV adaption in 1959 and a Russian production (often credited as the truest to the book, though hard to get a good copy of that is not too dark and muffled). Variants of the plot are perennials in movies and TV, appearing, for example, in Harry O, Quincy, and Remington Steele. As someone who has read all of Christie's work and admires it as running the gamut from diverting to entertaining to inspiring, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, neither Christie nor the filmmakers succeeded in bringing this brilliant idea to life in a truly fulfilling story. Occasionally, a mystery plot can be so ingenious and powerful that it can be a satisfying story in itself. Most often, the best that is achieved by plot alone is an amusing but arid puzzle mystery. For the depth and richness to engage, a novel usually needs to develop to some meaningful degree the characters, their backgrounds, their interaction, their dialogue, the setting, the tone, and any larger themes.The premise of Christie's book is fascinating. As to plot, the book is clever in conception and careful in execution. Compared to the films, the book's assortment of past crimes and depictions of the characters' attitudes toward them are more varied, subtle, and interesting. The order of the crimes has some meaning. The book does the best job of presenting the characters in ways in which the reader could actually see them as the murderous host. It is the least sentimental, treating all of them vaguely and suspiciously. This is not necessarily enough to make them convincing killers, but at least it maintains more of a sense of menace, suspense, and purpose than the film versions. The book does the best job of explaining why and how the host carried out the scheme.Yet, even the plot has definite shortcomings. Once the imaginative premise is established, the story becomes thin and formulaic. There is little plot or character development. The characters in the book engage in less deductive reasoning and survival techniques than in the 1945 film. The only real plot twist creates a major logical problem, which the book tries to overcome by implausibly suggesting that the ploy would either trick or \\"rattle\\" the murderer. The guests' murders are designed to follow the nursery rhyme, but, aside from some cosmetic frills, the poisoning, stabbing, shooting, and head-bashing that go on in the book show, in themselves, no special cunning, skill, strategic advantage, or plausibility. The killer strikes crudely without detection too effortlessly.The storytelling seems flat, frigid, and, at times, slow-paced. There is no lead character to care about. Characters are described largely by catch-phrases (the judge's \\"tortoise-like\\" appearance; Lombard's \\"wolfish smile\\") or hardly at all (Marston, the Rogerses). Their backgrounds and motives are sketched in summary fashion. The past crimes vary widely in originality, depth, and genuineness. Some -- especially Claythorne's and the general's -- are more subtle, interesting, and powerful than others. Some, like Blore's, Dr. Armstrong's, and Lombard's, are utterly trite, unexplored, and ineffective.However, the book's and films' worst failing is that they have nothing serious to say about the powerful themes that are at the very heart of the story. The story is inherently an observation of human nature in a desperate situation. How do the characters behave? How do they try to reason? How do they try to survive? Also by its very nature -- as the book's last pages acknowledge -- this story is a morality play. How is each of the characters a \\"criminal\\"? How is each \\"beyond the law\\"? Does each get \\"justice\\"? Is justice the point, or simply a \\"lust\\" to torture and kill? Is the story about breaking the law or enforcing it, about mistakes or abuses in pursuing justice? None of this is meaningfully addressed.The films are worse in some respects and better in some respects than the book. Each is worth seeing as an attempt to bring to life a compelling but at the same time confining plot concept. Each, like the book, fails to fully realize that idea as a story.Briefly, the 1945 film develops the plot better in some ways than the book and is more entertaining. The cast is outstanding, except Mischa Auer. But the film presents the general and his past crime ineffectively and changes others. Its attempts to make the characters entertaining come at the expense of their plausibility as villains and of the story's seriousness. The climactic scene revealing the host's identity, means, and motives is short, sedate, and unsatisfying.The 1965 film is enjoyable and energetic. But it is not as tightly and richly told, nor as well-acted, as the 1945 version, despite good casting. As in 1945, attempts to make characters comical or appealing sap the suspense. The final scene has more explanation than in 1945, but remains thin and undramatic.The 1974 film takes a different tone than its predecessors. It captures more of a sense of fear, dread, and suspense. Yet, overall, the movie is less substantial and entertaining than the prior versions. The storytelling is so spare and unartful that it is sterile and uninvolving. Other than Stephane Audran, the outstanding cast is unable to breathe life into the characters. The final scene is less effective than before.Everything about the 1989 version seems low-budget, from the cast to the script to the set to the production values. The casting of the doctor is even worse than Frank Stallone as Lombard. And not until Donald Pleasance's final moments on screen does he play his character with any coherence. But Herbert Lom is excellent as the general. And it is left to this film to finally present a dramatic end scene."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I'm an avid Mystery Fan and was glad to be able to find so many books available for the Kindle written by AC.

None of these people have any real idea who owns the island and the locals find the situation very mysterious. These ten people soon discover they have been invited to this island under false pretenses and each is accused of something awful they have done in the past. Suddenly these ten people begin to fall prey to murder and a very mysterious madman pits each one against the other in a game of cat and mouse and ultimate survival.Agatha Christie has been given the worthy title of the Queen of Crime and her novel, plays and short stories have captured readers for years. She is one of my favorite mystery writers and I always enjoy her books. And Then There Were None is a wonderful psychological thriller that captured my attention from the first page. The way the characters interact with each other is fascinating and how each one begins to suspect all the others is also very interesting. What happens to these people and how they try to make sense of what is going on around them is wonderful. The mood of the book is creepy from the first page and I always find that the book keeps you guessing until the end about how things are carried out the way they are.I believe Agatha Christie paved the way for other mystery writers and began a mystery writing industry that created an environment of gripping and intense storylines and unique studies of human behavior, perverse justice, and social interactions. I could reread her books over and over again and find new and different ways that she makes her books unique and exciting for readers"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Mystery is not my favorite genre by far but I just had to read at least one Agatha Christie novel.

By reading this part I thought that I would hate it. But, it got better as they reached the island and people started to die.The book is about ten uncaught murders who are lured onto an island by a strange man. As their darkest secrets about their horrible past are reavealed, they start dying one by one. At first they think that the deaths are accidents or even suicides. Then they believe that there is someone else on the island with them, but after looking around the island, they realize that they are the only ones there. So they begin to suspect each other. Every one is a suspect here.I really liked this book and would recomend it to anybody who like mysteries. It kept me guessing the whole time."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I had a choice of 3 books to read for my high shcool summer reading: Dandelion Wine, Ordinary People, and And Then There Were None. I chose And Then There Were None because of the title and what it said on the back of the book. The book starts out by introducing all ten of the characters. This part was very boring because there was no action. I talks about how they got invited to the island. Although this part may seem boring, it gets better as they reach the island and people start to die. This book is about ten uncaught murders who are lured to an Island off the Devon coast. As the people start to reveal their secrets, they also start to die, one by one. At first they suspect that it was an accident, then they suspect that there is someone else on the small island with them, but as they search the island and find that there is nobody else, they begin to suspect each other. Every one is a suspect. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recomend it to other people. It kept me guessing the whole time."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is Christie's best book. I loved it. The atmosphere is scary, the plot is magnificent and filled with tension, the characters are believeable and great as well as the setting, which is marvelous. You are kept in suspence until the very last chapter where it is wonderfully explained to you. A sheer thrill, and a great expereince. Definatly read this, as it Agatha Christie's best novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I just read this book for my summer reading program! It was the BEST book I've ever read. I kept thinking about the murderers and I was always wrong. This was the first Agatha Christie book and I will most definetly be reading more of her books. She makes you think of different things that never end up to be true so you're always in suspence! Definetly read this book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Okay, I confess that halfway thorough reading &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; I glanced at the last page and figured out who the murderer was. (Not that I'm suggesting you do the same thing if you haven't read it!) But even after that, I sometimes second-guessed myself and thought it was someone else. That's how good this book is; Suspense all the way through, along with plenty of wit, great characters and writing, amd that &quot;veddy, veddy&quot; British atmosphere to spare. Yes, it probably is one of the greatest mystery novels of all time. This is the only Agatha Christie book I've read so far. I hope all her others are just as good."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"It was a great novel. It got me thinking and wondering who the murder could possably be. The ending is execlent and leaves you craving for more."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I found this book to be captivating. For anyone interested in reading it, I suggest choosing a character in the book who you think is the murderer. I did this and thought until the very end that I was right - I had Agatha Christie all figured out after reading her for the first time. This book was memorable to me because I really didn't have it all figured out - I was dead wrong! Try it for yourself."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"There were ten people gathered on a mysterious island. The night they get there a recording comes on convicting every person of a murder. From then on the people die one by one according to a rhyme. In the end everyone was dead and nobody could figure out how they died. If you want to find out who the host was,who the murderer was,and how all the people on the island were killed, you will have to read the book. This book was an excellent book if you are the kind of person that likes being in suspense thoughout the book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"A wonderful mix of emotion , creativity, and imagination, And Then There Were None is a phenomenal murder-mystery book that pulls you into the story, and keeps you always on your toes and guessing. Agatha Christie did a remarkable job in providing vivid details about the characters and their emotions and personalities, specific scenes in the book's plot and important events, and did an over-all fantastic job at providing just enough information to make you think you know the killer, but not enough to make you sure. The use of a poem to represent things to come is a nice touch to the eerie and coincidental sequence of events. One moment the book might lead you to believe that you know the person guilty of the murders, and then evidence is introduced that makes you believe it's someone else. Sometimes you think is the murderer becomes the victim of a murderer. Definitely a book that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"My gosh, this is the best book ever! It has a great plot. It's confusing in the beginning, but as you read it, it'll make sense to you. This is my first Christie, and I think it's probably the best!!! I'm forcing my mom to read it!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I guessed at the murderer until the very end and I was wrong. You wouldn't believe the plot if I just told you. If you only buy one Agatha Christie book this is the one to choose. I have read some of her other books and this is my favorite. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I had read this as a class assignment, and I was expecting it to be stupid and dull as the other books have been. But i thought worng! I realized how thought out the whole story was! I mean she thought of EVERY SINGLE DETAIL and then some... When I was reading i couldnt put the book down, and when i did, i found myself casually trying to figure out who the killer was. She is REALLLYYY good at what she does because i had no clue what-so-ever. And now looking back on the book i saw that if i had thought hard enough i could have figured it out. I DEFINATLY have to recomend this to you if you are a 1st time Christie reader! and if you are a first time reader- my advice to you (when u read any of her books) DONT RULE ANYONE OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It had a certain quality about it that I liked."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is the greatest ever. I couldn't put it down, I stayed up half the night reading it. I love the way that Agatha Christie leads you one way, and then takes a drastic turn the other."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"A throughly enjoyable novel. The plot is very good and its well written. One of Agatha Christie's best. Though I do prefer the other title, Ten Little Indians."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was by far the best mystery novel I've ever read"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I would recommended this book to anyone I know. It was so suspensful and entertaining. This book never let me down. I am definately going to read it again. If you love Agatha Christie read this book right away. I had to read this book as a child in school and I am so happy I did."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"After you've read the last chapter, you'll see that this one is much more of a &quot;how&quot; dunnit than a &quot;whodunnit&quot; (no peeking, please). The denouement is truly spectacular! Buy this book; you will NOT be disappointed. Agatha Christie's plotting skills approach the genius level. By the way, if you want to experience a highly unusual tale from the mind of Dame Christie, check out the killer in Endless Night, a superb 5-star psychological murder mystery. Cheers!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I just loved this book I don\`t really like books that talk about death but this one I liked."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I read this book when I was 13, and it may have been one of the first books I read that I've never been able to stop thinking about. The twist at the end is so genius, I've been recommending it for years. In some ways I'm sorry this was the first Christie book I read because I haven't felt any of the titles I've read subsequently have been as good, but I know that's due to this being one of the best mysteries ever written."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is a suspenseful read- it's killer! It will scare you at times as the guests go insane in their own ways.It is an action-packed novel with many twists and turns. The fact that the crimes are based on a nursery rhyme adds a childish cruelty to it. We loved the remote macabre setting on Indian Island.Our guess as to who the murderer was continually changed; a suspicious character would die and we'd be kept guessing. Suspicion is placed on everyone, making it easier or harder (depending on how you look at it) to like or dislike specific characters. The actual deaths are so creepy that it will give you chills.Even when you are finished reading the book you'll spend many days after thinking about it. This book is awesome-- we recommend it!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"What a wonderful murder mystery! I did not want to put it down, and didn't aside from a lunch break which I would have read on then too if we were not in a restaurant! I have to admit I don't think I have ever read any Agatha Cristie novels but now I am hooked! I can't wait to read more.The ending was a huge surprise and I thought I had it all figured out. Fantastic book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"It's good, it's really good.Although, there is some pen writing on it, but it's really doesn't matterI like it, and I bought it 'Used before' but it's good :-)"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"A cracking good Agatha Christie murder mystery with no detective (until the very end). Written in 1939 and set in that time, it omits the modern crime-solving techniques and even things like cell phones. It doesn't take long for the reader to be swept up in the situation at hand, however, and to try to guess the identity of the murderer, until he or she is murdered. The end seems a bit contrived, but plausible. A good book for a discussion group."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"If you like thrillers, Agatha Christie will never disappoint you. This novel is well written, the plot is complex and skillfully developed and, in the end, there is a logical answer to the many questions you cannot but ask yourself while reading. Magic and the supernatural are left out and this makes the novel even more fascinating."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"There is a reason that this is the best selling mystery novel of all time. And that reason is that it will successfully fool all but the most vigilant of readers. The premise is simple enough - ten strangers are trapped on an island and one of them is a murderer who picks them off one by one. A major strength of this novel is that the protagonists share a curious trait with the reader - they seem to be pulled into a more passive role and just watch with horror as their inescapable destiny approaches. What seems to be lacking in the book is character development. Because the motivations of the characters must largely remain secret, the narration does not probe too deeply into the thoughts and feelings of this lot. This may leave the reader wanting for the author to more fully explore the hysterics and the paranoia that may develop in this kind of situation. There is little richness to the writing, but the plot is propelled well by quick and natural dialogue, which also forms the majority of the insight that the reader gets into the victims. Overall, the plot and the conclusion are quite fantastical, though do not at all feel contrived, and so this is an enjoyable read that will leave you guessing until the very end."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was published in 1939. You have seen countless movies and read countless books that have tried to recreate this story. A classic mystery with great characters."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is really good, and you never see what happens.Its a little freaky, so i would not recommend it to young children."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I remember watching the movie \\"Ten Little Indians\\" as a young adult and thoroughly enjoying it. As an adult I realized I'd never read any of Agatha Chistie's novels and settled on this one. It was so enjoyable reading the novel and realizing thedifferences from the movie. If you enjoyed the movie you should read the book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Christie begins with a not-anything-special-but-it's-good sort of story line. Nothing an avid reader hasn't seen before. (I imagine Ellen Raskin got the idea of the Westing Game from this story). We are introduced to Indian Island, once owned by an American millionaire (yes, the story is British), who has sold his estate-on-the-island-- it's the hit of the news, and everyone wants to be there. Problem?--nobody knows exactly who has bought it. Rumors are flying and facts are few.In the meantime, 10 different people, all with various backgrounds are contacted in various ways, none connected directly with the new owner of Indian Island. Reluctantly and happily and angrilly, our guests come to the island and get to know each other during the boat ride. The shock comes after they arrive. It seems that Mr. Owens, the supposed owner of the estate, has not arrived. In fact, it does seem that he does not arrive for the entire duration of their stay!The guests are surprised, but carry on normally, some planning to go back home on the morrow, when the boat comes to the island. When the guests go to their rooms, they see a plaque on the hearth, the grotesque poem of the Indian boys (10, then 9, then 8, and etc, all dying in grotesque ways). They think nothing of this, some even fond of the old rhyme they knew as chidlren. Nor do they think anything strange of the 10 Indian figures placed on the dining table.The real shock comes when suddenly, during a quiet time, a recording booms aloud, stating each of our tenants, and a murder(s) they have committed. Naturally this angers/confuses/arouses suspicion/guilt from our tenants, and they demand explanations. It doesn't help when a guest dies, then another, then another, then another.....all like the ways described in the grotesque poem on the plaque.After the third or fourth death, the remaining guests decide that the murderer (they came to the conclusion that it was a murder), was one of them!!The conclusion is awesome, bringing you to the edge of your chair, with suspense ringing in the air. I can almost guarantee you will be shocked.Can you find the murderer before it's too late?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This classic Christie whodunit has borne three different titles, which has been the source of some confusion. Originally published in England under the title \\"Ten Little Niggers\\" in 1939, it was retitled \\"And Then There Were None\\" for its 1940 American edition for obvious reasons. However, the English stage version of 1943 retained the \\"Niggers\\" title while the American stage version ran as \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" Even more confusingly, the first film version, released in 1945, bore the American \\"And Then There Were None\\" title, while the three subsequent adaptations (1965, 1975, and 1989) took the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" title! The original offensive title comes from a Victorian-era music-hall song, which itself was a rip-off of an American song by Septimus Winner, circa 1868. All of which is neither here nor there, but only to help clear up any confusion. I would note that the most recent French edition bears the title \\"Dix petit negres\\", which somehow does not surprise me...As for the actual novel, it's perhaps the ultimate whodunit of the \\"locked house\\" variety. Ten people are summoned to an island off the Devon coast, none of them know each other or their ostensible host. The story starts by showing the ten en route to the island and provides a brief character sketch of each as background. I have to confess that at first, some of the men kind of blend together, and it takes little time to keep straight who is who. Once on the island, the eight guests and two servants wait for their host, who never shows up. Completely cut off from the mainland, they grow restless until one of them dies. When another dies, it can be no mere coincidence, and they realize that one amongst them must be a killer. The rest of the book plays this cat and mouse game all the way out, leaving the reader guessing until the very end. Because of the number of characters, there's not a whole lot of depth to any of them, but the story is obviously plot-driven as opposed to character-driven, so that should come as no surprise. It's an incredibly elaborate (and thus slightly contrived) web that is woven, but great fun, especially in bleak, stormy weather!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I have read a lot of books by Agatha Christie and this is my favorite one. Ten guests are invited to an island by a host who is no where to be found. One by one the guests are murdered according to a nursery rhyme framed in their rooms.I was amazed with the ending of this book. The plot was fabulous. It was a fast read and I couldn't put it down.It was never dull or boring for a minute. After just reading the first chapter, I knew this book would be great and it was. I couldn't believe the ending.It is truly one of the best mystery books ever. I am an avid reader and believe me you will want to read more once you are finished."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"My sister was reading this book for school and she thought it was amazing so i decided to read it. The beginning was quite confusing and hard to understand as the characters were being introduced. Ten unacquainted guests are invited to an island for a relaxing vacation, but as a storm approaches the ten begin to die mysteriously and there is no way to get off of the island. The ten guests are the only ones on the island so the murderer has to be one of them. After only one guest is left alive on the island they have to be the murderer, right? But with Christie you never know. This book is edge of your seat exciting with twists and turns around every corner. It is a must read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Christie has some many books which could be termed \\"her best\\" that the title becomes somewhat cliche. Almost all Christie's book could be considered her ebst, from my personal favourite \\"Death Comes As The End\\", to the one i liked least \\"Passenger to Frankfurt\\" which i am sure many other people loved.All of her books are ingenious, intriguing, and feature a mind-bending puzzle or a fast-paced adventure.This is no exception. this is porobably one of her most famous, and it's easy to see why. it's completely original and the solution is so unexpected...The plot runs at such high speed...there's practically a death per chapter...and each person who pops their clogs is murdered in tune with the rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\". there is a subtle build up of suspense and terror until the final two people remain on the small island, isolated from the world, convinced the other is the killer. paranoia runs rife among the final few victims, and when at last the final ones gets it, we think it's all been sorted out. but oh no.In the final chapter christie pulls of a brilliant twist, and one that i totally did not see coming. she really pulls the wool over the readers eyes.a very enjoyable book. highly reccomended"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book I ever read, but it was definatly not the last. Although the first chapter is a tad bit slow it gives you important information on the many characters. I love it when a book has a twist at the end, and this is a perfect example! This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read quite a few; I advise this to anyone who likes mystery and suspense books."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was the first Agartha Christie book I ever read (since then I have read many more because of this books excellence), and thought this book was excellent.

I have it in both languages, English and Arabic, and also the Arabic copy was translated by a Doctor of the Arabic literature, so it was something fabulous to read in Arabic, too.You can't guess who is the killer, even if you guessed, your guessing will die with the person in his turn,so you have to guess again, and again the death will be faster than you, and so it is.In the end, you wont the believe that killer was:..., well discover it by yourself, it is worth."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is Agatha Christie's finest novel.

You want to go to the back of the book, but you knew if you did it would spoil the whole book!

It all starts off when ten people: Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard, Vera Claythrone, Emily Brent, William Blore, Edward Armstrong, Anthony Marston, and Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are all invited to Indian Island. They get inside and talk, and then, a record plays &quot;FREEZE! You are all charged with the following indictments.&quot; After everyone has recovered from the shock and told their story, they casually start to drink, but the first person to drink dies!

But who...?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"You will probably want to read this book in one sitting. It's the classic &quot;locked room&quot; mystery. Ten people are on an island, no one can get on and no one can get off. One by one, people start to die for their previously unpunished crimes.What I think makes the suspense in this book work so well is that we all have, to varying degrees, a guilty conscience. We've probably all gotten away with something at one time or another. But questions always remain in our minds: Does somebody really know about it? Will I really go unpunished? The killer in &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; may just be what we all fear, the one person who knows our sins, and who's not going to let us get away with it. It's that fear that drives the suspense in this book. Any way you may look at it though, it's still hard to set this book down once you start it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book Then There Were None is an extremely good book. It starts out with ten strangers on an island with an unknown host. Then, they start being killed one by one. It all comes together at the end. This was one of the best books I have ever read. The beginning is hard to follow, but the end is very intense."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was my first Agatha Christie book. I knew she was the famed &quot;best selling mystery writer&quot; and I guess when you hear all the hype your expectations soar. While the book wasn't bad, I found some of it perplexing and somewhat difficult to swallow. While the motive was sneaky, I didn't feel that Christie persuaded me enought to make it believable. None the less, I tried another book...&quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;. Please look up that book to see my review on it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, this book was still very entertaining. If you do like this book, you might want to try _Toward Zero_ and _They Came to Baghdad_, which are my second favorite Agatha Christies."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I certainly agree with all these fanatical reviews. But I feel I must defend the play. Yes, it's simpler, and more innocent, but it's not a cop-out. The reviewer of Jan. 11, 1999 should note that Lombard and Vera are NOT murderers in the play--they both wind up being innocent of their charges, so it is not a matter of two murderers getting married.Having said that, the book is certainly wonderful, extremely detailed and of course suspenseful."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Wow, this was a really great book, it was the first book I ever read that I really LOVED.

This one is superb for its plot and the way it is developed around an ancient poem about ten indians. The most classic line in the poem(&amp;story) would probably be &quot;A red herring got him&quot;. However, Christie's stories donot have a very good character introduction. They are somewhat dumped on us in the first few pages. Professor Moriarty would object to that."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I liked this book a lot, and I know that you hvae already read many reviews dealing with the many parts of the book that were good, and I feel that you shold here some of the less entertaining parts, if indeed you wish to read this book. 1. The beg. is really slow and confusing. I suggest that you write down a little note about each charater as they are introduced. There are 10 characters that make the story hard to follow if you don't know why they are there, and their secrets. 2. I did like the ending of the book (the killer and how he/she did it), but the writing style wasn't for me. There is 2 endings, 1 being explained by police (i was excited about reading the killer,so i kinda didn't pay attention), and the ending by the killer (which was very easy to follow, but not written the way the rest of the book was.I think this book is very very clever (clever is the word).

I had no idea who the killer was nor did I find any clues in the reading of the story.

Using an old nursury rhyme, she fuses the whole book together and instantly pulls you in. One bad thing I'd like to say about this book, however, is that some of the ideas and psycology behind the murders was kind of crazy, and a little TOO well planned. It just doesn't happen that there is a perfect place for a murder and a perfect little motto for it as well as the perfect victim. In her defense, mysteries are usually fiction, and where would all the fun be if something just happened with no suspicious suspects and no motives? People would be sleeping before they finished the book.I would deffinately recommend this book to anyone who wants to try out beginning mysteries, ones that are not as complex as ones by people such as Dorthy Sayers. Great, Great, Great, book, Christie: I just wish that you were still alive for me to congratulate you personally on your wonderful accomplishments and masterpiece."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was a great book. The book was confusing in an interesting way. What I mean by that is the book gets you excited and if you're really into it you might get a little scared.

I read this in my basement in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm (how cliche) and this book scared the hell out of me. The plot is amazing. Buy this book...now!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie is a fictional novel containing a lot of suspense and mystery. In this book, ten strangers are invited to an island off the coast of Devon. There had been rumors about \\"Indian Island\\" in the paper. Most people seemed to think it was owned by a crazy millionaire. When the ten people arrive at the island, they go into the dining room. There, they hear a voice over the loudspeaker. It tells them what all of them had been hiding inside, hoping no one would find out about it. The voice tells them that they are each charged with a crime of murder that they committed in the past. They had never been convicted, because there was no proof against them, but they all knew that they did it. Soon, all of the people begin to die. One by one, they are killed, and their deaths go along with the rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" As the first few people die, the others are trying to figure out who the killer is. By the end of the book, they have all died, and no one would guess the outcome. You will have to read it for yourself to find out.I really liked this book. It was so suspenseful; it made me want to keep reading and reading. This was the first Agatha Christie book that I have read, but it definitely won't be the last. The only part of the book that I didn't like was the beginning. It was boring because the author took so long to get out the background information. Once that was over, and the book really started, I couldn't take my eyes off the book because it was so good. I would recommend this book to anyone, if you like reading or not.Garret H."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"It took about a week's worth of reading \\"And Then There Were None\\" a couple hours each night to complete, but this is the kind of novel you could mow through in a single day. I was hooked by page ten in no small part because of Christie's ability to revolve swiftly through the cast of characters in setting up her story's premise. That premise has been so overused in Hollywood movies (John Carpenter's \\"The Thing,\\" Arnold Swarzenneger's \\"Predator,\\" and this year's \\"Identity\\") it is truly remarkable to note that it all began with Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians/And Then There Were None in 1939.This is one of those books that you should read in your lifetime, man. It played a key role in elevating mystery/detective fiction to a level that has not been duplicated nor surpassed in more than a half century, and despite many charming and flamboyant egos that have climbed to the highest heights of popular fiction charts none have matched what Agatha Christie brought to our public consciousness when she published And Then There Were None. It epitomizes the word \\"classic\\" in its truest sense. It is _the_ book for you!Staceyauthor ofCLAWS: A Suspense Novel"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None was a book that had little interest to me. I love mysteries and trying to solve them along the way, but with this book I soon lost my interest. I have been an Agatha Christie fan for two years now and have to say that I was completely disappointed by the way which this book was written. Not only were there to many characters, but there was also very little description. Which is so unlike Agatha to do. I will continue to be an Agatha fan, but hopefully the next book, which I read will hold my attention a little more."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And no, I don't refer in my title to the dark secret of who the murderer eventually turns out to be! (Although it's a good one, and a surprise!) I refer instead to what many here are unaware of, which is that this book had two previous titles. \\"Ten Little Indians\\" is the one people are most aware of. But the FIRST title of this book -- a PUBLISHED title, not just something Christie proposed and had rejected -- was \\"Ten Little Niggers.\\" And the poem in the book was originally the same, referring to \\"niggers\\" and not Indians. I purchased the \\"Agatha Christie Companion\\" for my mother as a gift and we discovered that as we were flipping through it. They even included the original poem! We both remain fans of Christie, chalking this up to the fact that she was a product of her times, but it's still something people should know! I took one star off for it myself, although Native Americans might still be offended by the second title, and the revised poem. Maybe as the world gets more PC, they'll update the book again so that the poem is called \\"Ten Guilty White People\\" . . . or would that give too much away?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was probably a big hit in its day but it seems pretty cheesy. My son needed to read it for his 8th grade English class. There are much better books out there. I am not quite sure why they picked this book. The word &#34;queer&#34; is used quite often which would give these students a very low grade (if they were writing a paper) for repeating the same word not to mention it made them laugh every time they read the word. At first, it is hard to keep track of who each character is. It didn't hold my interest. Many people enjoy this type of writing, but based on this book, I would not read another one of her books. I understand it had a original title different from this. I didn't appreciate that and maybe it was acceptable during its time but it doesn't sit well with me. Google it if you want to learn more. Instead of ten little soldiers it was ten little Indians which was changed from ten little (not a word I would repeat)."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book, And then there were none, was thought to be the best mystery novel of all time. Ten strangers are all brought to a mysterious island with an unknown host. Once all the guest have arrived, the hosts accuses them all of murder. They will later find out they can't leave this island and start telling each other of their well kept secrets.This story isn't a bad read. The high school level in general should be perfect for anybody who wants to read it. The mystery keeps you wanting to read more and more until you realize wow, I am already half way done. It shows imagery of the killings and how people who are strangers will somewhat start working with each other if necessary. All guest have something they wouldn't want anybody finding out, but when people are dying, humans do strange things."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is a fabulous mystery novel, a classic. I would recommend it to one and all. HOWEVER, this particular edition is missing a vital component, namely the list and description of the major characters which has been included at the beginnning of every Agatha Christy novel that I have read, including other editions of this one. The ommission of this list makes it extremely difficult for anyone not familiar with the book to follow the plot. The reasoning behind St. Martin's Press's decision to ommitt this list of characters is indeed a mystery worth solving. My advice is to find another edition of the book elsewhere. Amazon needs to sell an editon which includes this important element."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie has been an expert at tricking readers into finding a murderer. And there is no exception in this book. Christie was an author with big brains. This book features a murderer using the 'Ten Little Indians' poem to kill ten guests gathered around from mysterious letters. In the beginning, it starts up with each character introudcing themselves, thinking of what they would be doing.It is a great book: and the killer isn't who you think until you get to about the 3rd person. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because some of the characters were beyond crazy. A previous Christie book I'd read: the dialogue was more calmed and stretched out, while this was all in a rush. That shouldn't stop you from buying the book, though. Another reason I gave this only 4 stars was because the killer was pretty obvious by the end. It has happened in some of the other Christie books, but there was also more to the story.But, in the end: you cannot put this book again. I'd thought someone else was the killer, and someone else had the motive, but it seems that was definitely true. Christie models her books like professionally carved sculptures. Just remember: the obviously stated isn't always obvious.Overall Rating: 4.6/5Pros: Very great book, you can't put it down, based on the Ten Little Indians poemCons: The dialogue is stretched out, and everyone is frantic, and frightened so much, the killer is obvious"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None is an excellent mystery novel.

Supposedly, Agatha Christie is this awesome mystery writer who writes all these amazing books. Granite, the premise of the book is quite interesting. All the murders are based on a children's poem- the order in which they happen and the method. It is a shame that Christie could not deliver on such a surprisingly novel idea.Also, her lack of \\"clues\\" in a mystery book was disappointing.

This is because it is fun to read, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are many twists in the book concerning who the murderer really is. Each murder is filled with suspense and mystery that keeps you wondering about who killed the victim. When you think that you know who the murderer is, this book will prove you wrong.

These ten random people get invited to a island. But there is a trick. They all are getting killed one by one. They can't find the killer and don't know it is one of them. They are all so confused which causes them to not be alert and be killed. This is a great read because you never know who is going to get killed next and don't know the killer while you are reading.

Ten strangers are invited to Indian Island by a mysterious host, U.N. Owen. They then die one by one according to the nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians (the book is also sold with this title). The book starts off slow, all the characters are introduced. This part can be boring, but once you know all the characters and the first couple deaths occur, it becomes the most exciting book I've ever read. The strangers determine that it has to be one of them who has been responsible for the deaths. By the time there are five people on the island, it appears to be obvious who the killer is, but then that person dies. After that you become puzzled, as the remaining people all appear to be honest and righteous people. The ending is one that nobody could possibly guess without help. There is also a movie, which I have never seen, but if it is anything like the book I am sure I would recommend the movie as well. Part of the reason why I enjoyed this book so much is because my favorite character, Phillip Lombard, was one of the last ones to die. If your favorite character dies early in the book, you may not enjoy it as much as I did. However, if you like mysteries you will still enjoy it. When you compare And Then There Were None to other Christie books one negative is that Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple are not in it. They are both great detectives and greatly increase the excitement of books they are in. Those negatives nonwithstanding, this is probably the best and most exciting book I've ever read, and I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"One day, I was browsing online on Amazon, I saw this book.

For instance, I dont like the fact that the author introduces the characters at the same time pretty much. I didnt like this because it was to hard to figure out who is doing what until some of them start dieing. On the other hand, there are many things that I liked about the book.

But, in any case, those two sentences--which even to my fourth-grade eyes seemed awfully inept--were what stayed with me from the book, more than anything else. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is widely considered to be Agatha Christie's masterpiece, the sheer ingeniousness of the plot mixing with an aura of impending doom to make an overwhelming reading experience. I guess that's true, and maybe I'm just too picky, but I keep thinking how much better the book would have been if written by, say, Raymond Chandler, or someone else who knew how to write a decent sentence.

Judge Wargrave begins an inquiry. One of the group is a private detective hired to watch the others! The guests tell of their past (Chapter 4). They cannot leave until next morning. One man finishes his drink then collapsed on the floor. It was cyanide (Chapter 5)! The cook and housekeeper died in the night (Chapter 6). Three of the men decided to search the island (Chapter 7). No one was found (Chapter 8). Then another guest is found dead; it wasn't an accident (Chapter 9). The judge offers his solution.

The elderly spinster did not join the others (Chapter 12). Philips's revolver is missing! Vera gets a shock when she goes to her room (Chapter 13). The rest of them learn why the judge stayed behind. The remaining four go to their bedrooms and lock their doors (Chapter 14). The detective sees a man leaving the house; they trail him and find he had disappeared! The three remaining try to signal the mainland but fail (Chapter 15). Another man is killed by a falling block of marble. The last two see a body at the water's edge; that missing man was found!

The last pages have a manuscript that was in a sealed bottle found floating in the sea. It is a confession from the killer that explains the mystery. [Does the story seem believable with all of its dependencies?] Christie's story seems to mock some of the authorities of society (judges, doctors, police, army, religious believers) and ordinary people. What was she thinking? [The movie improved the story by modifying its ending. It seems more realistic that way. \\"The best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray.\\"]This very popular and successful novel may have inspired Raymond Chandler to write his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\" which criticized authors who wrote mystery novels designed to produce a puzzle for the entertainment of their readers. [Some mystery novels are also educational.] Yet her stories made Christie rich and famous, the #1 mystery writer. In his lifetime Erle Stanley Gardner was the \\"World's Greatest Author\\" since his novels outsold the combined totals of his competitors. His books were criticized by some, probably because Gardner formed \\"The Court of Last Resort\\" to free the innocent convicted. They also educated people about the law. Gardner's name is found in \\"The Legal 100\\". Gardner, like Christie, did not burden his novels with the descriptive background details found in Chandler's novels. Chandler's talents with words found him employment as a Hollywood scriptwriter."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book came in like I bought it from a store.

The remaining survivors do their best to defend themselves and identify the person killing them, addressing the issue of whether it's one of them or someone hidden on the island. The rapid-fire beginning introduction of characters is supplemented well by their words and actions on the island, so they become clear. The clues are there, but this reader found them subtle enough to miss sometimes, and only obvious in the retrospect of the ending revelations.

Considering this book was written in (I believe) 1939, I thought I was going to be suffering through a boring, outdated novel. For once I will admit I was dead wrong.Most people, whether they realize it or not, are familiar with the concept of this book. The most recent time it's been used was actually on a very funny episode of Family Guy. The concept is this: A large group of people from the same town are lured onto a remote island where a lone mansion sits. Someone among the guests is a killer, and the guests try to figure out who among them is the raving lunatic before it's too late. The idea is so simple, but so perfect for a suspenseful mystery.And Then There Were None was reprinted this year, so minor changes were made. Rather than than the \\"indian island\\" and \\"ten little indians\\" you'll hear other reviewers mentioning are now \\"soldier island\\" and \\"ten little soldier boys\\" - I'm assuming this is to avoid any implication of racism. However, the original plot still stands: 10 strangers are lured onto Soldier Island, off of the Devon (pronounced dev-ehn) coast. In every room of the house, a poster of a nursery rhyme hangs, about Ten Little Soldier Boys. After their first group meal, the housekeeper plays a recording as instructed by the man he claims is his boss- a mysterious (and yet to be seen) Mr. Owen.The recording accuses all the guests of indirect murders. Not long after, one of the guests chokes on his food- as per the first verse of the nursery rhyme, where \\"he choked his little self and then there were nine\\". It's not long until the guests realize they're being attacked in accordance to the rhyme and that the murderer is among them. But will they unmask the murderer before it's too late?The book keeps you reading until the very last page. And yes, that does include the two epilogues...

I savor every speck of the page. I don't want the end of the book to be the end---every time I hope that by some impossible miracle, there will be more. I can't bear the thought that when I have read all the books...there WILL be no more! The brilliant writer herself, Agatha Christie, has passed on, and, therefore, has the possibility of new books. Meantime, I relish her enchanting plots and twisting story lines to the fullest extent, and as of a result, there has never been, and never will be a book of hers that I will not like. But this book, And Then There Were None, surpassed them all. It was glowing! Radiant! The book contains so much suspense and excitement, and general eerieness that I couldn't put it down. The whole concept of basing a murder story on a nursery rhyme is chilling, and brilliant, not to mention the beautiful language and expressive characters. And Then There Were None sent chills down my spine, and as the victims captive on Soldier Island were struck down one by one, my eyes grew larger. I was entranced by the magical spell Agatha Christie had spun in her book, and always will be. This book is a classic. Gorgeous. Spell-binding.

No kidding."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Chrisite's &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (Previously printed as &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;) is mystery's #1 bestseller. This book is fascinating, alluring, and most of all, mysterious (of course). The book is about ten strangers called to Indian Island through letters and telegrams. When they arrive, their host seems to be absent. A voice from the walls accuses all of them of being responsible for someone else's death. And as in the poem &quot;Ten Little Indians,&quot; they slowly begin to die."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agath Christie has written a great book in And Then There Were None. At the end of the book comes a great surprise. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. A must read for Agatha Christie fans."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I had to read this book for English class. I was a little skeptical at first. I started reading it, and got really involved. I honeslty couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in two nights, reading over 110 pages the last. I had to find out who did it. Needless to say, I wasn't teh first to read the entire thing, or read the last few apges, so the word got out. I still was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and was so shocked at the ending. This is a GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is truly the best book ever written!! It's no wonder Christie is called &quot;The Queen of Crime!&quot; It keeps you guessing right until the end! You'd never guess the killer. It's the first Christie book I've read, and I think it's going to be better than any of her other books."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"this book is a great thriller for almost all ages and it has the best ending but that i cant tell u unless u read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"While I loved the movie, I was not prepared for the difference in the endings between the book and the movie. Reminds me of the two movie versions of The Vanishing, American and German.This is a must-read for mystery writers. A true old-fashioned thriller and if you love Christie, this is her best."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the best mystery ever written and I have read all the others. I suffered through their illogical plot twists, characters and facts introduced in the last 10 pages, hackneyed conversations, impossible and incorrect technical events, enemies turned best friends for no reason, and actions totally out of character.None of that here. Ten people go to an island and all end up dead and no one knows who is responsible. I read it twice and did not have any idea. Then a clever literary tactic is employed to reveal the secret. It all fits together perfectly, there were clues, I should have figured it out, but Dame Christie is too good and too clever for any of us.The 10 Indians are all implicated in crimes for which they can not be punished in a court so instead they will receive their just rewards in this world and the next on this forsaken island.But what to do when a majority of your housemates are already dead? Whom do you trust to form a possible alliance? Finally, what if it is you and one other person whom you thought you could trust. Pay particular attention to the nursery rhyme reference to the red herring.Read the book and skip the film. There have been several versions, mostly under the title of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. In a fit of sheer irresponsibility and lunacy, the movie makers changed the ending. They thought it would be more clever and easier to film, but they were wrong. Why mess with perfection?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people are invited to stay all isolated on Indian Island by a mysterious Mr. Owen. The guests however, discover that there is more than meets the eye with the ten people invited. They all have a mysterious past that links them together and shall fall prey to Mr. Owen's plan one by one.This book is a great murder mystery that should be read by anyone with sense. It shows that Agatha Christie is truly the Queen of Crime. This story is no different. The plot is intriguing. Who wouldn't want to read a murder mystery where a mysterious host invites ten people then kills them off one by one? In the end, you get to find out the murderer too. This book might be a bit boring to those with either no or little patience since all of her books tend to start off quite dull. By chapter 3 or 4 the story should get interesting. So all you people out there that haven't read it before, read it. Read it before but stopped cause the beginning was boring, read it again. This book deserves a special place reserved in your bookshelf for years to come."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None : A Novel is a classic who dunit story written by the incredible Agatha Christie. The story centers on a group of people whom have all been summoned to an island. The plot is thick with suspense, psychology and moral and ethical issues. The descriptors used are great and the story is multi faceted and one never is able to figure out the killer and when it is revelead I was quite shocked.

I loved this novel it made me guess from the begging to shocking ending.I love how it ended, books these days would never end like it did. The characters are greatly written. I recomand this book.

A classic novel a must read."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the most intriguing well written mystery I have ever read. You can not put this book or any book by Agatha Christie down until you have completely finished it. This murder mystery is elaborate in detail and the suspense is incredible. I enjoyed reading every word of this book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This novel should have come with a warning.DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE SEVERELY PARANOIDBecause the machinations at the heart of this novel is that there are no secrets, even between strangers. And who knows, maybe one day, someone very evil and demented will happen upon the very thread that linked them all and pull at it. With devastating consequences.Strangers stranded on an island is nothing new in the literature world, but strangers on a comfy island and getting nicked one by one is new, not to mention when after a while, no one else is left!Toying with this plot, which Agatha Christie claimed to be the most taxing plot of them all, the story unfolds with a very energetic, very handsome man speeding down a road in a new shiny car with the women swooning after him. A few chapters later we see him choking on his drink while dining, and seconds later died. The first line of the nursery rhyme has been realised, and there are nine more to follow...Christie's toying with the rhyme is very delightful, albeit cruel and frightening. There was a moment where the characters were discussing about the rhyme and wondering where in the world would their demented tormentor find a red herring or a bear, as suggested in these lines:Four Little Indian boys going out to seaA red herring swallowed one and then there were three.Three Little Indian boys walking to the zooA big bear hugged one and then there were two.Without giving anything away, suffice to say that Agatha Christie got her bear and red herring just the way she wanted them. And the ending is simply haunting and depressive. Not your usual Christie, but her best ever."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is brilliant. I would have never guessed that ending. It was the best murder mystery I've ever read, and it was just for my pre-ap English class. It never gets boring. I would reccomend this book to anybody. Trust me, once you start reading, you can't stop."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; one choked his little self and then there were nine...One little Indian boy left all alone; he went and hanged himself and then there were none...This old nursery rhyme is the foundation of &iexcl;And Then There Were None,&quot; by Agatha Christie, who is also known as the Queen of Crime. This mystery is teeming with suspense, thrills, and surprises.The story begins with the rendezvous of ten strangers on Indian Island, a private island off the coast of Devon, England. An unknown host or hostess has invited the guests there for the weekend. However, the host never appears; instead, the sinful past of each guest is unwillingly revealed. One by one the sinners are punished for misdeeds from their dark past. Suddenly, the livings are amidst the dead and the guests are murdered in the same manner that the Indian boys die in the Nursery rhyme. Another element in the story that makes the hair raises on your neck is that there is ten Indian figures on a table in the main lobby. As each guest dies, one figure disappears...Agatha Christie manipulates the personalities of the characters well. She depicts their fear and sense of desperation through her clever usage of words. As the only ten people on the isolated Indian Island die one after another, Christie shows the helplessness and desperation of the survivors and she beautifully grasps the human emotions of the characters well.Another interesting technique of writing used by Agatha Christie is that she portrays the guests like normal people who have amiable and caring personalities. The readers will definitely a connection to them and even begin to like them. However, when the awful crimes of these seemingly innocent individuals are revealed, the readers will face a conundrum &iexcl;V whether to fear for the lives of the characters or to fear them.This mystery also deals with the theme of justice and law, and how if ending the lives of the guilty out side the law are justified.Each of the guests on the island are found not guilty by the courts for crimes they had committed. The murderer, by killing these ten individuals, seems to seek justice where the courts had failed. Through this dilemma, Christie forces the readers to ponder whether seeking justice outside the law is morally acceptable, especially for cases in which the courts have failed."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Also published as \\"Ten Little Indians\\", Agatha Christie's classic mystery is still one of my favorites. Ten people come to a remote island, all vaguely invited under false pretenses. With their hosts nowhere to be seen, they have a quiet dinner until a disembodied voice accuses each of them of murder. Of course, everyone claims innocence, but when the guests begin to die one by one, the accusations seem to have some merit. And they can only conclude that there is a true murderer in their midst. This mystery is a fantasy about the art of crime, and is one of Christie's more famous ones. It may not be her best book, but it is quite a delightful tale."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"and I'm no kid, believe me. I didn't think I'd like mystery, but this one makes me want to come back for more. It was assigned for my daughter's English class at school, so I picked it up and read it -- in one day. It kept me guessing and flipping back to find clues all the way to the end. Bravo!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"very entertaining mystery, suspenseful and engaging - you are trying to figure it out all along, and then the ending just blows you away. (Well it did me, anyhow.) Lots of fun - great way to kill some time on a lazy day. Don't read it when you're really busy though or you won't be able to put it down and you won't be able to get anything else done!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I don't see how anyone who relishes a quality 'whodunit' could fail to love this book (even though a few Amazon reviews below show that it is the case). I am familiar with quite a number of Agatha Christies (including classics like Roger Ackroyd & Orient Express, etc.), and this one clearly takes the prize. Everything about it is delicious: the inescapable island setting, the strange circumstances, the unfolding pattern, and the overall feeling of a growing and inevitable horror. Most excellent of all is the plot, which is brilliantly conceived and executed. And at the end of the day, the author has played fair (I'll make one complaint below). What more do you want?!There are only two (mostly minor) criticisms I would make. IMO, the first keeps this story from being the perfect murder mystery. Namely, there is an early scene in which the killer THINKS a deceptive thought (I won't type it here and ruin the story for any prospective reader), and the reader reads it. This is an unfair slip on Agatha's part. Sure enough the murderer might indeed SPEAK such a deceptive sentence, but to have him/her THINK it silently (and then have the reader simply read it at face value) -- I felt this was stretching credibility too far. For a perfectionist like me, it is a pity that it's in the text, and if only it could be excised! Secondly (and AC probably had no control over this), I prefer the British title of the book - Ten Little Indians - over the American and more popular one, which sort of anticipates and gives away too much (albeit subtly). Admittedly not a huge issue, just a quibble.At any rate, mystery lovers you're in for a treat. Enjoy and savor the Grand Dame at her finest!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten Little IndiansImagine you're stuck on an island with ten strangers, and then all of a sudden one by one they start dying. In Agatha Christie's popular mystery book And Then There Were None, ten strangers are brought together on an island by and unknown host, and one by one they start to die.All of the people on the island have a dark secret that's gotten them there in the first place. On the first evening at the mansion on the island an unknown voice reveals the secrets of all the guests on the island.In Agatha Christie's novel the deaths at the island follow a popular nursery rhyme. The deaths occur in the exact order they do in the nursery rhyme. Throughout the book the author shows the thoughts and feelings of each character from his or her view.Once you pick up this book you'll never put it down. Readers will enjoy this book if they like mystery and great suspense. I recommend this book for people from ages 12 to 16. So who is this mystery killer? You'll just have to read it to find out."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book I have ever read, and after the thrilling experience it gave me, it surely won't be the last. It is about ten strangers each lured to an island where they are all accused of murder. All though it is rattling, none of the people take it seriously; until one person drops dead. Suspicions are raised as each person accuses one another as the murderer.As the days progress, more of the ten original guests are murdered in gruesome, sick ways, all according to the children's rhyme of what someone would never suspect.This book is thrilling and mysterious. Agatha's unique style of writing is captivating so that you can't put the book down. You won't be able to figure out \`who done it', when only the dead are above suspicion."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The classic \\"who done it!\\" What most people have come to think of when a murder mystery is mentioned. Most modern day \\"murder mysteries\\" bore me as I usually figure out early on who the culprit is and how the crime was committed. Although I had the \\"who\\" figured out in this mystery, I could not figure out the \\"how.\\" And one thing I absolutely love about a mystery is trying to keep solving it...all the way to the end!Ten people whose lives are not connected in any way, are invited by a very mysterious host(ess) to a luxurious house on a somewhat remote island for a brief getaway. Very soon after their arrival, each is accused of having brought about the death of another person and for that they are to pay. When, one by one, they are discovered dead, it is time to try to figure out who - and where - the killer is and try to stop him or her from continuing their murderous rampage before all are killed!This novel is evenly paced and easy to read. Agatha Christie seems to have covered all of her bases on this one to leave the reader attempting to figure out the clues. The book keeps the reader involved, tracing over the clues and the guests in the house, while moving through the story and wondering - who might be the next victim? And exactly who can the killer be?A well thought out mystery, very well done!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Easily Agatha Christie's best! A claustrophobic mystery par excellence! Supposedly this is the best-selling suspense novel of all time and I can see why. Not only is this an intriguing mental puzzle but it is also (rare among Christie's tales) a genuinely scary read. This creepy, almost supernatural book has a slightly tepid beginning but then heats up to where it cannot be easily put down.A seemingly impossible set of circumstances leads to a number of murders among ten total strangers all trapped on a tiny island off the English coast. One by one these persons, all out of contact with the outside world, each invited for the weekend by a host named \\"U.N. Owen\\" (say that name fast a few times and you get \\"Unknown\\") is accused by a mysterious Voice---that seems to speak out of thin air---of perpetrating a homicide for which he or she was never tried. One individual is said to have purposely drowned a child. Another stands charged with killing his patient during an operation in which he was too drunk to undertake the task. Still another, a forthright judge, is condemned for knowingly sending an innocent man to the gallows. As the plot boils, first one and then another of these unfortunate guests is \\"punished\\" by ghastly deaths that correspond to the verses of a children's rhyme about \\"ten little Indians\\" who meet grim fates until \\"and then there were none.\\"How are these slayings being carried out? Is the killer one of the ten or is there someone else hiding in the house or on the island? By the mid-point of this book, trust me, you'll be dying to know.This is a fine novel of near perfect length and satisfying resolution. Christie gets away with an explanation that might stretch plausibility in other hands but here only seems exactingly perfect. This is the sort of zephyr-paced book to spend a stormy evening reading. It's a lot of fun and doesn't hold a single letdown anyplace within."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie is at her best in this novel. It is the story of 10 seemingly unrelated people who are lured to an isolated island under false pretenses. A copy of the poem &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; is posted and there are 10 figurines representing each Indian. Soon, deaths begin to occur and each time a figurine is smashed or disappears. The guests soon come to the conclusion that nine of them will die and the perpetrator is the only person who will survive. They begin to regard one another with suspicion and they all fear for their lives. Each person has a secret to hide and each has been directly or indirectly responsible for the downfall of another human being. This cleverly crafted novel will keep you riveted and puzzled at the same time. It is definitely one of Agatha Christie's best works."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None (also known as Ten Little Indians) is a good mystery, just like Agatha Christie's other works. It tells of the story of ten anonymous strangers who have been summoned to Indian Island, a remote island off the coast of Devon, England. As the weekend passes, one by one they are murdered and their attempts to get off the island come to nothing. I was kept on my toes as I kept trying to guess who was the culprit. Just like &quot;Death Comes as the End,&quot; another one of Christie's mysteries that are well contrived in the beginning and middle but just make it through at the end, this mystery has a disappointing ending. In a short &quot;Manuscript sent to Scotland Yard&quot;, the culprit is summarily identified. I like Christie's other mysteries in which the culprit is ingeniously and suddenly discovered; in this one, it takes several pages of reading the &quot;manuscript&quot; before one finds out the culprit, and second, there is a practically useless epilogue that the book does not need. However, excepting the ending, this a wonderful and enthralling mystery."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I'm a big Agatha Cristie fan and this is one of her better ones.

I was so scared that every little noise in the house made me jump. I was quite literally on the edge of my seat!

In the intro, the book describes the characters and what they are going for. The background was in the late 1930's. In the newspaper they described who owned the island. The island was called Solider Island or Indian Island. There were ten people who were invited to the inland. On the first night they heard a creepy voice talking about the ten people and of the murders that they had doned. After the creepy voice people got murdered and people got worried and crazy.People were wondering who was killing the people but nobody knew. People were curious who was Mr. Owen and Mrs. Owens. People were getting crazy because someone was on the island with them. This book will keep you on the tip of your seats and you will get creeped out about what will happen to the people.I encourage you to read the epilogue because you will think you are done with the book, but you will be wrong. People think that you are at the end but really you are not. I recommend this book for a lot of reasons. My first reason is if you like mystery and creepy -- this book is for you for sure. Second reason is it was an excellent book and this is one of my favorite books that I have read in years."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Even though she has a household name, I didn't know about Agatha Christie's work until I read Amore Towles' \\"Rules of Civility.\\" Until then I probably would've assumed she was the founder of the famed auction house. It's disappointing to realize her name was never mentioned in any of the various English Literature courses I took in college. It probably has something to do with the snobbery that's unfairly issued to genre fiction. Nevertheless, when I learned of the Queen of Mystery I delved in to her work immediately, starting with \\"And Then There Were None.\\" Reading of its premise reminded me of the board game and movie \\"Clue.\\" This was no mistake. Her most widely read book certainly influenced pop culture, and having read it in a two day span I can see why. This is a book that sucks you. I stayed up until 2 AM on a weeknight just to finish it, something I almost never do. The thought of reading about ten different characters might daunt those who want to know everything that lies inside the hearts and psyches of those they read about. Had Christie provided such details I probably would've skipped the book. In Christie's work murder victims get about a half-page of background and that's it. Only detectives and survivors will ever warrant more. At around 250 pages the work is palatable and brisk. The various murder scenes aren't too gruesome for today's tastes and even at age 71 the book is fun, dark, and suspenseful without manipulating its reader."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Among Agatha Christie's massive collection of published books, three titles stand out:Murder on the Orient Express,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, and this, \\"And Then There Were None\\". Widely considered to be her very best novels, these three titles are notable not just for the ingenuity of their plotting, but for the way they shaped the mystery genre itself. These days, the idea of a conspiracy or an unreliable narrator are commonplace, so much so that readers forget that such tropes had to start somewhere - and that Christie was responsible for creating (or at least popularizing) most of them.In the case of \\"And Then There Were None,\\" the story follows a familiar premise. A group of strangers are lured through deceptive means to an isolated location. There seems to be no obvious connection between any of them. Yet as time goes by, murders begin. One by one they fall victim to an unknown killer...It's a plot that every mystery-lover knows; one that originated in its most recognizable form with Christie herself. Previously titled \\"Ten Little Indians\\" (and before that, something even more offensive), the book was first published in 1939 to rave reviews. It has since become her #1 best-selling mystery, and the one that has undergone the most stage, film, television and radio adaptations. There's even a video game!In this case the isolated location is an island, and the ten guests have all been brought there by various invitations and job offers from a man who signs himself U.N. Owen. The guests are surprised to find that the luxurious modern house is empty except for the help, a husband-and-wife team who are also clueless as to their host's whereabouts and identity. They settle down to wait, only to be shocked and appalled when a gramophone recording informs them why they've all been gathered there: each one of them is guilty of murder, but until now, has managed to evade the law. Now, the time has come for justice.The guests respond with everything from vigorous denial to self-righteous indignation. Among them is a governess accused of deliberately drowning her charge, a doctor who botched an operation, a judge who wrongly sent a man to the gallows, a religious fanatic who cast out a pregnant servant, a hit-and-run driver, and a retired colonel who sent his wife's lover to his death, among others. As their ordeal begins, they soon reach an undeniable conclusion: that with the rest of the island deserted, the killer must already be among them.Counting down the murder victims with the \\"Ten Little Soldiers\\" rhyme that is hung prominently on each bedroom wall, the remaining guests desperately try to outwit the killer. As time passes, the psychological strain and inevitable degeneration into suspicion, fear and ruthlessness marks each character's actions as they fight for survival. Guilt weighs heavily on many of them, and issues of class and gender come into play as each guest attempts to pinpoint the identity of the killer.As the cast is gradually whittled down, the palatable sense of dread grows into a genuinely terrifying atmosphere that quite simply *prevents* the reader from putting the book down until the final pages have been read. With its short chapters that are in turn split into smaller divisions, combined with its relentless pacing and Christie's ability to not waste a single word, I guarantee that you'll be amazed by how quickly you devour this book. Without distractions, you may even manage it in one sitting.Its dark subject matter may throw many readers off guard, for this is about as far away as you can get from Christie's usual \\"cozies\\" that star the fastidious Poirot or fluffy Miss Marple. More of a suspense thriller than a mystery story, the novel is notable for not featuring one of Christie's usual detectives (or even a sympathetic protagonist). At the time of its publication, there had never been anything like it written before, and even now its devastatingly simple premise is riveting.Of course, if you look closely, it is possible to pick several holes in the murderer's plans. The levels of coincidence and contrivance in getting everyone to the island and keeping them there are high, as is the complete infallibility with which the murderer oversees and controls the victims in his plans. At times, it feels as though Fate itself is at work. However, the plot is so well-constructed and the suspense so brilliantly raised over the course of the sixteen chapters that it seems mean-spirited (and self-defeating) to quibble over details.As mentioned, the book's title (and accompanying text) has undergone several changes since its first publication. I believe that some issues still use the terms Indian Island and the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme, but my copy had been changed to Soldier Island and Ten Little Soldiers. I suspect collectors will enjoy the challenge of getting their hands on the older versions of the text, but casual readers can rest assured that the changes in terminology don't affect the story in any way (kept intact are several characters' racist remarks and attitudes, all of which *do* impinge on the plot).I vividly recall the first time I read \\"And Then There Were None\\" and how shaken it left me. If you're reading it for the first time, do whatever you can to avoid being spoiled, and try to savor every chapter. You'll only get to read it for the first time *once*, and though a subsequent read is just as rewarding in appreciating Christie's misdirection and marvelous plotting, it will inevitably be a less terrifying experience the second time around. Whether you are a long-time Christie fan, or have never read a single one of her books in your life, \\"And Then There Were None\\" is an absolute must-read. Rest assured, this is an unforgettable book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Was truely a confusing mystery. In this I mean I thought I knew \\"who dun it\\" but of course I was wrong. Agatha Christie was amazing and in the end it was sooo worth the journey. Very clever mystery and she made it work nicely. A definite read."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None was an amazing novel written by one of the greatest mystery authors, Agatha Christie. The author gets inside the heads of each and every character. It is suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Take a ride through Agatha Cristie's And Then There Were None and be shocked at how the story all comes together in the end."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"One of the all time great mystery novels. I read it in middle school for the first time and fell on love. Still fantastic even as an adult!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"&#34;And Then There Were None&#34; by Agatha Christie - Very satisfying to the Agatha Christie addict who is looking for something other than Marple or Poirot!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Once again another one of her suspenseful, incredible stories. My very best author. I have been a fan since my teenage years."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Good mystery, love the ending. It is a great mystery plot line and i recommend to everyone. Agatha Christie does a great job."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Loved this book when I first read it years ago and still find it a page turner and abook that is hard to put down"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I loved the book And Then There Were None. I myself am not a big mystery fan, but this book was my exception. Every part of it made it more and more interesting and I wanted to read more. It was definitely a page turner, that I simply did not want to put down. The aspect I liked most about this book was how Agatha Christie related all the deaths to the toy solider poem and how every time someone died there was a glass solider removed from that table. It added a spooky element that I thoroughly enjoyed. When you find out who did this murder it is a total left hook, you do not see it coming.In the beginning however I found the book kind of hard to keep up with. There were so many characters being thrown at you at once, I had to reread it a few times to fully understand. However, I kept reading and as I learned more about each character, it became increasingly easier to understand.I thought that the characters were very compelling, each in their own way. The character I specifically enjoyed the most was Miss Vera Claythorne. She was a tough old lady, who held her own throughout the dreadful experience. I found her very interesting particularly her back story, and how it simply drove her mad. I do not want to state too much more because it will give ruin the experience.Another thing I really enjoyed about this book was how diverse Agatha Christie made each character. No two characters were alike. She really went into detail with every single character so you felt like you knew them. The sub-stories she developed for each character were not simple stories, they were complex with intriguing turns every step of the way. I can only imagine the amount of thought she put into each character, because each character left a clear and vivid picture in my mind. This book was very spooky; I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 simply because it is a very scary book with advanced language.Agatha Christie did an amazing job at keeping the suspense throughout the whole book, and showing the fear that each character was experiencing. There were some parts in this book that actually gave me the chills. The thing that I find most astonishing is how Agatha Christies was able to create an enthralling story about these people who would come to an island invited by an unknown man who they cannot even recall meeting. How Miss Christie came up with the plot and was able to develop it into such a suspenseful and entertaining novel is simply beyond me. I loved this book I am thinking about doing it for a big paper next year, because Agatha Christie is a truly brilliant author. I enjoyed this whole entire book and I strongly recommend it. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people are invited to Soldier Island for a very strange vacation. Each guest is hiding a secret from their past. One of them may be hiding murderous intent. Could it be their host, U. N. Own? One after another, they fall. Who is going to be left in the end? This is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mysteries. I loved this novel because it's a very smart whodunit with so much psychological suspense that it made me listen for footsteps at night. The characters are so unique that when thrown together in this surreal conflict, the reader will need to decide who they believe is the most guilty and the most innocent."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie is known as the best mystery writer of all time, and this work proves her status to the fullest."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I love Agatha Christie and this book is one of my favorites. It is a fun, easy read. A 5 star book for sure!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"It took a while to get into this book but once engrossed I still did not anticipate the ending. Enjoyed very much."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Although I have read about 50 Christie mysteries over the years, I never read this book until a few days ago. I never wanted to read this book because I saw the film, &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; which was adapted from the novel and it was a colossal disappointment. The film neatly eviscerates the moral of Christie's story by transforming Vera and Philip Lombard into lovers (two admitted murderers who get away scot-free - how's that for Hollywood's attention to story detail) who escape their island deathtrap after defeating the &quot;killer.&quot; Much to my surprise, the novel is nothing like the film. For those of you who haven't read the story, I certainly won't give away the ending, and the other reviews have nicely summarized the plot, so all I will say is that I read this book at white heat in just over 2 hours because I could not put it down. This tale is not &quot;only&quot; a mystery story - it is a deeply felt study of the human heart. The crimes of the main characters are either sins of &quot;omission&quot; rather than &quot;comission&quot; - by choosing not to act, they cause the deaths of others, or they arrange a situation that will lead to murder, without necessarily being &quot;directly&quot; responsible for the death which results. This novel was written in a Europe which had just entered WWII, a war in which millioms were sent to their deaths by people who &quot;did&quot; nothing more than sign pieces of paper. At the Nuremberg trials, these killer bureaucrats refused to accept moral responsibility for their actions. The characters in &quot;And then there were None&quot; are similar types of people - they seem &quot;normal&quot; on the surface, but these facades of civilized behavior conceal whirlpools of arrogance, greed, selfishness and self-righteousness. This novel is, in truth, a gripping tale of madness and psychological horror. It amazed me to see how quickly these people allowed themselves to descend to an animal level of existence. So much for &quot;civilized Europe.&quot; The scene where Christie compares the behavior of the remaining characters to specific animals was as good as Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. This book shocked and saddened me. Thinking about it kept me awake at night. An absolute must."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None, the brilliant masterwork by the much imitated Agatha Christie is a complicated yet accessible murder mystery. Ten guests arrive at an island, each with a different secret, and each uniquely mysterious. When all the guests have gathered, a mysterious voice, U.N. Owen??? indicts each for a crime. The bloodletting follows. Good luck solving this mystery. The Denouement is nothing short of brilliant.Required reading for Mystery fans. A 5 star classic!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I read this book 3 years ago for a school project, and it was one of my favorite books since then. The plot is so interesting, especially with all of the suspence, mystery, and murder. It is almost impossible to predict what will happen next unless you have, of course, read the very last chapter. This was one of the most surprising endings I have seen in my life. Nobody would have forseen such a twist of fate! You must read this book: it is a true classic! Also, check out some of Christie's other books. So far, I have read about 30. This one, however, was my first, as well as my favorite. Even after her death, the legacy of the Queen of Crime lives on!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Don't buy this $12.95 edition with black cover and red images. It has been weirdly edited to remove all references to Indians! There's no explanation anywhere in the book. Agatha Christie's classic has gone through many editions through more than half a century using the classic \\"Ten Little Indians\\" nursery rhyme and the setting of Indian Island. Then, for some unknown reason, all the Indians were removed in this \\"bogus\\" edition and replaced by soldiers. Readers at least should be given an explanation for such a change. If the references were deemed by some unknown censor to be insulting to Indians, would they be any less insulting to soldiers?? I don't get it. Anyone interested in reading a better version should order the little black paperback with blue images for about half the price. As I have urged my local book store, I will urge Amazon, don't stock this book. I am an English teacher who has taught this book for years, and I am mystified by such an unwarranted and unexplained change."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Barring the many controversies that this book generated over the several decades since its first publication, \\"And Then There Were None\\" probably ranks among the BEST works of crime fiction ever written.From the haunting title to the seemingly harmless yet eerie nursery rhyme,the story deals with the accidental(?) meeting of ten unrelated individuals, each with a shady past and all of whom are now stranded on a desolate island off the south-western English coast. There is a problem though....at large on the island is a maniacal murderer who knows everyone's troubled past! This person now calculatingly begins to eliminate the visitors one by one. But where is this person, what's the motive and how far would this person go? I wouldn't want to be the one to spoil this by revealing any further, but if you are a mystery buff, go no further. An absolute page turner and a classic for many generations to come.Kashyap MothaliVirginia, USA"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"\\"And Then There Were None\\" is one of the best audio books I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Hugh Fraser gives what can only be described as a masterful performance. His reading is sumptuous, scary, and above all, intelligent. The story moves briskly and chillingly toward the shocking conclusion. Even if you have already read the book (as I have), Fraser's telling must be heard to be believed. This is the rare audio book that you cannot turn off. I highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten went to the island to get away from life's hassels for a week, but only one came back. In the novel, And Then There Were None, by Agatha Christie, ten strangers are brought together through a series of mysterious letters. When they arrive at their destination, it is announced that their host and hostess will be delayed a day. Yet, before morning comes, two of the ten guests are dead. Earlier in the evening a tape is played to the guests. On it are accusations of murder directed towards each one of them. It soon becomes apparant that they were all gathered here to be punished for the murders they committed, murders the law could not touch. When the third person has been killed, the seven that are left conclude that the killer must be one of them. As the story progresses, more people die, and the suspense becomes unbearable as each of the guests try to figure out who the killer is and escape their demise. Although the book is a bit boring in the beginning, the suspense quickly builds. Also, there are many characters to keep track of, but you become familiar with them within the first few chapters. The clues and evidence make you put the book down for a minute to try and come up with the murderer before he/she is revealed. The book actually makes you think, which is a very rare thing, even for a mystery."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I have multiple copies of this Agatha Christie classic under both titles. My kindle edition has , in the interest of political correctness, changed &#34;Indian&#34; to &#34;Soldier.&#34; This is over the top political correctness. Had I known the kindle edition incorporated the word change I would have one less copy of the book. Give me a break. This is the ultimate insult to one of the great authors of the 20th century."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is a very well bound hardcover book that's built to last. The fonts are also small but comfortable enough to read.As for the novel itself, coming from someone who has read too many Christie novels to remember, this is by far the best one that I've read. The plot is brilliant and the perfect crime is committed so that the ending is truly unexpected and surprising. In that sense, this novel is similar to \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" with regards an unexpected ending but that's where the similarity ends. Whereas in that novel, the rest of the story is pretty pedantic and boring, this novel in contrast is exciting from beginning to end.The tension and suspense builds as you go along and the climax is nothing short of inspired writing. If you are looking for Christie's best work, this has surely got to be among the top 3 if not the best she's ever done.Highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None tells the story of ten people, all with different backgrounds, and who don't know each other, who are invited by a certain U. N. Owen to spend some time on Nigger Island, off the shore of Devonshire. When they disembark they learn that their host has't arrived yet. They're all speculating as to who this mysterious man or woman can be when a record starts playing on the gramophone, accusing each guest of murder. Not long after, one of them dies, poisoned.The next morning, it's another one's turn. One by one they die, according to the verses of the nursery rhyme Ten Little Niggers, and one by one the ten little negroid statuettes displayed in the dining room disappear. After a thourough but infructuous search of the island, they're forced to face the music: the murderer must be one of them.It was the third time I read this book, albeit the first in its original language. And even though I was bound to find it a little less suspenseful, it was nice to see the tension build up as the guests all start to suspect each other, and it was much entertaining. Lady Agatha Christie sure knew how to write them detective stories!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"the best mystery i have ever read. I am only 12 and hate to read but once i started this book it was like i had to be beaten to put it down.

The nice part about it, is that the plot is purely original, unlike many mystery books, and is unpredictable.

Ten people are invited to an island by one mysterious host. And one by one they die..."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None was a thrilling murder mystery that kept you wondering who the murderer was throughout the book. The book was interesting because \\"Mr. Owen\\", the owner of Indian Island, invited ten complete strangers to his house as guests. Why were these people invited to the island? You find out all the guests had committed a murder not punishable by law. This made the book spooky because all the guests died off one by one and the last guest (who was not the murderer) hung herself. This is an excellent novel with well developed characters and interesting plot turns. I recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and wants to be scared!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie tied a psychological thriller to a physical mystery involving real people. The murderer in this story used physical weapons, like pistols and poison to do some of his/her crimes. He also, however, used psychological weapons. The psychological weapons consisted of fear, guilt, and the like. Agatha Christie's book had psychological and almost superstitious happenings, because the characters sometimes weren't exactly sure if the killer was human or otherwise. It also happened that physical things, like model Indians being taken off a table caused psychological feelings, like fear and panic. This book is indeed well written. The sign of a good author is one that can take an old concept, like the plot of this book, and turn it into a delightful mystery thriller. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes a quick but complex book. If you like a Sherlock Holmes story, this book is for you."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"At the school library, I was short of time so I pulled the first book I saw off the shelf. Little did I know that this would become my most favorite book ever! The whole story is a climax (exept for maybe the very beggining) that kept me up from 7 to 12 one night. I just had to finish it! I totally recommend this book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was an excellent book. This was also the first Agatha Christie book I've ever read.

You don't need to be a Christie fan to admire the brilliance of the plot and the flow of the story. The only possible downside of this book is that it was so good that it if some of the story seems cliched it's because there have been so many who have tried to copy the story. Don't be fooled. This original is a keepsake.What makes this book so enjoyable is that while it is a relative short book by today's standards it is more enthralling. It is not burdened with the gore or the sex of so many mysteries today, but has a solid suspenseful story that will keep you guessing until the end.Read this book whether you're a Christie fan, a mystery lover, an avid reader or even if you pick up a book only once in a great while. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the first book that I read of Agatha Christie and I thought that it was great.

This book shows that she has sheer talent. She keeps you turning the pages late into the night. The way she describes things is exquisitely done. Most mystery writers will just tell you what happens, but she goes into detail after detail making the book exciting and interesting.

The mystery and excitement will keep you reading the book and keep you on the edge of your seat. As the suspense builds you may even find yourself wanting to skip ahead to find our who the murderer is. Throughout the book you are given clues that lead you in different directions and you might look back through the book a few times to find evidence. The undiscovered kiler will have you pulling at your hair throughout the book and then the author's genius twist at the end will make your jaw hit the floor. This is a good book because of its mystery and it can be read more than once.

And Then There Were None is about ten strangers from all over the world that receive these letters from someone named U.N.Owen. All of them travel there and take a boat to the island. After the first day the people start to die one by one. So they start to think that it is one of them among the people that were left. In the end though every single person dies. Yes everybody dies. I could not figure out who the killer was but I have a good idea who it was. You should really read this book and see for yourself who the killer is.

One by one, they are killed of, according to a childish poem, Ten Little Indians, planted in each of their rooms.

Leading them to the conclussion that one of the ten is Mr. U.N Owen. Unexpectedly, one by one, the ten get killed. The excellent part of the story is all of the killings go along with a nursery rhyme called ten little Indians. Also the ten glass Indians that are on a kitchen table, mysteriously disappear every time someone gets murdered. I would recommend this book to any mystery lover. You'll never guess the suprising ending to And then there were none."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is one of the first Christie's I have ever read, but I still think that it is the best.

A must for Christie fans."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was the first Christie book I encountered. A friend persuaded me to read this book, and ever since I've been hooked. This book, however, is by far the best Christie book I have read yet. I may only by 13, but I've been reading full length novels since 2nd grade, so I have a pretty good sense about books. Christie takes you in from the beginning, by taking what seems to be a perfectly innocent vacation, and immediatly adding suspicion. Then, adding in the idea of murder, which, of course, sets the scene for any good murder mystery. She then eliminated all the possible suspects, one by one, untill you know who the murderer is. Or so you think. Then that person dies, and you start all over again, only with no witnesses,or suspects. Just when you think that this will be an open-ended book with no ending, the police recieve a letter from the murderer, who you had already suspected, but then dismissed him as a possible suspect because of death. If you have not read any of these books, or have not read this one, I would strongly recommend this one. But be careful, if you haven't read Christie yet, this book will get you hooked, and you won't be able to stop reading her books."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is amazing! I may be only 13 but this is one of the best books I have read!

This book really gets you mind working in trying to figure out who the murder, and the host is. I couldn't put the book down!!This book is rather amazing, I recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a great murder mystery. Also, to anyone who is a true Agatha Christie fan should know that this book deserves nothing but the highest rating.

It is an intricate web that isbrilliantly woven and spellbinding.Unfortunately, it is so good that I really do nothave much interest in reading other Christietitles, nor other mysteries by other authors,since I am confident that &quot;And Then There WereNone&quot; (also titled &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;) is thebest there is, and it's only downhill from here.- MARK VOSS; Cottage Grove, MN"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I love Agatha Christie's book and Hugh Fraser is a great narrator, but the poor reproduction on the cd is disappointing.

Set on the mystical, deserted Indian Island, eight people are invited by an unknown host to stay at a house complete with a butler and and cook, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, who are completely clueless of the identity of their employer. In each of the guests' bedrooms, there is a poem pinned up to the wall: and old nursery rhyme featuring ten little Indian boys. It is then that the murders begin, revealing that each guest (including Mr. and Mrs. Rogers) is concealing deep, deadly secrets connected to murder in their past (accidental or on purpose). Who the culprit is is the case which causes commotion and suspicision among the house's occupants and fright. But all is not lost since a pattern develops following the content of the poem. Soon only two people remain alive on the island, Philip Lombard and Vera Claythorne. Which one is the killer? The solution is quite a twist since both die anyway as predicted: &quot;Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were none.&quot; So get your hands on 'And Then There Were None'; it's grand fun and suspense and if you are that a great of a sleuth like Hercule Poirot, the solution is quite a clinch and erratic, yet highly expected of Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie is a story that uses an old nursery rhyme that regards ten little Indian boys as a ploy of murder. With this said, the plot is easily foreshadowed, ridding of any element of surprise for method of death, yet the play also has a sense of suspense with who is behind the murder of the ten visitors of Devon Island.One of the negative aspects of the play is that there is no character development. The author does not include a lot of details or characterization, and due to this, the plot becomes slightly confusing in regards to which characters the author is referring to. Personally, I had to turn pages back in order to clarify which character had died.Some parts of the novel that you might find more favorable are that the novel includes a murder mystery and that it is an easy read with action. You can relax on a couch and read it within a few hours.Overall though, I do not recommend this book unless you are looking to kill time. There is no depth to the novel, and the only part of the book that I enjoyed was the manuscript document included at the end revealing the murderer."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Great book but I wish it was tagged correctly.

It is so well crafted that whenever I read it again I always find somehting new in it. I love this book so much that I read it once a year (which means I have read it seven times!!)

And now I'd love to do the same with you. I bet you'll read this book from the beginning to end without ever stop"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Known as the Queen of Crime, Agatha Christie lures readers into a world of deadly deception with her famous novel And Then There Were None. She is renowned worldwide for her genius mystery plots that are entwined with thrill and surprise for the reader as they learn more about her characters. Her literary works include Murder on the Orient Express, The Man in the Brown Suit, and The Seven Dials Mystery.In this novel, ten strangers turn up to visit Indian Island, a place right off the coast of Devon and a constant in newspapers; yet, when they arrive, their host, whom none of them seem to know, isn't there. Accusations of past murder for each guest surface, and one by one, a guest gets murdered in correlation with lines from an old nursery rhyme about ten little Indians. The island is searched for the murderer, but they discover no one is there but themselves; the conclusion is drawn that one of them is the murderer, but as the deaths increase, the number of possible culprits dwindles. The reader becomes the only person sane enough to uncover the killer's identity.Memories linger within each of the guests' minds, and as their fears of death grow stronger, so does their conscience of the past. Fear and suspense are beautifully portrayed in this novel because as the novel progresses, it becomes easy for the reader to adapt a character's emotions of fear and guilt. The familiarity developed between the reader and characters makes this 275 page novel seem like 50 pages whether read by savoring each accusation or gobbling up each suspicion. It is as though this book embodies all elements of a classic mystery, yet it is tinged with the madness of the characters' own twisted consciences, making the perfect combination for a gripping plot.With haunting suspense and a chilling ending, And Then There Were None deserves five out of five stars. When the murderer's identity is revealed, every piece of the story fits like a perfect puzzle, a literary marvel that could only be achieved so gracefully by Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The mystery novel, And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, by Agatha Criste has been rightfuly awarded the title Mystery's #1 Best Seller for it is unpredictable even to one who is a devout reader, unlike many 'mystery' novels where the author gives away the story towards the middle of the book.The story starts as ten people travel to a mysterious island, after they receive a note of invitation from someone who they think that they know from the past, only to find that it was all a lie; as their stay in the Indian Island begin.As they dine, it is then revealed that the mysterious host intends to kill them all as a punishment for each of the guests' dark past, which they have attempted to forget.The reader from the begining, as ten people are sealed in to a prison of an island to the end of the story, has a single question in mind, &quot;Who is it?&quot; which is only answered by a letter from the culprit after the story ends.The fact that the reader actually has an idea of how the next person would die (as the murders follow the nursery rhyme) only adds to the suspense of the story as the reader is always unsure whether who he/she think the murderer is is actually the culprit.No mystery novel that I have ever read has given me so much pleasure and joy. Therefore if you are one that doubts the truth that it is the best mystery novel, you should definetly go find it out for your self!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"A group of ten people are brought to a remote unoccupied mansion in the middle of deserted Indian island by a mysterious Mr. U.N.

Soon the guests begin to die in accordance to the poem &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;. They come upon the gradual realization that Mr. Owen must be one of their number. Once all of the murders are complete the murderer is revealed.And Then There Were None was an action packed novel that kept me guessing right down to the very end.

After a young man dies of choking, a woman realizes that this was no accident- it was a murder - a murder that followed the old nursery rhyme called The Ten Little Indians.When the people realize that there was a murderer on the loose, they stopped talking to each other.

There are twists and turns, which make the book more exciting and pleasurable to read. I think Agatha Christie is a talented author and makes all of her stories unpredictable. I have read other books by Agatha Christie as well, but this one in particular was very suspenseful. I also think this book is challenging and will make your mind work harder than other books would. This is not an easy book fit for a fifth grader, although from its thin size you may think so. There are hidden meanings in some of the phrases and words that even I had to look up in the dictionary.

My biggest regret is that when I first encountered this book I could not resist temptation and I peeked at the last chapter before reading the book all the way through. Nevertheless, it is still one of my favorite books of all time.If you are most familiar with this book via the many movies that have been made from this novel, the original book will be a surprise. Most of the film versions have ruined the ending by trying to impose a &quot;happy ending.&quot; As a result, most of the power of the novel is severely dilluted. (A notable exception is the recent movie &quot;Identity&quot;, about which I will say nothing except that while it may stray from the letter of Christie's novel, it stays closest to its spirit.)

I really couldn&#65533;t tell you. I read this novel for the first time in the 6th Grade and have read it countless times since. The amount of plotting and planning Agatha Christie had to do in preparing to write this book boggles my mind. It seems that every time I read it I discover some new, subtle clue to the killer&#65533;s identity that I missed before. It&#65533;s not a traditional Murder Mystery, where the reader is privy to everything the detective sees and hears. There is no detective, so the book is written in an omniscient third-person style that frustrates some readers who think they can solve the crime using standard Murder Mystery logic. I recommend you approach the book as a thriller, just relax and enjoy the sweet frustration this book brings.Oh, yeah&#65533; and anyone who claims they knew who the killer was before the final pages is either lying or made a lucky, unsubstantiated guess."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is an excellent book.

He will start you off with how he was raised and the many stuggles he had to go through leading up to meeting his lovely Hawaiian Wife. Against all odds they were called into a country to raise up other missionaries. The stuggles were not only real, but you will begin to see God revealed in a pattern sort of way, teaching John Stier to figure out the ultimate questions you may have been asking yourself. When I started off reading this book I became depressed hearing all the struggles John had gone through. But closer to the end I started seeing this pattern that God had taken John on.

Currently the prices I see for this are ranging $180-$200. I bought my book brand new for $12.95 at a nice music store in Dallas. There is an older edition of the book but the only difference between the two is the front cover. No front cover is worth changing the price value of the book by over $100 worth.

Based on the ideas of Bill Lind and COL John Boyd, &quot;Warfighting&quot; wraps up all the critical ideas of these influential military thinkers into a useful and concise book. &quot;Warfighting&quot; represents the definitive work of American Military Doctrinal thought of the second half of the 20th Century.A theoretical, but highly readable example of military doctrine, &quot;Warfighting&quot; suceeds where it's Army counterpart, FM 100-5: Operations, fails miserably. It is interesting, relevant, and easy to read and comprehend. It also expounds a workable military doctrine, called &quot;Maneuver Warfare&quot; that is a significant, and conceptually different method than the Army's ponderous, attrition based &quot;AirLand Battle Doctrine&quot;.Tactical ideas such as objective, mission orders, recon pull, main effort, and other critical concepts are discussed, with relevant historical examples. The Boyd theory and time critical decisionmaking are explained in depth. Tempo and decision cycles are explained, and their decisive impact on military operations is demonstrated.This is a great choice of books for the young military professional. Any junior leader, especially those in the combat arms will benefit greatly from reading this book."},{"Title":"Warfighting: Maneuver Warfare in the U.S. Marine Corps","review":"This book is about as interesting to read as it is to watch grass grow.

Maneuver warfare regardless of how entertaining and readable is a poison menu offering easy victories that sets up the American public for dissillusionment and defeat when these lofty promises are undelivered and the clever asymmetric enemy targets perceptions through the media using 4th Generation war means.This book is fatally dated and needs to be dismissed and replaced by more balanced, innovative thinking that is geared to the 4th Generation war reality we live in today, not trying to relive the German blitzkrieg ala 1940 with 3d Generation war means. Sea-based posturing and small-force Maneuverism failed at the fortified cities of Tobruk, Stalingrad, Bastogne, and more recently in Lebanon and Somalia, something the doctrines espoused in this book do not take into account.We need REAL original thinking about war, not wannabe German left-overs. We need ACTION and EQUIPMENT not &quot;3 block war&quot; TALK to dominate future city fights, and a doctrine that is more balanced than easy maneuverism cleverly manipulated to advance the agenda of an obsolete sea-based service bureaucracy.Airborne!"},{"Title":"Ann of Ava","review":"A well written account of the life of an early American woman who set forth with her husband to share her faith with the heathen in Burma; of the devotion of Ann Judson, and her unfailing faith in God through many trials endured in an uncivilized country at the mercy of the very people she went to help and teach; this book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Ann of Ava","review":"The story Ann of Ava tells about the girl turned woman, Nancy Hasseltine, also known as Ann, travels to Burma in a mission trip with her Husband, Adoniram Judson."},{"Title":"Ann of Ava","review":"A well written account of the life of an early American woman who set forth with her husband to share her faith with the heathen in Burma; of the devotion of Ann Judson, and her unfailing faith in God through many trials endured in an uncivilized country at the mercy of the very people she went to help and teach; this book is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Following Story","review":"&quot;The Following Story&quot; is full of lovely, epigramatical observations about life, language, love, and learning. I particularly liked the narrator's musings on his beloved Latin language, especially when he considers the names of the constellations and notes that &quot;the blackboard of the sky was inscribed in Latin...&quot; But the framing story that provides the pretext for these epigrams is much less impressive. The subject matter -- the adulterous affairs of academics -- is such a cliche of contemporary literature that it would need a treatment much more original than Nooteboom's to make it fresh again. Read this book for its language and its philosophical musings, but don't expect it to keep you up past bedtime."},{"Title":"The Following Story","review":"The story starts few minutes before death of Herman Mussert, a teacher of classical languages, and ends few minutes after his death. In this short period of time we learn all the important events of his life. The story is just like a journey to the eternity. It begins in Amsterdam, where Herman is dying of heart attack. It continues in Portugal, where he wakes up and remembers the things happened here years ago that were very important for all his life. The last part of the journey is a journey with the ship over the ocean to the origin of the river Amazon. This is the last part of the journey and it is where the eternity begins.This is also a story of two men and two women, or three teachers and one student. This is a story of love and jealousy or love and revenge. The very important thing in this book is a relationship between materialistic world of science with all his natural principals, and spirituality. The last moments of life are just the right ones to think about the connection between them.The novel is very short. In some way, it is cyclic and written in such a way that at the end the reader has a feeling that the story is beginning not ending. But there is already the time for a following story - the story of the next traveller on the journey to the eternity."},{"Title":"The Following Story","review":"Herman Musset, a quiet, introverted teacher of Latin and Greek, and who spends all of his time reading. He writes travel guides under the name of Dr Strabo, and calls it 'a moronic activity whereby I earn my living'. In his spare time - when he is not reading - he translates Ovid's Metamorphosis, a translation he wants nobody to see because, 'Our modern languages are altogether too wordy...the traffic jam, the jumble of words, blathering chaos.'He falls asleep one night in his home in Amsterdam, and awakens in Lisbon, twenty years previous. He is unsure if he is dead, or has been transported back through time, or whether he is hallucinating. Or, maybe, some other possibility that he cannot imagine. All he knows is that the room he woke up in, the room in Lisbon, is the very same place where he slept with another man's wife.In waking up in this room, he remembers the actions of all those years ago and the people that were affected. Lisa d'India, a talented, beautiful student, he remembers the best. She was loved by all for her intelligence, loved by Herman for the ideal she represented. He admired her, appreciated her skill with Greek, but he did not love her in the carnal sense, the way every else seemed to. For Herman, sexual love '[has] more to do with the animal kingdom than with human beings, who concern themselves with the less tangible aspects of existence.'Lisa d'India is loved, most especially, by Arend Herfst, a poet and basketball teacher. He begins a relationship with the girl, and it seems that everyone but Herman is aware of this. Arend's wife, Maria Zeinstra, begins an affair with Herman, an affair of revenge, not love or lust, and Herman is completely unaware of this fact. Happily, the plot never moves into confusing betrayals or empty, 'romantic' gestures. Instead, we follow the events through the absent-minded, bewildered eyes of Herman. His affair with Maria Zeinstra, an affair that he did not plan and did not really want, is somewhat beyond his talents in people interaction. He does not know how to handle her, and luckily, does not have to. Herman is used merely as a piece in the strategy game that husband and wife are playing. Yet, Maria's relationship with Herman is not malicious, as far as we can tell, and is oftentimes quite gentle.The clandestine cum love story plot is one that can easily be ignored, and indeed is for most of the novel. The true focus is Herman. He is an amazing character, a learned, intelligent, gentle man, who is 'as ugly as Socrates'. He quotes Ovid, Tacitus and Shakespeare in his meandering confessions, he considers this philosophy or that author, wonders about the state of art and culture, comments on everything with a wry wink to the reader. Herman is a man who enjoys words more than anything else in this world, he enjoys reading them and - while he considers his own talents to be of a poor quality, and useless when compared to the Latin and Greek greats - he loves writing down his thoughts. Through the sarcasm and the negativity towards popular culture, there is a timid yet kind man who just wants to love his books in peace.An explanation for Herman's sleeping in Amsterdam and awakening in Lisbon twenty years earlier is given, but I will not reveal it. Towards the end of the novel, when Herman has relived the most vivid, alive experience of his life, when he has finished recounting an episode when the real world intrudes on his careful, closed existence of words and rhyme, he boards a ship, travelling with six other people, swapping dream-like stories of time and reality. In this section, the sardonic, witty narrator - Herman - all but disappears, replaced with a lazily beautiful chronicler of events of the mind. The transition is seamless and works very well, building up a sort of confused, dreamy tension until the last two amazing pages, and then the final, perfect sentence when the cloud of unanswered questions are blown away and we are left with a brilliant clarity and understanding."},{"Title":"The Following Story","review":"I've come across this book quite inadvertently (or serendipitously taking into account the results)attracted by its European Literary Prize. But from the first page I was fascinated by this literary masterpiece of previously unknown (for me) author. It is a love story dressed in apparel of modern psychology and philosophy, overwhelming beautiful and devastatingly sad, absolutely devoided of schmaltz. This incredibly succinct book includes stupendous magnitude of contemplations and reflections, metaphors and symbols, images and emotions. Its composition is perfect - from humorous observations of ostentatious misanthrope nonplussed by extraordinary awaking in a memorable place to the pinnacle of genuine understanding of human tragedy of classical scope where jealousy and vengeance generate distorted passion and destroy real love. Its language is exquisite, the language of the sincere poet. It is the book which you'll want to reread when the last phrase still reverberates in your mind. It is one of the best books I've ever read, chef d'oeuvre of intelligent, perspicacious and generous author."},{"Title":"The Following Story","review":"Mr. Nootebooms book tells a fascinating story about an outlived teacher in classical languages (or a classical teacher in languages).

Rogers books on race about eight years ago and from time to time I still refer back to them. J.A. Rogers is considered by many to be a Psudo-historian and anytime one references his name, they are regarded as afrocentric and hence not taken seriously by the mainstream white intellectual community. Sex and Race volume I came out originally in the 1950s. A period of time when many of the so-called white intellectuals were convinced of the inferiority of blacks. Indeed, many intellectuals today are convinced of the inferiority blacks in america. Otherwise people would not constantly quote negative statistics about blacks and exaggerate.In this book, Rogers not only talks of black achievement in the old world but also shows that there is no scientific basis for race because a large percentage of the world's population is &quot;mixed&quot; with black or people who are apparently of african ancestry. One of the interesting techniques used by Rogers in these sex and race books is showing photographs of people who have ascertainable &quot;black blood&quot; (no matter how slight) and leaving it up to the reader to judge. Indeed, to show how mixed we are, all one has to do is watch things like the Olympics, read National Geographic magazine and the news.J.A Rogers points out that when people (particularly non-blacks) are confronted with the possibility of being of black african ancestry, they become irritated. Indeed, in some circumstances claiming that someone is of black african ancestry can get you into a lot of trouble. On the other hand, people are proud of being &quot;part German&quot;, &quot;part Dutch&quot;, &quot;part Italian&quot;, etc. Read this book to discover that Germans, Dutch, Italians and other Europeans have been mixing with blacks well before they set foot in america. Some may ask, what difference does it make who has black blood and why does it matter? On the other hand, boasting of being Italian, German, English, etc. holds no shock value. In order to move beyond racism and bigotry, we need to ask ourselves why does it matter if we are part German or other European and why doesn't this carry any kind of stigma like being part black? The problem of race prejudice in the world may never go away, but de-emphsizing the significance of being of European ancestry is a start. The next time you accuse someone of being afrocentric or boasting of the achievements of blacks, ask yourself why aren't you bothered by people constantly boasting of their European ancestry and achievements?"},{"Title":"Sex and Race, Volume I: Negro-Caucasian Mixing in All Ages and All Lands: The Old World","review":"I first experienced J.A. Rogers books at a Bob Marley festival. A woman introduced me to the Sex and Race books but at the time I did not pay them much attention. I again saw Rogers books at an Afrocentric bookstore, and I picked the Sex and Race Vol. I book up and did not stop reading it. Sex and Race is an eye opener for me. Rogers presents many pictures, and sources to prove his theories on the evolution of Race with a heavy influence upon African ancestry. As an African American I am proud to be able to read about the roots of orgin of African people and its influences upon the world."},{"Title":"Sex and Race, Volume I: Negro-Caucasian Mixing in All Ages and All Lands: The Old World","review":"I discovered this book one morning when I had a few hours to spare and suddenly a few hours were not enough! I must have read half of it and then, when time was running short, skipped ahead to certain chapters in less than 3 hours. It was that riveting. I am 26 and I was born and raised for all my 26 years in Trinidad in the West Indies. What really got my attention was how much I finally understood the generations before me and why they were the way they were.There are many habits and behavious patterns that exist in Trinidad and much of the Caribbean today that this books sheds great sociological and psychological light upon.For instance, my great grandmother (the darkest skinned of 7 children born to the son of a freed slave and a Venezuelan woman of Spanish descent) did not inherit the straight or curly hair of her mother. Maybe it was for this reason that we, the grandchildren and great grandchildren, were subtly instructed to marry a man with 'good' hair (meaning not kinky) and of lighter skin. After reading this book, I understand now that to have more obviously mixed children, to be of the 'mulatto' grouping was to elevate your family and give them the chance to have a better life experience in those days. After years of this training, this kind of living, now I can understand more fully why my great granny said and did the things she did. It doesn't make it right, but that is how she was raised and she was just doing the best she knew how.It may take centuries upon centuries before that colonial social stratification fades from the minds of Trinidadians, but this book certainly helps to explain why. I believe that change has already occurred to a significant extent and will continue to occur as time passes.Eventually people in the Caribbean will list their ethnic heritage and state African first instead of last. There are those who state it now, but for most, it almost seems a swing of the pendulum where the 'racism' - for want of a better word - is reversed and they seem to shove Africanism down their own throats (and the throats of others) as if trying to acquire a taste for the heritage. Time heals all wounds, and though we must never forget, we must release so that change can occur.I must say in closing, that Trinidad is certainly growing, because I was raised to think of myself as a Trinidadian first. I am not and AfroTrinidadian, nor an AngloTrinidadian, nor and IndoTrinidadian. These might be elements of my heritage but I am not characterised by a race, only this nationality where no one can truly claim to be any pure race since we have all mixed and mingled and in the words of J.A. Rogers, engaged in a whole lot of miscegenation."},{"Title":"Sex and Race, Volume I: Negro-Caucasian Mixing in All Ages and All Lands: The Old World","review":"I just love this author...his work is so real and detailed, he leaves no stone unturned in his quest for knowledge and subsequent presentation to the public thru the written word...and as with his other works this volume has great pictures...the appendix, notes on the illustrations and bibliography is just tremendous.

However, the Margaret Cheney work was a big disappointment to me nevertheless.Tesla's accomplishments are justifiably lauded throughout. However, it seems that each and every one of the inventor's wild, unfounded, publicity-seeking boasts is praised with the same unquestioning pen. By the mid-point of the book, I found it hard to put any credence in what was being written.I'm interested in finding a better-balanced treatment that looks more deeply into the meat of Tesla's revolutionary early work and glosses over the just-over-the-horizon meanderings of the last 40 years of his life."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"About a month ago, I was introduced to the life of this brilliant man, Nikola Tesla, and all of his inventions that he conjured up, by a good friend of mine. When this friend mentioned that Tesla was creating wireless communication and remote control-- during the late 1800's into the early 1900's (!!), I at first did not believe him. So, I decided to do some research myself and began to look through different articles dealing with Tesla and his inventions. Sure enough, Tesla did invent remote control, flourescent lights, robotics, wireless communication, and many other mind-blowing inventions--during the time that people were still traveling pretty much by way of HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGES!!!!! This man was, in effect, 2001: A Space Odyssey on two legs--He was definately light-years ahead of his time. And wouldn't you know it? His inventions are still being taken seriously today--by scientists and military personel alike. This book is perhaps one of the most definative and fascinating biographies I have ever read. Easy to read, yet quite an in depth look into the genius who lit the world by his discovery of AC electric current. A highly recommended biography, in my opinion. Well worth the time and money."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I'm fairly recently getting into Tesla. As I mentioned in another review I've always known who Tesla was, his work on Turbines and the Tesla Coil, but I didn't know too much about the man or his other inventions. When I saw the movie \\"The Prestige\\" I became far more intrigued into the person that was Tesla, so I decided to pick up a few things about the man. A great introductorion, from what I can tell, is the PBS Documentary on DVD, but it has almost no depth and is really a very brief overview of the man and his inventions. \\"Tesla: A Man Out of Time\\" on the other hand seems to be a very in depth researched overview of the man, his inventions, and his friends.For the most part I thought this was a good book and it did keep my attention. It's not written in a manner of an engaging tale, but rather a critical analysis of the man's life. Some people may not enjoy this kind of writing as it has almost no story-form, but I'm the type of person who can sit down and read books on Mathematics or Ancient History, where it's a bit of a report like format. Granted \\"Tesla: A Man Out of Time\\" is not nearly as dry as some History texts I've come across over the years! One of the greatest misgivings for this book, however, is the way it is organized. The first half of the book seems to be organized by invention. So if we're dealing with Tesla's most monumental achievement for mankind, the Alternating Current, then that chapter takes us through all the years with the boons and plights of that invention. Actually a few chapters are dedicated to this. So we're dealing with a time period of like 1893 to the 1915's or so, if I remember the dates correctly. But Tesla invented a lot more in that time frame, such as the Tesla Coil. Granted I totally understand the approach to organizing it in this fashion, but Cheney doesn't really let you know the beginning dates when she starts talking about an invention so it's up to the reader to project when it is happening. This format could have worked if she was more forthcoming with some dates so people can put it in chronological order in their heads, though maybe she just didn't want to clutter the book with too many dates, which I would normally agree with, but not in this circumstance.Some other reviewers have commented on the her lack of explaining the technology in a lay readers understanding and some technical analysis shows that she likely didn't fully understand what Tesla's inventions did. That being said, I must point out that Cheney is not an engineer, she's a biographer and it says as much on the back of the book. While she does try to delve into the technical aspect, even I got confused with her explanation of Fusion and it's relation to Plasma, and I actually have a decent grasp on how Fission and Fusion work in terms of atomic structures. So people or engineers (specifically) reading this book may want to overlook that drastic aspect and focus more on the tale she's trying to tell about the man. I can kind of get over the technical aspect since there is very little explanation on the details and more focus on just Tesla's inventions and what he was general interested/motivated by as a result of his inventions. There are times when the author tries to liberally project her own conclusions to the reader such as Tesla's pre-concept of the circular \\"atom smasher\\" or cyclotron, which also lead to a premonition of Cathode Ray Tubes we've used in televisions and computer screens. While I think Tesla may have been on to something conceptually with the splitting of the atom, he by no means led the world to discover CRT technology as far as I can tell. However, I felt this kind of bias/commentary was in the minority overall.That being said I feel I have a better grasp of who Tesla was and what he has done for this world in the grand scheme of existence. This book is definitely more for those who want to know more about who he is, the hardships he dealt with, and what he invented over his life time. Cheney goes through great lengths to quote letters Tesla received from friends and his responses, even quoting news articles with his comments or comments from others. There is no doubt that she spent an exhaustive amount of time peering over news articles and letters from this great inventor. The book also has a grand amount of notations so you can do further reading when she abridges some of the quotes in this book. She goes over the types of people he has gone to over his lifetime and friends he's made like Anne Morgan (J.P. Morgan's daughter), Mark Twain, and having met Thomas Edison and worked for him. This is just a taste for who he met and worked with over his lifetime.In this book we meet a man who has practically no interest in woman and has enough obsessive compulsive quirks to astonish anyone. While I don't think his quirky nature was fully touched upon in this book, Cheney does give us a taste of some of his phobias, like earrings for example. We meet a man who was on top of the world for a portion of his life and who seemed to be on the way to making it big in the world, but then after making rather overly generous financial decisions he could never really get out of debt's clutches. He literally had to beg to borrow the money as the years got worse and worse over the years. Things looked up for Tesla for a while here and there, but he was also quite generous with his funds to help his friends financially during the Great Depression and his friends gave him the same treatment.Towards the end we get a portrait of a man who liked to make grandiose statements for what seems to be for the sake of being in the limelight again. It feels like Tesla simply missed the fame and attention, quite a different scope from the man who worked in seclusion and extreme secrecy. But his secrecy was intriguing and I think he liked to emerge to the public for attention every now and again. As he got on in years his claims didn't end in much fruition for the world, which isn't surprising since towards the end of his career and life he lived out of a hotel room without a laboratory. However, he still claimed his wirelessly transmitted electricity would work. He also ended up being wrong on quite a few things, especially when he said Einstein's relativity was not an accurate representation of our universe. Even Einstein would have wanted to agree with him, but Einstein's accuracy cannot be denied. Like Einstein they both died with dreams of a final theory, Tesla's wirelessly transmitted electricity and Einstein's Grand Unified Field theory, both of which have not been proven definitively yet. When Tesla's life was finally over his papers and research items were confiscated by the government, because amidst the grandiose claims was high grade weapons technology like ray beams and so forth.In the end we get a portrait of a man that struggled to change the world for the better and not always at his benefit. As his life ended in debt we are all left with the great boons of his inventions. Thanks to his Alternating Current we don't need a power station every two miles like we would need with Direct Current only systems. His research into radio which was eventually fully realized by Marconi made great leaps in that field. He was clearly a visionary more than anything else and a brilliant mind on top of that enthralled with electricity, machines, resonance, and the various waves that power and drive the like. I thought this book at times was a bit overly laudatory, but I think it did him justice. I get the feeling that Cheney felt a little bad for the man since he clearly does not get the same kind of esteemed recognition in America as Edison does. Some of the best tales of Tesla's life was when the two bitter enemy's fought the war of the currents, which is literally worth a book in itself. Say what you want, but in the end I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to people who want a more in depth portrait of the man behind the inventions. Truly a great inventor who should be well known in the annals of history."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Nicola Tesla was a revolutionary inventor who gets little credit for his dramatic contributions to modern society. Tesla stood up to and won over Edison in the battle between direct current and alternating current which proved the practical choice. Tesla held the patents that first powered the Chicago World Exhibition and transformed Niagra Falls into energy to light Buffalo, NY. No one but Tesla knew when they threw the switch at Niagra that the new process would work at all. He held the patents for wireless communications before Marconi, used x-ray photography prior to Roentgen, and created the first prototypes of continuous cycle motors and transformers that are in common use today. He envisioned radio, television, and even defensive particle beam weapons before anyone else even thought they were remote possibilities.Tesla's ideas go way beyond the technology of his time. Tesla had rare gifts to visualize, design, and test ideas in his mind, so when he tooled a device it wasn't a process of trial and error. His rare gift allowed him to envision ideas that challenge scientists today. But because he was always ahead of himself, Tesla didn't stay still long enough to see his ideas come into fruition for the last half of his life. We still wonder if it's possible, as he pondered, to send power wirelessly, to use standing waves in the earth and atmosphere to provide free power anywhere.Margaret Cheney tells Tesla's life with a richness of detail that brings him into focus as a revolutionary thinker. Tesla's compulsive obsession with his ideas precluded romance and normalcy, but it set him apart as a figure who changed the world. A predominant figure in early 20th Century America, Tesla influenced the way we live today. You'll be enriched for learning about his fascinating life."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This has been for many years the best Nikola Tesla biography out there. It is highly readable and full of information. Notwithstanding, the way the material is presented can be a bit confusing at times because it does not follow a strict chronological order. That is why I did not give the book five stars. Upon reading the book you will find out how fascinating was Tesla's life. Mr. Tesla accomplished a lot and we, present generations, are highly indebted to him. The breadth and the scope of his discoveries are breathtaking thus making him a \\"man out of time\\"."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This was a fascinating read for me, and I was astonished to learn he had original patents for VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) and other things you might not expect from the genius, Dr. Tesla. Since I had heard about him inventing practically everything, I was excited to learn he really did impact every technological invention used today. This book brought him to life and inspired me to learn more in my field with computer science.If you're looking for a lot of technical drawings, you won't find them in this book. This book is a detailed account of his life, accomplishments, and struggles, as well as insight into what happened to his unpublished documents after his death in 1943. Again, a fascinating and inspiring read."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I agree with what the other reviewer wrote. About the Tesla book as not focusing on Tesla very much. However, I felt that Cheney was trying to tell us that Tesla didn't 'want' to be known at all. The times that Tesla opened up to america, were to see american corporations clamp down on him and his ideas.... so Tesla became even more the introvert than before.... While yes, his letters to people are opening a little bit, they are quite sad, how he came to love pigeons more than people at the end of his life. Animals never tried to hurt him emotionally or finacially, so he spent all his time with them.The science could have been deeper but I was not a science major so it was at a perfect level for me as a reader of literature. Perhaps it could have had a middle chapter titled, &quot;Deep science&quot; and most readers could be given the heads up about it, so they could skip it if they wished to. However the main thrust of the book was to enlighten the reader as to how recluse Tesla was and how sad his letters got even though he changed the face of american science more so than Edison did. I was shocked when the US Military did not take his genius and put him to work in some hidden base somewhere. But then they probably had a less budget then compared to today.Anyway, it was a great read on the long drive to Baja Mexico from Idaho.Jonathan M"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Good book,I like electicity and always thought tesla was the man.

He was a scientific genius and also understood the value of good PR. He tinkered, thought deep thoughts, hobnobbed with high society in the form of the New York rich and Mark Twain, and dabbled in the politics of his homeland. For a reader like me who did not understand the scientific concepts behind Tesla's work, I was still fascinated by his personality. He immigrated to the US to work for Thomas Edison and became his arch-competitor. As his career went on, his work became more theoretical as he had more and more trouble getting funding. He captured the public's imagination with electrical tricks, a secretive stay in Colorado Springs, and with the alternating current which was proven more effective than Edison's direct current. The true extent of his accomplishments is still somewhat unknown. As the author explains in what amounts to an extended epilogue, many of Tesla's papers were lost.If you are like me and find the elusive figure of Tesla fascinating, you will enjoy this book even if, also like me, you do not really understand all the work Tesla was doing."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I'd seen bits and pieces about the inventor Nikola Tesla on TV before and been a fan of the 80's rock band Tesla. I then watched a TV special about him a few months ago and wanted to know more. I got this book and I'm over 1/2 way through it and it is wonderful. Tesla was one of the premier inventors in History and certainly was a man out of time, coming up with inventions and concepts we are only able to appreciate today. He is also responsible for the mastery of alternating current and our lives today would be completely diferent without him. Everytime we turn on a light or run an appliance, we have Nikola Tesla to thank for it. It is also very sad that practically no one has ever heard of him and his contributions have been almost purposefully hidden from us for some reason. The book does a great job of going into his personal life and the behind the scenes world of his mental idiosyncracies and social relationships. The only thing negative I have to say is it is not a very technical book. It describes many of his ideas in very general terms. I would like to have more explanations of many of Tesla concepts such as electrical resonance for instance. The book is an easy read and pages go by quickly. People interested in history, science or biography will like this book and I can't wait to finish it."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"If you are intrigued by genius or what David Keirsey calls the Promethean temperament, then you need go no further than this book.

As I read it, I was struck by how exciting Tesla's research was (anyone who thinks science is boring should read this book). He had some profound (if sometimes off the wall) theories on how to use electricity. It is a truly sad ordeal, though, to see Tesla at middle age, bitter because so many of his inventions had been ignored or stolen. But hopefully books like this will bring recognition to his myriad of inventions. He was certainly worthy of a Nobel Prize, at the very least for his invention of the alternating current."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Tesla was more of an inventor than a scientist.

Born in 1856, he died at age eighty-six in 1943. He was a prolific inventor. Addressing the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Tesla introduced a new scientific principle. He hit upon the notion of a rotating magnetic field produced by two or more alternating currents out of step with each other to make his induction machine. Obsession plagued his life. He excelled in languages but starred in math at school. He had an abnormal ability to visualize and retain images. He was introduced to physics at age ten and was enthralled.Tesla continued his studies at a school in Karstadt, (the family was Servian but lived in Croatia). In 1875 he was enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz. He sought to complete two years of work in one. In the second year, Nikola Tesla toyed with the idea of an alternative to direct current machines. His financial circumstances were grim. He had to become a school drop-out. He was basically self-taught.From a telegraph office in Germany, Tesla moved to a telephone office in Paris in 1883. He travelled to America in 1884, the year of the panic. He gained employment with Thomas Edison on his first day. There were personality differences. Edison had a vested interest in direct current machines. Tesla redesigned the Edison dynamos. He thought he had been promised fifty thousand dollars for the work of a year. When it was not forthcoming he resigned.Tesla made a deal with George Westinghouse for an alternating current system. The public was confused by Edison's propaganda and G.E.'s efforts to contest Tesla's priority of invention. It was never fully understood even by engineers that the system almost universally adopted was Tesla's. When Westinghouse faced a financial calamity, Tesla signed over his patents for the polyphase system to Westinghouse. The first commercial use of Tesla's system was undertaken in Telluride, Colorado, in 1891. Tesla gave demonstrations of light sources in 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair.Milikan was inspired by Tesla's claim of cosmic rays and Compton, too, expressed his debt to his Victorian predecessor. Tesla anticipated the electron microscope and the atom smasher. Marconi and Tesla wrangled over priority in the matter of radio patents, although neither man originated the law suits. The polyphase system was used by the Niagra Falls Power Co. and it laid the groundwork for all the electricity service systems in the United States.In 1895 there was a fire at Tesla's New York City laboratory. Everything was destroyed. The fire took place amid the happiest and most productive decade of Tesla's life. Newspapers reported that the fruits of genius had been swept away. His researches included radio, energy transmission, guided vehicles, liquid oxygen and X rays. A new lab was located on East Houston Street. Tesla accepted money from a financier, start-up funds, but to his material detriment rejected an alliance with the House of Morgan.Because his work was interrupted, Tesla was bested by Linde in developing the commercial breakthrough to produce liquified oxygen. Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled robot boat at Madison Square Garden in 1898. Tesla's laboratory was moved to Colorado Springs in 1899. He had an experimental lab built to his specifications. He returned to New York City in 1990 and in 1901 one of Tesla's patents specifically addressed the issue of supercooling conductors.In 1943, after his death, the United States Supreme Court held that Tesla had anticipated all other contenders with his fundamental radio patents. Nikoa Tesla was ahead of his time and mistaken for a dreamer. In 1975 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

She is a ridiculously biased cheerleader for tesla and distorts the facts and logic to credit Tesla with everything from inventing television to the cyclotron. Even when Tesla foolishly abandons his entire claim to royalties on the AC power system, the authorSpecifically, the author credits Tesla with the \\"early work\\" in the development of the cyclotron because Tesla did some experiments on RF discharges in evacuated bulbs. This is complete nonsense. the fact that the author makes this argument is a direct result of her scientific illiteracy.The book was also poorly written. The author frequently uses quotes to set forth dialogue. This is inappropriate unless the author knows for a fact the exact exchanges she is quoting.There are also significant events that are ignored or not fully explained. For example, the reasons behind the failure of he Wardenclyffe tower project are not explained.The worst, most embarrassing mistake the author made was in the section discussing the tesla turbine. In defense of the (flawed) tesla turbine, the author quotes MARK GOLDIS (sic, correct spelling is \\"Goldes\\") of Sebastopol CA who says that his company is working on an improved version of the tesla turbine. Well, Mark Goldes is a con man and fraudster who makes his living by selling investments in his phony fraudulent companies. Goldes claims to have solved every major engineering and physics challenge of the 20th century, including free energy, zero-point energy, room temperature superconductors and the like. Goldes is blatantly a scientific fraud and investment criminal but the author does not have the basic understanding of science necessary to figure this out."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"An avid reader of scientist biographies, I was bound to reach Nikola Tesla and Man out of Time, by Cheney.

There was quite a few passages with very vague, if any, connections to Tesla and his personal life.

I also found that the author has a much unbiased opinion of Tesla. I am not sure what the truth is about his life and inventions, but I did feel that though the middle of the book that the author was rooting for him all the way and so I felt I was reading opinion more than fact."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I, like many others, have heard the name of Tesla and knew that he was far-sighted and a great inventor. Many rock fans will remember the group \\"Tesla\\" and their album \\"The Great Radio Controversy\\". I only mention this because I feel it opened the door for a great many young people to have an interest in Tesla.This book was engrossing from start to finish. The number of patents, the ideas he presented so far ahead of his time and the inventions he brought forth literally changed the world. He does not get credit for most of what he did. He was just recently added to the Smithsonian Museum for his invention of the radio which many still believe was invented by Marconi. And children are still taught in school that \\"Thomas Edison invented electricity\\" but in fact the type of of electrity we use today was put forth by Tesla.His awesome intelligence invented so many components of micro technology that inventors for years after did not comprehend. For instance, this book brings for the facts that \\"Inventors of modern computer technology in the last half of the twentieth century repeatedly have been surprised, when seeking patents, to encounter Tesla's basic ones, already on file.\\"To list Nikola Tesla's ideas, discoveries and inventions would take an entire book in itself but some included the Atom Smasher, X-Rays, Radio, electro-magnetic power, AC electricity, Solar Heating, Vacuum Tubes, Remote Control Vehicles, Torpedoes, Force Fields, Microwave Transmissions, Diathormy, High Voltage Conducters, Wireless Communications, World Wide Broadcasting Systems, Flying Saucers, Transisters, The Atomic Clock, Cosmic Rays, Phosphorescent Lighting, The Heating Pat, Robots, Liquid Oxygen, Under Ground Power LInes, Cryogenics, Radar, Guided Missiles, Automobile Speedometer, Highway Systems, Parking Garages, Interplanetary Communications, Laser Beams, Death Rays, Modern Warfare, Geothermal Steam Plants, and the list can go on and on. He once produced an earth quake in New York City and blew out electric plants in Colorado with his experiments. He was so far ahead of his time that the US Air Force is still researching his ideas and the US Government, in posession of his papers, denies that they have any of his notes. What they did acknowledge they had is still classified.Nikola Tesla was a dapper man who spoke eight languages fluently and onced signed away riches for the benefit of a friend (George Westinghouse) who had supported him in the past. He was a naturalized U.S. citizen and this he considered his greatest accomplishement. His experiments through most of his life were constanty in need of funds and he approached the US Government several times. One can only wonder what might have come of his knowledge if the government had agreed to fund him. Thankfully his devotion was to the United States because both Russia and Germany approached him and he turned them down. As it turns out the US Government expressed much more interest in his experiments after his death than when he was alive. Apparently taking his notes and classifying them and also moving forward in his ideas.This book presents a great overview with a little insight into his experiments. It covers the man, the experiments, his friends and his times. It's a great introduction to Nikola Tesla and I highly recommend it to anyone who is searching for the truth about historic inventions. Big companies and powerful men continued to keep Tesla's inventions either ignored, ridiculed (until later knowledge proved them right) or stolen so he could not profit to the full extent that he should have. A study in the down side of capitalism.Buy this book, open your ideas, enjoy history and think about what you have been taught. Fascinating!"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Cheney paints a rich portrait of the character of Nikola Tesla, Mad Scientist---or at least Eccentric Inventor, providing ample detail of his bizarre manners, his proficiency at gambling and billiards, his astonishing hubris, his society appearances, and his (putative) unrequited love.However, Tesla was foremost an inventor, not an eccentric, and so the content and context of his inventions should be foremost in any biography of him. It's clear that despite this being Cheney's second book on Tesla, she simply does not understand the technical content of Tesla's work. For the reader, this is merely unfortunate. What is inexcusable, and intellectually dishonest, is that Cheney plagiarizes the writings of Tesla himself---unattributed verbatim copying---to provide explanations where she herself is unable. And not even good ones, at that.Here are two examples. The first appears on page 37 and refers to Tesla's bladeless turbine:---What he built was a cylinder freely rotatable on two bearings and partly surrounded by a rectangular trough which fit it perfectly. The open side of the trough was closed by a partition and the cylindrical segment divided into two compartments entirely separated from each other by airtight sliding joints. One of these compartments being sealed and exhausted of air, the other remaining open, perpetual rotation of the cylinder would result---or so the inventor thought.---This paragraph was lifted verbatim from \\"My Inventions\\" by Nikola Tesla (Filiquarian, 2006; p. 32) without attribution. (In the original, the last words were \\"at least, I thought so\\".) The latter work by Tesla, a brief autobiography only recently published, does not appear to have been available in print when Cheney's book was written; perhaps Cheney was assuming none of her readers also had access to the manuscript.The second example is even stranger. In an explanation of Tesla's \\"magnifying transmitter\\" appearing on page 147, Cheney writes:---He considered the ultimate design to be a transformer having a secondary in which the parts, charged to a high potential, were of considerable area and arranged in space along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature, thereby insuring a small electric surface density everywhere. Thus no leak could occur even if the conductor were bare.---I read this impenetrable paragraph half a dozen times before finally giving up trying to make sense of it. I wasn't sure if it was my lack of physics expertise, or Cheney's lack of explicatory clarity that was to blame. When I reached page 175, I was in no doubt. Cheney writes:---\\"Well, then, in the first place\\", he wrote, \\"it is a resonant transformer with a secondary in which the parts, charged to a high potential, are of considerable area and arranged in space along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature, and at proper distances from one another, thereby insuring a small electric surface density everywhere so that no leak can occur even if the conductor is bare.\\"---What is astonishing here is not only that Cheney so wantonly plagiarizes Tesla's writing, but that she also (correctly) characterizes his explanation as \\"tantalizingly vague\\"---having shamelessly used the exact same explanation herself only 30 pages earlier.In his introduction, Leland Anderson asks why anyone should wish to undertake another biography of Tesla after John J. O'Neill's \\"Prodigal Genius\\" (1943). He concludes that O'Neill's biography was \\"authoritative\\" but \\"thin with regard to his interactions with personal associates\\". Perhaps Cheney's \\"Man out of Time\\" might fill that particular gap, but it is certainly not authoritative, and her (and her publisher's) sloppiness are embarrassing.I recommend that readers with a technical interest in Tesla's work look elsewhere."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Tesla was such a fascinating scientist -- trailblazing, mysterious and quirky -- that it would be hard to write a boring book about him. Cheney's bio, however, makes a valiant attempt.Her material is poorly organized. She jumps back and forth in time, from the young Tesla to the old Tesla, with no warning or pattern. She jumps around in subjects almost as willfully. Her treatment of Tesla is reverent and laudatory one minute, dismissive and belittling the next.She gives almost no firm dates, so I found myself often bewildered about exactly which Tesla was being discussed. Her description of Tesla's science makes it clear that she was no scientist herself, and in fact makes Tesla's accomplishments all the harder to decipher. And most damning of all, she alludes to Tesla's odd habits and personal quirks, but never once comes right out and describes them.Tesla's story makes for a fascinating biography, but Cheney's may not be it."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"The best biography written on one of the most amazing men of the 20th century, or perhaps of all-time.Nikola Tesla was one of the world's greatest inventors, and definitely its most mysterious. To say that Telsa was ahead of his time is putting it rather mildly. Most of his inventions were so advanced that the public had a difficult time grasping just how important they really were.Although Marconi is often credited with the invention of radio, the real credit goes entirely to Tesla. A long-running battle between the two ended when American courts essentially invalidated Marconi's radio patent, and awarded credit for the invention to Nikola Telsla.In addition to radio, Tesla also invented Alternating Current (AC), which is the form of electricity used to deliver power to most homes and businesses on earth. He also patented hundreds of other inventions, many of which are in use today. Others are yet to be understood by modern scientists.Probably just as fascinating as Tesla's inventions was Telsa himself though. He was the original, real-life \\"mad scientist\\", and often discussed his invention of the \\"death ray\\" with the popular press. The world has never seen an inventor the likes of Nikola Tesla, and may never see one again. This book is a fascinating look at an amazing individual."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Nicola Tesla is one of the wonders of recent centuries. A more complex and mysterious man can hardly be imagined. He is known to have invented things like Alternate Current (AC), robots, guided missles, and the radio, among many other things. During his later years he was constantly broke and had no funds to purchase the equipment he needed to test his theories, and it is rumored that he invented a way to transmit energy wirelessly, a type of electic force field that could encircle an entire country and prevent it from being invaded, a death-ray that killed with highly concentrated energy beams, and a way to light the earth at night by stimulating the chemicals present in the atmosphere. He is also known to have invented an oscillator which he could fit into his pocket with which he could destroy buildings and once accidentally used to start a small earthquake in New York.In addition to his imaginitive and innovative inventions, Tesla himself was an exceedingly interesting man. He was plauged by what sounds to me to be Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (though the book never called it that). He had to do things in groups of three (for example, if he walked around a block he had to do it three times), his apartment or hotel room number had to be divisible by three or he could not stay there, he had to calculate the cubic volume of his food before he ate it, etc. He also could not touch or be touched by other human beings and was excessively afraid of human hair. In addition to all this, he became obsessed with pigeons in his later years, and would take them into his rented room. He aquired many pigeons, and was kicked out of his hotel because of it. He moved about to other places and his pigeons followed him. If he could not make it to the park to feed the pigeons, he hired someone to do it for him, and when he went through a particularly sparce period when he was nearly bankrupt, he lived on crackers so that he could buy bird feed for his pigeons.Needless to say, this is not a boring book at all. It discusses two things: Nicola Tesla and his inventions. Both Telsa himself and his inventions are some of the most interesting things that you will ever read about (as you can tell from the above paragraphs). You may have read fictional accounts of mad scientists, but Tesla is the only real one that I know of. I highly recommend reading about Tesla, and this book is as good a place to start as any that I know of.Many who have heard of Tesla have heard about him mainly in the form of conspiracy theories. His strange inventions and even stranger claims in his old age, combined with his excessively eccentric personality have made him the center of any number of consipracy theories, and the dissapearance of his papers into the hands of the government and the government's subsequent denial of their possession of the papers only heightens feelings of curiousity and suspicion about him. Thankfully, Cheney takes the road less traveled and does not devote her book to conspiracies and extravagant claims. Most of her claims are backed up by citations from Tesla's works, newspapers, or those who knew him personally. When she does discuss controversial and unproven theories she makes sure to mention that they are controversial and she leans heavily toward disbelieving the conspiracy theories surrounding Tesla. In short, this is a very well researched book, providing the information needed to do more research if you feel inspired to do so after reading it. It is not a conspiracy theory book, unlike most of the other books I have seen about Tesla. Definitely a book worth reading.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Cheney has a very pleasant writing style and she keeps the story moving well. But it seems clear that she didn't really understand Tesla's inventions and had a hard time distinguishing between what he did and what he said he did. It also appears that Cheney gives credibility to ESP and auras and I am not sure that this is the best way of thinking when doing a biography of someone like Tesla. This somewhat diminished my enjoyment of the book but it was still worth reading and is an excellent starting point in exploring Tesla's life."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Excellent introductory work on one of the most brilliant scientists of the 19-th and 20-th Centuries.Nikola Tesla is a fellow who gave us the System of Electrical Power (Generators, Motors, High-Tension Transmission Lines, Fluorescent Light) that lights our homes, runs our factories, trains, cars, our hydro power plants.He opened our eyes and gave us pointers to follow with his basic patents in Radio, Robotics, Energy utilization, Communication, High-Energy and Plasma Physics, and many other areas of science and technology.In addition to the above, as it was not enough, Tesla's genius ventured into many other fields. Over 400 US and Foreign Patents bear his name in the fields as diverse as &quot;AND Gate&quot; without our computers would not work, Bladeless Turbine with high efficiency, High-Frequency Heating Pads used in medical treatment of cancer, High-Voltage Coils that spark our gasoline powered car engines, and ...

It is incredible that one man could be a pioneer in so many separate fields of technology. Moreover, it is incredible that one man can be traced back to be the originator of practically all of our global power and information infrastrucure- yet he benefited so little for it in terms of either credit or wealth.Nikola Tesla was the single genius behind the the entire modern polyphase and single phase system for generating, transmitting, and utilizing electrical current. He was no mere theorist- he actually designed the dynamos, motors (the FIRST AC motors- when all the \\"experts\\" said that it was impossible), transformers, and automatic controls. It all occurred to him in a flash in the 1880's. This alone should have made him the greatest of modern inventors, yet it was only a tiny part of his genius. Tesla also invented wireless communication (Marconi used his patents and lied about it.) Now combine this with his seminal work in superconductivity (he had to invent the technology to produce liquid oxygen on an industrial scale), cryogenics, fluorescent lights, radio-control, robotics, logic circuits, x-rays, radar, aeronautics, blade less turbines, etc. He didn't merely predict the developments in these fields- if you look he held the original U.S. patents backed by detailed drawings and models (this book does an excellent job in tracing those patents.) Much of it dated from the 19th century- before the \\"electron\\" had been discovered or named.Yet, he received so little in credit or financial reward. After his time working for Edison (who cheated him him out of his promised fee for redesigning his DC dynamos), and after starting up and being forced out of his own arc lighting company, he was actually penniless and forced to work as a street gang laborer during the recession of of 1886. He barely survived. In fact he often found it difficult to even pay his room rent during his life. One is stunned to find that this greatest of minds could be so poorly treated by society- it truly puts one own misfortunes into perspective...Those people who only associate the inventor with high frequency, high voltage stage spectaculars only see the tip of the iceberg. The only reason that Tesla even put on such theatrical displays was to try to attract investment capital from ignorant but wealthy men that did not understand his real work.Personally, Tesla was an enigma. He held that human beings were fundamentally no more than \\"meat machines.\\" Yet there has seldom been a more altruistic personality. He did not subscribe to the rule of the jungle and the social Darwinism of his times. In fact, he essentially gave away his royalty rights to Westinghouse just to see that his superior system would actually be given to the world. Plus, there is the fact that Tesla experienced many instances of ESP and precognition in his life- yet he seemed to pass this off as a type of \\"mental radio\\" not yet explained. However, he never did come to grips as to how he could predict events in the future...One result of my reading the is book was that I grew ashamed that I kept a picture of Thomas Edison over my drawing board for years. Edison was a petty little man who behaved shamefully, especially concerning Tesla. Tesla was by far the greater innovator, plus a polished gentleman, linguist, and poet. One thing stuck out forcefully- Tesla was a great believer in developing solar, wind, geothermal, and ocean power as well as other forms of renewable energy. On the other hand, Edison held that such methods would not be needed for 50,000 years because just chopping down the South American jungles would provide us with that much fuel...\\"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid by night;God said, Let Tesla be, and all was light.\\""},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Although, the countries of Serbia and Croatia are on everyone's minds as war-torn, depopulated, and religiously segregated, they were not always so. They had, and still have, high universities and arts, sufficient to produce the likes of Nikola Tesla. This is the biography of the man who invented the A/C motor, flourescent light bulbs, electric starters(tesla coil), RADIO, wireless power, telemetry(something near and dear to every spaceman and submariner), x-rays ( known as shadow graphs ), electro-therapy and on and on. He made possible the Niagara Fall Power Plant, cellular telephony as well as nearly every household appliance. Marconi, who is thought by many, and in some circles mistakenly celebrated, as having invented radio, did not. He usurped Tesla's demonstrated and patented work. In 1947, the US threw out Marconi's patents as infringing on Tesla's, restoring credit to Tesla. Originally an employee and later the nemesis of Alvin Edison. He held over 700 patents; the flourescent light bulb and the shadow graph he did not patent. Oddly enough, based on Tesla's shadow graphs Roetgen went on to receive the Nobel Prize for what he termed the X-Ray. Tesla is the most under-appreciated, unrecognized hero of the late 19th and early 20th century. America and the world owe him more than can ever be repaid."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"After reading this book, I truly feel like I have gotten to know Tesla on a personal level. I feel the author does a superb job of conveying Tesla's personal side, as well as his many unbelievable professional achievements. The author combines many stories of his personal life with how these led to his brilliant inventions and does it in such a way that I could not help but to admire Tesla's unyielding devotion to his work. Few people are as committed to anything as this great man was! Although Tesla might arguably be described as a \\"mad genius\\" by some, there were so many other facets to his personality that I can only view him as an incredibly gifted, talented, and caring human being who marched to the beat of his own drum. He was truly a man ahead of his time!"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Cheney provides a lot of in depth information about Tesla's personal life, which at times is interesting. She refers often to his personal letters, which is information that is often hard to find in other biographies. However, there are a lot of lackings in the book as well. First, for anyone with a scientific or engineering background it is unsatisfying. Cheney's reiteration of Tesla's language when referring to his inventions is often archaic and unclear. I'm not sure her educational background, but she does not seem to be able to convey the engineering significance of his ideas. Secondly, she seems to almost be \\"defending\\" Tesla throughout the book. It doesn't necessarily detract from the book, but it comes across as desperate. Finally, it seems like the book's a little long. I feel like some information could be left behind. Nevertheless, for a compelte biography of all aspects of Tesla's life, this is the one for you--just be ready to focus more on his social interactions than his inventions."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"For some odd reason, there are not very many books out there on Tesla. This one is all it takes.The way he could visualize an invention with such focus that he could even make changes to it based on how he saw it operating in his mind, without ever fabricating an actual model, was pretty wild. Some of the concepts he was working on almost 100 years ago still cannot be duplicated. Too bad he couldn't channel some of that genius toward his finances.The book has a good mix of his technical inventions as well as the personal aspects of this fascinating inventor's life."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This book is, without doubt, the most complete and concise biography on Nikola Tesla.

There are several good books out there if you want to reproduce his experiments, but no one book will tell you more about the man, himself."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"That's what my initial assessment of Nikola Tesla had been prior to reading this marvelous account of his life. I had only viewed him as most of probably still do...as mere \\"footnote\\" in the annals of the Industrial Revolution.Such could not be farther from the truth!Margaret Cheney does a superb job of mastering not only the scientific aspects of Tesla's life, but the social nuances as well with her biography of this amazing gentleman.Nikola Tesla was (and most likely still is in many circles) considered one of the world's greatest inventors, and also, one fo the most enigmatic. Most all of his inventions were so far beyond the public, that even today, we have a difficult time grasping just how important they really were.Think Marconi invented the radio?Think again.Think Westinghouse was behind alternating current?Wrong!Power generators for the Niagra Falls hydro-electric plant?You're getting warmer.These (and so much more) were invented by this man from Yugoslavia...that's right...he was an IMMIGRANT (with a passion for feeding pigeons)...imagine that!This is one book that begs NOT to be put down!Many of Tesla's patents are still hidden away, collecting dust, and have never been further contemplated by even today's scientists.Truly, this man was far ahead of his (or even our) time!"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Nikola Tesla, a Serbian immigrant to America, was a strange man. He was frequently referred to in the press as a 'mad genius', and previous biographies have been sensational, rather than informative.Tesla thought in pictures rather than words (like Einstein) and had a photographic memory until well into his adult life. At least three of his senses, hearing, sight and touch, were sufficiently over-developed that they caused him physical discomfort. He was an intuitive thinker: he grasped concepts as a whole, and then worked backwards, painfully and not always successfully, to realize the practical details that would utilize his grand ideas. He was able to model and test equipment in his head, rotating it as needed and putting it through its paces, so that when the equipment was finally built, it worked perfectly the first time.The problem, admitted by biographer Cheney, is that an inventor who goes directly from mental concept to patent papers leaves a thin trail behind him as to his thought processes. The constant need to obtain funding for his experiments and the legal ramifications of being first to patent new ideas, meant that Tesla -- already a loner by nature -- was driven to keep his work as secret as possible. Cheney finally located his private papers in a government department, out of sight under lock and key.Tesla was more of a scientist than the purely practical Edison, his main competitor for funding. Although some of his more famous patents -- the Tesla coil and 'polyphase' (i.e. alternating current) electricity -- became the foundation of American engineering before World War II, other patents were filed and not followed up on as Tesla lost interest in them. He filed patents for a transistor and for wireless broadcasting. But it was Shockley et al who build the first working modern computers (and received the Nobel prize) and Marconi who transmitted the first long-distance wireless messages and is generally recognized as the founder of modern broadcasting.Biographer Cheney has presented as much of the material on Tesla's life as seems currently available except, of course, for the patents themselves, which are publicly available. It is up to us, the readers, to try and understand how the mind of this inventive genius worked based on our own knowledge of both science and psychology. That doesn't seem an unreasonable chore on behalf of a man who once said:&quot;I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success.&quot;"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I stopped reading the book in chapter 9 but should have stopped earlier. There is no indication that the author can offer novel insights into Tesla, his inventions and contributions to the science and industry of his time. The writing is dry and unimaginative. It is also pretty clear that the author has no deep understanding of electric forces and the devices that harness them. I would love to find a good scholarly biography of Tesla. This book is far from that."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":". . . and I'm looking for them. I picked up this book while browsing biographies in the library, and was just appalled at the writing when I opened it to start reading. Though it seemed to be grammatically correct, it was, as previously noted, dry, lifeless, and, in short, a drudge to read. With Tesla's brilliance and eccentricities, there is no reason not to have a lively book . . . apparently the author thought the subject matter would carry the day. It didn't."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Already knowing something about Tesla's eccentric character I was excited to read this book. However, I soon found it confusing, poorly writen, and very easy to put down. Tesla himself is an interesting character who perhaps doesn't get the credit he deserves and his story should be told. He was largely responsible for our advances using alternating current, better understanding of electricity, and he also produced many other inventions. Some of his inventions fell more to the theoretical as opposed to practical side but there can be no doubt that he was a veritable intellect. The problem with Cheney is the book focuses too much on other people instead of Tesla and very little in the way of describing the history of Tesla as a man or of Tesla's character is expounded upon in this book. Instead we are given a bunch of little episodes about Tesla interspersed with droning technical detail. This was supposed to be a biography and not a technical journal. As an example allow me to post part of one of her paragraphs:*The relevance of ball lightning to fusion research has to do with the problem of confining plasma. The heart of the most common type of experimental fusion reaction involves taking isotopic hydrogen gas and both accelerating and superheating it until the hydrogen nuclei fuse to make helium nuclei, releasing, in the process, staggering amounts of energy. Along the way, while the hydrogen is being charged with vast amounts of kinetic and thermal energy, it enters an imperfectly understood material state known as plasma*Now, boy doesn't that make for compelling reading! Besides these rather boring technical interludes the book does have a middle section with photographs and smidgets of insight which help prevent making the book a complete waste. Perhaps, most irritatingly to me was the way Cheney was disorganized and bounced around in time. It was hard to tell if she was talking about the younger or the older Tesla and if she was discussing something that already happened or that was occuring later in his life. Anyway, this is a shame because Tesla is without doubt someone worth studying but based on the things I've mentioned I would have to suggest a different biography."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I recommed this book on Nikola Tesla to anyone who knows very little about this amazing scientist. The book gives a concise overview on his life and some of his scientific achivements. Ms. Cheney also brings into view some of the political events that were going on at the turn of the century and the impact that major personalities of the times had on these events.

While I agree with a great deal of the propositions made about Tesla in the book, and COMPLETELY agree about the radio patent debacle, Ms. Cheney spends a bit too much time overstating the scope of Tesla's work and overemphasizing its significance. A test in which Tesla noted something that might be called plasma != creating plasma physics, for example.Anyway, it was still definitely worth reading, so I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I have been intrigued by Tesla for many years as little is known or told of him, or so it seemed. On the odd occasions his name did crop up, it seemed to either be for something important (the name of unit of measure, A.c. generators) or outlandish (transmitting electric power without wires).Tesla is a fascinating and colorful but often overlooked historical figure, by comparison to his contempory Edison at least. Yet his earliest inventions are still the basis of all major electrical power systems around the world, while some others are still used in laboratories. Some of his later work seems fanciful and extravagent now -- he was clearly not afraid to think big, very big in some instances. Some of his ideas seem fanciful or futuristic even now. Tesla was facinated by very high voltage electricity and enjoyed an understanding of it that few if any could equal at that time. This book does a fine job of summarizing the history, character and work of \\"the great man\\" and reveals many -- but not all -- of the mysteries surrounding him. His relationships with some of the major figures and financial giants of the day are touched on. It also covers, quite fully but sensitively the rather sad decent of Tesla into a hotel dwelling, lonely, eccentric \\"pigeon man\\" (the male equivalent of a \\"cat woman\\"?) towards the end of his life.This book has pretty much satisified my curiosity about Tesla -- well at least as much as is likely to come out in my lifetime!"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"What a fascinating man.

Sure enough, there are plenty of tales about his strange mental behaviors and nervous breakdowns. There are no doubts that he was brilliant in the first half of his life, but he was very clearly a sick man. One can only wonder why it has taken over a century for the toxicity of electricity to emerge when Tesla clearly was displaying problems from his exposures. The toxicity of electricity is an \\"inconvenient truth\\". This was a great book that gave me the answers that I was looking for. I am now back into good health after detoxifying from the toxic exposures that I had.

Getting it for my Kindle made it even more appealing. A very interesting book on a man I thought I knew a lot about."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This book did educate me about some of Tesla's life and work. Whether because Tesla was impenetrable or because the author chose not to delve more into Tesla's idiosyncrasies, I was left with a feeling that I did not get the full picture of the man. Obviously, way ahead of the science of his time, why was he so stubborn in his mundane dealings? Why not hire a business manager and concentrate on the big picture instead of getting lost in trying to scratch out the dollars necessary to survive? Why get hung up with Morgan?For a nonscientist, like me, many of the inventions and gadgets and discoveries seemed vague and hard to decipher. Given the importance of Tesla in advancing the field of electricity, the book does serve as an introduction to a much under reported and under publicized aspect of scientific history. I feel that this book is a start to explore Tesla and his inventions and his insights. I would like to see a coil in action."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"The author is a good writer who has chosen a towering, almost out of reach, subject. My only quibble is a bit of meandering in the structure of the book, a faint tone of confusion (perhaps due to the enormity of the \\"genius\\") and a slightly too bedazzled attitude on the part of the biographer. Good job, but one day Tesla will get a really talented, penetrating biographer and the resulting book will blow the tops of people's heads off. What he did, fooled around with, patented, and so on was entirely incomrephensible to most during his lifetime and still remains spooky to most people today."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Cheney does an excellent job of describing Tesla's life, which just like for other geniuses was somewhat troubled at times. The book is loaded with facts and some interesting photos. While I enjoyed reading about Tesla's early life (his walk off the roof with an umbrella opened thinking he could fly) and was glad he \\"recovered\\" sufficiently to move into work that to this day we are still learning and benefiting from ....I'm more impressed with her excellent research into developments made during the war, and later--the latter half of his life. Also of note: I had no idea Tesla was good friends with Mark Twain until I read it in Man Out Of Time! I appreciate that Cheney takes the time to bring Tesla to life. He was more than a scientist. He was a true genius, in my view even more so than Edison. Her factual description of the \\"war\\" between AC and DC electricity is one of my favorite chapters.A lot of technical books are just that -- \\"technical\\", but Cheney makes the work of a genius, a genius we are still trying to figure out, easy to read whether you have a background in science and engineering or are simply someone who wants to know more about the guy who pioneered the technology that lets you sit on the sofa sipping beer while you channel surf -- 'cause he invented remote control.Wonderful book. I've read excerpts to my daughter and countless friends, both male and female, young and old. We're still figuring out how to use some of the technology this wonderful inventor created. ....fluorescent lights...didn't come up with a use them until about 50 years later for example..."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Pond: \\"Looks like Marconi got the jump on you.\\"Tesla: \\"Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents.\\" (161)*I'm not sure we will ever understand Tesla. First, he was head and shoulders above everyone else, we are like puppy dogs trying to keep up with his great strides. One biographer suggested that Tesla was the avatar of an alien from Venus (p. xiii). The problem with that theory is that it is almost believable!The second problem is that Tesla was a classic introvert. (The first observation is the cause of the second.) As a classic introvert, he had a chronic case of the Da Vinci Syndrome. He was so smart, his internal world was far more exciting than the humdrum external world--the world of politics, back-stabbing, no finaces, and the ever-cascading trifles and trivia.The difference is that we can read Da Vinci's notebooks and try to reconstruct his mind, much as we can read all of the Lost Tales of Middle-Earth (Tolkien also had Da Vinci syndrome) and think about what could have been. However, with Tesla he was not a note keeper. On top of that we have the problem of the missing Tesla papers. Thirdly, if we even had the papers, could we make sense of them?Cheney's masterwork is worthy of her subject. It is readable, balances the hard science with the human-interest, and when you are done, you know you have read a beautiful tragicomedy. This book has converted me to Tesla, and I suspect it will do the same for you."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"TESLA: MAN OUT OF TIME by Margaret Cheney, originally published 1981. It is so difficult to find reasonable, believable material about the great inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla. This biography is really the only reference source you'll ever need - and one of the very few you'll ever find. If you wish to supplement this with a dvd I suggestTeslafrom 2007.I warn you now: keep away from all other biographies, which are only so much flotsam/jetsam.A good friend of mine and I formed a Nikola Tesla fan club when we were in grade school. This nearly-seven-foot-tall Serbian engineering genius and inventor inspired us like no one else. Einstein, I must say, had received no attention from me at that tender age of 9 - I was mesmerized by Tesla. At first I even thought he was Hispanic like me, because I hoped that were so.Ms. Cheney's biography is without question the primer and the comprehensive story of Nikola Tesla, from his beginnings to his sad end. Having very little to read about Tesla in my childhood, this has been my \\"Tesla bible\\" ever since it was first published. Though I came to own several paperback editions of this beautiful biography, I presently have only the 1989 Dorset Press hardback, without photos.This biography places the reader exactly in every single scene of Tesla's amazing life. From the childhood in Serbia beset with tragedies and psychological tortures to his Ney York City lab, to his amazing field experiments in Colorado to his cramped, semi-senile final years in a New York motel - it's all here. You can feel Tesla's \\"psychic strain\\" as Cheney puts it, struggling with what was probably autism and OCD.Cheney does not shrink from criticizing Tesla's many shortcomings. She indicates that he hated overweight people with a vengeance matched only by his anti-Semitism; he despised people he considered beneath him or intellectually slow, despised Thomas Edison (perhaps with good reasons) and could not bear to hear the name of Marconi. (In spite of Cheney's detailed reminder that in the 1930s the Supreme Court found that Tesla, not Marconi, invented the radio.) Cheney reminds us of Tesla's many failures, his incredibly childish temperament and selfish ways.His relationships with powerful men like Westinghouse and Morgan, Edison and others is explored deeply. Cheney does not shy away from questions about Tesla's homosexuality - but as she concludes, from the historical record there is nothing to prove Tesla was. There is little to prove he wasn't! Cheney handles this interesting mystery with maturity, aplomb and clarity. She allows the reader to decide. In my view, there was enough written material and Cheney addresses it sufficiently to convince me Tesla was an active gay man.The inventions and actual work Tesla accomplished are explored deeply. Cheney does not fall into the sinkhole of antigravitational UFOs for the Germans or any of the other intellectual trash that is pinned onto Tesla's coat. This is a straightforward, beautifully rendered exploration of Tesla's inner and outer life, and the whacko theories are left in the dust where they belong.Cheney informs us of an interesting phenomenon: Tesla was hard to describe. She manages it with scientific precision, and I have always been bothered by the fact that he is played by stumpy little actors. Tesla was 6'6\\", very slender and physically powerful, athletic and beautiful. His eyes, which were blue-grey, and his jet-black hair threw everyone into confusion. People somehow got the impression his eyes were green and his hair was brown.This always annoys me because I do not think one can enjoy the measure of a person without the literal measure/appearance of that person. How can we feel the majestic awe of Tesla's presence, which was very real, if we think he was a chunky little man? This traces back to my own hypersensitivity about my great-grandfather on the maternal side. He was 7'7\\" - this always reminded me of Tesla due to the numbers - and I can only marvel that the two men were contemporaries.What it must have been like to live when Tesla lived!Tesla is covered from another angle in Cheney's final chapter, \\"The Missing Papers\\". In this great chapter, researched like no one had done before or has done since, Cheney explores Tesla's private papers and their misadventures after his death. Why was the FBI called? As Cheney explains, Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanovich, was the Yugoslavian ambassador - and he was key in the early days of Tesla's 'personal effects quest'.Did Tesla have vital research among all those papers? Cheney thinks not - but she is constricted by the period in which she did her research. Cheney was one of the first major authors working on such a project to avail herself fully of the Freedom of Information Act. Cheney questions the active interest the government had in Tesla's papers and personal effects. She reminds us that an order was issued preventing anyone from entering his personal effects for some time. What stamina Cheney has for research - and what a biography!Do not confuse this with the older \\"biography\\" by the turgid romance writer Margaret Storm,The Nikola Tesla Story. Storm, in accord with the stupidities of the Victorian and Edwardian Eras, literally believed Tesla was from Venus. Margaret Storm's bio was printed by herself; the whole text is in green letters. All I can say is: asinine and weird. I warn you in the face of this new edition. Also ...NOTE TO BUYERS/COLLECTORS: Cheney's biography of Tesla has had many editions over the decades. Especially in 1981 and 1983, about a dozen different publishers put out this book. The original 1st ed. seems to be the Prentice-Hall hardback, 1981. Everyone went somewhat mad and began re-issuing it circa 1989 until the early 1990s. The latest is the edition you see here, Simon & Schuster's 2001 paperback.I can only admonish you to get an older hardcover edition if you can - avoid the older paperbacks because their quality is dreadful. The spines break and they tend to be published on newsprint-pulp. Dreadful. I am very happy with my Dorset Publishers 1989 hardback copy, no photos, a good, solid book."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Having been involved in the utility and finance industry for a few years I noted how much we take for granted the understandings of science in terms of AC electricity and tele-communications. Introductory economics pushes electricity and the invention of the motor car and later the computer, as being \\"infrastructural enablers\\" of economic growth and development. So our modern society owes a lot to those early pioneers.The fact that one man (Tesla) was in the middle of this early utility pioneering around the 1890's to 1920's at a time when the early seeds were sown for mega-corporates (including the Fed Reserve Act 1913), yet today its still vague as to what he really stood for, is amazing. This is testamount to how private Tesla was. In this context I believe Cheney did an admirable and focussed effort. The book is a must read for those, like me, who had no idea what Tesla's life outside of his inventions was like.Tesla's experience shows how important it is to have people on the side of great inventors and thinkers to help commercialise and ground their ideas. The book shows how backfires can easily happen for the eccentric inventors who need loads of personal space and then as a result end up without an implementation team.I prefer the term \\"futant\\" for Tesla - a futurist who's consciousness far exceeded the level of the times. It would be interesting, as Cheney points out, just what Tesla could have done in our modern age with computers etc. Perhaps Tesla Tower's would be providing free and wireless energy from the ionosphere and across the world, shifting us from a Type 0 to Type 1 civilisation as Michio Kaku in Visions describes.One can only dream...Regards,Daniel John Hancock"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Like most information about Tesla, useful information can be gleaned from this book, but not all is revealed. The more information that one has about Tesla and his inventions, all interact to educate the reader/technician/inventor. This is necessary because most technical Tesla components have to be made and fashioned on the spot, and then tuned and calibrated to perform the desired function (it's not like you can go to Radio Shack and buy key Tesla components off the shelf).Indeed, Tesla spent a lot more time making and trying out certain key components, than making the overall end invention of his tinkering. There is some debate that Tesla was Autistic, and through quirks of nature, was able to focus on ideas and thoughts in ways most of the rest of us cannot. He probably was able to build the whole thing inside his head, and his challenges were not so much to know what would happen, but rather, how to make a physical model that would work as well as the intellectual model of whatever goal or interactive unit worked inside of his head.Through the use and making of very complex components, Tesla later found that many of the end results, intended or not, were 'simple' oversights or side bars of his experiments, and these 'simple' technologies assumed a life all their own; sometimes overshadowing the more complex and intricate workings of the previously envisioned result. He seemed to be extremely distracted by sidebars. Working on something would spark interest in a side note or reaction, and there he would go, off on another trail. Started 100 things, finished maybe 5. but gathered data that only added to his catalog of possibilities that obviously, no one but he could comprehend.Here we are, amateurs and novices (compared with the Master Tesla), attempting to pick up the pieces from obscure notes and diagrams, and reproducing 'simple' actions, which are anything but simple. This, the legacy of a true inventor, rather than a tinkerer, as was Edison.Lest anyone think about journals and writings of Tesla becoming readily available, most acredited sources believe that 80% or more of his technical notes and works ended up in Belgrade, and with the last Croatian/Serbian war, their continued existence is doubtful.Yet, with what few notes we have, our quest for knowledge and witness to the vast fields of thought and technology unmasked by Tesla is simply unfathomable to the informed. If psychic contact and all that stuff really worked, how is it that no one has taken notes and academics from Tesla? It sort of makes you wish that Some other gifted autistic would focus on electronics, rather than piano.Good luck in your quest, and be open to purchasing all you can about Tesla, the Genius Inventor."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Margaret Cheney has taken a biographical look at a now generally forgotten inventor, Nikola Tesla, who was a hero to millions in Victorian times. Depending on how much of Tesla's self-promotional speeches and conspiracy theories you believe, Tesla either developed, contemplated, or imaged almost every new device of 20th century, including radio, television, space travel, fluorescent lighting, x-rays, nuclear fusion, particle beams, and the sabers from Star Wars.It is true that he pioneered alternating current, leading Westinghouse to a technical leadership position ahead of General Electric and Edison. Unfortunately having the best mousetrap only lasts so long, especially when patents are violated, and neither Westinghouse nor Tesla profited in the long run. Tesla is sometimes remembered for his work in illuminating Chicago for the World's Fair and building power plants at Niagara Falls and location out West to support remote mining operations.Tesla grew up in Balkan poverty, but was quickly identified for his unbelievable intellect. After some practical experience in Europe he came to America to meet Edison. The jealousy and rivalry took root nearly from the start and Tesla quickly moved on to Westinghouse which was not as invested in the direct current power systems.At his core Tesla was an inventor. He seldom completed a project before moving on to the next big idea, much to the concern of his investment bankers, friends, and employers. Unfortunately his really big idea, wireless power, was never developed. We could use it now.Cheney's book is very unusual in the writing style, it is really a compilation of quotes, anecdotes, speculation, gossip, and hard to follow streams of technical jargon. Some of this is necessary due to Tesla's character. He was a bachelor and loner, always working in a laboratory, running experiments in secrecy throughout the night, breaking only for meals at luxury hotels and midnight sojourns to feed and mend Manhattan's pigeons."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Tesla: Man Out of Time, by Margaret Cheney, is a comprehensive view into physicist and inventor Nikola Tesla's life. It documents his birth into a brilliant family in Croatia and his coming to America where his life seemed to alternate from complete success to utter poverty. He dreamt big and some saw him as an utter head case (although they probably were encouraged to come to this conclusion after witnessing several of Tesla's personality quirks) while other saw him as the greatest inventor of all time. The author supports Tesla in every way, however, which takes a bit away from the objectivity I expected. Surprisingly, Edison takes a shocking role as Telsa's antagonist. Even though today Edison is seen as one of the biggest visionaries of the period in the book he comes across as a grumpy man who only was looking to protect his assets in the electricity market. Tesla lived most of his life in debt even though he should have been one of the richest men in the world. Several of his projects fell through due to budget shortcomings and the withdrawal of support from financial backers. The author does do a good job demonstrating how brilliant he was, even if the reader does have to sift through some of her one-sidedness.The bottom line is Nikola Tesla was a brilliant, interesting man and this book will give you a great insight to his life."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I have read this book twice and I intend to read it again.

Cheney has written a solid and serviceable biography of Tesla. I realize this is faint praise. There's nothing wrong with the book, and quite a bit really right.

I got the facts, but missed the madness.(I did like her view on Edison.

It is very true that Tesla just didn't have enough time, but it is still proven and definitely seen in this book that he was the greatest inventor and electrical engineer of the 19th and 20th century.I high recommend this book.

Margaret Cheney has created a well balanced book that tells both the positive and negative aspects of Tesla, without bias. Not only does she cover the history of the man, but explains the relevance of each event in his life in a way that is entertaining, fluid and engaging.I have read a great deal of books on Tesla, but this is the only one I buy to give to others. It isn't a laundry list of every invention, it is instead about the journey of the man through life, his relationships with industry leaders like Westinghouse, Edison and others. No other book explains the man himself like this one."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"If you read just one book about a quirky genius, this should be the one. Tesla was an unusual man.

Notes 15 pgs., Postscript, Index 10 pgs., 26 B&W; glossy photos, 9 1/4\\" x 6 1/4\\".Authoring two prior 2 books, this is well-researched bibliographic portrait of the World's most highly acclaimed contributing scientist born in Croatia Jul. 9, 1856 & dying New York City, American citizen, Jan 7, 1943 at age 86. There are 30 chapters, given some prolixity, containing that gamut of details providing solid characterization to a mysterious, impeccably dressed loner, a dedicated inventor of 1st magnitude, and whose legacy lay in his inventions as AC motors, generators & transmission lines, radio, Tesla coil, & founding principles for guided missiles, submarines, odometers, turbines, and the like.This period of history saw many present-day electro-mechanical devices invented, perfected and placed into use for transportation, communication and manufacturing, largely machinery affording efficiency - but also a time for several wars, economic downturns and fierce competition, -- as that between Thomas Edison and Tesla. The author succinctly describes the period, the people and emerging problems of early 20th Century America and intellectual greatness, and unique charm of Tesla, who, in his later years, speculated on scientific matters that continue to baffle experts, with a chapter on a search and evaluation of/for his missing papers upon his death. He had some OCD, and was particularly fond of pigeons, especially a white one with silver-gray wing tips he communicated with.After reading divers books on Tesla, I detected modestly unobtrusive reiteration, recital and quoting of events implying a totality of factual data has been exhaustively chronicled or reclaimed - notwithstanding, this is the finest definitive review I've unearthed, and having to choose one, this would be it."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This is one of those books you finish in a short time because you just can't put it down. Sure with a subject as fascinating as Tesla it's probably not that hard to make an entertaining book but the author does a good job imo.

I saw a documentary on the man, and descided to learn more about him. When we were assigned our physics paper, I thought that the most interesting person to write about in the field of physics was Tesla. I ended up choosing this book because as I flipped through some of the pages, I realized that I would be able to understand the complicated aspects of Tesla's theories since they were so well explained. I read this book with ease and enjoyment, and it gave me good insight on Tesla's life. One thing I learned from this book was how vicious the fight was between physicists to dominate the field of electricity. Who would have guessed that Thomas Edison was such a stubborn and hated rival of Tesla? I thought that these great minds would have tried to collaborate with each other in order to craft technological advances. I was also suprised when I learned how hard it was for Tesla to get work and shelter even though he had a great mind.I definitevely recomend this book to anyone who isn't too familiar with the scientific aspects of modern electrical engineering and wants a simple but accurate explanation of Tesla's works, and anyone who wants to learn how Tesla's rose from a small town in Croatia to one of the leading physicists in the world."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"In Margaret Cheney's Tesla: Man Out of Time, the uncommonly heard of inventor's life is magnificently revealed in the most enjoyable manner. However remarkable her story recounting abilities are, Nikola Tesla's genius and interesting past surely also catches readers' attentions. He was well loved by the aristocrats from the late nineteenth century and well despised by every competitor he beat in claiming patents, but his creations of the alternating current system, which powered the homes of thousands, and his fundamental research on modern technology such as computers, war machines, and robotics, earned him respect from all those who fortunately benefited from his inventions. Although he is well acclaimed and credited now, Tesla often encountered criticism and doubt about his inventions, which were far too complicated and advanced for the people during his lifetime.

Nikola Tesla, who developed the alternating current (AC) was a most eccentric man who led a life of constant experimentation and development in the field of electricity. Although afflicted with many phobias ( he couldn't stand jewelry), Tesla was also gifted with photographic memory which he used to his advantage as he needed very little diagrams and blue prints to build his inventions, which were drawn in his head.Cheney describes Tesla's childhood as a sickly but curious boy who was recognized by his professors to be a very gifted child who was going to accomplish many great things.She tells how Tesla traveled to America and worked for Thomas Edison for a time, but eventually left because Edison would never allow Tesla to improve his eletrical machines with alternating current.He silenced all opposition when his AC electricity system was used to light the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Many had believed before that AC current was very deadly and dangerous, including Thomas Edison, Tesls's greatest rival. Edison and Tesla would have many court battles over who had invented what first. While Edison was a better marketing man, Tesla was a much better thinking man.Tesla was also the inventor of hundreds of other inventions, including many radio devices and several remote-controlled devices that he tried in vain to convince the military to purchase from him.He ran a very erratic social life and was constantly in debt. Cheney brings to life the emotional conversations that Tesla and Alexandra Johnson, wife of Robert Johnson, associate editor of 'Century' magazine, had back and forth and how Tesla was always asked to come and visit and almost always declined.For a man who was so intelligent, Tesla lacked the skills needed to maintain a balanced checkbook and Cheney recounts the many pleading letters Tesla sent to JP Morgan, George Westinghouse and others asking for capital. He also enjoyed living the life of a dapper man about Manhattan and this showed from his residence at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and his frequent dining at expensice restaurants and clubs with the wealthy New York '400'.As much as Tesla was a complicated man, Cheney gives a thorough and complete account of his life, from the experiments and ideas to the parties and social letters.Cheney fully brings to life the life of one the greatest minds and inventors that ever lived. If you are an avid Tesla enthusiast or just someone curious about one of America's greatest inventors, then pick up a copy of this book today!"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"After reading this book, the whole way of understanding what the human mind is changed for me.One of the most important things I have ever read in my life came from this very book, when Tesla is quoted saying this:&quot;Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating opon our sense organs from without. Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment, we respond in like manner to similar stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understanding is born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed, but what wecall &quot;soul&quot; is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the &quot;soul&quot; ceases likewise.&quot;As you can see, this book is so much more than just about some inventor and his amazing gadgets that created sparks!My second favorite quote from this book is this:&quot;There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. The universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and will never end.&quot;Here we can see Tesla was way before his time knowing back then what most scientists today don't know.This book really shows you a man born way before his time."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"What a disappointing read! I honestly struggled to finish this biography after starting it with such high hopes.Tesla is a fascinating character. His early work laid the groundwork for much of the modern alternating-current-based electrical grid. Later on he made major discoveries in wireless communications but was unable to capitalize on either. The later part of his life is marked by grand proclamations but little actual experimentation. He's something of a controversial figure and the jury is still out on many of his inventions, including whether or not he actually made various discoveries or if he was just deluding himself.Cheney does a remarkable job of turning this fascinating story into a dry, boring slog. While generally her writing is technically fine it just doesn't flow. She also has some very annoying habits:1. She provides very few hard dates and skips forwards and backwards in time, making it very hard to understand the ordering of major events.2. She provides almost no technical details on anything engineering-related.3. She clearly has no understanding of most of the scientific principles involved and takes all of his ramblings at face value.4. She breathlessly mentions how some of Tesla's work explains various paranormal activity which she seems to accept as fact, and at the end of the book implies that there's a huge conspiracy involving the US government to keep all of later inventions, including his \\"death ray\\", under wraps.If you're interested in learning more about Tesla, avoid this book - it will just crush your curiosity."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This book reads more like a very long feature article for a newspaper than a biography. Nikola Tesla is fascinating because of his revolutionary and fantastical ideas. He never became rich and powerful because he was too busy racking up incredible new ideas, and never converted his ideas to commercial use (like his nemesis Thomas Edison). Tesla invented alternating current, and had a chance to make royalties from each and every use of AC by the public (potentially worth billions), but signed the royalties away to preserve his friendships with industrial titans. He discovered most of the concepts of radio, but lost a messy war of words and patent lawsuits with Marconi and Edison. He invented remote control and key aspects of robotics, and envisioned (in the late 1800's) a worldwide wireless communications system that companies are still trying to develop to this day. In fact, modern scientists often &quot;discover&quot; new phenomena that Tesla brought up so long ago that nobody remembers his work and fails to give him credit. This is why Tesla continues to be so under-appreciated. On the more outlandish side, Tesla theorized that he could utilize the electrical charges in the Earth's atmosphere to turn the entire planet into a giant fluorescent light bulb; and with his concept of mechanical resonance he theorized that he could create vibrations to destroy buildings or even split the Earth in two. He could electrify the Earth itself and make the soil crackle for miles around. This was when people started calling him a madman. Another interesting aspect of Tesla was his participation is high society, as he spent much of his life schmoozing rich benefactors for capital. Few scientists of his caliber today would be such social climbers.Now what kind of a mind would lead to such a fascinating personality and such incredible ideas? You still can't tell, because Margaret Cheney fails to illuminate Tesla the man in this book. This biography is essentially the work of a reporter who has rehashed freely available information into the form of a special interest article in a local newspaper. There is more focus on Tesla's social calls and financial transactions than his ideas or personality. The book often digresses into useless detective work on the handling of Tesla's papers by various government agencies after his death, or descriptions of the current use of his ideas that read more like bizarre advertisements for the modern companies involved. One of the few attempts to provide insight into his personality is a completely ridiculous treatise stating that Tesla's hobby of caring for pigeons is related to a lack of breastfeeding as a baby. Of course, more information on how Tesla came up with his amazing ideas, and the workings of his unusual mind, is probably impossible to obtain, and this is not Cheney's fault. However, this biography is not very useful without it."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Length:: 0:14 MinsThis is a fascinating in depth writing of Tesla a brilliant man and pioneer in electronics and mechanics.I enjoyed this book thoroughly.In this clip, a friend shows and comments on this amazing book.Highly recommended.Five stars !"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Nikola Tesla, for the uninitiated, made wireless transmission (radio) a reality. He also perfected alternating current which was, up until then, merely a concept. During W.W.I he proposed using radio waves to find German U-boats in a method we now call 'triangulation'. He also envisioned a time when electricity and radio waves would be used to transmit data and images between various persons or agencies, ie; the wireless internet. This was at a time when the telephone was still viewed as a novelty. I haven't even gotten to his envisioning of geo-synchronous satellites. Oh yeah, this man died in 1942.Any one of these accomplishments would merit the highest of accolades from the scientific community yet the name Nikola Tesla is greeted, more often than not, with questions. \\"Who? I thought Marconi invented the radio...\\"Nikola Tesla was, quite simply, the most important figure of the twentieth century but he made the mistake of angering Thomas Edison by doing what Edison said couldn't be done (perfecting alternating current) and thus a Stalin-esque media campaign championed by Edison was born to impune the imperious Serb (Tesla). The inertia of the campaign continues to this day - The People's Almanac Vol. 2 credits Marconi with inventing radio...The chapters detailing Tesla's interaction with Edison are alone worth the price of the book. Sadly, it reads like a soap opera as Edison was a spiteful old man. It's a pity that Mr. Edison's ego prevented him from seeing the importance of Mr. Tesla.This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Like so many others, I was taught that Marconi invented the radio but this book addresses that issue in a chapter entitled 'The Great Radio Controversy'. This book also describes the many expirements with electricity conducted by Mr. Tesla. How different life would have been for Henry Ford if he'd been unable to build and operate his assembly lines due to a lack of sustainable power. Tesla's research into mechanical resonance still leaves me in awe - he generated earthquakes with a little gizmo he cooked up in his lab.The implications are numerous. Maybe someone would have come along to invent these devices but I can find no one person who had such a wide field of vision for the potential of electricity. Tesla proposed ways to use electric impulses as a weapon of war before W.W.II. In the 1970's computer designers were surprised to learn that some of their patent applications were denied because such devices had already existed for decades. Guess who?!I have only scratched the surface here. Nikola Tesla is one of the most important figures of the last five hundred years. Margaret Cheney has written a superb book that reads like a science fiction novel - surely no one man could have been so brilliant but Nikola Tesla was truly that brilliant.BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"Ms Cheney should clearly have stuck to the historical aspects of Tesla's life and his inventions instead of trying to write about the technical. After reading several of her speculations about Tesla's inventions, and explainations of how they worked, I had to stop reading the book becuase of her glaring ignorance on these matters. Examples are her asserations that capacitors discharge with &quot;several hundred million oscilations a second&quot; (they can, but it depends on the external circuit), and her comparison of the skin effect with superconductivity (currents flowing on the &quot;skin&quot; or surface of a conductor because of high frequencies cause the conductor to be MORE resistive, not less). She suggest that Tesla was the true inventor of radio (by her analysis, the first person who measured a magnetically induced signal of any kind should be) and the particle accelerator (again by her analysis, it should be the first person who observed that an electic field can accelerate a charged particle). On a side note about accelerators, or as she calls them &quot;atom smashers&quot;, a cyclotron cause particles to have a spiral, not circular, orbit as she says. Finally she delved into the paranormal, at which point I stopped reading. As someone who has spent a career working with high voltage, high current, and high frequency electronics, I found this book an embarrassment to the genius of Tesla's work. A word of advice to MS Cheney, get a technical editor."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"It is hard to imagine that there is anyone who does not know the names Edison and Einstein. The same should be true of Nikola Tesla, the inventor of the alternating current motor, radio, X-rays, radar and more, yet somehow Tesla's name has slipped into history, largely forgotten. As Margaret Cheney reveals in \\"Tesla: Man Out of Time\\", there are several reasons that Tesla's legacy has suffered: he didn't market himself as well as Edison, and he left no wife or children to promote his interests after his death. Although a naturalized American citizen, his ashes were returned to Croatia, the land of his birth, as were also his papers and writings. A world war and a cold war later entombed his memory.Bizarrely enigmatic yet definitely brilliant, Nikola Tesla is one of the giants of science. He was an under-educated inventor who explored the nature and properties of electricity with a rare vision and trial and error. He was lauded in his time, an on-and-off national hero, but could do little as his patents were raided by other inventors. His life is fascinating and worthy of study. Margaret Cheney took the initiative to pull together all the separate, obscure treatises on his life and weave them together into one complete narrative, but her delivery is dry and her narrative devices stumble. She, for instance, tries to create suspense and expectation by presenting portions of Tesla's life out of sequence, by referencing back to journal entries or setting up cause and effect relationships between present and past events. These devices don't work and leave the reader confused as to why, suddenly, a decade or more has passed in Tesla's life. She also laces the narrative with Tesla's science--the properties of electricity--with no explanation at all. Why were alternating current motors so important? Just what the heck WAS a Tesla coil? What does electricity jumping an air gap do? If you do not already know the answers to these questions, this book will not answer them for you. But even though the narrative is clumsy and dry, \\"Tesla: Man Out of Time\\" still stands as a good, single-volume study of Tesla's life."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME by Margaret Cheney is a 396 page biography. The book has 16 pages of glossy black & white photos, e.g., showing Tesla's radio controlled boat, or Tesla's steam turbine.SEMI-FICTIONAL WRITING. Towards the beginning of the book (but not later on), there is some semi-fictional writing, apparently to stimulate interest in the book. For example, we read, \\"Mark Twain's eyes sparkled in anticipation. Let's have a show, Tesla. You know what I always say. No, what do you say, Mark, the inventor asked with a smile. Suddenly, the whole laboratory was flooded with strange, beautiful light . . . but the light show was merely a warmup for the inventor's guests. Twain, in his usual white suit . . . was delighted. He whooped and waved his arms.\\" (pages 21-24) To repeat, this sort of semi-fiction only occurs near the beginning of the book.INVENTIONS. The book describes a number of inventions, some of them having a permanent impact on the global economy, e.g., AC current. Some of the inventions such as AC equipment, are provided with patent numbers, enabling the reader to acquire a high-quality account of the invention. These patent numbers include 334,823; 335,786; 335,787, and so on (see page 62). Any reader can obtain copies of these patents for free on line from the European Patent Office at espacenet, or from the United States Patent & Trademark Office (uspto.gov). Other inventions are only described in a haphazard way, e.g., a motor that runs only one wire (page 80), reduced pressure gasses that are highly conductive and that glow (precursor to fluorescent lamps) (page 79), a carbon-button lamp that was a precursor to the electron microscope or cyclotron (pages 81-84), and no patent numbers are given. Another invention, is merely the conduction of high voltages through the skin of a living human being. What is inventive is that the voltage is so high, that it does not pass through internal organs (pages 23-24, 101). Other inventions described in this book are merely phony inventions, such as a ring 100 feet off the ground, and encircling the earth, allowing travelers to hop aboard and travel at 1000 miles per hour (p. 39), or use of electricity to cure arthritis (p. 102).EARLY LIFE. We learn of Tesla's childhood in Smiljan, Croatia, where he wrote poems and fixed a collapsed fire hose, and that Tesla's older brother was killed by a horse. We learn of Tesla's phobias, e.g., to earrings, the need to count steps while walking, the need to calculate the volume of soup bowls, and aversion to touching other people's hair (page 29-30).CAREER BEGINNINGS. In 1881, Tesla got a job in a telegraph office in Hungary, and he put some effort into improving the Gramme direct current generator. A turning point came when he \\"hit upon the principle of the rotating magnetic field produced by 2 alternating currents out of step with each other, thus eliminating the need for a commutator or brushes (p. 40-44). We learn that Garland and Gibb had earlier invented AC current, but it was not practical until Tesla made these improvements. We learn of Tesla's first collaborator, Charles Batchelor, who installed Edison's first commercial lights on the S.S.Columbia (p. 47-48). Later, Tesla moved to the USA, and was hired by Edison to repair lights on the S.S.Oregon.TESLA THE ENTREPENEUR. We learn that J.P.Morgan was the wealthy backer of Edison Electric, which strung DC wires throughout Manhattan. Tesla left Edison to form his own company in Rahway, New Jersey, and later at 33 South Fifth Street in Manhattan. Tesla's backers included none other than George Westinghouse. Tesla invented the 60 cycle AC motor, which is still the universal standard throughout the world. We learned of a massive controversy between Edison (advocate of DC current) and Tesla (advocate of AC current), and that Edison staged public executions of dogs with AC current, in order to blot out Tesla (pages 67-69).At any rate, we now watch Edison's motion pictures run on Tesla's AC current, today's advocates of vinyl recordings listen to Edison's records run on Tesla's AC current, and we run Edison's incandescent lights on Tesla's AC current. Regarding radio, we learn that in 1893, Tesla made the first public demonstration of radio, though Marconi is usually given credit for doing this in 1895 (page 96). We learn that next to Tesla, Oliver Lodge was the 2nd most important radio pioneer, and we learn that Tesla's radio patents prevailed in the U.S. Supreme Court. We also learn how George Westinghouse wrangled Tesla's patent royalties from him, though more details would have been welcome on this point (page 74).CRITIQUE. Sometimes, I wish that the book had been written by an engineer. Few of the inventions are described with any degree of specificity, or in a way that distinguishes them from the inventions of others. It would have been useful if the book had provided a list of all of Tesla's patents, not just some of them. The author neglects to give a citation for the Sept. 1900 case heard by Judge Townsend of the U.S. Circuit Court of Connecticut. The author seems to have relied heavily on another book, PRODIGAL GENIUS by J.J. O'Neill (1944), instead of doing fact-finding from primary sources, e.g., newspapers. At any rate, the book is an engaging page-turner. Any reader interested in a skilled description of Tesla's inventions may download Tesla's patents for free. The U.S. patents available from espacenet have better quality images than the U.S. patents available from uspto. The opinions from the various lawsuits can be found in any law library, on LEXIS NEXIS. Law librarians will be more than glad to help the interested reader look up these things!!! If you want to learn other things about Mr.Tesla, I recommend EMPIRES OF LIGHT by Jill Jonnes. EMPIRES OF LIGHT has a more consistent theme (AC generators; AC motors) than Ms.Cheney's book, and seems to dig deeper into details on this particular theme, for example, the partnership between Mr.Tesla and Mr.Westinghouse.As of May 21, 2010, TESLA MOTORS agreed to open up an automobile production plant in Fremont, California. Hopefully, the re-establishment of Mr.Tesla's name in the public's eye will stimulate more interested readers to buy Margaret Cheney's fine book, and also Jill Jonnes' fine book."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"I have read the German version of Margaret Cheney's book &quot; Tesla - Man out of time&quot;. Surprisingly, besides my personal impression that the quality of translation is rather poor, I found more data on the time and people who met Tesla than on Tesla himself. There are no precise scientific descriptions of his inventions throughout the text and several chapters predominantly focus on the industrial development during that time often without being directly relevant to Tesla and his work. The author jumps back and forth in time such that it is difficult to find a clear organization of the text. In the middle of the book there are some nice black and white pictures showing Tesla, some of his friends, some of his inventions and even some title pages of magazines that published articles on him and his work. Summarizing this, I would say that this book supplies sufficient information to give the reader a good impression of the time during that Tesla lived and to the problems he had to face during his life. Some extraordinary curiosities concerning his character are also presented (for me the main reason to give the two stars rating). However, this book is not recommended to readers who like to get detailed technical information on his inventions or to those who expect a book emphasizing Teslas SCIENTIFIC work."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"There's no disputing that Nikola Tesla was a genius of the first order, who lived a very fascinating life. Writing biographies of everyday people is quite easy; writing biographies of prodigies can be quite a challenge.Every biography of a prodigy suffers under this fact, but this biography of Tesla suffers so much more than most. The reason I am not that enthusiastic about this book, is that it is written in the style generally used in biographies of political leaders and athletes; they glide from victory to victory, and, of course, suffer the occasional defeat. However at the end of the day the \\"big pictures\\" of their lives are generally largely interchangeable. Not so the life of Nikola Tesla; his contributions were sui generis, and deserve a more thoughtful and exhausting examination. Some would argue that Babe Ruth was the best baseball player of all time, but nobody claims that after Babe Ruth, baseball players could swat baseballs five times as far. Nobody, on the other hand, disputes that Tesla completely rewrote the books in the fields he touched. I believe that describing these different lives requires different approaches. The names and dates in this book are right, but you don't get an understanding of the importance and ramifications of his work, which to my mind is far more valuable than mere names and dates.I wouldn't recommend this book except to high school students and those who seek a superficial introductory biography of Tesla."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"\\"Tesla: Man Out of Time\\" succeeds only in making the life of an extraordinary man a lifeless and frustratingly shallow story.Prior to reading this book, I was only aware of Tesla as a mysterious genius and some kind of cult figure. And I had read a brief but intriguing description of Tesla's paranormal experiences. I read this biography anxious to dive into the life and times of this fascinating man. Unfortunately, I would STILL like to be fascinated by the story of Tesla, because this book skims over the most interesting aspects of this ingenious and troubled inventor and engineer.The book brings attention to countless captivating things about Tesla, confirming that he deserves a quality biographical study, but fails to deliver much more than a sketch of the events in his life. It seems like most of the pages are wasted on describing Tesla's lab equipment. I say \\"wasted\\" because even after countless tiresome descriptions of Tesla's experiments, I still have no idea about how his inventions were supposed to work or the basic theories behind them. I still don't know which of his ideas, if any, were revolutionary, or if any of his unattained goals have been achieved by any inventor-scientist after Tesla. The author should have (even briefly) explained some basic electrical concepts in order to make the writing about his experiments meaningful, or better, she should have minimized the descriptions of his devices and concentrated on the man - his odd talents, his relationships, his obsessive-compulsive behavior, why he failed in his business enterprises, and why he seemingly became an outrageous liar and huckster.I now know who Nikola Tesla was and what he did. Two stars for that much."},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"The whole story of the emergence of our electric age cannot be told without the story of Tesla.

Born in Serbia in 1856, largely self-educated; fluent in eight languages; a confidante of Mark Twain and bitter rival of Thomas Edison; obsessive-compulsive, feeder of pigeons in the park when he himself was hungry; owner of 700 patents... the list goes on and on.Biographies of Tesla tend to fall into one of two categories: one is the H.G. Wells scenario: \\" it was a dark and dreary night as blue sparks flew from the mad scientist's laboratory while a dwarfish assistant cranked up the generator. \\"; and the other concentrating on his scientific accomplishments and business problems.Margaret Cheney's \\"Tesla: Man out of Time\\" does a pretty serviceable job of addressing both sides of his life. Tesla kept meticulous diaries and notes, many of which disappeared after his death at age 86 during World War II.What happened to those notes is an open question: did the FBI or OSS get to them before the Nazi's could, thereby preserving the so- called \\"Death Ray\\" from the Germans? Or were they destroyed by loyal assistants and secretaries? Or are they preserved in the Tesla Museum in Belgrade?(Ironically, Ronald Reagan tried to implement the Strategic Defense Initiative, or \\"Star Wars,\\" in the 1980's. It didn't work then and it wouldn't work now.Which isn't surprising since Reagan didn't know the difference between Tesla and Teflon.His epic battle with Marconi over the rights to radio ended with a Supreme Court decision awarding the invention of radio to Tesla, but by then Marconi had already won the Nobel Prize and gotten the fame and fortune. Edison was fixated on direct current and frustrated that it could not travel over distances efficiently. Tesla developed alternating current and in a flash of true genius, the induction motor. George Westinghouse was another key figure: he saw dollar signs in Tesla's inventions and offered money, but always with strings attached. Tesla was as bad with money as he was good with science.Although he could be testy and short with people, Tesla also could be an engaging and generous friend. With his Slavic good looks, he adorned the cover of Time magazine and popular publications. He could have been a matinee idol, like another eccentric genius, Howard Hughes. Like Hughes Tesla lived alone in a suite of hotel rooms in New York (their numbers always divisible by three); had a pathological fear of germs and human contact; and had highly developed auditory and visual senses. His contribution to modern science and technology, long underrated, are finally beginning to get the credit he deserved during his lifetime. The scientific notation for magnetic field induction is named the Tesla in his honor.Further Reading:Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla by John O'NeillProdigal Genius: The Life of Nikola TeslaWizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla : Biography of a Genius (Citadel Press Book)The Nikola Tesla TreasuryThe Prestige"},{"Title":"TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME","review":"This is a great book.

It describes the character of a man of brilliance equivalent to Newton, Faraday or Einstein, who through his research forever changed how we think and live.Due to his modesty, secludedness and research without economic interests, he didn't get nearly as much publicity as Thomas Edison, his American counterpart. Later during his life his extremely revolutionary ideas labeled him as a lunatic, which further compromised investments in his research. Once a millionaire due to a royalties from Westinghouse, his careless spending in expensive research and his generosity toward Westinghouse in a time of economic hardship eventually made him penniless, a condition in which he died.Tesla has hundreds of patents in his name, including the radio's, which _to this day_ is still incorrectly attributed to Marconi. Many of his patents were classified by the military and are still secret. Yet Tesla rarely has any mention in physics textbooks.Get the book and know that truly Tesla was a Man Out of Time.

Garth-LewisAbstract by: freedom / 600 / 29 July 2005 / Rating: 4Abstract type:AbstractThis explosive new book challenges many of the long-prevailing assumptions about how to successfully reintegrate inmates back into our communities. Dr. Lewis is a professor, international speaker and strong supporter of the rights of women, inmates and minorities. She speaks with fervor and passion about beginning an honest discussion about the fate of ex-offenders once they return to society. The writing is scholarly, packed with powerfully reasoned and packed with an array of documented facts and research about \\"what works\\" in corrections. How PIE Turns Predators Into Producers, is not only a discussion that needs to take place on the subject of inmate employability and education, but is timely. Dr. Lewis began assertion of views about how inmate reform more than a decade ago, when dangerous policies, actions and trends led to high costs of management and operations of prisons. In a series of lectures and conversations with students and criminal justice practitioners, Dr. Lewis brings some eye-opening insights into the historical development of penal institutions and the prison culture that is today wrongly identified as a place for \\"black and brown\\" males. The disproportionate minority confinement issue is not foreign to Dr. Lewis, who served as the DMC Coordinator for s Governor's Office of Criminal Justice Planning and advocate for effective data collection to track the incarceration of minorities in California juvenile and adult corrections. The real history of the use of work and the jolting re-examination of work and related mores in inmate habilitation really challenges the old traditional notions and practices that dominate corrections today. In general, around the world work and labor is essential to a strong market economy; and in particular, it's utility in inmate reentry ought to be re-examined. This work is inspiring as it is upsetting and adds to the decades of debates and writings about how to return producers rather than predators back to our communities.

If anything, this manual is even more lacking as it doesn't even include the 50 scenarios comprising the Crusader Trail, and offers no information on the new AI opponents you'll be going up against in the scenarios. Like the first guide, this is really nothing more than an expanded instruction booklet and not really necessary to getting the most out of Stronghold Crusader. Much of the introductory material is just a rehash of what was contained in the original, and coverage of the new features and campaigns introduced in Crusader is far less than what I would have hoped for when buying this guide. While Crusader as a game is a worthwhile sequel (and the Warchest version even more so), this accompanying Strategy Guide falls even farther short than the original guide."},{"Title":"Stronghold Crusader Official Strategy Guide","review":"Recieved guide as promised in coundition as promised, I have been a long time Amazon.com , I have always been happywith thier service, I trust merchants who deal with Amazon."},{"Title":"Stronghold Crusader Official Strategy Guide","review":"Top Notch guide, April 4, 2007I'm not a very \\"hard core\\" gamer, in that I don't enjoy spending hours and hours and hours trying to figure out on my own some of the more esoteric wrinkles in the plot or game play of my PC games.

Jon Tuska adds more research and investigation in this new book. For Billy the Kid enthusiasts who really want to know more about the legend, the book is probably the most important one I've read. Tuska explores the man's life and death, historical views and fiction based on his life. One of my favorite parts is his description of how he escaped detection by the law once when he went to a friend's house and woke them from their bed. He got in bed with them, and they covered him up with covers, then got back in bed as if they were alone. When the law questioned them, it appeared they were alone! Talk about a threesome!But the best aspect of the book for historians and perhaps for Tuska's future books on Billy the Kid is his determination that to get the true story of what happened during the Lincoln County War, researchers need to focus more on the actions of Alexander A. McSween and Susan Hammer McSween and answering questions like, what happened to the Fritz inheritance money? What happened to John H. Turnstall's numerous high investments? Tuska's work suggests Susan McSween's financial success might have come from extortion from the Fritz and Turnstall estate.Tuska's theories ring true, and make the reader want more. From his suggestions, the reader almost anticipates another book from Tuska exploring these issues. Readers should follow Tuska's career and future writings about Billy the Kidd."},{"Title":"Billy the Kid, his life and legend","review":"Billy the Kid was neither the most romantic of western desperadoes nor a vicious killer. He was, for his time, a reasonably well-educated young cowboy who went to work for legitimate rancher/businessmen who were in conflict with agents and friends of a local and state government that were so incredibly corrupt that even Governor Lew Wallace couldn't save him. He wound up being 'outlawized' by an equally corrupt and sensationalistic press. Ironically, he was the only participant in the Lincoln County War who was sentenced (railroaded) to hang. Ever since the Kid was ambushed by Pat Garrett in 1881, historians, storytellers, and filmmakers have depended primarily on Pat Garrett's self-serving 'Authentic Life of Billy the Kid'. Jon Tuska, basing his work on documentary evidence, separates what is known of the facts from the fiction about Billy to produce the most accurate account of Billy and the Lincoln County War. He then turns to the standard legendary elements and shows wherein they differ from known facts. Tuska goes on to critique the standard histories, novels, and films that feature Billy. I consider this book to be the standard against which all other Billy the Kid materials are to be measured."},{"Title":"Billy the Kid, his life and legend","review":"I found the book very informative and added a bit more knowledge about him to what I have read over the years.I would reccommend to anyone interested in William Bonney."},{"Title":"Billy the Kid, his life and legend","review":"Tuska did a damn fine job researching and writing about the Kid and his 'legend'.

How do we make sense out of such phenomena? Bonnie Glass-Coffin's very readable and enjoyable book introduces the reader to the pre-contact world of the Peruvian Indians, and links that reality to the post-contact trauma of the people today. Based on more than five years of field work, the &quot;Gift of Life&quot; is a true gift to anyone who is fascinated by different cultural ways of knowing, and the forms of cultural resistance and adaptation that enable a society to endure. This volume is a very important addition to the anthropology of religion and to the field of women's studies. The balance of research, first person accounts, and interviews provide a wonderful forum for understanding the function spirituality has in the lives of the oppressed and marginalized. Dr. Glass-Coffin understands the nuances of ritual, adding a richness to the manner in which she describes, evaluates, and analyzes the historical and social structures of contemporary Peruvian curanderas and their practices. The researcher, the scholar, the student, as well as the casual reader will find this attention to the lived reality of the people very valuable. The first part of the book introduces the reader to a variety of aspects relating to shamanism. These include issues of sorcery, dualism, world view, and healing traditions. This is followed by stories of five women healers, and descriptions of their social-cultural milieu and methods of healing. Glass-Coffin, in the best tradition of anthropological fieldwork, describes how she became an active participant observer to the rituals and lives of the curanderas. This leads the reader into a vibrant encounter with the cultural constructions and understandings of healing spirituality that is present in Northern Peru today. The final section of the &quot;The Gift of Life&quot; examines and discusses issues of patriarchy and gender, the use of symbols and religious experience, the feminine approach to God, and the role of transformation of self in shamanic healing. The use of Och's Five Part Model of Healing is particularly useful in summarizing the processes discussed in the book. Glass-Coffin's academic rigor makes this book an important tool for the classroom, as it opens up the complexity of social stratification, culture change, women's spheres of power, and issues of poverty. I use this book as a primary text in my own course on the Anthropology of Shamanism. It is a book that students enjoy and that avails itself to a variety of interpretations and discussions. While I also use Marjorie Balzer's book (&quot;Shamanic Worlds&quot;) and Stacey Schaffer and Peter Furst's &quot;People of the Peyote,&quot; I have found that &quot;The Gift of Life: Female Spirituality and Healing in Northern Peru,&quot; is a text that incorporates the major themes and issues of shamanism into a forum that is accessible and extremely readable. Footnotes are well placed and concise, the Spanish-Indian glossary is very helpful, and the reference section is useful for further studies."},{"Title":"The Gift of Life: Female Spirituality and Healing in Northern Peru","review":"This most engaging book offers a first hand anthropological/sociological look at healing rituals as performed by several women healers in Northern Peru. The book is made richer and more compelling by Glass-Coffin's accounts of her personal growth as a result of her experiences with these gifted healers. This book is a a rich accounting of those experiences. It is not often that one finds such a blend of academic scholarship and personal sharing of self."},{"Title":"The Gift of Life: Female Spirituality and Healing in Northern Peru","review":"Prior to THE GIFT OF LIFE, little had been written about the role women play in healing and shamanism in Northern Peru. Part of the reason for this oversight had to do with the way European colonization brought the concept of &quot;witchcraft&quot; to Peru, and the fact that Peruvian women who practiced traditional healing arts were frequently beaten and tortured until they confessed to standard European-style &quot;witchcraft&quot; practices. Author Bonnie Glass-Coffin was trained as an anthropologist, so she knew that women have historically played a large part in shamanism from looking at the ancient sculptures of the Moche and Chimu, which both portray women involved in healing arts. With the intention to find and interview modern-day women shamans in Peru, Glass-Coffin set out to do exactly that.Bonnie Glass-Coffin shares the stories from five female curanderas (shamans) she met with between April 1988 and September 1989. Her extraordinary book, THE GIFT OF LIFE, describes the daily life of these female curanderas and the story of how they became healers, and includes black and white photographs of their mesas (curing altars) and healing herbs (plants such as the San Pedro cactus). Glass-Coffin's background in anthropology and her accounts of her experiences living in Peru as she grew up give this book a unique feeling of personal relevance and social perspective.I was impressed that THE GIFT OF LIFE does not shy away from describing the ways curanderas have used their spiritual powers on some occasions for sorcery. Glass-Coffin describes &quot;dano&quot; as intended harm by sorcery, and tells stories and includes pictures of how Peruvians have discovered and dealt with the harmful magic of others. She also describes some of the differences between male and female healers in Peru -- such as the way female curanderas tend to involve patients more directly in their healing. I was also impressed that Glass-Coffin described her own personal involvement being healed by curanderas, giving this book tremendous warmth. The first-hand accounts of what it feels like to suffer as the recipient of a dano help the reader better understand the way our thoughts and feelings affect one another.I give this book my highest recommendation to anyone who is interested in ancient traditional ways of healing, wishes to know what is unique about women healers, and is intrigued by reading stories about how our thoughts and feelings affect others."},{"Title":"The Gift of Life: Female Spirituality and Healing in Northern Peru","review":"The Gift of Life reveals a wonderful combination of beautiful storytelling and academic, anthropological research.

There are no monsters, or horrors to overcome within the novella, only the growing knowledge of the man's relationship to the trees. After my last reading of the text I realized that the story is just as much about the wife as the man -- what she has to go through as the man passes over more and more to the influence of the forest.

Taking place in the present day, Springer spins a fable both sweet and sinister about a pure and virginal girl, Angel, who falls head-over-heals with the town freak, Damnbanna, so named because of the bandanas he constantly wears around his head. This orphaned, teenage boy bears horrible scars from head-to-toe, all of which he attributes to his &quot;devil&quot; of a father. After saving Angel from a viscious dog attack, Damnbanna appoints himself Angel's guardian when they both realize some sinister force has chosen Angel as its prey. Angel's heart immediately goes out to her new savior, and the love affair begins, although menace lurks around every corner. Springer crafts a clean and simple story, that despite its lack of depth, hits the mark with any romatic who can appreciate the dark side of love. She has done so be creating achetypal characters. Angel is a meek, perpetual &quot;good girl&quot; confined by over-protective parents. Damnbanna is a tough-as-nails orphan and a rebel who can be chained by no one. His gentleness, caring and love come shining through to her alone. Angel looks to him as a protector. Damnbanna has given her his heart. By adding a touch of the spiritual realm into this work, Springer breathes a dark and slightly twisted and fantastical life into the old story of a girl from the upper crust falling in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Springer writes this story with a frank and almost careless style that works to keep this melodrama from going over the top and becoming sappy. &quot;Damnbanna&quot; is probably too intense for the younger crowd, however it is a quick, fun, and easy read that will be especially appreciated by anyone who has fallen for someone he or she shouldn't have. It will also touch the hearts of all of those who enjoy stories about the unstoppable power of love."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Way back in 1922, Walter Lippmann analyzed the nature of public opinion with many valuable insights that still hold true today. Note that most of the historical references Lippmann uses to illustrate his theories are from World War I and surrounding events, and some aspects of the political environment of the time are totally irrelevant today. However, this book rises above the confines of its time. Lippmann dealt in an interdisciplinary method that is extremely rare, if not structurally impossible, in today's academic environment. His basic treatise is in the realm of political science but ably brings in supporting theories and knowledge from psychology, sociology, communications, history, and logic. Lippmann's then-current style of writing is also nearly impossible to find in today's social science writing, with a flowing prose loaded with references to classic literature and frequent use of imagined characters and scenarios. Part VI offers a surprisingly no-holds-barred examination of the American political system that is refreshingly free of today's unyielding us-and them ideologies. This feat of the intellect, just slightly outdated in its specific examples but not in its underlying insights, is a powerhouse treatise on how public opinion is constructed and influenced by social trends, politics, and media.

According to all I've read on Walter Lippmann, he was the most influential pundit of his era, so to read his assessment of the public's opinion & what it's worth & how it must be tamed, we (the readers) are being given access to the core elements that lead to what we know today as government & business propaganda.Lippmann was part of the Creel Committee, whose job it was to sell the idea that America should get involved in World War I to the American people...so the importance of peeking into the thought processes behind that campaign of pro-war propaganda is a priceless opportunity.If you wish to understand what those in power actually think of the public's importance in a democracy (or democratic republic), make sure you read this book...twice!"},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"In this book, the first pundit Walter Lippmann speaks about the journalism, democracy, and the American people - creating a picture that's not pretty but remains very true up until this day. Lippmann's style may be difficult for some, but those who endeavour to read will find it fascinating.Through the book, Lippmann talks about how there is no real public opinion, how most people have a very limited view of the government, and how the government synthesizes complex views into either-or issues (i.e. \\"pro-life\\" v.s. \\"pro-choice\\"). The journalists, who should help the American people understand the issue, end up doing little at all. Lippmann offers no real solutions in this book, but for anyone who wants a wake-up call for what's wrong with the government, they should spurn Michael Moore and Ann Coulter and turn to this book."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Lippmann is great, but the BN Publishing edition of this book is beyond terrible. Misplaced (or simply missing) punctuation, misspelled words, no italics or boldface where they are needed, random line breaks in the middle of sentences, no indented paragraphs, no margins on the pages, haphazard footnotes ... you get the idea.The content is worth four or five stars for all the reasons that other reviewers have mentioned, but this printing is simply unreadable."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"I have been looking for a decent printing of this incredible book for a long time, but I was foiled again. It seems that this hard-cover Kessinger Publishing version was produced without any quality control whatsoever. Some of the flaws in the printing cause entire pages to be unreadable. The printing of this edition is so deeply flawed it's at the point of being infuriating.Here are only some of the problems I found -- Some pages are \\"wavy\\" and blurred to the point of being absolutely unreadable. What is said on these pages, I will never know. This flaw resembles what would happen if one were to copy a document on a photocopier while pulling the document out at the same time.- Random pages are printed with a very dark grey background - making the text quite difficult to see.- Literally every other page of the book has a strange printing flaw where, at the top of these pages, there is a strange image - something that resembles an accidental, nonsensical banner ad. It's quite large. It seems as if in this image, the mechanics of the scanning equipment are visible. Interesting in it's own weird way I suppose, but very unprofessional and distracting.Somebody didn't care."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"The measure of a great book is how well it stands the test of time. &quot;Public Opinion&quot; meets and exceeds that standard. It should be read by everyone who cares about the idea of American democracy. Walter Lippmann's insights will still be valuable in 2022. Highly recommnded."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Lippman is sadly under-appreciated these days, I hadn't even heard his name until the past year, when, while working on my dissertation, I came across this book. Written in lucid, clear prose, yet dealing with incredibly complex theoretical and philosophical issues, Public Opinion argues that not only is there not really an agreed-upon \\"Public Opinion,\\" but that people rarely even understand what they think they know, let alone what they can agree upon with other people. Lippman persuasively demonstrates that opinions are formed in such a way that they have little or no bearing upon \\"really existing\\" facts and truth most of the time, and instead are ill-informed, vague, and haphazard in their application of rational thought. Lippman closes by arguing that, since no one has the time or ability to be as informed as they are expected to be on every issue, what is needed is a group of intellectuals dedicated towards improving the quality of media we receive; a sort of \\"filter\\" which can correct misperceptions and inform the public at large. (Although, in his subsequent Lippman becomes even more pessimistic, arguing that there is no such thing as \\"the public\\".) This book is a must-read for those fascinated by media, politics, or even more general philosophical/culture questions."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"This is Lippmann's classic critique on media and public opinion written in the 1920s. His prose is easy to read and filled with a slew of anecdotes and casual asides. The book focuses on newspapers because they were the dominant news medium in his day, but many of his criticisms are still applicable to television and the internet today. Ironically, Lippmann was a strong opponent of socialism but his concern about the \\"manufacture of consent\\" inspired Noam Chomsky's scathing critique of the free-market media industry inManufacturing Consent.One thing to keep in mind when ordering: this book has been reprinted numerous times by a variety of publishers with results of varying quality. Some of the publishers cut out Lippmann's footnotes or tack them onto the end of sentences rather than formatting them properly. I chose the version published byFree Press in 1997because the formatting and typefaces they used are clean and remain true to the way the book was originally published. Check the \\"Look Inside\\" option to make sure you get a good-looking edition."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"In spite of its fairly advanced age (over 75), this remains a highly readable book. Its pages on stereotypes are more valid than ever. And the author could write an excellent English. Knowledgeable, informative and urbane. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Lippman was the first one to state what public opinion was, and why it mattered. He did this in the years between World Wars 1 and 2. This book became important because it offered individuals a view into the power that one could gain by manipulating public opinion. It would only be until after the end of WW2 that we would see how correct Lippman was. HIs view has been added to, and modified over the years, so that today this work seems out of touch and simplistic. However, we must not loose sight of who gave shape to the field and why it matters to understand the topic. We should not loose sight of that contribution."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Love this book. Puts the pecking order into perspective. Another book everyone should read to get a better idea on how we are all manuipulated for the benefit of others..."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"I bought this book after reading Chomsky's, \\"Manufacturing Consent.\\" I recommend to everyone that they check up on the sources that are cited by others. I was actually a huge fan of Chomsky until I read Public Opinion, because I couldn't believe how much he misrepresented, not only details in the book, but Lippmann's main thesis, which is nothing more than a detailed exploration of how people come to know what they think they know.From the Intro:\\"Our first concern with fictions and symbols is to forget their value to the existing social order and to think of them simply as an important part of the machinery of human communication. Now in any society that is not completely self contained in its interests and, so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens, ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp. Miss Sherwin of Gopher Prairie is aware that a war is raging in France [WWI] and tries to conceive it. She has never been to France and certainly she has never been along what is now the battlefront.Pictures of French and German soldiers she has seen, but it is impossible for her to imagine three million men. No one, in fact, can imagine them, and the professionals do not try. They think of them as, say, two hundred divisions. But Miss Sherwin has no access to the order of battle maps, and so if she is to think about the war, she fastens upon Joffre and the Kaiser as if they were engaged in a personal duel. Perhaps if you could see what she sees with her mind's eye, the image in its composition might be not unlike an Eighteenth Century engraving of a great soldier. He stands there boldly unruffled and more than life size, with a shadowy army of tiny little figures winding off into the landscape behind. Nor it seems are great men oblivious to these expectations. M. de Pierrefeu tells of a photographer's visit to Joffre. The General was in his \\"\`middle class office, before the worktable without papers, where he sat down to write his signature. Suddenly it was noticed that there were no maps on the walls. But since according to popular ideas it is not possible to think of a general without maps, a few were placed in position for the picture, and removed soon afterwards.'\\"From this very basic and incontestable base, he then explores the implication of these facts upon democratic theory, socialist theory, economic theory (he tears apart the notion of a harmonious collection of selfish interests in free market capitalism), etc... He then talks in detail about exactly how the news is made, and even what constitutes news, and why. This doesn't come until the end of the book, and I'm convinced that Chomsky never got that far, because Lippmann tears holes in much of his Manufacturing Consent thesis in 1925, by simply noting the details of why some facts become news and some things simply don't. He is able to highlight the effects of press publicists and special interest lobbyists on the system long before anyone else was talking about them in the 1990's. I think everyone else is just now catching up with Lippmann, and many have yet to come close."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Anyone who seriously considers a career in today's journalism needs to become familiar with how Walter Lippmann approached that once hallowed calling. It's not enough to be the first on the scene with a story, no matter how important that story may be. What's important is to have an informed opinion on what caused the event to happen and to be able to speculate, with some authoritative references, on how it will affect the future course of events. What made Walter Lippmann's thoughts, opinion and observations on current affairs so important to the movers and shakers of his day was his fundamental knowledge of history and how that knowledge related to the often bewildering array of modernist \\"spin\\" -- from the manipulation of popular opinion through propaganda, to the more often overlooked affect of human psychology on the course of politics and current events."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Cheaply produced and bound -- and the typesetting is shockingly poor. There are no indents after paragraph breaks, italics that were in the original are missing in this shoddy edition. I have to purchase yet another copy because this fly-by-night publisher can't be bothered to typeset an out-of-copyright text properly."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"There is plenty here I don't agree with, but many valuable lessons as well. Lippmann's interest in Public Opinion focuses on how democracy- as it is currently practiced- depends on an informed, engaged public to form policies based on an interest in the \\"common good\\". There are a lot of vulnerabilities; it is a fragile system at best, and Lippmann doesn't believe the system can work in a large, complex society, so a good 3/4 of the book is awfully down on democracy. The thesis is that people distill complex issues down into stereotypes and short, reductive soundbites. The author is incredulous that a disinterested, profit-driven press can deliver the relevent information for decision-making to a disinterested public. To give him his due, it is true that one of the great challenges of democracy is to get the electorate to understand the decisions before them, the potential consequences of their various options, and the struggle to even know where the public interest truly lies. It may not have been his intention, but Lippmann illustrates vividly how important a quality education system is to a functioning democracy. Therefore, an excellent book to read along with this is The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.After contructing his worldview, Lippmann hits us with his solution: replace the free press with an elaborate cadre of indifferent, professional information collectors, whose only desire is to present our elected representatives with pure, complete, and unbiased information. Yeah, right. Nothing Lippmann says suggests this new system would be less vulnerable than our current system to corruption, inefficiency, bias, or incompetence.I can't say for sure where the author is coming from- whether this is really his idea for a renewed democracy, or its deconstruction and replacement with something else. It seems that autocrats and others could use this as a playbook for exploiting weaknesses in our current system. On the other hand, the book reveals many important and legitimate criticisms of America in 2009. We DO need a better-informed, more skeptical, more demanding electorate. We DO need a less-centralized, freer, more agressive and independent press to function as a vital Fourth Estate. We DO need to recognize the complexity of many of the most important issues facing the voting public, and need to reject the superficial, thoughtless, manipulative soundbite format that most information is presented to us in. Overcoming those obstacles is a herculean task, but not impossible. I cannot accept the tenet that complexity precludes democracy, but Lippmann apparently has, and that is what I find so disheartening about this book."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"this book represents part of the blueprint used to deceive and manipulate the American public to this day. A must read!!"},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"Not his best work but a somewhat interesting read. It's short so it's not like you've wasted days on it and some of the content is worth contemplating."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"In the last few pages, the author starts writing about hope and remedy for the current problem.Until then, this book requires a lot of patience. The analysis of how people understand public affairs is appliacble to the present world (also applicable to Japan where I live)."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"No information of the publisher is available. Therefore it cannot be quoted or be of any academic use."},{"Title":"Public opinion","review":"I had the good fortune to meet Walter Lippman growing up, as my father was his children's orthodontist (overbites all). Through this, Lippman and my biological mother, the receptionist, began an affair that lasted--on and off--for several tumultuous years. While Lippman the intellectual is to be respected, I cannot recommend his book without reservation. I mention this on accout of the extent to which his shenanigans with my biological mother resulted in a great deal of cruelty and psychological trauma to her fragile working-class psyche. If Lippman were around today, I would ask him about this. As I cannot, I am simply leaving this review here so others may read the \\"full story.\\" You cannot judge a book by its cover, but you can judge an author by his actions in the world."},{"Title":"NCLEX-PN Exam Practice Questions Exam Cram","review":"I thought this was an excellent resource.

I found it on a bedside table while staying at a friend's house. \\"Death of an Old Goat\\" was so funny that I have now read it several times and end up buying a copy.It is the story of a murder at a backwater university-- university is too good a name for it-- in provincial Australia. Maybe I like it so much partly because my father taught English at a place much like the one in the story, and the author has a keen eye for the petty faculty politics, backstabbing, social climbing, and oneupmanship in such places!But the book's appeal goes beyond that. Years later, I can still see the characters and story vividly. The characters are hilariously observed and believable and the dialogue snappy and sharp. The brassy young Australian woman professor, the doddering eminent visiting lecturer, the hapless young Oxford graduate lost on the Australian scene, the rough and hearty Aussie landowners, and other memorable characters, plus the fast-paced clever story and the strong sense of dusty-outback place, made me love this book."},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"I am biased in that I'm a sucker for detectives stories in an academic setting and for witty detective stories. In \\"Death of an Old Goat\\" Robert Barnard gives me both these elements as well as a satisfying plot. There's a wonderful cast of ignoble characters including nasty back-biting academics, ignorant prejudiced graziers (sheep barons), and Inspector Royle who at one point declares he doesn't have to catch THE murderer, just A murderer. Imagine RCMP Sgt Dudley Dooright with his moral compass reversed 180 degrees and his IQ halved -- that's Inspector Royle."},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"I confess to not being a reader of crime fiction, but I agree with others that the mystery takes second place to the satirical portrayals of the characters and what they reveal about Australian life. The mystery itself is puzzling but hardly suspenseful, and the solution to the crime is anti-climatic -- until the splendid kicker of the final paragraph. Mordant and hilarious."},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"This book is an extremely funny satire. It also gives a very close up and personal look at University life \\"down under\\". And the fun doesn't stop right up until the very last words. Barnard pokes fun at all kinds of golden age mystery writers, and his Royle creation is absolutely wonderful. I wonder were the cops in the Australia outback as bad as this in 1974? Read this book for a good laugh, and the mystery isn't bad either."},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"Robert Barnard is one of my favorite authors (and I'm very glad that he's so prolific). Amazingly, he never does anything like the same thing in every book (as does, say, Robert B. Parker). But, probably because he never does the same thing twice, he VERY occasionally comes up with a clunker. Death of an Old Goat is the clunkiest he's ever produced (and I've read 34 -- still 15 to go).The book is set in Australia, and it's very clear that Barnard doesn't care for Australia (and you won't enjoy spending time there). And the book is full of people he obviously despises (and so will you). Even worse, the protagonist crime-solver is a bigoted, thuggish drunk of a policeman whose usual way of solving crimes is to use his fists on the handiest nearby aborigine.Had the book had any other author's name on it, I would not have finished it. But because it was his, I stayed on till the end, and the ending seems to have been chosen deliberately as appropriate for a book this bad -- it's one of the most unsatisfactory ending I've ever read.I'm frankly baffled by some of the reader reviews of the book. If what I've described here sounds to you like a book that is \\"Hilarious\\" and \\"Terrific fun,\\" your sense of humor must be very different from my own (in which case you may enjoy Death of an Old Goat).I'd still maintain that this is not the place to begin your acquaintance with Robert Barnard."},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"This authori is one of the top three of my picks of British authors. The man knows how to draw a character and even if you HATE the character, you are drawn into trying to solve the puzzle. Excellent author!"},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"I chose this rating because the book is interesting as I live in the small city where it was set. It presents various aspects of the community in a very personal way which many would find either amusing or offensive. A good, little who-dun-it."},{"Title":"Death of an Old Goat","review":"The murder-mystery plot seems to be secondary to the emerging details about the various characters. In fact, the primary character is probably the rural Australian psyche itself, and the individuals are all variations on that theme. To what extent is the book a satire of Australian life? I don't know; I've never been there. Is the book funny? Yes, wickedly so!"},{"Title":"America Entertains: A Year of Imaginative Parties","review":"America Entertains was my holiday survival guide!

Dr. Geisler approaches the Old Testament from a uniquely Christ-centered point of view. The whole ouline of his survey is based on Christ the substance of the OT shadows. He divides the OT in mainly 4 parts, the books of the Law: The foundation for Christ. The books of History: The preparation for Christ. The Books of Poetry: THe aspiration for Christ and the books of Prophecy the expectation of Christ. He follows the same excellent system of studying each book starting with the author (here he uses his excellent apologetics skills), then when they were written, to whom and also the historical, doctrinal and Christological purpose of the book. Thereafter he divides the book into main parts and begin his systematic survey of it. I highly recommend this book to any Bible student and also to the average Christian seeking to obtain a good understanding of the OT and it's message for us today."},{"Title":"A Popular Survey of the Old Testament","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book during my seminary days and plan to use the book for a class I will teach as an adjunct instructor at a local community college.The book is succinct, contains valuable information, and is very reasonably priced (certainly compared to educational publishing authors who sometimes have a decidedly more secular worldview).The book's basic format is as follows for each Old Testament book:1. Introductory information.2. Who wrote the book.3. When, why, to whom was the book written.4. Doctrinal and Christological purpose of the book.5. What the book is about.6. Basic content of the book with a focus on particular chapters.7.

This is a good introduction for a new Christian or beginning bible student and does not become too technical or theological. Dr. Geisler, known for his apologetics teachings, uses them to help explain some of the more common objections in scripture. The study questions at the end of each chapter are helpful. However, if you are a more advanced student, you might find this book a little too simplistic.My only complaint is minor. He dismisses the apocrypha as inspired text, rightly so, in the first few chapters. But then on at least two occasions uses information in the apocrypha books as arguments for authorship of the truly inspired OT books. I thought this was a stretch and weakened his authorship arguments a bit since he already presented more credible evidence. This is a case of \\"less is more\\" and the apocrypha references should be left out."},{"Title":"A Popular Survey of the Old Testament","review":"Very informative - It is very easy to read and has a lot of useful references.

The only area of the book I find 'dated' is the 'Fast Food and Drinks' area at the back of the book, and even that info is probably OK except for it lacks the most recent offerings from the big burger joints.Included in the 'Fast Food' area are the following: McDonald's (it has the salads, burgers, fries, apple pie, shakes...), Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell, \\"Pizza\\", Wendy's, Subway, \\"French Fries\\" (from all the different biggies with size breakdown), \\"Fast Food Breakfast Options\\", \\"Fast Food Fish\\", \\"Sandwiches and Subs\\", \\"Chips Pretzels and Savory Snacks\\", \\"Crackers\\", \\"Dips\\", \\"Ice Cream, Sorbet and Sherbet\\", \\"Pudding, Mousse and Custard\\", \\"Chocolate\\", \\"Candies\\", \\"Cookies and Bars\\", \\"Cakes and Pastries\\", \\"Sugar, Honey, Jams and Spreads\\", \\"Sauces and Condiments\\" (very helpful...), \\"Beer and Wine\\", \\"Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate and Whipped Drinkds\\", \\"Soda, Water and Sports Drinks\\" and finally... \\"Juice and Juice Drinks.\\"Also in the book are the following sections:-Meat and Game-Fish, Shellfish and Poultry-Dairy Foods and Eggs-Fats and Oils-Nuts, Seeds and Legumes-Starchy Foods-Fruit and VegetablesIn each section (on each page really...) are the following: \\"What's in it?\\", a Tip, \\"What's the Best?\\" and \\"What's Not So Good?\\" Choosing items from the section these give you information and guidelines to make healthy choices.Also on each page addressing foods are lists with headings: 'Style (or size serving)', Calories, Cholesterol, Sodium, Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Protein, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Sugars and GI (Glycemic Index). All very easy to read and gives you a quick reference for meal planning or things to avoid.This book is one of the best I've found for referencing 'clean' or real foods. I highly recommend picking one up.NOTE: If you are looking for others that reference fast foods or prepackaged, you may want to look elsewhere.

From it I first learned about Mach's Principle, and how it followed right from the concept that motion is relative. The analysis of Newton's pail experiment is astonishing. It is just a combination of powerful ideas, with no equations. Nowadays, when I happen to teach General Relativity, I begin with this analysis by Reichenbach, also because it is one of its conclusions that Newton's gravity theory is inconsistent with motion being relative. At least you have to accept that a moving mass attracts differently than one at rest. This is already extra-Newtonian. Reichenbach, a member of the famous Vienna Circle was a very sharp-minded fellow, and a very clear one too.

Suppose a lamp hangs in the room. How can we determine its place? We measure its distance from the floor, from the back-wall and from the side-wall; these three figures determine its position in space. ... If we want to determine not a point in space but an event, we require another figure, namely, the statement of time. Suppose we switch on the light for a second and produce a flash of light; this is an event. It is completely determined if we know the three numbers defining the position of the lamp and, in addition, the fourth number defining the time of the light flash. Insofar as there are four figures, space and time together are called a four-dimensional manifoldness.

As the problems progress, you are required to probe into your understanding of the underlying principles. Simply recalling and applying formulas will not cut it in an exam, and this book makes certain that you cultivate your problem-solving abilities in a manner expected of a scientist.As other reviewers have noted, there are typos.

At least ones that don't make you feel like you are drinking from a fire hose, just blasting you with too much information at once. This does not have a bunch of fancy graphics or illustrations. It gives you just enough so you can picture the situation. It really helps you interpret the problem. Like in the first chapter on vectors, there is a problem asking at what point do two cars cross each other. It then goes on to say when a question asks you this, set the equations for the position for each car equal to each other and solve for x. After you know that is what you are supposed to do, the math is pretty straight forward.Depending on how much time you have, I recommend going through a good algebra based physics supplement to get an idea of how to attack the basic problems. Then move on to this and get exposed to more challenging problems, then do problems from your textbook or one of the supplements with harder problems in that. If you do that, while physics class will probably never be simple, you will be prepared and not get freaked out in an exam because you don't know how to start the problem or waste a lot of time trying to interpret what the problem is giving you and asking for. I am in the middle of the first semester of calculus based physics right now, and this more than any other supplement has the most similar type of problems to the examples my teacher goes over in class and sample problems he puts in our lab manual. Those are of course the questions he uses as a model for the exam questions.For the first test (which I got 29/30 on) I found the examples in here that closely matched the examples he used in class and made up my own exam (something the authors advise to do in preparing for your test). I definitely attribute that to figuring out how to set up the equations in the incline plane problems involving tension which you are definitely going to get in your calculus based physics class. If you go to class, go to lab, do your homework problems and use this supplement, you will do well in class."},{"Title":"How to Solve Physics Problems (College Course)","review":"The book is helpful even though the equations are set a little more complex than they have to be.

The case goes to Rudy just before he takes up his bar exam to become a licensed lawyer. Once he passes the bar, he and a friend named Deck, the so-called paralawyer, decide to challange the insurance company being represented by one of the most expensive and well known firms in Memphis. Rudy's graduation, the pre-trial events were kinda droning along. The only likeable part of this novel by Grisham was the trial itself. Even the trial was practically far-fetched because judge Kipler is fully biased towards the plaintiff. This is normally not what happens in court. Grisham kinds makes a mockery of the legal system. But it is a little fun to read. Recommended if you have nothing else to read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker: Legendary****\\"Donny Ray sits with his cane between his legs, resting his chin on it.\\" In John Grisham's book The Rainmaker, the lawyer deals with clients very often. The author's purpose in writing this novel is to create a drama that will capture the reader until the end.Basically, a son goes to college and law school and then starts the lawyer life after he passes the bar. He starts his own firm after working for other people. He has some clients, but one big one in which he has put his hopes in. He then goes to court with the case. The end of the story comes soon after.In the book the setting has much to do in the way of understanding and comprehending where the characters are. Many times in the novel Grisham changes the setting fairly quickly, but in some places he leaves it where it is for a while. An example of a short setting is Deck and Rudy discussing things over a meal. The court room is a good example of a longer setting because Grisham keeps the story there for about eleven pages.There are many small characters in the novel, but only one real major character. Rudy Baylor is the main character, who is young and learning but matures throughout the book Deck, Rudy's assistant (\\"paralawyer\\"), is underhanded and conniving, but in and innocent sort of manner. Judge Kipler is like the elder; he is wise and very helpful. He is Rudy's arch enemy; he is older, knows the ropes, and a wanna-be that makes himself into a fool. Rudy and Drummond's personalities collide because they are different, and they are opponents. There is also Kelly who is a passionate person who bands with Rudy, but the rest cannot be told for the sake of the ending.The plot of the story happens to be excellent, but it takes awhile to achieve the goal of interest and suspense. This story gets off to a slow start when Rudy is obtaining information about the case, and getting a job. The action picks up after that though and the escape from the government by Prince and Bruiser along with the Kelly incident at the hospital picks up the plot and run with it. Of course the court case becomes the best of the plot it starts to wind down, but the end gives it closure with a good plot sequence.The lawyer jargon such as the \\"briefs\\" and the happenings that go on like the jury selection, are not normal because the readers don't usually know these things, but Grisham does a good job of explaining everything. Other than that the conversation and such are normal communicating language. Grisham's style is mostly descriptive and partially very easy to read and blunt.This book captures the reader and they won't want to put it down. It is intriguing, entangled with deception, lies, and court battles. It is capturing. Read this book or loose a great experience. This novel truly deserves a five star rating."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker by John Grisham is Great fun to read, a captivating thriller that keeps you on your toes from beginning to end.

I loved the writing techniques that Grisham used, which included both writing in present rather than past, and writing in the first person.

It's even made me think harder about attending law school after I complete high school. Law school for me has always been in the back of my mind, but I haven't thought so seriously about it until I finished this book. This may be unbelievable to those of you who have already read the book, as it paints a bleak picture of the 'world of law'.I was prevented from rating this book a nine or ten as I was disappointed with the ending of the book. Not with the writing, but rather with the content. When I read the verdict I was overjoyed, but then, in the next thirty pages my joy quickly turned to dismay as Rudy's future in law was flushed away forever. I know that it is this surprise element at the end that makes the book interesting and fun to read, as it isn't too predictable, but in my opinion: All's well that ends well. Sorry, I just like my happy endings. This ending was happy for Rudy and Kely I suppose, but not for me. I got too invovled in the law side of the story that I didn't want Rudy to give up his career.

One thing I liked about the movie better than the book was that they made Drummond into more of a bad guy. Everytime Rudy had a major break-through, the other lawyers had an excuse.

Of course, the protagonist's fate is never in doubt, but he/she certainly takes a long time in getting there.&quot;The Rainmaker,&quot; however, is not a thriller by any means. Yes, it's an engaging -- sometimes even moving -- story about the search for justice against an amoral insurance company. But Grisham seemingly wrote the novel with an axe to grind, and this moral agenda prevents the novel from becoming a truly great, make-your-heart-skip-suspense-tale we've come to expect from the author of &quot;The Client&quot; and &quot;The Firm.&quot;Three criticisms:1. The plot is too black &amp; white&quot;The Rainmaker&quot; moves from one event to another in a near linear fashion -- there's no surprise revelation, no complicating obstacle that places the outcome of the case in doubt. The protagonist, Rudy Baylor, simply gets one lucky break after another and faces no setbacks at all in taking down the evil insurance company.2. Side-plots and characters are abandoned instead of being woven into the fabric of the story-lineEven the most promising side-stories (Rudy's shady boss, his landlady's will), are slowly abandoned out of convenience somewhere in the middle instead of being skillfully integrated into the main storyline (as Grisham has so wonderfully done in the past). Characters richly characterized in the beginning -- like Rudy's best friend Booker -- are virtually forgotten, only to be picked up again at the *very* end when Grisham realizes he's forgotten to mention them.3. Great development in the beginning; virtually nothing in the endFinally, the pacing is off: there's so much rich depth in the first 200 pages as the author develops Rudy and fosters reader loyalty (you really do root for him and cheer as he triumphs). There's all kinds of great background information, the pace is thoughtful and deliberate throughout...then Grisham crams together a conclusion in a rather thin 10-page spread near the end.All in all, an entertaining narrative about a fictional insurance company getting its just punishment -- but certainly not a Grisham &quot;thriller&quot; by any means, and thus, a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I find Grisham to be a hit and miss author, although lately he has been on such a losing streak that I've stopped reading his new novels altogether.

He meets an old lady who claims to have a fortune her family doesn't know about and she wants to cut them all out of her will and a woman whose son is dying of cancer when he could have been saved if their insurance provider hadn't refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant. When Rudy's post-graduation job disappears due to a merger of law firms, these two clients are all he has. The insurance case has the potential to result in a huge windfall for the fledgling lawyer, if he can win it.It's a standard David vs. Goliath tale, when Rudy, who is so green he has yet to write his bar exam, takes on the insurance company who denied medical services to his cancer patient client. Like most of Grisham's novels the lines between good and bad are too clearly defined for my taste. Yes, Rudy has some anger issues and he isn't perfect, but he's still a stereotypical, bright, idealistic, well intended young man taking on evil corporations and greedy Ivey League lawyers. Personally I'd like to see Grisham exercise more subtlety. Do his bad guys need to be so bad? Not only do they deny claims, but they do it arrogantly, systematically, and knowingly as matter of policy, and to make matters worse they sexually harass their employees, fire people without cause, and lie, cheat and steal at every turn. They are so blatantly evil it never requires the reader to contemplate an ethical dilemma because the right answer is always so clear.But I digress. This complaint can be made about almost all of Grisham's novels. What makes this one better than many of his other novels is that while predicable, it's entertaining. There are surprising touches of humor and as with many of Grisham's better novels, some insight into the world of legal wrangling. Yes, there are some pretty neat coincidences that work in Rudy's favor but even a cynic like me can find satisfaction in the little guy bringing down a giant, even if it is contrived.I thought the romance angle however was weak. Kelly was less a person and more a vehicle for Grisham to demonstrate Rudy's noble chivalry. But so what I guess. It allows our hero to ride off into the sunset with his best girl by his side, and who am I to question a formula that obviously works. I was entertained and that's more than I can say for a lot of novels that I read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The book's plot is utterly predictable. Rudy'll win his case. This you'll know since the first chapter so I ain't telling anything important because the good guys'll win and the bad guys'll loose. Rudy's biography is long and boring. I'm sure that JG can write overly better than this."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Good character development. But not up to Grisham's high standards, as in The Firm.

True, it is full of exaggerations, but it is a defense of all those who are oppressed and/or deceived. It is also full of humor, sometimes wry."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Appreciated and enjoyed by recipient who is a huge John Grisham fan! Would recommend for all fans of this author."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The narrator of The Rainmaker is Rudy Baylor, a law school student at Memphis State, who runs into a string of bad luck in his final year of school. His girlfriend, Sara Plankmore, dumped him for a preppie named S. Todd Wilcox. He was evicted from his apartment, and a process-server delivered a summons for him to answer to a debt from Texaco. His job at Broadnax and Speer was eliminated when the partners of that firm sold out to Tinley Britt, the most exclusive white-shoes law firm in Memphis. Rudy talked himself into a job as a paralegal by offering the carrot of a case, only to find out that his so-called boss never really had the position to give in the first place. Barry X. Lancaster then insisted that the case now belonged to the law offices of Jonathan Lake. Rudy took a job with a disreputable lawyer who sends Baylor on ambulance-chasing missions, something Rudy is loath to do. The lawyer running that firm resolved some personal legal problems that ensnared Rudy, and he encouraged Baylor to pass the bar exam. Even that job quickly ended when the feds busted Bruiser Stone, his new employer.Baylor ends up forming his own practice with Deck Shifflet, an odd-faced egg who is practical at chasing down business. The author, John Grisham, introduced the reader to another aspect of the legal world - a new lawyer opening his own practice. Baylor was one of the lucky ones, as he had two hot leads as prospective clients, as well as an employee who seemed to enjoy hustling for clients. One is a lonely widow named Miss Birdie who asks Baylor to redo her will, one that doles out an estate of more than $20 million to various beneficiaries. Another is the bad-faith suit against the Great Benefit Life Insurance Company proposed by Dot and Buddy Black, a couple with a son dying of leukemia. Their son Ronnie Ray would have been saved had the insurance company forked over the money for a bone marrow transplant. His twin brother was a willing and able donor, but Great Life stalled, and denied the claim eight different times until it was too late for an operation to save Ronnie Ray.Through the Black case, the reader also learns about the thin legal line that some fly-by-night insurance firms tow. A bad-faith claim is simply one presented by a client who is denied, even though the claim is covered by the insurance.Grisham grew up in a small town across the border from Memphis in Mississippi. A web site for the city of Memphis promotes Grisham as a tourist attraction. This story occurs primarily in Memphis, and there is no shortage of colorful characters or establishments. Yet, many of these characters have a benevolent side to their personalities. Prince Thomas, the owner of a bar called Yogi's, who employed Rudy Baylor during school, should also be mentioned along with the aforementioned cast of colorful characters. Both Prince and his friend Bruiser were rumored to be involved in strip clubs and illegal businesses, where money was laundered through a variety of manners. Yet they were of great help to Rudy Baylor, who remained grateful to his former bosses even while he was afraid that their transgressions were causing him grief.With all of his troubles, Rudy Baylor is an engaging narrator who unwittingly became the underdog in a David and Goliath courtroom struggle. His antagonist is a behemoth law firm representing a disreputable client. Both sets of antagonists are as easy to root against as it is to side with the underdog. Yet, a reader cannot always count on a happy ending from Grisham. Here, David so regularly vanquishes Goliath that the reader is waiting for the ball to drop."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"did not think the subject matter of the book would be all that interesting but I was wrong .

And I recommend it to all john grisham readers"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Gresham has a marvellous way with stories, but this one really made me sit up and think. So many sub plots and turn arounds that keep you guessing until the end. I highly recommend it dear reader!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Methinks that John Grisham has a mellower side to his writing than we've seen thus far.Certainly \\"The Rainmaker\\", rather than being the legal thriller that one might have expected on the basis of his previous novels, is more of a gentle bittersweet general fiction novel comprised of three concurrent sub-plots that take place primarily in a legal setting.In the first story, (of course, all three are intertwined to a certain extent and bump into one another, although each of the three would serve as a fine short story or novella on its own), Rudy Baylor graduates from law school with the hopeful vision of a young man destined for a rising career in a mainstream firm well known in the field of corporate law. When an unexpected takeover leaves him jobless and facing personal bankruptcy, he is forced by unexpected circumstances into the arms of his first client. A pleansant but very lonely (and surprisingly wealthy) elderly lady offers him rental accommodation at a price he couldn't possibly refuse in exchange for a review of her will.In the second (and central) plot of the novel, Baylor unexpectedly becomes the attorney of record in a major lawsuit alleging fraud against a mega-rich insurance company that pads its profits by routinely rejecting legitimate insurance claims comfortable in the proven belief that only a small statistical percentage of those claims denied will actually be taken to court. His client is a 22 year old man, dying of leukemia. He can't afford the cost of a bone marrow transplant because his claim under the insurance policy he bought many years earlier has been rejected. The stakes are huge with a $10 million judgment hanging in the balance.In the third and final story, and certainly the most poignant of the three, Baylor meets a young woman in the hospital who has been severely beaten by her husband. As his relationship progresses from legal representative to something much deeper and much more important, Baylor begins to question his future, his objectivity and even his commitment to the entire field of law.\\"The Rainmaker\\" is entertaining, well written fiction that certainly speaks to Grisham's ability as a well-rounded writer who can create believable stories, populated by a strong cast of warm characters with complexity and depth, that are far richer than pure suspense.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This isn't a mystery, nor is it a thriller. There are no sadistic serial killers slinking through the night, no wondering who the killer is, no car chases, etc. Despite that, this is a suspenseful book that had me cheering for the little guy to prevail.A newly minted lawyer in Memphis takes on a mega insurance company, represented by a pack of lawyers who have initials in front of their names and Roman numberals behind. And lest I forget, expensive clothes and haughty smirks. The issue: the insurance company arbitrarialy turned down coverage for a bone marrow transplant that would have saved the life of a young man with cancer. Every trick is used to reject coverage, to obfuscate, to delay. As an aside, I worked in insurance for over 26 years, and Mr. Grisham's version represents what I saw and sometimes did. I'm not proud of it.Apparently some other reviewers read a different book from the one I read. One said that the characters were not well drawn. I thought they were excellent. Some doubted the plot. Don't doubt it. Grisham stacked the cards, but that's the nature of fiction. This book along with the movie \\"Sicko\\" give an accurate picture of how insurance companies often operate. Adjusters are not promoted for how fairly they settle claims by the terms of the policy but by how many claims they can deny or settle for a sum below what the policy promises. \\"We're on your side\\" and \\"good hands\\" are what all companies promise, one way or another, but they are promises that are not always delivered.I've not always been fond of Grisham's novels, but this one is a winner. It also has some nice surprises, ones I certainly didn't expect. That added to the pleasure in reading this."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is a can't-miss Grisham! This is one of his best books. Classic.Who doesn't love a thriller with an underdog chasing the greedy and corrupt insurance company, to make them pay for cheating their customers? Especially one that is so dirty that they would rather lose a life than to pay out benefits. Great characters, story and ending. It was fast-paced but thorough in the story and development. Loved it!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Though Matt Damon was great as the awkward and sweet Rudy Baylor, the book is even better"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Like most Grisham books, this is a simple book that requires no thought or effort to get into. No wonder he is so popular.There are no plot twists. Pretty much everything falls Rudys way. Not once is he tripped up in court. The case is so cut and dried that someone who doesn't know what he is doing can win it with no effort. This is problem one with the book. Where is the drama?The second problem is that both Rudy and the Blacks repeatedly claim that they are not suing for the money, but for the principle, and Rudy wants to put them out of business. So after he does this, but gets no money, both Dot and Rudy are upset.Just as bad is Kelly, the typical beaten wife who deserves no sympathy because she seems to want to get beat. No one intelligent would get involved with this train wreck, no matter how hot she may be. The ridiculous part of this story line is how Rudy takes her back to get clothes. No lawyer would allow her to go to his house without police escort, this is nonsense! Then of course, he lets her gets arrested, and apparently the police are too incompetent to investigate it properly, so she walk in like two days.The worst is that at the end Rudy decides to never practice law again. This pretty much comes out of nowhere and is based on the fact he lost out of 33% of $50 million, even though it was never about the money. Huh?Despite all these major problems, I still liked the story. I am still not sure why, but I can't give this book the 1 or 2 stars it deserves. I can't believe people give this McBook 5 stars. He is the fast food of fiction. Grisham has always been a decent storyteller, too bad he has absolutely no concept of drama and plot twists."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham is one of the best authors of this era and this book is proof to that fact. He is very good at devolping characters and plots without the need to use reaccuring characters. The story is a perfect balance of a believable story and a thrilling legal battle. Recommended to any Grisham reader, and if you haven't read a Grisham novel then this is a perfect book to start with (along with The Firm and A Time to Kill). Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker by John Grisham is an excellent book due to its highly suspenseful nature. Unfortunately, the book also becomes predictable towards the end until the last few chapters where the suspense resumes. The plotting, although linear, is interesting. It is also a very emotional book; this book can make you hate insurance companies. The linear first-person perspective both supports and opposes the ability of the book to convey the plot. Also, there are many unanswered questions that the book leaves. At times, the story feels incomplete, especially at the end. However, The Rainmaker by John Grisham is an excellent book in general and is definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I love this storyline. Baylor is a lovable character and has a true sense of what justice should be, and he makes certain that his clients do not go unheard."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This novel is an underdog story of a young lawyer, Rudy Baylor, barely out of law school who goes against the big guns--that of a very corrupt insurance company defended by lawyers from a big, prestigious law firm. You cannot help but root for Rudy, who put himself through college and law school and who is so desperate for a job in law that his job-hunting leads to a very low point: He finds work from a corrupt lawyer. However, through circumstances beyond his control, Rudy soon finds himself with his own struggling practice with a paralawyer (Grisham invention) named Deck. Deck is an unattractive, unethical guy who does what it takes to get the job done. He is an amusing character and rings true-to-life. I think that most people know someone like him, or know of someone like him. Nonetheless, in the end, I feel sorry for how things turned out for him.Rudy's biggest case is the Blacks vs. Great Benefit, an oh-so-evil insurance company. The Blacks are a senior couple with a dying son who needs a bone marrow operation that GB will not pay for. GB preys on the poorly-educated with medical policies that don't cover much at all in reality.(*Spoiler alert*: Don't read the following stuff within the parentheses, else it may ruin one of the best moments in the book. GB's employee manuals for claims handlers and underwriters instruct the GB employee to deny every claim initially! They only pay for claims that don't cost much and/or when threatened with litigation.)I really hope that insurance companies like GB don't exist; it is merely a Pollyanna hope, I suppose. However, if we didn't have evil companies (or evil organizations, agencies, etc.), we wouldn't have great courtroom dramas (or just plain drama). Things are more interesting when you have conflicts involving good versus evil, or some forms of those opposing realities.After reading this book, I know why Grisham is a bestselling author. He delivers the goods in an exceptional way. I find myself just flowing along with his words-it's so readable. There are parts in this particular story that aren't that believable (most of the breaks that Rudy gets in the case against GB), but somehow it doesn't diminish the excitement of the story."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham did a wonderful job after he wrote this one. Rainmaker however, is a rare classic case when a young graduate is thrown into the gunlate of law. When young Rudy's first cases is to help a couple sue an insurance corporation for denying claims to help their son whose is suffering from leukemia, he was bearly able to keep up with the top lawyers representing the corporation. He was literly holding the book of all of the medical insurance statutes and laws in hand during a court room session. Rudy then finds a good friend, Deck Shifflet, who quickly becomes Rudy's \\"partner in crime\\". The catch is that Deck hasn't even passed the bar exam. The duo decide that they should at least open a small office to give them selves a working space since they are only freash into the world of lawyers. As the team searches high and low for loop holes in the cororation, time is running out for the young man with leukemia. He dies and then the family is devistated and answers are wanted. In the end, the case is won fair and square by the \\"tag team\\" and the coporation has been agreed by the court to pay a sum of 60 million dollars. But before the corporation could even write that check, they had one last trick up their sleeves and thqt was to declare bankruptcy and close down the corporation before anymore lawsuits were to come knocking at their front door. Rudy and Deck were not to happy but the case recived world reconition for two new lawyers who had taken on a large and strong insurance corporation. Highly reconmend it for those who like drama."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is the first Grisham novel I've ever read, and I enjoyed every page. The Rainmaker is well paced, engaging, witty, and surprisingly resonant. I could completely relate to Rudy, the main character, and I rejoiced at his triumphs, great and small, and I sympathized even with his petty, less noble moments. He's just a regular guy trying to make his way in the world and do some good while he's at it, and it was fun partaking in his journey.Grisham has a great sense of humor, and I still find myself smiling over the title &quot;paralawyer&quot; and the preppy Waspishness of &quot;Trent and Brent&quot;. The line, &quot;Go chase an ambulance,&quot; is both cruel and hilarious, yet once you get to know Deck, you understand that he doesn't even have enough shame to be offended by such jabs.I laughed aloud during the jury selection passage, and I found myself cringing during Rudy's confrontation with Cliff, aka &quot;Fists of Fury, Redneck Style&quot;. I chewed my lips constantly in suspense through the last third of this book, and I was loath to put it down. Let's just say that I was definitely drawn into the story.I'd recommend this book to anyone since the characters are realistic, the writing style is sparse and elegant, and there are little realisms and moments of truth that catch you off guard in their simplicity. This book contains grief and tragedy, but never once does Grisham cheapen his characters by resorting to maudlin, pity-party tactics.I will now be on the lookout for another Grisham novel that's as engaging as this one. If you buy this book, you're not likely to be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"A young man, struggling through college with a job and classes and the upcoming bar, finds out his future job is gone. He's in debt because his girlfriend dumped him right after buying her expensive jewelry, while facing the one of the worst Lawyer job markets around, and he just got evicted. This no luck kid finds the case of a lifetime.Grisham expertly weaves a story about this young lawyer during a crucial time of his life. Through chance, he joins up with a sleazy law firm, finds and rescues a helpless girl, and takes on a large corporation. It's a touching story that really makes you root for the main character. The book is easy and fun read, and like any Grisham novel, the pages fly by.The book is not perfect however. The ending is predictable and corny, and the hard luck story gets old after a while.I suggest this book to anyone that wants a good read. I would not recommend the movie though, as it doesn't capture any of the essence."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This book is about Rudy Baylor, fresh out of law school, who has been assigned to an incredible case that just might be the greatest insurance scam ever.Grisham tells a great story, somehow making a boring trial so interesting, you can't stop turning pages. From page 1, you find yourself cheering for the good guy, booing for the bad guy. You become sad or mad when Drummond (the bad guy) does something, and then can't stop yourself from smiling and letting out a little giggle when Rudy (the good guy) does something totally unexpected and stops Drummond's plan in its tracks. And in some places you stop breathing when Rudy or Drummond presents an unexpected clue to the jury.There is an upleasant anti-climax at the end, but Grisham rarely has good endings. Believe me, the ending's not that important if the book is so interesting, you can read 200 pages in one sitting.The Rainmaker is definitely Grisham's best book and there will always be a place for it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I always enjoy John Grisham's books, but this one had a much &quot;lighter&quot; tone to it while still dealing with an incredibly sad situation. I liked the dry humor and, of course, Rudy Baylor was just a really personable fellow. Some of John Grisham's books deal with one major subject and others, like this one, have numerous subplots going on as well. I just found this to be an excellent book on all levels."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"In the book, The Rainmaker, the author, John Grisham, skillfully presents a case of good versus evil. The main character, Rudy Baylor, is a struggling law student trying to make it in life. With no job and no place to live, he stumbles onto a case that will either bring him fame or ultimate failure. In this case, Baylor is up against professional, smart, and crafty lawyers. The lawyers and the rest of the society are both impressed when the inexperienced Baylor crushes them in the courtroom.Hollywood has created the typical story line for a story. The hero always ends up winning. Well Grisham diverts and steers to and from the typical. Readers are kept interested because they do not always know what is going to happen next. There is even a murder drama placed in the already exciting world. Baylor and his girlfriend, Kelly, go to her old apartment to get some of her clothes. \\"I place the car, and take a deep breath. \`Are you scared?' she asks. \`Yes.' I reach under the seat and get the gun\\" (Grisham 412). To make matters worse, they meet up with Kelly's abusive ex-husband. There is a struggle and in the end, only Baylor and Kelly stand. Towards the conclusion of the book, there are two great endings. In the courtroom, there is an overwhelming victory. \\"We the jury, find for the plaintiff and award actual damages in the amount of two hundred thousand dollars... And we the jury find for the plaintiff and award punitive damages in the amount of fifty million dollars\\" (Grisham 402). The second happy ending in the book comes at the end. Baylor and Kelly, leave together. \\"We smile and giggle as the land flattens and the traffic lightens. Memphis is twenty miles behind us. I vow never to return\\" (Grisham 434). With the thrilling scenes and interesting details, Grisham's book comes to life as everything unfolds perfectly in time.Many people have praised The Rainmaker. One critic has written, \\"The case against the insurance company is a classic David vs. Goliath scenario. Mr. Grisham expertly weaves all these plot lines together and keeps the pages turning with bright, vivid and entertaining writing\\" (Thomas Magnum). This critic is correct. Readers learn throughout the book that perseverance always wins. Baylor, the inexperienced lawyer, gives inspiration to the little people in the world trying to make it in life. In classic Good vs. Evil cases, the outcome usually leans towards the good. Although this is known, Grisham exemplifies his great ability of writing and guides readers on a journey that leads to reality."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I love John Girsham's books and all the movies. He has great amount of experience writing about the law and it's complicated twists. His writing style is easy to pick and and enjoy for all people. One can see the words being drawn into a movie as they are reading. I like to read books before watching a movie because it is usually better and so I recommend people to do so. Their imaginations are alwayz more creative than any motion picture can display. enjoy reading!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Rainmaker. It was on the few Grisham novels that I had yet to read and after the disappointing Summons I wasn't excited about reading another Grisham novel. However, once I began I just could NOT put it down. I went everywhere with the book as I was reading it. I just couldn't get away from it for more than a few of my waking hours. Why? Well, I'm glad you asked. First of all, the most pleasantly surprising thing about the book is its humor. It's a mix of sarcasm and wit. I just loved his characterization of the Defense and their actions. In one courtroom scene all eyes turn toward one of the corporate baddies after a wrenching testimony places blame on them. Grisham paints his reaction along the lines of &quot;Suddenly, his shoelaces became the center of his life.&quot; I couldn't stop laughing after reading that. The book is full of these quips.Secondly, the book won me over in how Rudy is portrayed. I felt really really sorry for the kid. All the things that could of gone wrong, did after Law School. However, he was a moral, bright, and hard working kid that was fortunate enough to come across the Black case. I loved his character arc.Finally, the coutroom drama was riveting. The legalese was palatable and believable and it showed Grisham's amount of research into the material. I loved the fact that he didn't make it too easy for Rudy. Drummond did have some minor wins with the jury.Overall I'd give this film a 5/5. I can't say there weren't any negatives(insufficient explanation of the fire/death, unrealistic assistance by the Judge) but they didn't take away from what is one of Grisham's top two novels."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Before reading the Rainmaker I had never read any of Grisham's books, or any legal thrillers for that matter. I was therefore a little apprehensive about reading it. My apprehension was unwarranted; I was hooked after the first 50 pages. It only took me 3 days to read, and on the last day I read half the book (this is a record for me). The first half of the book revolves largely around Rudy's less than comfortable life as he struggles through the merciless world of law. I found this oddly appealing to read about. There's something about the way Baylor handles these dillemas that makes for a good read. The last half, of course, flew by as the suspense grew and the climax approached. I encourage those who are apprehensive about reading this kind of book to try it. It certainly exceeded my expectations."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I saw the movie, listened to the tape and then read the book. To book was great and the tape would be great for a family on a long trip. I also like the movie very much. The audio tape holds your attention and would probably hold the interest of kids 12 and up (for those soon approaching summer car trips). The narrator was excellent.This is a great book for people who want to know what law school is like - the last year and especially for those students (75%) who aren't one of the top students. Most people don't realize how hard it is for the majority of graduates to get good jobs after finishing law school. Not only does Grisham write accurately about law school, his story of the typical lawyer (not the white shoe corporate types) is also right on target. Finally, there are so many million dollar cases that never collect for all kinds of reasons and Grisham really tells a story of how frustrating being a young, inexperinced lawyer can be at times. For all you &quot;learn&quot; in Law School, you know very little about how law is practiced in the courts everyday. Armed only with truth and a just cause, is simply not enough.The book should be required reading for anyone thinking they want to be a lawyer or to really get an understanding of what most young average lawyers go through. It really is like this!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor is a rookie lawyer who is almost broke. The first case he ever bags is a doozy. It is a bad faith case against a big insurance company. The insurance company could have saved a life if they had not denied a valid claim. Rudy Baylor's story is told in first person, using the simple present tense all through the book. Maintaining the interest of the reader throughout the substantially lengthy story using this kind of comparatively uncommon style of writing is indeed a feat and only a very confident writer would dare attempt it. John Grisham dares - and succeeds. The book starts by giving some background about Rudy Baylor. From there on, the plot threads off in diverse and interesting directions. The longest thread is of course the one about the insurance case. It occupies more than half the book. The next most prominent thread concerns the love affair of Rudy with Kelly, who is a young girl married to an abusing husband. The other plot threads involve Rudy's financial troubles, his relationships with various people: his business partner named Deck, an old lady nicknamed Birdy, two underworld characters called Bruiser and the Prince, and other assorted characters. The book has a lot going for it. It is well-paced. There is no lapse of interest at any time. The courtroom scenes are relentlessly gripping. The legal machinery is depicted with authority, and why not? Mr Grisham was a lawyer himself. The novel has no sleazy sex and it has a dash of idealism; two features that are becoming very rare in the best-selling fiction of today. Well done, Mr Grisham. The only gripes, and minor ones, that I have about the novel are two. First, in the initial part of the book, the writing is not tight. It is possible for the reader to skip chunks of text on almost every page and still be able to follow the plot threads. But the writing becomes almost air tight once the courtroom scenes start. My second gripe is about the ending. I don't know why Mr Grisham tried for multiple climaxes. They lessen the impact of the ending. In summary, The Rainmaker is one of the best books to reach the best-seller lists in the recent past."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read just about every book by John Grisham and except for \\"The Client\\" and \\"The Chamber\\" I have enjoyed all of them. The main character, Rudy, in The Rainmaker gave me a laugh or too which was nice. The hardships that he encounters throughout the book are real-life experiences that any reader could identify with; bankruptcy, unemployed, homeless, and the list goes on. Overall, this was a fantastic novel and I would recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor hasn't even passed the bar yet. but he's about to get the case of a lifetime. Insurance company Great Benefit has committed a possible malpractice in repeatedly denying the claims of Donny Ray Black, a 21-year old suffering from severe leukemia who doesn't have very long at all to live. Not only will they not recognize their claims, but they won't pay out any insurance money for Donny Ray to get treatment. Somehow, this case falls into Rudy's lap, and he's determined to get these people the settlement they deserve. But since he's been fired from two different law firms in the span of about a month, he's a bit strapped for luck- not to mention cash. Soon, not only does he have to deal with the rigors of a trial that has caught national attention, but he also has to haggle with an aging landlord who views Rudy as her own personal lawn workhorse, a boss with less than scrupulous business practices, and a young beautiful woman who has fallen hopelessly in love with him- and has a brutally abusive husband to boot. If Rudy ever feels in over his head, it's probably because he is!!The Rainmaker is to me Grisham's best novel yet. It's the only novel from Grisham that I've ever been able to laugh out loud at (which I did in multiple parts) and even cry at (although I do admit I was ecstatic when Rudy killed Cliff, Kelly's abusive husband; he's the only character in the novel I wanted to see murdered, at least similar to the way he treated Kelly. So yes, I was happy when he got offed). If only Grisham's other novels were this good, I'd be reviewing them like this one: only five hours after I finished the last page."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is a neat little package of a book. 550 pages-odd but a fast, fast read which turns the screw nicely. Grisham is excellent - I'm sure he knows he is - but in a sense, with so many great books under his belt, I wonder if that doesn't leave him with a desire to tie-up too many loose ends in the last chapter or so. I felt that some of the last few swings were a little too convenient and so, much as I cannot believe I have the audacity to give Mr Grisham only four stars, that is what I am going to give him. I think more flags earlier on in the story would have given it five, but the quick spurt to the end - common in a number of books - is possibly a failing of an editor, not necessarily Grisham himself? I wonder if he reads these reviews?"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Best of its ilk, The Rainmaker surpasses most legal thrillers without a doubt. A quick read; start to finish a great novel. This book as defiantly started me on Grisham saga, that won't end until I've read all his books. I highly recommend this to any one who has any remote interest in the law, or just reading in general. A+"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is an intriguing story that will keep readers wanting to turn the page. Written by John Grisham, this story has inspired readers everywhere. It's a story of compassion, devotion, and love- This is the story of a lawyers struggle through the beginning of his career.The Rainmaker is about a rooky lawyer named Rudy Baylor who just graduated from law school. He has passed his bar exam and has taken on his first cases as a lawyer. Since Rudy has no money and no place to live, he's just looking for some easy money makers. At least that's what he thinks these cases are, but Rudy gets in over his head. These so called easy cases turn into a fight for justice in this small town.With the help of his new found partner, a friend who knows the ropes of law, and some ways around it, Rudy finds the real lawyer inside of him, vs. the lawyer that breezed through college. He fights for what's right against a dishonest insurance company that won't cover a young man with leukemia and a young woman with an abusive husband.This story follows his struggles, hardships and breakthroughs. This is an extraordinary story. It's a story for all readers and one that everyone will enjoy. This novel is written so well you feel like you're not just reading it, but your there, in the courtroom, or in the office, or wherever the story may take you. The details, it's not superficial or unrealistic, and how the characters are written make the story even more real. It almost feels like a biography, like Rudy's thoughts were written down on paper as he thought them. Reading this story will inspire young lawyers, and young readers everywhere. I can truly say that this novel is one that I can read over and over and still be taken aback by this story of affection, love, and allegiance."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I believe this is the book that defines Grisham as a writer. He weaves so many elements into this emotionally charged story. He gives us humor, heartache, twists and turns all in one novel. He gives the reader a great look at what it actually \\"costs\\" to get through a graduate degree. The struggle for grades, money to pay rent and buy food, and the search for a job in an already flooded job market.If you've ever had to struggle to get a claim paid through an insurance agency, this book will strike a chord with you also. The injustice of Big Business screams in this book. Rudy is a loveable, believable character and it's fun to watch as he struggles to learn the ropes. You'll want to cheer as he's taken under the wing of a seasoned judge. This judge marches in like Nemesis against Rudy's powerful legal opponents.Speaking of characters, there are so many rich and real ones in this book. My family is from the South and Grisham has such a way of portraying these lovely people without stereotyping them, but also exposing their struggles. Although understated, Dot Black is a true heroine in the story. We feel the anguish of this family in dealing with their son's terminal illness.Other memorable players in the story are Deck and Miss Birdie. You'll be chuckling with every chapter and their antics.Grisham gives you a look into Memphis, at the rich and powerful as well as a glimpse of its dark underbelly.His characterization is what brings me back to his books over and over again. If this is what draws you, then this book won't dissappoint! This book doesn't have the fast-paced action of the Firm, but it shouldn't. It's about a young law student's struggles to survive in a tough world and this is something that devlops over time. The book reminds us how slowly the wheels of justice can turn, especially for the poor.Once you read the book, check out the audio version from your local library. Michael Beck makes these charcters really come to life and I thoroughly enjoyed this book the 2nd time while travelling in the car."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham never ceases to amaze me at how well he writes his novels. This one once again is a winner with some of the best characters i have ever read. This also has a great plot with a superb ending that i was not expecting and especially the fact this actually does have some comedy added to it. Something you don't normally see in a Grisham novel. Never read a Grisham Novel? Read this one immedeately and you will see why John Grisham is one of the best writers today."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am a big John Grisham fan. This book was so great. It started with so much excitement and energy. I read a chapter a day. Many times it was hard to stop. I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I actually expected it to end after the case. The remaining chapters could have been excluded."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Quite like a few of John Grisham's novels but feel this is by some way his best. Not sure quite why. Enjoy the first-person narrative, which is self-deprecating and funny. Also like the romance with the battered woman, the other characters in the legal practice, as well as the general atmosphere of Memphis. I think above all the characters are quite three-dimensional, which I don't always find with Grisham's books."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is the story of law student Rudy Baylor. Throughout the book, you'll be told his story and the story of his client, Dot Black.His story begins towards the end of his time in law school. As the days pass until graduation, he is dropped by the firm that was going to hire him. Problem after problem arise, until he is helped out by his friend (and very dirty friend) Prince. He helps Rudy get a job with Brusier Stone, your typical evil lawyer, that you actually like. You know, that old story. Anyways, as the story unfolds, Rudy meets a co-worker by the name of Deck. They slowly become friends and the two gain a trust, something that doesn't come easy at the law offices of Bruiser Stone. Meanwhile, things are dug up about Bruiser and he and Prince ditch town.Throughout the story, we'll hear the other tales of Miss Birdy Birdsong, Rudy's temporary landlord and yard boss. As well with the story of Cliff and Kelly Riker. Two very key elements to this book.When it gets right down to the nitty-gritty of the case against the evil insurance company, Great Benefit, Rudy goes head to head with Mr. Leo F. Drummond...a very, very mean lawyer. Luckily for Rudy, he's got a judge that is on his side and helping him through the case. He's just graduated law school, you know. The book goes through the humorous testimonies and mishaps of Great Benefit and Drummond.As far as the characters go, you really begin to love and feel for the characters. Especially Dot Black and her dying son, Donny Ray. As the story unfolds and you read on through Donny Ray's story of how Great Benefit denied him treatment time after time, it makes you want to get up and cuss out your insurance company.The story is thrilling at times, but is very predictable when it is. It relies on humor more than anything, as it is a very funny book. The quips and one-liners really strike a chord with you. All in all though, it's a great book. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Sorry I have read most of the Grisham novels. This one did not do it for me."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"When I finished this story I was like that's it?! Where was the plot, and the conflict?! The only thing I would call a twist in the story was that it had absolutely no twists!

Unless you're reading Shakespeare, stick with non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am a 16 year old and I have read all of John Grishams books. I like the Rainmaker the best because it tells the story of a young man trying to make a name for himself and get some respect.

John is a great writer and I wish he would write some more great storys."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Even though I am an avid reader, this was my first Grisham read. I don't know why I waited so long! I enjoyed The Rainmaker very much. I especially liked rooting for Rudy (the underdog) and how he messed with the high powered lawyers. I didn't particuarly like the end, (you know, in the apartment) but still liked the book. It caused me to stay up way too late at night!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"You will be entertained by this book, and even educated about the unglamorous aspects of becoming a lawyer. I have an undergraduate and graduate in Criminology, and I have real problems about how Mr. Grisham portrays the workings of the criminal justice system...it seems slightly unrealistic, especially how openly biased judges can be for one side or another in this tale. I know just enough about the law to know that Mr. Grisham accurately breaks down the legalise into understandable language so that anyone can understand the way the law was meant to be and how the law has evolved into what it is today. And here is a refreshing twist - No sex before marriage in the romantic side of this story (Thank You, Mr. Grisham). And as always, Mr. Grisham neatly ties up all loose ends so there are no questions or misunderstandings at the end. Just remember that this is entertaining FICTION, not a college textbook."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I had a hard time putting it down!

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Thought this book was quite a departure from his usual excellent, thrilling, page-turner, legalese-filled novels in that he wrote in a SENSE OF HUMOR. I loved it and even laughed out loud a few times. The story may be a little contrived and Rocky-ish but still a wonderful read. The courtroom scenes were so compelling, I had to stay up all night to finish the book.

(amd I have read almost all of them)"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read every single one of John Grisham's novels and this one by far was my favorite. Rudy Baylor's character was so real to me that I saw my self in him almost from the first chapter. It was this book that had me &quot;all of a sudden&quot; start really wanting to become a lawyer. Sigh, this never happenned. I went into computers instead. Yet this is still my favorite Grisham novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is all too realistic. It is descriptive in the way that it tells of a young lawyer who is determined to be a lawyer and in the process, stay the person he is. His desire to not become a rich cheating lawyer like the &quot;bad guy&quot; in the book is evident. We feel his pain and his sorrow still at the end. Those who saw the movie and are searching for the same degree of brilliance in the book will get it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"When I first looked at The Rainmaker, I thought it was going to be some touching story about some ordinary guy who has bad things happen to him. Well, I was totally wrong. It's actually about a lawyer suing an insurance company. I loved how you really got to know the character, Rudy Baylor, and how much of a glimpse you got at the work involved in a trial. As I said earlier, the book is very involving. As soon as the lawsuit is filed, you get drawn into the book and you feel Rudy's emotions, the Black's (the people Rudy represents) emotions, and as the book goes on, you begin to hate the company being sued, Great Benefit. I hated them so much that as I read the trial parts I found myself rooting for Rudy and laughing when he nailed them.Overall, The Rainmaker is a great great book and I reccomend it to anyone who likes books involving the law, and anyone who hates insurance companies."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I've read through all of Mr.Grisham's books but still find this the best. I ask myself why? Compared with others, The Rainmaker definitely does not acquire the most interesting plot. The reasons are very simple: it's the most realistic and the characters are too vivid to be merely imaginative figures in a book. And what I enjoyed most is that Mr.Grisham actually displayed his humorous capability in this book. It's a simple book, too simple that I can't help finding it the best."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I hate reading books, but I must admit &quot;The Raimnaker&quot; is one of those of books I actually enjoyed reading. The positive side was it keeps you in suspense, but the negative part was that everything went to easy and smoothly for the main character, at some parts you can predict easily whats going to happen next. And another thing I didn't like was how Tyrone Kipler ganged up on Drummond and supported Rudy a little too much and was being very unfair to him, I felt sorry for the guy. But in conclusion its entertaining its worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This book was well worth reading. It had a great ending as well as a great beginning. The outcome of the book will surprise you. I would read this book over again and again. As usual Mr. Grisham another great book!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham does a superior job of telling how everyone can get the justice that they deserve. A small town woman causes a large insurance company to go bankrupt. This story is definitely worth reading, even if you aren't too thrilled with lawyers these days."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I think Grisham never reached (and never will) the level of this first novel.Involving."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor is a rookie lawyer who is almost broke. The first case he ever bags is a doozy. It is a bad faith case against a big insurance company. The insurance company could have saved a life if they had not denied a valid claim. Rudy Baylor's story is told in first person, using the simple present tense all through the book. Maintaining the interest of the reader throughout the substantially lengthy story using this kind of comparatively uncommon style of writing is indeed a feat and only a very confident writer would dare attempt it. John Grisham dares - and succeeds. The book starts by giving some background about Rudy Baylor. From there on, the plot threads off in diverse and interesting directions. The longest thread is of course the one about the insurance case. It occupies more than half the book. The next most prominent thread concerns the love affair of Rudy with Kelly, who is a young girl married to an abusing husband. The other plot threads involve Rudy's financial troubles, his relationships with various people: his business partner named Deck, an old lady nicknamed Birdy, two underworld characters called Bruiser and the Prince, and other assorted characters. The book has a lot going for it. It is well-paced. There is no lapse of interest at any time. The courtroom scenes are relentlessly gripping. The legal machinery is depicted with authority, and why not? Mr Grisham was a lawyer himself. The novel has no sleazy sex and it has a dash of idealism; two features that are becoming very rare in the best-selling fiction of today. Well done, Mr Grisham. The only gripes, and minor ones, that I have about the novel are two. First, in the initial part of the book, the writing is not tight. It is possible for the reader to skip chunks of text on almost every page and still be able to follow the plot threads. But the writing becomes almost air tight once the courtroom scenes start. My second gripe is about the ending. I don't know why Mr Grisham tried for multiple climaxes. They lessen the impact of the ending. In summary, The Rainmaker is one of the best books to reach the best-seller lists in the recent past."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This amazing, \\"hard-to-put-down\\" book portrays the life of a young law student, Rudy Baylor's rather short career as a lawyer in Memphis. Very unpredictable, you will never know what is going to happen next if you do not keep on reading. It is really surprising to see an author that can change the situation of the whole story in few pages and make it sound like a real piece of of literature. John Grisham, with his amazing knowledge of law weaves perfectly the two subjects that don't seem to go together well: Courtroom/law and Suspense. It is really intriguing to see the author give great amount of details about the court that in our normal life would put us into sleep in less than 5 minutes. In this ingenious work of literature, you can experience all kinds of emotion: sadness, happiness, love, fear, hatred...Adding to all the compliments on this novel, this book is frightfully realistic and its story could happen anytime and anywhere around us. In addition, Grisham depicts the corruption of the U.S. Courtroom, the law firms, and harsh reality about insurance companies. This book can be compared to a car with a diesel engine; starts real slow but once it reaches above 100km/h just keeps gaining speed. That means the first 100 pages of The Rainmaker is rather boring but after that 100 pages, the novel becomes a really \\"hard-to-put-down-page-turner\\".In short, this book is a masterpiece legal suspense novel, probably the best one in the 21st century. There are only two faults about The Rainmaker. It is that the book has a rather deceptive ending and that the book is only about 500 pages...Highly recommended to anyone...Guaranteed."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"JOHN GRISHAM IS ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS OF THE LEGAL SUSPENSE GENRE THAT HAS EVER WALKED THIS EARTH. \\"THE RAINMAKER\\" IS A FIRST RATE BOOK THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN. IF YOU'VE NEVER READ A GRISHAM BOOK, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO START READING THEM."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I was a little reluctant to read this one, mainly because I was so bored by Grisham's \\"The Client\\" and because I heard this was a \\"funny\\" book. Usually funny means excessively silly and cute.However, just a few pages into this novel I knew it was different. Maybe becuase I could relate to the Rudy character, having graduated grad school not too long ago and having concerns about what Id be able to do with my degree, it kept me reading non-stop.THe writing is personable, like it's really written by a young man just out of law school. The humor in it is just right, not over the top silly, but enough to make me laugh every so often. It's also fascinating material for anyone who has considered going into law ot just like watching law-based shows on TV.A few reviewers have pointed out that there are a couple inconsistencies with the story, particularly the ending, though by that time I was more than willing to cut Grisham a little slack and overlook it. THe previous 500 pages of enjoyment I got gave him some leeway in putting together an ending that was, maybe, a little clumsy.Whenever I read one of Grisham's novels I think that the main characters, in some way, reflect on his own experiences and opinions from when he was an attorney. All I can say is that I am very glad that the legal profession turned out not to be his true love and that he decided to become an author. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"\\"The Firm\\" still remains John Grisham's best novel, but \\"The Rainmaker\\" is far and away his funniest. I have never read a book that better managed to hit my funny bone straight on without tipping over the edge into farce (i.e., John Irving at his best). This time around Grisham's would be hero is Rudy Baylor, in his final semester of law school and required by one of his professors to provide free legal advice at a Senior Citizens home. There he meets Miss Birdie, an old lady who apparently has millions of dollars salted away and who definitely needs a new will, and Dot Black, who's son Donny Ray is dying of leukemia while their insurance company refuses to pay for medical treatment. In the legal world a \\"rainmaker\\" is someone who brings in big clients (i.e., big money) to a law firm. When Rudy's future job suddenly disappears in the wake of a surprise merger, these cases might be his ticket to a promising legal career.The villains are lawyers from a giant firm and a heartless insurance company, which is certainly stacking the deck but part of the fun as Grisham pours it on. As with \\"The Pelican Brief\\" there is a bit of misdirection at the beginning in terms of getting a read on the main character. Rudy is broke and has some shady friends in the legal profession, but the bottom line is he is a good guy and he will do the right thing. Even if it means playing David against Goliath in a stacked courtroom where the presiding judge is best buds with the great Leo F. Drummond of the giant law firm Trent & Brent, representing the Great Benefits Insurance Company. But then Rudy gets a break. The presiding judge suddenly drops dead and his replacement, Judge Kipler, is a plaintiff's dream. Rudy also has the truth on his side, but believe me, having the presiding judge on your side and having a key piece of damming evidence fall into your lap and finding the missing witness that has disappeared are all more important in the end.The joy of this book is watching little Rudy beat the big bad guys. Every single lawyer's trick used by Drummond fails with Judge Kipler. Every dirty trick by the insurance company is exposed by Rudy, who comes up with some little twists of his own. Sure, all the rabbits getting pulled out of the hat is a bit excessive, but that is what makes this such a fun read. At the heart of this book is the quest for justice, but that does not mean we can not enjoy a little payback along the way. The romantic subplot between Rudy and Kelly comes across as something of a diversion from the main story, but at the end it gives the hero someone with whom he can ride off into the sunset. \\"The Rainmaker\\" is one of those books where you pick it up from time to time to read the good parts. If you saw the movie and enjoyed Rudy sticking it to the bad guys, then you should enjoy much more of the same in this novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grishams novel The Rainmaker was filled with interesting and unexpected turns from the begining through the end. It was near impossible for me to put down this book, even to eat. I highly suggest it to anyone of all ages who is looking for a fast paced exciting read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Because I was in law school when I read it, I immediately identified with the hero of this Grisham novel. Rudy Baylor, the hero, isn't the top-notch student of some top-tier school, and the mysterious or openly corrupt southern firms aren't about to bang down his door. Even the mid-level prospects that Baylor had counted on for needed employment after graduation seem to vanish in the wind. But he's determined and not just a little ambitious, and his very first case takes him up against an evil HMO represented by the top law firm in state, a self-contained old-boy network with time and money to burn, and half the state's judges in its pocket.But Rainmaker is more than that. Actually, it's a bundle of stories sharing Rudy Baylor as the common denominator. He finds love with a battered wife, room and board with a widow who may be worth millions, learns things about law they don't teach you in law school and mixes with a rogue's gallery of unsavory types who are in equal measures scary and indispensable. Baylor's best hope (for work) is the ambulance chasing king of the hill, served by an army of disbarred or never-licensed minions who can't litigate issues.The book is best in the first half when it's not clear which of these little stories - if any - will take over the book. When Baylor's lawsuit against the evil HMO's takes over, the story necessarily slows down and becomes less satisfying. The trial itself becomes a bit of a disappointment - the racist old-time judges suddenly keels over to be replaced with one more friendly to Rudy and his cause and openly averse to the defense; the defense attorneys themselves remain the perfect paradigms of their evil breed and the defendants...well, what would you say in the defense of an HMO?As if to balance, Grisham beefs up the other plots (now firmly subplots) with unconvincing melodrama - a violent confrontation with the battered wife's evil husband being the worst example. Through it all however, he remains Rudy Baylor, first year law grad, scared out of his mind and possibly the Grisham's best hero."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor is a young lawyer just starting out in Memphis. He's barely making ends meet and has to exchange mowing lawns for his rent. His first case falls into his lap and it's a chance of a lifetime - an insurance company refuses to pay the medical treatments for a man dying of leukemia. Several problems face Rudy with this case, a few minor things like first passing the bar exam, getting together enough money to even try this case since he's flat broke, and getting the courage to go up against a huge corporation who just happens to have hired the best defense attorney around.John Grisham endures his characters to the reader and makes everyone think Insurance Companies are corrupt and only after profits. THE RAINMAKER is one of those books that will have the reader cheering against Corporate America and wondering just how many times this type of atrocity has actually happened. Many of Grisham's books make you think about things in real life and wonder just how much is being covered up by big money corporations. This is definitely one of those adventures!THE RAINMAKER is another great book by this writer. Not as good as some of his earlier works, e.g. The Firm, The Pelican Brief, or A Time To Kill, but still a decent read and definitely worth the time spent. This is not one to keep you awake at night to finish, but it will keep you occupied, entertained, and wondering."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor couldn't buy a job when he graduated from law school.

But his boss is in trouble with the law to so he and a friend of his from the office get their own firm and work on that one case.Through the Rainmaker John Grisham keeps the story going so you can never put the book down. One other thing I like is how Grisham kind of makes you feel bad for the kid in Rudy Baylor's main case. He is diagnosed with cancer and you don't know what to think. Grisham describes the details of his cancer very well.John Grisham makes the Rainmaker very witty, and is always gaining a new story to keep you along.In my opinion this is one of the greatest books that he has written. I like how The Rainmaker is always gaining a new story so you want to finish that one small story to get to the biggest story."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Now I'll be quick.

I loved this Grisham Novel!(I never saw this movie)"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is my personal favorite novel, though I might be a little prejudice in this opinion since this was my first. The book is about Rudy Baylor, a desperate-for-a-job lawyer, who stumbles across a case to help a dying boy's family fight against a corrupt insurance company.The story is dramatic and very clever. Grisham makes this one truly about the courtroom and shows that the little guys can beat the big guys. An excellent novel that is very interesting. Like many of Grisham's other novels, this one is a page turner. Very fun to read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"When I looked at this book, I thought to myself, \\"there is no way I will read such a long book,\\" but as I began to leaf through the pages, I sat down and read it. Three hours later I was still engulfed in it. The description is so vivid I feel as if I'm in the story line myself. I can relate to the situations the characters deal with. There are many conflicts that all intertwine with one another. A love story evolves, but doesn't disrupt the main plot. I had already watched the movie, so I always pictured the main character, Rudy, as Matt Damon. When I finished the book, I was upset; I wish it were a never-ending novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have been a huge John Grisham fan since I first read The Street Lawyer. After seeing the movie, I decided I had to read this book. The book is always better than the movie and I found that thsi held true here too. Grisham paints his characters so vividly that even if you haven't seen the movie, you can still picture them in your mind. He spins a heart wrenching story along side of a few others, of a young boy dying of cancer. Rudy, the young law student picks up the boys parents, dot and Buddy as \\"clients\\" because of a school assignment. At first he doesn't realize what he is getting himself into. At the end, he makes history. I found this book impossible to put down. The realness of the places and people he described are amazing. I would honestly have to say it is the best Grisham book I have read yet."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"There's something about southern drawls and humid summer afternoons that intrigues loyal Grisham readers to \\"The Rainmaker,\\" but it's a thought provoking plot which keeps them.A young Missipppi lawyer named Rudy finds himself in dismay after learning the hard and fast cut-throat world of law. As the apprentice of a slick, ambulance-chasing veteran he feels ready to give up his chosen profession when he stumbles upon the case of a lifetime. A young man of the surounding town is diagnosed with terminal cancer and has spent countless dollars on medical treatment which has provenitslef useless. Medical insurance, which he paid faithfully, is denied and the young man is left with little more than a death sentence. Rudy, despite contradicting advice, takes on the case of proving the inhumane treatment and negelct of the insurance companies. He proves the companies unlawfully denied medical expenses to the ill man and won his family millions.I enjoyed the witty writing style and the frank nature of the book. Grishman probed into the real life those with medical problems and the harsh realties they must face.I highly recommend this book to all those who love legal drama. Just have a tissue handy for the tears guaranteed to be straming down your face."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"i loved this book!! it was soooo good! i thought that it started out a little bit slow, but i was uplifted after about 75 pages. The climax was the best part, when Rudy Baylor, a fresh new lawyer that just got his license and just passed the bar exam, went to his first trial. The result of the trial was surprising and wonderful. The book is very good and presents many twists and turns rather than a predictable ending. This book, along with the firm, keep me hungry for many more John Grisham books!!! i love this book! it truely was a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i would rate it a ten on a scale of 1 to 5!!!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham has presented us with another winner, &quot;The Rainmaker.&quot; Readers will identify with the characters in this drama of the good guys against the bad.

The Rainmaker will have you smiling one minute and in tears the next. A truly great read.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Well its another McBook from the burn and turn factory know as Grisham Inc. I am convinced he has a group of Santa's elf's slaving away in some South Carolina sweat shop turning these screen plays - sorry, I mean books out. If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get. An easy to read and understandable book that is as light as cotton candy. I actually think the movie was better. Why do I read his books, for the same reason I eat junk food, it is easy to get, fast and not complicated. Sometimes you just need a little light reading to take the stress from the day and his books fit that bill."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am only half way through this book and this is by far one of John Grisham's best works. John Grisham is a wonderful author and can definetly paint a picture with his words. I have watched the movie also and even if you had not seen the movie you are able to make your own movie in your head with how well written this book is. If you have not read this book yet I recommend that you pick it up today."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This offering from Grisham is fun and fast with a good strong protagonist to root for. Don't read it first or second, the early books really need to be read first to really get the most out of this one (The Runaway Jury too). How Grishom writes with such ease is one of those mysteries that I wish I could solve. While this book has its hard looks at serious issues including spousal abuse, family hatreds, insurance scams, ambulance chasers and the rest, it really scores in the humor department, it's just a good fun book. But really, read at least two or three earlier works first it'll make this one so much better."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy bailer was fresh out of law school when he got his first big case. It was summer in Memphis, and the company he was just working laid him off due to a merger. To make matters worse, he just got evicted from his apartment and had no place to go.

So Rudy and another employee of the firm started an all new practice together. Although some of the first months are trying times, they stumble upon a very interesting bad faith insurance claim.

It has been praised by many newspapers, and fellow authors. It is the story of a young prosecutor, Rudy Baylor, fresh out of law school. After being fired from his first job, he is forced to live in the attic of one of his clients. After he stumbles upon a case that could make him f amous, he gets to work. A middle-age couple has been screwed over by an insurance company, who will not give them the money for a lifesaving operation for their son. Baylor is their lawyer, and he is up against some of the biggest names in law, including the ones that fired him.

Fat chance. In fact, John Grisham's Rainmaker has hit the bookstores like a storm. Since the Firm, no one thought another book would top it, but the Rainmaker was very successful in doing so. The book gives a setting of a typical Memphis and a young inexperienced lawyer that is faced with normal minor cases. However, as the book progresses, the adolescent lawyer is faced with a case that not only puts his job at risk but his life as well.John Grisham has, once again, brought the whole courtroom to life. He has captured his fans and other readers by constantly firing suspense into the story. Those that are big supporters of fiction books dealing with law will fall in love with this book after the first page. In addition, John Grisham has added a slight touch of humor to spice up the book.The characters in his novel are well developed. Although the characters are somewhat strange and unpredictable in their actions, they are rather entertaining, colorful, and ornamented. The characters all play in a part to create a fascinating and complex plot that will keep the readers up for hours.The plot is well structured with a solid base and an exciting climax. This young average lawyer with a basic life has found himself fighting against a whole professional corporate defense team in this simple insurance dispute. At least, he thought it was just a simple insurance dispute, but it had turn out to be the case of his life. He had found himself caught up in a middle of a storm filled with lies. The case had turned into a test that would cost the 100% attention and effort of the lawyer in order to overcome. If he fails, all he had to lose was his life. This book was definitely worth reading, and it should be considered a classic in the future."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Those who said this is one sloppy book must be morons"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I don't understand how people can actually like this book. Compared to Grisham's previous novels (such as The Firm, the Client, and A Time to Kill) this novel absolutely sucks. He takes no time in development in his characters. Rudy Baylor is an arrogant, self righteous lawyer who preaches about the woes of big corporations. It's not if he has any experience in the matter. He's fresh out of high school. His girlfriend Kelly is the sterotypical beat up woman who returns to her man again and again and almost gets herself killed. Why can't he return to the helpful and intelligent women such as Abby in the Firm? Or in the Client? Kelly has to depend on Rudy, who isn't a stable himself, to get her out of the mess she's gotten herself into. The Rainmaker lacks character, it lacks orginality, and it lacks thought. Spend more time on your novels John Grisham!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"It was true to the movie, which was wonderful. I highly reccommend the book and Amazon offered it at a much lower price than Barnes and Noble."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I really enjoy John Grisham books, I usually read them very quickly because I get so into them that I can't put them away. The Rainmaker easily fits this category. It really is quite entertaining and for the most part you will really like the well developed characters and story line.It has its flaws though. (FLAW #1) Grisham spends most of the first half of this book developing these characters (Birdie, Price and Bruiser) that you think are going to be really important to the ending but in the second half he just gets ride of them because, I believe, he couldn't figure out what to do with them. (FLAW #2) This is also one of the most unrealistic novels I have read in some time. Judge Kipler would never be allowed to be that biased towards Rudy (at least I hope not), Rudy would never been allowed by any sane person to have that case by himself and Kelly would never immediately fall in love with a man she's barely met especially when she's in a very abusive relationship.(Spoiler coming... be ware!!!!)(FLAW #3) The main thing that ticks me off with this book is the fact that they spend the whole entire book showing you how Great Benefits was a liar and a crook etc and how they are the most unethical company in the whole entire world. Thank goodness there is Rudy to defend the world against such immoral beats of the devil. Then at the end of the book Rudy kills Kelly's husband with a baseball bat and lets Kelly take the blame and while he is trying to get Kelly out of prison he lies to everyone so he can achieve his means. WHY IS IT A GREVIOUS SIN FOR GREAT BENEFIT TO LIE BUT OKAY FOR RUDY? WHY IS OKAY FOR RUDY TO MURDER SOMEONE DIRECTLY WITH A BASEBALL BAT BUT NOT OKAY FOR GREAT BENEFIT TO DENY A CLAIM THAT LED TO SOMEONE BEING KILLED. This is a drastic double standard and it really just left a very bad taste in my mouth.P.S. It's also amazing that someone is murdered and they don't even bother to look at the murder weapon and run some prints on it. They also dropped all the charges against Kelly and let the \\"murderer\\" out of prision and on her own in less than two days. Just totally unrealistic.EASY BOOK TO READ, ENJOYABLE FOR THE MOST PART BUT JUST TOTALLY UNREALISTIC AND WITH ANNOYING DOUBLE STANDARDS"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is my least favorite Grisham book. Aside from the underdeveloped plot, the characters are very flat. And, the story, especially the ending, is so completely far-fetched, it makes the endings of The Firm and The Pelican Brief seem plausible.I don't understand the hype this book receives, it certainly doesn't deserve it. Grisham knows how to keep the reader captivated, so it's disappointing to read something like this and know that he could have done a lot better."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Because the text to speech is disabled and I am blind this book is not available to me. I have purchased all of John Grisham book and it is very upsetting that because I now can use the kindle I can not purchase certain books because the author holds the right to enable or disable text to speech ."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I really enjoyed this bok, it's one of the best I have ever read. John Grisham erally captured the excitement of a larger corporaate lawsuit in this book. He goes into vast detail in the procedures that a real laywer would have to in that situation. Though the insurance fraud case was incredibly simple to win, it really added something special to the book, a real-life situation. It seemed real through the whole book, from beginning to end, from the last year of Rudy Baylor's law school to the hesitation in Dot Black to file the lawsuit against the Great Benefit Insurace Company. Grisham went a little overboard with Rudy's romance, that small portion of the book is the only part I found unrealistic. Although I couldn't relate to this book in any way, of course, I'm not in law school or a lawyer, I still found it a valuable piece because of it's representaion of this decade. He was able to capture the essence of multi-million dollar lawsuits and faulty mairrages in an excellent book. It is different from most boks today because of the complicate first person narrative. It's present tense setting also sets it apart from many books. With The Rainmaker, Grisham has dared to go where most autors are afraid to. I, at first was hesitant to pick up this book because I 've never read anything in the genre before, but after the first five pages, I was hooked."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is an intence story of a young man, Rudy Baylor, finishing his years of law school and is just about to take the bar exam. Whithin this time he takes on two cases, without a lisence, one is an elderly woman with her will while the other is a mother, Dot Black, and her son Donny Ray Black, who is dieing of luekemia and their insurance company, Great Benefit, will not allow them the money they need to give Donny Ray the proper medical treatment that he needs. As Rudy takes on this case he is met with a group of &quot;legal sharks&quot; led by a man named Leo F. Drummend. These lawyers have power, money, and experience non of which Rudy has. I liked this book because it had a mixture of comedy, romance, mytery, and suspence giving it my attention all the way through. I believe that any one looking for a good book with intelegence and a mixture of themes will love this book every time that they read it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I love the book because you get a feel for how a young lawyer has trouble getting past law school.

I mean, it is truly awesome! Grisham makes boring things sound so interesting and cool. Although I didn't like the ending, actually his other books have kinda sloppy endings too but other than that, I would recommend this book to everybody out there!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker has to be one of the best books I have read in recent times. The plot is a very simple and the characters are very believeable. The court room dramas are superb and there are enough twists and turns to surprise the reader to such an extent you will never have witnessed before. A very readable, engrossing and humourous book which I recommend to every one. The Rainmaker is a book quite uncharacteristic of Grisham which is a pleasant surprise. Rudy Baylor is one of the most likeable characters in recent fiction and you feel inclined to hate the Great Benefit insurance company for what it did. The story can also be thoroughly moving and the story flows quickly without a single dull moment. The ending is a tad nondescript, the only flaw I could find with the book.A TOP READ!!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read the Pelican Breif from Grisham, and this one tops it!

This one's another of his works, interesting but not informative, fast-paced yet predictable. The way Rudy Baylor does the job is not very impressive as the things are just happening for him, the smaller devil working with him is more interesting. The court scenes are really good, the usual grisham stuff is there too.

They are both wonderful books. The research makes it worth it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I think that Mr Grisham developes his main idea.

The courtroom scenes are the best-written in the book, but they unfortunately don't provide muchin the way of conflict -- the protagonist simply storms throughthe trial without a single hitch, and with quite a few thingsgoing his way purely through random luck. There is a romance --but it's badly developed, and the female half of it is a purestereotype, without a single distinguishing characteristic.

I could feel how important it was to him to help people, not take advantage of them for the quick buck. The minor characters are well-written also. Before The Chamber, my biggest complaint about Grisham novels was that, while they were long on drama and action, they were short in fleshing out the actors.

They involve the actual courtcase, which is fast moving with creative and surprising twists and turns. The problems develop when the author inserts multiple storylines that exist independently of the central case and, in the vast majority of them, are not resolved in the confines of the book. Case in point, Rudy's second boss is implicated in some underworld dealings. After focusing on these for several pages, they are never referred to again. In addition, his focus on a half-developed personal relationship between Rudy and a needy twenty-something is never explained and seems to exist for Hollywood's purposes only.

One day I was bored so I ransacked my bookshelf for books I haven't read (most often hand-me-downs from my brothers or books that caught my eye at a second hand book store), and The Pelican Brief caught my eye and I've been into John Grisham books ever since. Though I still view The Firm as Grisham's best book (that I've read anyway), The Rainmaker is definitely up there.When at a bookstore (second hand stores always have interesting books), I stumbled upon a copy of The Rainmaker, and for a bargain buck I start into it, reading whenever I could spare a minute. It's a very suspenseful, entertaining and yes, funny book. I could feel myself right there the entire way with Rudy. It seemed like when things finally got good, something bad happened.The book is written from the point of view of a young lawyer named Rudy Baylor. Required to give free legal advice to the elderly in a Senior Citizens home. In his first visit, Rudy meets a serious smoker named Dot Black with a son who was screwed over by an insurance company in a fatal way planning to sue, and a woman who claims to be worth millions by the name of Mrs. Birdie. Everything seems to be going alone well for a while with Rudy until his future job falls through and he is left jobless and in big trouble. Unable to pay his bills, he is soon evicted, and things seem to go downhill from there. Later on in a rather shady firm when scavenging the hospital for new \\"customers\\", Rudy meets a young lady who he instantly likes. After he researches a bit, he finds out her husband beats her. They meet in secret and things further progress. In the courtroom, things seem to look up for Rudy when the judge who seemed to favor his opponent croaks and is replaced by a guy who takes a shining to Rudy instead. Who knows what will happen with Rudy in the courtroom and out? Read The Rainmaker to find out...L.M."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is truly a fantastic book. I dont want to go thru the plot, coz to tell you the truth, this book is less abt a plot, its about humourous narative power unleased by Mr grisham, that will keep you in splits throughtout. Some may think me to be nuts, but really the court room thriller is just a canvas on which I think Mr Grisham wanted to try his hand at humour. And it comes of beautifully.you dont want to read this book,* If you dont like first person perpective in present tense.* If you want 50 % dialogues which get you through big fat fiction books in one evening.(This book is purely narrative power, only abt 10 % in dailogue).*If you dont like books where there is no shift in perspective. This book is completely through the eyes and ears of Rudy Baylor the main protagonist page 1 to page last.*You are looking for big conspiracies and huge climatic endings like the firm.*You really dont have a sense of humour and infact hate laughing,smirking,smiling,giggling while reading.(I did all of these while reading)For everyone else this book is a joyHumour highlights*The mulch planting section with Miss Birdie.*The U section in the courtroom (this is the cream)*Rudy's odd shaped colleague, Deck always waiting for tragedies and disasters so they can make some money representing them for insurance claims. I coud not believe this, lawyers actually waiting in hospital cafeterials wishing and hoiping for bandaged and mummied up patients to be taken up as cleints. The better the car accident the more the claim.*Dont miss this ..The stupid letter as the bomb in the courtroom scene.*The pretentious Mr Drummond episodes from the &quot;Trent and Brent&quot; firm with his collection of 4 other pretentious souls like him who all the time keep scribbling on their legal pads god knows what and bill at obscene hourly rates.Lots lots more.. just read itPS:Also dont read this in crowded places..people will take you for some dumb guy who keeps breaking into sudden smiles and chuckles."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"WHAT A GREAT BOOK I LOVED IT.

You really get into the characters and the story is great! I hold back 1 star because the firm and a time to kill were a little better."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I found this novel by John Grisham very entertaining. I had a hard time putting it down until I was done reading it. It kept me guessing about what was going to happen next and I would often guess wrong Also having never read a book about lawyers before I learned a lot of new things that I would have never known out otherwise. If you like stories about underdogs you will truely love this book. Rudy is a true underdog in this story. He is a just starting out lawyer whose first case is fighting a huge insurance company for 10 million dollars. Not your typical first day on the job. This book moves at a fast pace and my only complaint is that sometimes its hard to keep up. But overall go get this book and it will not dissapoint."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"In his first courtroom thriller since A Time To Kill, John Grisham tells the story of a young man barely out of law school who finds himself taking on one of the most powerful, corrupt, and ruthless companies in America and exposing a complex, multibillion dollar insurance scam.In his final semester of law school Rudy Baylor is required to provide free legal advice to a group of senior citizens, and it is there that he meets his first clients, Dot and Buddy Black. Their son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, and their insurance company has flatly refused to pay for his medical treatments. While Rudy is at first skeptical, he soon realizes that the Blacks really have been shockingly mistreated by the huge company,and that he just may have stumbled upon one of the largest insurance frauds anyone's ever seen, and one of the most lucrative and important cases in the history of civil litigation. The problem is, Rudy's flat broke, has no job, hasn't even passed the bar, and is about to go head - to head with one of the best defense attorney's and powerful industries in America."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I highly recommend \\"The Rainmaker\\" by John Grisham. It is an extremely entertaining book - one of his very best.This novel is interesting for the fact that it is written in the first person point of view, an unusual choice, particularly for Grisham, but it works wonderfully. He uses this to great advantage to show what the main character is thinking, and the result is frequently humorous. It works so well, in fact, I wonder why it isn't done more often, instead of the usual third person point of view.Add suspense, strong characters, legal intrigue, clean crisp writing, and humor and you have all the ingredients for a great read! I applaud John Grisham. He is truly one of our finest novelists."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"\\"The Rainmaker\\" is a modern-day \\"David vs. Goliath\\" story in which the reader can't help but cheer for David - Rudy Baylor, about to graduate from a nondescript law school with neither job nor money.Rudy accidentally attains two multi-million dollar cases within minutes of each other while staffing a free clinic as part of his coursework. The first involves a somewhat batty elderly widow who wants to revise her will to cut out relatives who have paid her no attention, and the second is a lawsuit against a major health insurer for failing to cover a bone marrow transplant that might have saved a young man's life.Despite being double-crossed by a legal firm that promises Rudy a paralegal job in return for his lawsuit case (Rudy is let go before being put on the payroll). facing a judge biased towards insurance companies (dies, is replaced by another biased against them), facing a five-man legal team from a top law firm with no experience of his own, being temporarily distracted by potential arson and murder charges stemming from his first \\"employer's\\" office burning down, support staff consisting solely of \\"paralawyer\\" assistant who has given up trying to pass the bar after failing six times, and a defendant that withholds information and lies, Rudy manages to take a serious case of insurance company abuse and win a $50 million punitive award, with the part-time help of a former law school professor and a couple of other private attorneys after the same firm. The \\"bad news\\" is that the company almost immediately declares bankruptcy, and its president is arrested for looting its assets.As for the \\"rich\\" widow, Rudy's assistant finds out that the fortune's almost entirely non-existent - so no money there either. The good news, however, is that her relatives are temporarily fooled, and Miss Birdie temporarily receives all the attention she ever wanted.One more loose string - early in \\"The Rainmaker\\" we learn Rudy has lost his law-school girlfriend to her former beau (higher-class); fortunately, he wins his new love at the end - after getting her out of an unhappy marriage and a manslaughter charge vs. her abusive husband.Outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor is about to graduate from law school in Memphis. It's been tough but he's finally there, and he has a great job lined up with a respected local firm. One of his last classes is legal issues for the aged and infirm, and part of it involves giving free legal help. It is here that he meets Dot Black, who has a medical insurance policy covering her family. Her son, Donny Ray, was diagnosed with leukemia, but the company has refused to cover a bone marrow transplant. Things appear to favor the Blacks, and Rudy has his first client. And it's a good thing because due to a merger he suddenly finds he no longer has the great job he'd been promised, and ends up working for the sleaziest lawyer in town with a bunch of ambulance chasers. He's broke and it just gets tougher from there.A very exciting story and full of legal drama. Plus, being told from Rudy's perspective allows for a very funny sense of sarcasm to come across. A number of side stories keep it from becoming boring, and keep you guessing what's coming next, even though not everything is tied up all neat and tidy. And there was a twist at the end that I found especially interesting, but still very satisfying (my book had about 15 blank pages at the end so it kinda fooled me into thinking the end wasn't as near as it really was)."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I love books that attack the insurance industry, corrupt lawyers and judges but the ending was entirely too similar to some of his other books. An easy read if you have be confined in a plane or car."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I was mildly dissapointed by this book. I was expecting something suspensful, a thriller, at least something that kept your interest. The meandering storyline was bland at best, with very actual storyline. The only half-way interesting part was in the last three chapters. Everything else in the book is basically just a day in the life of a unsuccessful lawyer. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who's looking for a thriller."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I love John Grisham's work without exception, although I find that each work has it's perks and different aspects. As one reviewer (of many I'm sure!) already pointed out is this book is very emotionally charged. While this book lacked any thriller aspect found in say \\"The Partner,\\" an aspect that made you not want to put it down, it was still a solid piece of Grisham work. This book was written in the first character, and for the first time in my experience with Grisham's work there was an element of sexuality. Have no fear, the book was not rittled with steamy sex scenes, but the characters merely came across as more human for the lust they were feeling and occasionally, at times, were not entirely concerned with the court cases at hand."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"In reading most of the reviews for this book I see that most of the other readers have a habit of comparing John Grisham books. I think that's a little unfair to each of the books individually. I've only read two other Grisham books and I will not do that here.The Rainmaker is a very good book. I have only recently begun to read fiction and this book kept me involved. If you know me personally, you know that most books I start I don't finish. I usually read about 10 to 20 per cent of the book and then shelve it. (Why I do this, I don't know. Short attention span, maybe?) This one I finished. And within about three weeks. I'll admit it seemed a little slow in the beginning. Rudy, the main charactor had a lot of different stuff going on. I wasn't sure where it was all leading. The pace really picked up though. I read the last half of the book in about 4 days.If you just want an entertaining book that deals with the law, I definitely recommend the Rainmaker."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I loved every minute of this book except the ending. The main body is filled with wit and excitement as we follow Rudy in his attempts to find a job and try his first case. At this point Grisham presents the reader with a half baked , totally unbelievable mini drama, the outcome of which made me dislike a previously likeable character. Rudy, who detests the unethical practices of those around him, lets the reader down. The final chapters give the impression that the author wants to finish up quickly, but instead of saying &quot;and they all lived happily ever after&quot;, he writes &quot; and they all commited some serious crimes, flew to the moon and lived there happily ever after&quot;. You'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham, a former lawyer, tried to show to his readers that he looks for the truth. The truth which is impossible to find in these days. Days of money and lies. Nobody likes to give money away, but nobody likes to die neither. Between a sick poor guy and a large insurance company there is one thing - money. Money for life. This story impies that the insurance is not always the best thing. There are so many people out there who try to get your money and to give nothing back. They just want to rob you and nothing else. And somebody has to fix all this unfairness. Grisham is not able to do that by himslef, his job is to show the truth about this world, and how many unclear deals there are behind these big companies. Grisham took the first step. Who will be next?"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This book was great, right up until the end. I don't know what it is with Grisham but his endings are often a little lame. Moreover I was not too impressed with Rudy Baylor as a character. I didn't like the way he looked down his nose at his paralegal. He was too derisive of what was after all quite a likeable guy. This weakened Baylor's appeal. In fact the failed barrister tended to upstage Baylor in terms of the paralegal's greater resourcefulness and practical business sense. It isn't all about educational prowess. People count more than degrees in my book. This is why I think the plot ran out of steam. Baylor was a brilliant court room attorney but he failed to win as a man. Having said all this, I personally could not put down until I had read every word. It was, aside from anything else, yet another excellent Grisham study in all things legal, and, more especially in this case, the hard reality of legal practice in and out of court. Grisham has a great sense of humour and an elegant style. This should be mandatory reading for all law students."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Another great book by Grisham.

So why then the four star rating? Simply because this book just didn't need a large amount of suspense, it succeeds far better as a drama.One of my biggest &quot;Grisham Gripes&quot; is the manner in which his style turns everything human and emotional into simply words, conveying little feeling what-so-ever. You have to employ a lot of imagination to get around his lack for detail and a lot of patience to get through his books.The Rainmaker is no exception to those gripes, however it does have a different appeal to it. Its somewhat riveting to see a giant corporation get whats coming to it (although I will always agree the Movie, for once, was better then the book).A young law student with dreams of fame and opening his own lawfirm winds up with a major lawsuit against an insurance company. It couldn't have been more simple, Grisham repeats a formula of this nature seemingly everytime, substituting insurance agency for whatever subject matter may be necessary. The Rainmaker having proved the only successful attempt for Grisham at writing a book worth the money it cost to buy it when you could have simply seen the movie."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"What a great novel, literally one I found to put down.

Grisham's writing is superb and often times hilarious(the actual trial is a riot). It's one of many excellent John Grisham books."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. The outcome, of course, is fully predictable (after the hint that Memphis is stingy with its punitive damages awards I kinda expected a multimillion $ award), but the ease, the finesse of Grisham's plot and the story left me captive in the fictive dream until I finished the book in the morning in one marathon setting. Grisham is an amazing story-teller. I can't believe a story about a bad faith insurance case, wife abuse, and family problems of a little old lady can enchant me in such a way. I am sure Grisham can tell a story of a lawyer going to the petting zoo and make it a bestseller. Deck, Miss Birdie, Bruiser and others were exceptionally vivid characters, if somewhat one-dimensional. Rudy was actually my least favorite. Sugary nice guy, whose personality doesn't get a grain of salt even after he works for a thug lawyer and a gangster. Overall, simple but high-profile story, interesting cast, and amazing, AMAZING storytelling."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Not thatthe movie wan't good, but after reading the book it does not hold a candel! The book was amazing and emotional! I felt that I was right along side Rudy and there were so many things going on in his life that it was shockingly similar to the way we all actually live! The problem with the movie is that it was too short. They didn't have time to touch onthe major issues of the book, and charecters that were pertinant to the book were taken out of the movie. If you are interested in being emotionally involved in a book, read this, but please.... don't see the movie!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Title: The Rainmaker Author: John Grisham #of pages: 598 Publisher: Dell Publishing Inc. Price: $7.99(paper) Reviewed By: Katie GordonThe Rainmaker is an awesome book, of course written by an excellent author. Although I have not read many of John Grisham's novels, I belive that he really knows how to capture a readers interest. He is very creative at writing books about lawyers and lawsuits. To me when I first picked up this book, I thought it would be very dull and boring because it delt with lawsuits. I came to find out that it was very powerful and entertaining. The book is based on a young man's life named Rudy Baylor. He had just gotten out of law school and was trying to make his way in being a lawyer. What makes this story so great is that Rudy isn't just a typical lawyer that want's money. He actually is interested in his cases and takes them to the fullest. One case could even change his life forever. Will it? Read this book I am sure you will figure it out, along with many triumphs and hard times Rudy goes through.I would difinitely recommand this book to anyone that loves lawsuits from the ages of 15 and above. I would also recommand this book to anyone that doesn't like lawsuits because it will take you on an adventure you have never been before. It will definitely get your attention and you will always have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is the first time that I have ever read a John Grisham book. Ironically enough, the first review I ever saw came from the Amazon website. I found the first third of the book, showing Rudy Baylor's experiences in Law School to be slightly tedious. I felt that it was important for Grisham to set up Rudy's background, but felt that he should've spent less time upon it - perhaps a fourth of the book.However, the other three-quarters of the book I throroughly enjoyed. Grisham seems to have the uncanny ability to make courtrooms and trials seem dramatic and exciting. It is a technique that he uses to great effect in this novel, and it is for this reason that I could not put the book down.The characters were adequately created. I felt that Kelly Riker didn't get enough attention, my reasoning being that if she were to be the love interest she deserved more attention.Francis Ford Coppola has made a movie based on the novel. It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor, and Claire Danes as Kelly Riker. I only hope that the film can do the storyline of this book justice.Overall, I took two marks off because I thought one-third of the book could have been shortened, and another one mark off because I thought Kelly Riker deserved more time."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"&quot;The Firm&quot; still remains John Grisham's best novel, but &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; is his funniest. I have never read a book that better managed to hit my funny bone straight on without tipping over the edge into farce (i.e., John Irving). This time around Grisham's hero is Rudy Baylor, in his final semester of law school and required by one of his professors to provide free legal advice at a Senior Citizens home. There he meets Miss Birdie, an old lady who apparently has millions of dollars salted away and who definitely needs a new will, and Dot Black, who's son Donny Ray is dying of leukemia while their insurance company refuses to pay for medical treatment. In the legal world a &quot;rainmaker&quot; is someone who brings in big clients (i.e., big money) to a law firm. When Rudy's future job suddenly disappears in the wake of a surprise merger, these cases might be his ticket to a promising legal career.The villains are lawyers from a giant firm and a heartless insurance company, which is certainly stacking the deck but part of the fun. As with &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; there is a bit of misdirection at the beginning in terms of getting a read on the main character. Rudy is broke and has some shady friends in the legal profession, but the bottom line is he is a good guy and he will do the right thing. Even if it means playing David against Goliath in a stacked courtroom where the presiding judge is best buds with the great Leo F. Drummond of the giant law firm Trent &amp; Brent, representing the Great Benefits Insurance Company. But then Rudy gets a break. The presiding judge suddenly drops dead and his replacement, Judge Kipler, is a plaintiff's dream. Better yet, Rudy has the truth on his side.The joy of this book is watching Rudy beat the bad guys. Every single lawyer's trick used by Drummond fails with Judge Kipler. Every dirty trick by the insurance company is exposed by Rudy, who comes up with some little twists of his own. Sure, all the rabbits getting pulled out of the hat is a bit excessive, but that is what makes this such a fun read. At the heart of this book is the quest for justice, but that does not mean we can not enjoy a little payback along the way. The romantic subplot between Rudy and Kelly comes across as something of a diversion from the main story, but at the end it gives the hero someone with whom he can ride off into the sunset. &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; is one of those books where you pick it up from time to time to read the good parts. If you saw the movie and enjoyed Rudy sticking it to the bad guys, then you should enjoy much more of the same in this novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"After 'A Time to Kill', and 'The Runaway Jury', 'The Rainmaker', is my third favourite John Grisham novel. These particular Grisham books all have one thing in common: courtroom drama.There's nothing I like better than a David and Goliath story and that's just what Grisham delivers in 'The Rainmaker', in which he pits Rudy Baylor, a lawyer fresh out of law school, against Great Benefit Insurance and its lawyer Leo Drummond in a bad-faith claim lawsuit. What really made this book is the Black vs. Great Benefit case, and how an insurance company would bend over backwards to not get caught in its own lies.Prior to the court case, the book goes into some detail about the life of Rudy Baylor, law student, and his struggles to get himself through school and into the labour market. However, this insight isn't really necessary and the book could've easily lost 50 pages without the reader noticing a difference.The movie 'The Rainmaker', with Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor and Danny DeVito as Deck and John Voight as Leo Drummond, does an excellent condensed version of the book. It's time well spent on either reading the book or watching the movie."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I think I understand some of the enthusiasm for The Rainmaker; I too found that I wanted to keep reading, that the plot was energetic enough to push me through the pages. When I read overall praise of the book, however, I'm baffled. It was entertaining, but very flawed. I found the characters flat and dimensionless, and never even felt as if I had a sense of protagonist Rudy Baylor. He seemed a living stereotype-- the bright, well-meaning, down on his luck, little-guy lawyer, blue-collar background, who takes on &quot;the man&quot; in one of his many incarnations: an enormous white-collar corporate conspiracy. Satisfying, but hardly original. There was no greater depth to either Rudy's character or the conflict; both were kept on a simple, surficial level, one most conducive to a fast-paced plot.Indeed, most of the characters were slightly embellished stereotypes, were vehicles for plot and never real people. Rudy's bosses were the heart-of-gold petty criminals; the opposing lawyers were Ivy League money-grubbers, etc., etc. The girl, Kelly, came off the worst. I found sitting through the patronizing relationship between Kelly and Rudy sickening-- Grisham and feminism ought to be on bad terms after this book. She was a battered woman whom Rudy set out to rescue, but she was never given any autonomy or a character of her own. She was only an idea, a helplessness embodied, a vehicle by which we were meant to see Rudy's chivalry and good-heartedness. The scenes of him dispensing advice to her, with a total disrespect for the person she might have been, the way she coped with her situation (which was of course far out of his understanding), were wretched. But, like any good cardboard cut-out, she obediently fell in love with him and seemed grateful for his condescension.The book was, as I said, satisfying, amusing, but too easy. Grisham took the easy way out at every step. We never had to think about sympathizing with the bad guys; we never had to contemplate the ethical dilemmas before us, because the 'right' answer was always clear. We didn't have to struggle through the inner conflicts of the characters because there weren't any such conflicts and there were barely any characters. If you're home sick, The Rainmaker is a fine choice. But for substance look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I often wonder; if Grisham can write this well, why aren't the rest of his novels anywhere near as good as this one? Is it laziness? Or was he finally writing about something he cared about?Of the two, my guess would be the latter. One of the things I am struck by when I read the Rainmaker (and I have done so quite a few times, much to my own amazement) is the emotional content. Grisham has always been about plot more than character, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Every person in this book hits exactly the right notes to become real.The main character, Rudy Baylor, starts out as a third-year law student who just wants to do his job, collect a paycheck, and retire as soon as possible. But along the way he is formed into a kind of crusading knight by his first client; Donny Ray Black, a young man dying of leukemia. He should be covered by an insurance policy, but the insurance company won't pay up. Rudy takes it upon himself, not to save Donny Ray, but simply to see justice done.Another thing I was struck by was the lack of thriller elements. There is no surprise ending, there is no cheap gimmicks. Grisham does not clutter his story with the usual questions of \\"will they win the case/championship/battle.\\" Nobody's life is seriously in danger (except Donny Ray, and it's made pretty clear at the beginning that it's already too late for him). Instead, Grisham turns his attention to insurance companies in an expose not unlike Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", about the Chicago meatpacking industry in 1906. We learn about murky accounting practices, cold-blooded corparate decisions designed to swindle people out of the smallest amounts of money, and a company who is willing to hide documents and buy off or fire their own employees in order to allay the firestorm they know is coming.I don't suppose that sounds familiar to anyone, does it?Grisham has written a remarkable, powerful, absorbing, educating novel. If only the rest of his work was up to snuff."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"After The Firm, John Grisham stumbled through low quality efforts The Pelican Brief, The Client &amp; The Chamber. He got away from crisp writing and strong character studies of his first two books and threatened to lapse into hackdom. On The Rainmaker, he gets back to those original traits. Rudy Baylor is a young lawyer who looses his job with a promising firm and has no other prospects. He worked at a bar where shady characters frequented and the owner who likes him hooks him up with a small law firm. It is a less than scrupulous firm, with an ambulance chasing attitude. Rudy is schooled in the art of hanging around hospitals from Deck, a squirrelly little guy. In the meantime he moves into an apartment over the garage of a lonely old widow, Miss Birdie. He tends to her yard and starts working with her on her will. He also gets a case for a young man whose dying and his health insurance company refuses to pay for his medical treatments. While hanging around the hospital, he meets Kelly, who turns out to be a victim of spousal abuse. He gets involved with her while working on his cases. The case against the insurance company is a classic David vs. Goliath scenario. Mr. Grisham expertly weaves all these plot lines together and keeps the pages turning with bright, vivid and entertaining writing. The Rainmaker is the best book of his career."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor has nothing. He delivered pizzas and waited tables to get through college and law school. He passed the bar, and got his licence - and one interesting case in a throwaway class in his last year at law school.Circumstances force him into ambulance chasing with a man who never passed the bar. But Rudy's one case is legal dynamite. His clients were the victims of a bad-faith case that is textbook. He has the dirt, and has the witnesses that has the dirt. He has a favorable judge. He is even smart enough to know how to turn the defendent's high priced lawyers into unwitting shills for his case.Maybe being a rookie with nothing to lose worked in his favor. He had no money, no professional reputation, or anything else to lose. The trial scenes are amazing. The green kid, the rookie, absolutely humilates the defendants, as well as the best legal defense money can buy. Trust me, they wre rueing the day that he was ever born.Yeah, Grisham rigged the facts, the evidence, and everything to favor the rookie... in short a case any trial lawyer would love, combined with the favorable judge. It's still fun. I have to say though, if Grisham could rig the trial in Baylor's favor, he could rig the outcome. Maybe the point is that his client got the justice she deserved, I have to feel her lawyer should have walked away from it all with the money. Still, he got the girl - and maybe that was enough. Along with the knowledge he quit being on top."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is probably one of John Grisham's most entertaining books. The pages will turn faster than lawyers can scribble on legal pads in this one, the story of young lawyer Rudy Baylor. An interesting look at the world of law, what young lawyers must go through, and what they must overcome to be successful. With Baylor, Grisham's takes us on a joyride of constant up and downs. And a classic battle of David Vs. Goliath emerges when the to say the least &quot;green&quot; Baylor, barely out of law school, takes on Insurance Godzilla Great Benefit. Baylor is interesting as the lead character, but more interesting are the supporting characters. Deck, Rudy's &quot;Paralawyer&quot;, Kelly Rifer, Rudy's new found love, and my favorite character, Leo Drummond, the notorious &quot;in charge&quot; Lawyer for Great Benefit. The Rainmaker is a bit predictable (the verdict that is) and after things are hard at first in the trial for Baylor, things get a little bit too easy. The insurance lawyers fold a little too easily. I believe in real life, Baylor would have had quite a bit more problems on his hands. I liked The Rainmaker the film, perhaps even better than the novel, because things were more difficult in the courtroom for Rudy. Jon Voight is also outstanding as the part of Leo Drummond in the film. I additionally felt the novel was about 40 pages too long and should have ended differently. Yet The Rainmaker, besides a few complaints, is an absorbing, page turning read in which you'll find yourself reading the last page of a lot sooner than you thought you would."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I must say I enjoyed reading John Grisham's novel, The Rainmaker. Of all the Grisham novels I have had the pleasure of reading, it is my favorite. He does an excellent job of portraying the lowly everyday working man who never loses sight of his dream despite obstacles.The protagonist, Rudy Baylor, is a poor rookie lawyer who seems to always get shafted. Grisham presents many subplots to keep his reader guessing as to which direction the novel will go. The beginning reminds me of a soap opera, in that it bounces from scene to scene leaving loose ends full of suspense.While participating in a class project, Rudy happens upon a woman whose child was diagnosed with leukemia. Their insurance company refuses to cover the cost of a bone marrow transplant that would save the boy's life. As a law student, Rudy is instructed to develop their case. Additionally, Grisham has Rudy involved in a case dealing with a widow, Ms. Birdie, who presumes that her estate is worth millions. Acting on that presumption, she has Rudy disinherit her children in her will due to their lack of interst and care for her. Once Grisham reveals that Ms. Birdie does not have the money that she claims, it becomes obvious that the case against Great Benefit Insurance Company will be the focus of the novel. Much like other Grisham novels, the story begins to get predictable. The pace and excitement slows to a near halt.At this point, the novel changes direction from suspense to drama, though it continues to be equally enjoyable. After Rudy overcomes many obstacles throughout the novel, Grisham develops a character who triumphs over a corporate giant through a string of lucky breaks.Grisham succeeds in having the reader become a part of this masterpiece. I felt as though I was experiencing, first-hand, what Rudy was going through. It is truly a work of art that I recommend for reading."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"&quot;The Rainmaker&quot; is one of Grisham's better novels (&quot;The Firm&quot; still remains my favorite by Grisham). It is the story of a young law student-then lawyer who is trying to make it in the legal profession; specifically, in the world of small-time civil litigation. Young Rudy Baylor lucks into a fairly big-time case, and the fun begins.Grisham gives us a cynical, funny, and mostly authentic look at the law. Oh, there are a few flaws. I doubt many judges would ever favor one side as much as the judge did in this novel, although I suppose such things happen (I've seen it once.) But overall, Grisham gives the reader a more or less accurate look at the world of civil litigation. This give the novel a gritty sense of realism that carries the reader through what is mostly an excellent read. There are some hilarious pieces to the story--I love that &quot;paralawyer&quot; guy. And Grisham's cynical portrayal of big firm lawyers hits the mark. This is a very funny book.One of Grisham's better ones. By the way, the novel is quite a bit better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Ok, granted I haven't read a ton of Grisham. But I have read a good amount and this is by far the best I've read from him. I tore through it in about 2 days.The basic plot was enough to keep me interested. The sub-plots only made things that much more interesting. The love story isn't overdone and fits nicely. I also love the way Grisham makes no apologies for Rudy's seemingly unrealistic good fortune. He's a likable kid who knows he isn't really worthy of being in the situation he's in. Things have fallen into place for him and he knows it. This story line could cause the reader to throw the book down screaming, \\"Oh come on!\\" But Grisham makes sure this isn't the case.The courtroom drama itself plays out in such a way that it never becomes boring. One thing I don't like about some authors is that they often seem to think their reader is fascinated with the same technical details they are (e.g. Clancy and his endless descriptions of ships and guns and such). Grishman interjects enough technical explanations of the legal system to explain things and keep it interesting. He never once goes too far. Through the 500+ pages of this book, I never once put it down because I was growing bored of it.As a disclaimer, I haven't seen the movie. I suspect the book is much better, but if you have seen it and already know what's coming next, it may ruin the book for you."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Started a little slow but it picked up speed as it went on. Like I find all of Grisham's books, it's less like reading and more like watching a movie or sitting in a corner while watching the action unfold. I think it would be boring to note a book's technical merits as one reads. I read for the entertainment factor and this book hit the mark."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Somehow John Grisham can make insurance claims and legalese interesting. Two of the cringe inducing most boring topics I can think of and Grisham is able to keep me enthralled page after page. Every character in this tale of corporate injustice is easy to see in the mind's eye. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I've read almost all of Grisham's books and through the years I've always considered The Rainmaker his best work. I chuckled numerous times, which, to me, is a demonstration of good writing if it can get me to laugh. The protagonist was likeable and all the backstories did not detract from the main theme of David vs. Goliath in Lawyerdom. Overall a very satisfying book, more than I can say for some of his novels. Kudos to The Rainmaker!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Gresham is at his best in this colorful tale of a young lawyer on the run from bill collectors, struggling to find a job out of law school and falling into the case that will make or break his career.This is the only Gresham book that is written in the first person, and Gresham does a marvelous job in reflecting the protagonist's thoughts and emotions as he interacts with a variety of characters, from good-old-boy lawyers and their crony judges to the uneducated poor who are fodder for corporate rip-off artists to the various parasitical characters that live off of the legal system in some form or fashion. With a variety of sub-plots, the reader is not really sure which one will take center stage... and that is one of the beauties of this novel in that it reflects life's vagaries.I was only lukewarm to Gresham's writing, until I read this book. If you're a Gresham fan, then read it. If you're not a Gresham fan, this book will change your mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This novel, like The Firm, is perfect vacation reading. Grisham is a quality writer who knows how to tell a story.

Had watched the movie on TV, unfortunately it was so long and full of commercials, I fell asleep, so I needed to see how the story ended. Excellent book, in great condition and arrived in a timely manner."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"We all know that to make a good joke, you've got to exaggerate the right elements while ignoring what isn't funny. John Grisham creates a slapstick winner with a book about a bumbling young lawyer who isn't going to Wall Street . . . in fact, he has to declare bankruptcy before he passes the bar exam.But don't confuse this book with a humorous book about the law. This novel would have to be toned down by about 60 degrees before that would be possible. This is a comic book version of a funny story about \\"what if\\" a law student didn't have a job, any money, or any connections after three years of torts and briefs.Rudy Baylor is dragged by his professor to a meeting of senior citizens to give out free advice. He meets the meeting's hostess who wants to change her will to favor a television evangelist with her millions. Rudy also meets the parents of a young man who will die from leukemia because the insurance company wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant.This all seems like a pleasant way to spend a few hours finishing a class until Rudy's promised job evaporates in a shotgun law firm merger. Now, he tries to trade off his leads into some cash and some work. The complications are unexpected, unrealistic, and slapstick funny. There's a sweetness to Rudy's character that you won't find in many real lawyers that makes the book work.I found myself wondering what pratfalls John Grisham would foist on poor Rudy next. That was a major part of the attraction of the story.If you hate lawyers and insurance companies, you'll find nothing to discourage either view in this jaundiced critique of the legal profession.But you'll have some smiles and chuckles along the way, neither of which would happen if there were any real lawyers around."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Plenty of plot reviews about this book -it's Grisham, so I won't go any further to describe it. The plot was thin, IMO, hardly much struggle (conflict), with not much of a climax. But it read so, so well! I was completely entertained on every page. I wanted to know what would happen next, and I can't even explain why. I just know I liked it!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I've read this book four times. It hits on some of the most important questions regarding our legal system, the insurance industry and the irony of most business dealings. Most people rarely mention Grisham's very dry humor. I laughed out loud at many of his characterizations and foolishness our our current legal system. Coppola's movie was okay, but can't compare to this novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am actually surprised a Grisham book is going to make my Top 5 list of all time favorites. Oh, but it is. This was a fantastic book. The characters and plot were so well developed, it was really tough putting this book down. The story is typical Grisham. A young lawyer graduates from Memphis State. He has no money and no job. In order to make ends meet, he is forced to work for the sleaziest lawyer in town. But he takes with him a case against an insurance company that, if he gets lucky, could mean millions in punitive damages. His luck is not in his favor when the sleazy lawyer disappears and leaves Rudy and a paralegal named Deck, to start up an office of their own and take the case against one of the toughest law firms in Memphis. Grisham does the layman justice by explaining law in a way anyone can understand. I always take something away from a Grisham book. The action does not stop until the end of this one. And I have to say I was surprised but definitely satisfied with the ending. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This book was the most incredible book I have ever read!

I liked the abrasive Mr. Rudy Baylor, felt sympathy for his client whose son is dying of cancer, and though the ending was slightly unrealistic, I was glad that Rudy and his girlfriend were able be together in the end. Very suspenseful, gritty, humorous and poignant--all at the same time."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"You can step right into this book and drift away.

Patrick from The Partner, Darby from Pelican Brief, Mitch McDere from The Firm: these are the characters whom I've played novel after novel, ducking into malls, avoiding tails by the FBI or the Mafia, battling grueling trials and struggling to pass the bar ... these guys add adventure and realistic obstacles to an otherwise boring and banal reality, pre- professional school! And now Rudy Baylor! This kid introduces the element of revenge for a society against him, and plays it off beautifully with the hint that we can make it even without the proverbial lucky break!The book is awesome! It winds itself up for the pitch with the introduction of a world packed with competition and lack of sympathy for those crushed under the heel of capitalism, i.e. said graduate of Memphis State Law School, our friend Rudy! Then he meets the people who will be the unknowing stepping stone out of hardship, and into a pot of respect so profound it'll disorient the young rookie! He plays hard, and we're right there with him as his whoops the menacing opposition, and moves to win a deadly game of &quot;who's better?&quot; It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, I guarantee it! John Grisham has lit the fuse of another terrific legal dynamite! Awesome!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This novel is impressive for its realistic depiction of the law school experience. Although the plot does not devote much attention to Rudy Baylor's struggle financially and socially through law school, it nevertheless, strikes a familiar chord with anyone who has been a law student. Many of ones classmates are arrogant and it seems that for some it is who they know as opposed to what they know that is more important to career advancement.As for the novel in general, it is remarkably accurate in its description of civil procedure (the various steps of advancing a legal action) and the legal arguments and strategies used by Baylor and the insurance company's counsel.Another aspect of the plot that kicks the teeth out of the conventional view of the practice of law is the fact that many firms pay their associates on a &quot;eat what you kill&quot; basis, which is the firm gives the junior lawyer a percentage on all legal fees generated by clients the junior lawyer manages to bring in the door of the firm. If you are a young lawyer this can be a very daunting task where age and maturity are sought by clients and youthfulness is ironically not attractive. Under this arrangement, a lawyer who cannot bring in clients may starve. There are a lot Bruiser Stones out there.Grisham is an experienced trial lawyer and the depth of his knowledge shines through in this work of fiction.A must read for anyone who enjoys legal thrillers which do not romanticize the legal profession."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"When you fight a legal battle, there is at least a few hurdles you have to overcome. Rudy Baylor didn't have any. A judge who would do anything to help him, a dead victim who left behind a moving video, helpful professors, and SUBSTANTIAL evidence...what else can a trial lawyer ask for? Although the plot has its share of suspense and drama, it's smeared with serendipity. Perhaps, Grisham could've done with a little more ingenuity in the plot. However, all this doesn't make the book boring. In fact, it lives upto Grisham's &quot;unputdownable&quot; standard."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Typical inexperienced kid goes up against the big corporation. That may be a negative comment; however, the getting there is what counts in this book. Even though you know what will happen in the end, the trials and tribulations of the main character are what counts here. Read it and enjoy, it is fairly fast paced and I found I was continually looking forward to the next chapter/sub-chapter."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The best Grisham book ever!

I felt as if I personally knew Rudy and became very concerned about his troubles. His inexperience as a lawyer and non-toxicated heart made the book hard to resist. I honestly didn't think lawyers could be like Rudy and Deck. They were both amazing in the book and the movie! This was actually a movie that didn't include or need any stupid, and annoying action scenes. Grisham, you did a good job on this one!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This was a very good book in my opinion. It didn't get 5 stars, but to me only few do. At some points, I couldn't out the book down, though it took around 50 pages to get into it (50 pages isn't a tenth of the book, as it is very long, but eventually that turns to be a good thing).

It isn't just that he was paranoid--they really were after him!Rudy was in his final year of law school in Memphis, Tennessee, a town overrun with lawyers, when the law firm that he intends to join is swallowed up, and he loses out. Not only that, but he is forced into bankruptcy, he loses his girlfriend and his apartment is burglarized.Is that all? No way! He digs up a promising insurance case, and so another slick law firm takes him on, tries to grab his case and dumps him. Then, his third employer, an underworld character, gets run out of town by the feds and he is again out of work.Then Rudy falls in love with a married woman whose husband likes to beat her up with a baseball bat and he rents an apartment from an old bat who wants him to work a 40 hour week on her yard, in addition to his other jobs.This guy has more hard luck than the guy who asked God, &quot;Why me, God?&quot; and the voice came down from heaven and said, &quot;I dunno, Smith, you just ( ) me off!&quot;Grisham has written a doozy of a book, here. It is pure entertainment. Because Grisham is himself a lawyer, of course, you get the real lowdown on what a trial lawyer thinks of his colleagues and his profession--and also, as icing on the cake, what he thinks of insurance companies, with which he has had vast experience in real life.As might be expected, his opinion on both subjects is probably shared by the bulk of Americans, which accounts for all the lawyer jokes and crooked insurance company stories.You should enjoy this one.

Not only does Rudy give up being a lawyer after such a short time of dealing with the real world, he thinks his new future might be as a history teacher. &quot;It shouldn't be hard to do. After all I have seven years of college.&quot; Being a history teacher myself, I am offended by Rudy's comment, and hope that it doesn't reflect John Grisham's own bias about teaching. Going to college for seven years, with a degree in law, does not make one a teacher. It takes years of specific training to be qualified to teach, and being a good teacher is much more than having a background as an attorney. Aren't teachers maligned enough in our country without a popular novelist contributing to the fallacy that teaching is a simplistic task, one that is far less stressful than being a lawyer in a major legal battle? Does that mean since I have seven years of college also, I can be a best-seller novelist?I would love to share these thoughts with Mr. Grisham, but have been unable to find an email address for him.

If you enjoy books about lawyers and their cases you will definitely enjoy any book written by Grisham. Grisham has a way of writing that really draws you to the stories being told. He has such good description of characters that you will feel you have known them forever.There is Rudy Baylor, a young lawyer who gets his first job and his first big case in the book. There is Rudy's associate, Prince. He is the man who will teach Rudy what real lawyers do. Then there is Kelly, she is a young innocent girl who is in the hospital for being beat by her husband Cliff, who is a rough cruel man. One of the most important characters in this story is Donny Ray Black. Donny Ray is a part of Rudy's first break through case, Black vs. Great Benefit. Donny Ray suffers from leukemia; he is in pain and hurt, he has lost trust, but hasn't lost hope in many things and is not afraid of death. His parents, the Blacks', are confused by the insurance company and wondering where or who they can turn to. Each character has a special quality about them, they make you love or hate them.The lessons that this book teaches all of us is that we are to never give up. Donny Ray fought for his life, Kelly fought for her freedom from her husband, and Rudy fought for his case.

Ir is not about a Lawyer who can do evertyting, comes from lawschool and earns a lot of money. No, this book is about a young man who has to fight for his rights and fight for his money. I have finished the book yet, but from now on, this book goes as a number 2 on my list. The Chamber is number 1, but this book can get him from that position if it goes on like this. Yeah, I like reading it. The last book I read was The Partner, but I found that one difficult. It was nice, but also very difficult to read. This book is even nicer and it is also much more easy to read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham has added another very readable story to his list. If he could get a better handle on the details and his apparent need for a bizarre ending he could be great. Throughout Rainmaker, Rudy was financially in trouble. During the trial funds were placed in escrow by the opposing attorney. If the insurance company principals skipped the country, why didn't he go pick up his money?John Grisham is obviously sick of being a lawyer, but do all of his characters have to give up the profession under extreme circumstances?Still in all, a great read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I liked the concept of this book, however, do not believe in the &quot;real&quot; world that any small time rooky attorney could win against the big time insurance companies!

Rudy has one problem other than finding a decent job: to win a battle with an insurance company that left one family devastated. The insurance company, The Great Benefit, denied coverage on a bone marrow transplant, which took away one's life. Rudy's boss, Bruiser Stone, is the owner of a low-paying law firm who helps Rudy with the case. Deck Shiffit also helps Rudy with the case, and even starts a business with him, behind Bruiser's back. The great Benefit insurance case could cost Rudy his life, or make him a very successful lawyer. This book has captured my interest because I was very interested in finding the verdict in the insurance case. I could relate too one of the characters, Rudy Balyor, because he acted how I would act and mistakes that I could see myself making. I was very anxious in finding how the plot unfolded, every turn of the page, the suspense to the case built up more and more. The book however lost my interest when it started to describe things to much about things, like &quot;the black phone rang seven times before I picked up.&quot; Lastly, I liked what the writer did, which was that he wrote alot about law facts and what rules you have to follow in court, all of which related to the real world."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker. I still haven't figured out what that word means yet, but the book was pretty cool. The style of writing was different, it was like everything was happening right while you were reading it. It was a good perspective because then you would know what Rudy was thinking and feeling throughout the book. The ending did dissapoint me though, when Rudy decided not to become a lawyer after all that he had been through. I think it was a stupid decision. I mean, he passed the bar exam on his first try and he won his very first case while he was still fresh out of law school. I think he would have made a fine lawyer. The only Grisham book I have ever dissed was The Pelican Brief (I reeeeeaaaallllly hated that book), but I will not diss this book. A Time To Kill still ranks up there as #1 on my list, but The Rainmaker just might become #3, with The Partner being #2. I do recommend this book to all you Grisham fans.

Mr Grisham is definitely one of the best storytellers I have read in recent years. That being said, the plot itself is very thin. It concerns a student lawyer who, by luck, is given access to an unloseable multimillion dollar case. Instead of passing it on to a qualified lawyer he hangs on to it until he qualifies it himself. Despite some set backs the end is never in doubt; he wins the case and gets the girl. The girl has no connection with the story, so I presume she was included to look pretty in the film.The story is full of potential subplots few of which are developed. Indeed, there is very little of anything which is developed, however, that is not a particular critisism. John Grisham's great ability is to hook you and keep you hooked. No matter where you stop in the book, you'll want to continue for 'just one more page' to see what happens next."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Story was boring, and everything was written in the present tense.

It was funny and an easy read. I loved Rudy and his para-lawyer partner. I would recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This 600-page monster of a novel grabs you from the very start and does not let go. Although I must admit that the beginning is slow, tracking the career progress of the hapless narrator, Rudy Baynor as he goes from one disaster to another. However Grisham manages the difficult task of keeping the reader emotionally invested for the first 250 pages or so of slow but steady buildup. Then once the central case of the novel begins in earnest around page 300, you are hooked and ready for the goodies, which are duly delivered as you read on.The first person narrative really makes the difference, making the story realistic and believable, and the main character is developed throughout the novel as he goes through various personal and professional trials in his turbulent career start as a lawyer. He struggles with his conscience and self-doubt (due in part to his low socio-economic status) in some of the cases that he tackles alongside his less consciencious yet sympathetic partner, and this really makes his character seem flesh-and-blood.The intricate details of court proceedings and legal manoueverings are fascinating, and would otherwise be unknown to someone like myself, who has not had much previous exposure. Also, central to the novel is the murky insurance business, which is portrayed as dirty and immoral. The author does hide his disgust and rage at the powerful corporations that take advantage of the simple folks. He uses \\"corporate thug\\" label several times throughout the novel.I like Grisham's style more and more with each novel I read. He has a way with words, and ability to describe feelings and places with quick, bold brushstrokes, without sacrificing depth. Sort of like gazing at an impressionist painting from a distance, it all fuses together into a cohesive, well composed whole.The ending is a bit of a letdown, but not impossible, if you think about it. Perhaps he rushed to complete the novel, and did not lay down all the possibilies in a complex situation.Overall impression - a truly fantastic, thought-provoking, multi-layered novel, one of his very best, head and shoulders above other mass-market novels."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"My first reading of a John Grisham novel although I have enjoyed several movies based on his novelsI must say this was very good and after the first 4 chapters which took me about 2 days to complete I found myself glued to the book and unable to put it downI will not get into the book itself but will only say I caught myself relating to the character and how in the blink of an eye your life can change and blink again and it changes againSo satisfied with this book I am now looking to read another"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor makes it out of law school and away from his girlfriend with pennies to spare. He soon finds himself representing clients beyond his experience. His landlady, Miss Birdie, needs help drafting a will to distribute her well-hidden fortune. A bruised and beautiful hospital patient needs help turning her husband into an ex-husband. And Donny Ray Black's parents watch him die of leukemia while the Great Benefit Insurance Company callously denies their claims for coverage of treatments that would save his life. They need a knight with a shining law degree.Rudy charges into battle for all of his clients. Hair uncombed, tie askew, and stray papers fluttering from his briefcase, Rudy is the very opposite of Leo Drummond, the immaculate lead counsel on Great Benefit's defense team. It's not hard to predict how such a David-and-Goliath contest will turn out in a Grisham novel. But there are a few surprises in how it happens.Grisham doesn't make Rudy face the enemy by himself. His chief ally is Deck Shifflet, a self-styled \\"paralawyer\\" who knows the case-winning maneuvers that Rudy would never dream of trying on his own. Their former boss, criminal lawyer Bruiser Stone, phones in his own advice from an undisclosed location. And Rudy's clients help him, and each other. The several subplots find each other as the story builds to its conclusion.Don't expect objectivity from this reviewer--this is far-and-away my favorite Grisham book. There are easy-to-like and easy-to-hate characters in threatening and interesting circumstances. There is a believable blend of suspense, comedy, and tragedy. Surprisingly, much of this translates well tothe movie version, too. But read the book before seeing the movie. If you don't enjoy it, you are just \\"...stupid, stupid, stupid.\\" (Sorry; I just couldn't resist. :^))"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I couldn't put it down, read it in two days.

I couldn't stop reading the portions that described the trial.On first reading, the first 100 pages bored me. But now that I am re-reading, I see the point and they are ok.The conclusion is bizarre and anticlimactic and seems silly, as though Grisham couldn't come up with a sensible end. The love intrigue is irrelevant to the case against the insurance company and is contrived.The story is marred by Grisham's tendency to use his story for his far-left activism. Here it is a campaign against big corporations (insurance, in this case) and abusive husbands.With good editing, condensation, and self-discipline, this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This was the first book I had ever read from Mr. Grisham.

This book has everything - action, drama, emotion, etc. Some bits are downright realistic and hilarious, with quirky details here and there. it was nice to read a book where the lawyer got quite a few breaks - a good judge, the Stupid Letter, etc. After seeing the hardships he had to go through - losing his job (and losing his employer later on), girlfriend, it was great to see. I could not stop reading this and felt impatient when I had to put it down for whatever reason. There was enough humor mixed with emotion to make the characters feel real - Bruiser, Birdie, and Deck were great characters. A great read - now I want to see the movie!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is my favorite book in Grishams series. i was hooked from page to page and never wanted to stop reading....Great book for anyone."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly; plowed through it in a week which is good for me. I thought the book was very funny at times, in fact at one point I started bursting out in laughter while taking the train home from downtown Chicago; I think a few people were looking at me, but I didn't care.I thought the judges bias against Great Benefit and Leo Drummond was a bit out of hand. It seemed as though old Leo couldn't say a word without Judge Kipley having some king of reprimand for him. I was not on the insurance company's side (Who could be?), but I thought this was a bit unrealistic.Also, after the trial was over there were about 20 pages left and I knew that this was going to be some kind of interesting ending with Kelly. Sure enough, Rudy kills her hubby in self defense and Kelly ends up taking the rap. The ending, however, is disappointing. I was expecting some kind of surprise at the end; not there. Rudy simply plots and strategizes and presto, Kelly is out of jail and they ride off into the sunset, literally drove off west.Overall, I loved the book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am surprised by all the glowing reviews. This was my first Grisham book and I expected more. Sure, he writes well and the reading is easy, but the plot left a lot to be desired. I never saw the movie, but if you have seen any TV show or movie involving lawyers then you know this book."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham has written three decent books (Firm, Time to Kill, and Pelican Brief) but the rest have been absolute unoriginal trash. His characters are so flatly drawn they give paper cuts to the reader. The plot is way too predictable. He needs to take more time between books, and actually use some creative thinking. I would have given this 0 stars, but wasn't given the option."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I've read a few Grisham novels and I have found them all to be entertaining (except Bleachers - Couldn't get on board with that one. In fact after Bleachers I stopped reading Grisham, thinking he had lost his touch).I saw \\"The Rainmaker\\" described as his best novel, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Bought it on Kindle. Glad I did, for I don't feel any great need to have it taking up space in my library.Don't misunderstand me, though. I did enjoy the book and I had no trouble getting through it. I just say that to say that it was pretty typical of Grisham. Fun but not a collector's item.Some reviews are disparaging the book saying that the characters are rather one dimensional and therefore, unbelievable as real people. To them, I say: If you want believable, don't read fiction.I thought the characters were developed well enough so that the reader wanted the main characters to fair well and the bad guys to be punished and this is where the story fell short for me.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!Rudy wins the case, but doesn't get paid. I guess we're supposed to feel sorry for Drummond because he and his crew get spanked in court by a biased judge (whom I LOVED!!!) and lose the case but in the end don't get paid by the faceless corporate insurance monster. Decker, the misfit with the heart of gold barely escapes with his life. The good guy gets the girl and they go off into the sunset.In the end we are left to assume that Decker made the drop without incident and is living high on the hog after his great pay off. Rudy and Kelly go make a life for themselves in suburbia. Rudy become a history teacher and Kelly goes to school and completes a bachelor's degree but in the end becomes the doting wife and mom and lives the rest of her days blissfully happy, loved by a good man who would never dream of raising a hand to her. I guess Cliff's brothers and red-neck friends stop trying to find them and give up the idea of trying to kill her once they drive into the sunset. Drummond goes on to continue being a high-powered attorney and a power house in the court room. Booker, bless his heart, becomes partner in a few years and his wife \`s social life is fulfilling and busy as she raises money for those in need and is of course the perfect lawyer's wife and they live happily ever after in a Victorian-style two-story house with 2 beautiful, college bound kids. Miss Birdie goes back home and lives the rest of her life alone I guess and never hears from her kids again. Buddy never gets out of bed and dies in his sleep one night and Mrs. Black (sorry, her name escapes me right now) smokes herself into emphysema. She eventually dies in agony but with the peace that she made those sumbitches pay!An easy story to read and certainly entertaining enough but the end fell off for me a little bit because we were left to make a LOT of assumptions about how everyone faired and I guess like to have everything neatly wrapped up at the end of a story. No loose ends. But that's OK. I'll still give it full marks because it did hit all my pleasure centers. For a soap-opera-type novel, it wasn't at all vulgar so I didn't have to compromise myself in anyway and what it was lacking in closure, I am more than capable to wrapping up in my own imagination.This is book is not going to change your life or expand your vocabulary and you won't be better for having read it but if you're doing any International flying for if you're laid up recovering from surgery, this is a fine book to keep you reasonably entertained."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am a Russian Woman. 5 years ago I came to USA with no English.

His characters might be stereotypes, but they were well done, fun, and had me chuckling. The theme is David vs. Goliath. The ending is happy with a bitter component. The evil, greedy, large corporation leaves a bad taste. The story took a while to get going which was fine. But the last third of the book had me on the edge of my seat, not wanting to put it down. Before reading it I didn't know if I was going to like reading about an insurance company trial. But I did. It was excellent.Most of my reading is romance novels, so for me to love something like this should say something about its broad appeal and entertainment value.If I could, I would change two things about the story. (1) The ending was happy, but it could have been happier. (2) Grisham never tells us who burned down a law firm early in the story. I was wondering if Great Benefit was behind it, but it was never explained.STORY BRIEF:Rudy just finished law school, is broke and cannot find a job.

I am one such person, and the trials and tribulations of Rudy Baylor have become very personal to me. This novel is sort of the Candid for those in my shoes. It shows our hardtimes (humiliating interviews, fruitless mass mailings of resumes, and trying to pay off law school loans) in a larger, more comical light. In fact, I would recommend The Rainmaker for anyone getting a little discouraged in their attempt to find a place in the world"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham is my favorite author, and of the six books that he has written, The Rainmaker has to be my favorite. It actually made me laugh out loud! The main character, Rudy, is very funny, but somewhat egotistic. Then again, that is a good quality for a lawyer. The hardships that he encounters throughout the book tend to be typical ones that the reader can identify with, such as being sued, filing for bankruptcy, and having no job and home. I immediately sympatized with Dot Black for her troubles, and was depressed for three hours when I got to the part where Donny Ray died. I must admit, though, when I read the synopsis of the book, I assumed that he would win the case, and that would be that. Man, was I wrong! Grisham shocked me by throwing a little romance in the mix. I felt sorry for Kelly and what she had to go through, even though she was a fictional character. All in all, I would recommend this book to Grisham fans or anyone who love to read about secrets, because this book has it in spades"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"During a 5-month trip through South America I picked up several Grisham books, and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; was one of them. Unlike most of Grishams other works, this story is more of a comedy than a page-turning, edge-of-the-seat- thriller, and a rather risky change from his otherwise tailor-made novels, but it works! The story is VERY funny, and I can't remember the last time I have laughed out loud so much while reading a book. Sometimes the humour is almost Dickensian, and that, I think, is somewhat of a compliment. It is also nice to see a change in the type of hero. Instead of the usual Mr. Perfect, Rudy is a somewhat unsucessful, insecure and average guy, and the character development is (as usual) admirable. The problems with his landlady make up some of the funniest parts of the book, and it is some of the funniest pages I've read in ages.There are no killers luring in the dark in this seemingly harmless story, but beware... you could just die laughing!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor-an excellent character!

It's addictive as hell. Rudy Baylor's character drew me in, probably because we've got some of the same issues: no silver-spoon, no Mercedes, no trophy girlfriend/wife, no cushy job waiting for him and creditors chomping at the bit (though I'm not as close to bankruptcy as Mr. Baylor). Everyone loves the underdog, and this book delivers a great underdog in the person of Rudy. In light of the strong main character, I liked the wry first-person narration. I kept turning pages in search of the next development in his relationship with Kelly and his battle of wills with Miss Birdy and her family. Developments there are few and far between, but I kept looking for my next &quot;fix&quot; anyway. The central plot concerning the family of the young man with leukemia fighting the insurance company has tremendous human interest value, but it coasts, especially given the magnitude of Rudy's obstacle, and in a sense disrupted the parts of the book I found more entertaining. We don't really know any of the other characters. That said, the ambulance-chasing Deck is one of the book's bright lights, and one of the grittier characters. I'd have rated this book higher if Grisham let the subplots flow and develop more fully, especially where the shadier characters (Prince and Bruiser Stone) are concerned, and if he had beefed up the central plot's danger quotient. The Rainmaker may not sate demanding intellectual or emotional appetites, but it didn't put me to sleep, either."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is probably my least favorite Grisham novel (though it's still pretty good - once you get used to &quot;Rudy's&quot; style of writing). The first time I read it, I was very dissappointed at the ending. I didn't feel that Rudy was a person that I could admire. It was a little better the second time around, but it still could be a lot better. The book gives some laughs, the &quot;Stupid Letter&quot; probably one of the best. I saw the movie recently, and I think that the book is better. Sorry, Coppola, but Grisham's better at it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is a book, every human kind should read. A book which should always stay under your hand, a book which should be read at different ages, so that different things can be learned, when you have different experiences. This is a book of punishment rather than suspense, mystery or thriller. I have read this book for an anthology work at my school and I really gained many things and I have learned to look in life from different point of views, as well as how to get over problems in life.

However, I work for a medical insurance company which makes decisions I abhor, so I just had to read The Rainmaker. And I actually liked a lot about it, e.g., Rudy Baylor's first person narrative was captivating, Deck was an interesting and fun character, Ms. Birdie honoriness was enjoyable. I wish there was more of it. What I did not like about this novel was what I found in all the Grisham's novels I have read , it was predictable, characters were one dimensional and plots were unbelievable. Rudy just obtained his law degree and was able to outsmart a lawyer with years of experience. Yea!!! And the whole trial, while educational, was just too preposterous. The subplot with Kelly was neither here nor there, it did not hurt the novel but was not necessary either. You could say this about Ms. Birdie but I liked her. The ending made no sense at all. The Rainmaker never indicated to me that Rudy was disillusioned with the law; the fact that he realized he never was going to see one-third of 50 million really was not important, surely because it was not important to Dot and Great Benefit at the end was, in fact, defunct. It would have made more sense that, due to the positive publicity, Rudy would have built up his law practice and therefore substantially increased his income. I thought Rudy had a good, moral character. Now I'm not sure. And so while I enjoyed reading the book to some degree, I'm promising myself I will never again read a Grisham novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"As a first time reader of Grisham I am compelled to read more based on &quot;Rainmaker&quot;. The plot was simple but the story rolled along comfortably. Writing style is a little 'gum-shoe detective' and I found Baylorisms creeping into my own language. Characters were believable enough. The ending is fine. When you've got nowhere else to go but down and you've become cynical of your profession, the distance seems a good place to be. Not an intellectual book but an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker is a great book which was made amazingly well into a movie. For those of you considering watching the movie, please read the book first. It can be kind of confusing if you don't have a general sense of who the characters are, and if you're bad with names, well, watching the film can be a struggle. The Rainmaker is a great book with a realistic plot. Folks, this is how many Americans live, and being a college student, I KNOW what it's like to be uninsured. I think that's probably why it was such a smooth read for me. My props to John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Being a big Grisham fan.. I have to say this is one of his best! The character's are rich and real and developed well early on... I'm a &quot;picky&quot; reader who doesn't like &quot;wordy&quot; books and this is by far one of the most gripping reads I've encountered in a while! Bravo Grisham!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I am not a great reader, so getting through a book this long is a challenge for me. I loved the plot: it was well crafted with limitless potential to weave the pieces together into an intriguing conclusion. But alas! I was disappointed. Seemed like Grisham ran out of time at the end."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I thought I had finally found a Grisham novel in which the characters were more than two dimensional stereotypes. For once, a believable character faced with daunting adversity. The book's entertainment value, however, lies in the reader's interest in how the whole mess is going to work out. What a disappointment when every subplot ends up a red herring, and the main character's development arrests seemingly midsentence and goes in an utterly unacceptable direction.Is Grisham too much of a celebrity now for a decent editor to challenge"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"While I enjoyed reading most of the book the ending was a huge disappointment. It felt rushed and carelessly thrown together, like a high school student hurrying to finish an overdue book report.The characters were very superficial. Not Grisham's best, or even close."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Although John Grisham writes well about courtroom procedures, this has a greater depth of understanding into the minds of prisoners and the minds of decent men.

Once again John Grisham has created a plot that holds your attention to the point you don't want it to end."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I love John Grisham! He has yet to dissappoint me! His books are the kind you just can't put down!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I enjoyed this almost as much as The Firm, which I think is Grisham's best. Rudy is such a nice guy and so naive at the book's beginning that you wonder how he's ever going to make it in the real world. Then his job falls through and he's stuck with old Miss Birdie and Dot and Donny Ray Black as clients. You wonder. Then he starts showing his street smarts and takes on the giant insurance company over Donny Ray's denial of medical benefits. It's a typical David vs Goliath story that has such charm and wit that you can't help but root for Rudy.Told in the first person through Rudy, this is a fun book that lets you enjoy yourself without worrying about how its going to turn out, because you know the bad guys are just too bad to win. Or are they?"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"If you love some courtroom drama, then you'll love John Grisham. Having read Runaway Jury, The Street Lawyer and the Testament before I read The Rainmaker, I kinda knew what I could expect, but that doesn't mean I could put the book down. Hell, I even took it with me everywhere to read between every available moment. The Rainmaker is understandable enough for those not familiar with courtroom liguistics, and written in a clever, funny way. I have never seen the movie - but the book is a big recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"If you've loathe your health insurance provider for making dealing with them your second job, then you will find this book most gratifying. At first I was nonplussed by the book. I kept expecting it be a suspense-filled rocket-ride right out of the gate--like every other Grisham book I've read. It's not like that. But it's compelling and keeps you reading and rooting for the good guys. I'm here to tell you that if you have insurance of any kind--especially of the medical variety--you will find this story to be a balm to the soul."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"My first book of John Grisham was \\"The firm\\", very thrilling. But this one, IT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING, by the fact that just simple things that can happen to a lawyer, no fancy things, just plain simple. It keeps you hooked all the time.FANTASTIC"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"While \`The Firm' still ranks as my favorite Grisham novel, \`The Rainmaker' makes it into my top three, mostly for its humor. Unlike Mitch McDeere in \`The Firm', Rudy Baylor is a two-bit rookie lawyer going nowhere quickly in life ...he's a grafter among a colourful bunch of friends/associates who add to the fast pace of the novel. The earlier part of the book was in danger of reading like a mini biography of Rudy; despite same the reader is entertained by the array of different characters and subplots that had me wondering what thread would ultimately take centre stage. By the time it becomes clear that the core of the story revolves around the David & Goliath case, as in Rudy Baylor vs the Great Benefits Insurance Company, the pace of the novel noticeably slows. To buy into some of the courtroom antics that follow, a few leaps of faith are required, such as the behaviour of the replacement Judge and how Lady Luck completely embraces young Rudy. That said, you are rewarded with tight writing, memorable scenes and what most people want - the big guy taken down by the minnow with truth on his side.The secondary thread involved Rudy hooking up with a battered wife...I guess this unlikely relationship was conveniently made to work so that our hero could be rewarded with a lasting slice of happiness beyond his moment of glory in court. Throughout the book, there are plenty of LOL moments, some of which stretched the imagination, but not enough to undermine the story itself. The ending was not up to Grisham's usual high standard...several pages clipped would have added more punch.In summary, the novel's strength is that it works well at a number of different levels, driven by quirky humor and overall good pace. Apart from a few shortcomings, I highly recommend this novel as yet another good insight by Grisham into the legal world."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"GREAT BOOK BY ONE OF THE GREATEST AUTHORS. ONCE YOU START YOU WONT BE ABLE TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The emotional ties begin to weave from the beginning of the book all the way to the end. Grisham brings the various sub-plots together through the protagonist in a way that makes the reader invest their hearts and thoughts into the story. You will find yourself satisfied in a bittersweet way by the end of this book. A must read for all fans of legal thrillers and great stories in general."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I didn't quite understand the meaning of the title until the very end. I guess it's a \\"lawyer term\\". The story was a wonderful roller coaster ride. It had all the right twists and turns that a thriller should have and pull it all together in the end. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This was my second Grisham novel and I have to say it was very compelling. I didn't see that ending coming and I can't honestly say I saw it ending any other way. Rudy Baylor's story isn't a very happy one but it is extremely entertaining. It brings in the grim reality of the law and shows a young law student how tough the world truly is."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I first read this book in the early 90s, after watching the film by Francis Ford Coppola.The Rainmaker takes us through a law student's first trial and burgeoning law practice. Rudy Baylor introduces us to his parents and his surroundings: the Cypress Gardens retirement home. In this novel Grisham focuses on the characters more than the actual events (which are used to propel the characters forward through maturity and adult life). While we are quickly introduced to Dot and Buddy Black, Rudy himself is uneasy about meeting Donny Ray, and although the reader knows that he doesn't have much time left, we don't get to \\"hear\\" his voice until roughly a quarter into the novel. The first quarter, the lead-up to the film's outset, involves Rudy trying to find gainful and profitable employment. This is far more riveting than it may sound, and leads to Rudy's ire towards Trent and Brent.We are introduced to Rudy Baylor as a young, bright and capable law student, cursed with naivete and an impetuous temper into a well-rounded adult. He no longer takes affront at minor slights well before the final chapter.I have read the book twice and listened to William Dufries' spectacular narration several times. This book has a poignancy that will never leave humanity. One of the key themes ever-present in The Rainmaker is how those who have money, power or and status can buy their brand of \\"justice.\\" This is also exemplified in every Grisham novel I have read (which include The Last Juror, The Runaway Jury, A Time to Kill, The King of Torts. The Associate and The Appeal). The wealthy and excessively affluent can stall cases for years until the statute of limitations expires (unless, of course, a judge who has not lost faith in justice is presiding). It's not that justice never prevails, but that it seldom prevails.Grisham's writing flows nicely, with no padding or filler. I found myself barracking for Rudy and even Deck as they toss ethics out the window and seek out Mr. van Landel, an unfortunate soul who became the victim of a drunk driver. Deck is one of Bruiser Stone's unapologetic ambulance chasers. While this may sound unethical at first glance, is simply all they can do to survive in a city almost infested with lawyers. The climax doesn't occur until the final three hundred pages, but you won't feel bored. Grisham knows how to weave a story, and keeping readers hooked on his every word is one of his many talents."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"does not get any better, but from one john to another the Black's got too much punitive!!!!---Johnny C"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read every book JG has published.

It just keeps you in suspence right up to the end of it!!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grishams experience of struggling through law school was so accurate that it brought back a flood of my own memories of school. Willing to take jobs no matter how sleezy they were. For anyone who has dealt with an Insurance company, this novel brought back very vivid memories of dealing with the slimmest business in the world. The struggle and conflict of the main character gave you moments of joy, sadness, fear, and anxiety. John Grisham had is very best novel, in my mind, until he gave up on the novel to meet a deadline. Meet a Deadline, is the only excuse I can come up with for the lame ending of this novel. In the ending, the main character, who would be fine role model for any attorney to acheive, kills a man. Come on Grisham, you are my favorite author, ask for the book back from the publisher so you can rewrite the ending. Either that, or give back part of the $6 million given for the novel, or better yet send me a check for $25, the cost I paid for the worst ending of any novel you have written"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read.

The ending is a surprise too"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The weakest of Grisham's stories, this one reads as if it was written to be the Sunday night &quot;made for tv&quot; special ---doesn't even make the big screen! The character development leaves us with nothing more than caricatures. And theonly satisfying part about the ending was that the story was over."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"A fast pace page turner. The story is simple but Grisham wrote it in such a way that the suspense kept readers on the edge of their seats.The ending is predictable, as in many other fictions, but it is still worth the readers' time to finish the book.Real life lawyers might find the story a little difficult to believe but for the general readers, don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham has crafted an intriguing, fast-paced storywhich will keep the reader turning pages long after thethe family has gone to sleep. Grisham's main character,Rudy Baylor, quickly becomes a close acquaintance of thereader. Rudy is a young, ambitious law student who getsthoroughly &quot;kicked around&quot; by circumstances beyond hiscontrol. His inherent intelligence and amazing ability tomake the right decisions at the right time, especially whileemployed by a &quot;sleaze-bucket&quot; attorney firm in Memphis, eventuallybring him to the ultimate heights of justice andjurisprudence in the American legal system. The final pagescaused me to wonder if it is possible that Rudy Baylor might,in some way, be related to Rocky Balboa? Grisham laces hisstories with believability in his characters and just enoughlegaleze to wrap us in tight blanket of suspense. A must read."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Until you get to the ending, this is probably my favorite Grisham book. I found a tongue-in-cheek humor, very wry, which was extraordinary, similar to Faulker in _The Sound and the Fury_. As to the ending, well, to be fair, the second time I read the book I found the roots of it all through, from the beginning. I didn't like it at all, however, no fun and no fair. And it was unrealistic that none of the powerful, smart and famous attorneys who were watching and helping Rudy didn't warn him about what might happen, and how he might avoid it. So that's it, at the end? It's all over, no looking back, after all that hard work? I don't buy it. The rest of the book is worth living with the ending. Well-written, fascinating, wonderful characters, darkly funny."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham's main character's fit into two categories, the brilliant, gifted strategists such as Mitch Mcdeere and Nicholas Easter, and the underdog commonfolk pitted against overwhelming odds such as Jake Brigance and Mark Sway. Rudy Baylor fits into the latter category. Grisham does a brilliant job of building him up as a frustrated, sympathetic underdog. At first, I was upset that the Rainmaker was written in the first person as I thought that this might take away from his ability to work his objective humor style into the book. Indeed, the book starts a little slow. Have patience however, it gets better. Rudy grows smarter, angrier and more mature as the story goes on until his opponents,the once heavy favorites, almost start to look like sympathetic characters. If anything the first person style allows the reader to follow one saga without having to endure one or two chapter interruptions between chapters that follow the master narrative. The book can be a little slow paced at times, and may be a bit long for the story, but the drama scenes are Grisham at his best. The Rainmaker is also the perfect forum for Grisham's trademark anti- lawyer humor, which, although unrealistic and not indicative of the way real lawyers live and operate, does make for some very good humor."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I liked this book because there wasn't just one good story line there were several. This major one was Rudy Bayler trying to nail ainsurance company for killing a person with lukimia. I also liked the first person narreration, by John Grisham in his finest books ever. Sure every book he writes is about a lawyer just coming out of, or in, law school, but he's so good at it who cares."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Let's hear it for the underdog!! Grisham weaves a clever tale of a law school grad going up against a huge corporation with its high-octane lawyers in a wrongful death suit. You can't help but root for Rudy Baylor, the rookie lawyer. There is, of course, the obligatory romance to spice things up, as well. My only problem with the story was how Grisham trivializes the death of one of the characters in the book, an abusive husband, and how Baylor rides off into the sunset at the end (with his new love). Good read!!!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I'll never get tired of this theme! Unfortunately, Grisham takes on two entirely separate plots in The Rainmaker and never makes them matter to each other. Romance with an abused wife deserved an entire book to itself, or else a clever way to relate it to the main plot--which was terrific as usual. Wet-behind-the-ears kid lawyer brings down money-grubbing slime and its hired guns. What's not to like? :^)"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read all of john grisham's novels and I was not the least bit disappointed with &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;. There is never a dull moment in the novel and even when you &quot;recovered&quot; from the climatic point in the novel,there's still something left to uncover. Grisham goes to an extra length to explain legal procedures, or perfectly describe the main character's &quot;surroundings&quot;. Because of this book I feel like I've been to memphis! Anyone that enjoys John Grisham's novels will love &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Mr. Grisham has compiled a weak, predictible plot with The Rainmaker. He does not allow his readers the opportunity to fall in love with any characters except for Rudy, and we do not really depise anyone except for an untangible insurance company. He needed to develop Kelly Riker's story line and weave it through the enitre novel rather than having her pop up every now and then. And what is the whole point of Bruiser and Prince? Not much except for a stepping stone to introduce Deck and Rudy. Characters did not develop and the conclusion was ho hum. I used to read his novels as quickly as my schedule would allow me to. Now, I drag through them in hopes to feel the thrills that stories like A Time to Kill and The Firm provided me. I feel as if Mr. Grisham only writes with the big silver screen in mind and does not provide his readers with a novel full of riveting action and roller coaster emotions like we grew to expect from him. I hope the real Mr. Grisham returns soon."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I saw the movie last night and, except for MINOR changes, it was extremely good.

The thrill of him being The Rainmaker was amazing in this book. I highly recommend it if you haven't read any of John Grisham's books to start with this one.

I cannot wait to see the movie, although Grisham's books are so descriptive that the movie is playing in my head as I am reading. I can picture every character and what they look like in my head, so the movie's characters are bound to be a disappointment. No other author has captured my undivided attention like John Grisham has in EVERY ONE of his books. Those who criticize him, need to re-read the book and this time PAY ATTENTION!

Written by John Grisham, this story has inspired readers everywhere. It's a story of compassion, devotion, and love- This is the story of a lawyers struggle through the beginning of his career.The Rainmaker is about a rooky lawyer named Rudy Baylor who just graduated from law school. He has passed his bar exam and has taken on his first cases as a lawyer. Since Rudy has no money and no place to live, he's just looking for some easy money makers. At least that's what he thinks these cases are, but Rudy gets in over his head. These so called easy cases turn into a fight for justice in this small town.With the help of his new found partner, a friend who knows the ropes of law, and some ways around it, Rudy finds the real lawyer inside of him, vs. the lawyer that breezed through college. He fights for what's right against a dishonest insurance company that won't cover a young man with leukemia and a young woman with an abusive husband.This story follows his struggles, hardships and breakthroughs. This is an extraordinary story. It's a story for all readers and one that everyone will enjoy. This novel is written so well you feel like you're not just reading it, but your there, in the courtroom, or in the office, or wherever the story may take you. The details, it's not superficial or unrealistic, and how the characters are written make the story even more real. It almost feels like a biography, like Rudy's thoughts were written down on paper as he thought them. Reading this story will inspire young lawyers, and young readers everywhere. I can truly say that this novel is one that I can read over and over and still be taken aback by this story of affection, love, and allegiance."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Rudy Baylor, fresh out of law school, tries to find a job as a lawyer.

If he loses than a company that has done wrong will get away with murder. Can he win or will he be another one of the countless lawyers roaming the streets of Memphis.I completely enjoyed this book. I was surprised at how much work it took just to get a case into a courtroom and how much paperwork is put into a trial. This book was excellent and I feel that I could read it over and over again.If you like any of the many John Grisham Books that you will love The Rainmaker.

He scores well with a nice mix of humor, memorable (and likeable) characters, action, and plot in a book that doesn't take itself to serously.As a whole - this may not be Grisham's best novel, the legal maneuvering has been kept to a minimum, but for me hit the spot."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is the first Grisham novel I have read.

I read it in the span of two days because I could not put it down. The story goes around a young lawyer named Rudy; a young lawyer who just passed his bar exam, and stressed out with the bill collectors. So now, he takes a case against a huge medical coverage company because they did not live up to the promise of one of their clients; he eventually died from lung cancer, and they didnt come through with the money to pay for the doctor bills. So now, they hire a huge law coporation to take the case. Now Rudy is over his head, but he wants to win this case because this could make him or break him in his law career. While the case moves forward, he meets what John Grisham calls 'a ambulance chase' and they start taking cases from other people, and Rudy still working on the medical case. Then Rudy meets a woman who is being abused by her boyfriend, so Rudy falls for and protects her from him. Now as the medical case moves along, eventually Rudy wins the case of $50 million dollars in grivence pay and medical bills. Rudy is happy winning his first case. Now he then finds out that the medical insurance went bankrupt and the family and Rudy would not see a penny coming their way. So now, with a old Volvo (it has I believe 130,000 miles on it, correct me if I am wrong), he then leaves the small firm he had with his buddy of his, and his new girlfriend and get out of town.The Rainmaker I thought was a good book, I have not read all of Grisham's novels, but the few i did read (The Rainmaker is one of them), I felt like the man can write a good tale. I cant really call myself a huge Grisham fan, but I like his writing. Anyway, good book and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"this is one of the best books ever written. It is well written and intelligent"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I had no cares for any of the people in this story. This is boring and simple reading. If this was the only Grisham I ever read, it would be the last. People you are being too kind to this author. He is turning out junk by the minute."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Nothing is worse than a legal novel that fails to get the law straight. Mr. Grisham is supposed to be an attorney, but fails to get any of the legal details correct. For example, the defense attorney in this book attempts to remove the case to federal court by filing a motion in state court! The only proper procedure to remove a case filed in state court to is to file a notice of removal in federal court. The author's description of bad faith law is also laughable- even a first year law student could do a better job of getting the law right. A great deal of time is spent in the book concerning the removal of a letter by the insurance company from its claim file. But what is the point of removing a letter that has already been mailed? If a company were going to conceal a document, it would conceal a document that the plaintiff has never seen, or heard about. Next, the main character is seriously flawed, and is no hero. In no particular order of importance, he is guilty of practicing law without a license, drunk driving, forming a partnership with a non-lawyer, improperly soliciting clients, and murder. Just who is the bad guy here??? Grisham completely misses the boat in this book. It would not have taken a great deal of effort to get the details correct. Instead, he loses all credibility as an author, especially an author of legal novels. Imagine, if you will, a writer of Western novels having his hero mount a horse from the right side, or saddle the horse backwards, and not have his readers laugh at the absurdity of his effort."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I'm afraid I can't recall the last time I read such an unrealistic book. A kid lawyer fresh out of law school takes on the super powerful legal conglomorate representing a massive insurance company... and wins, all by his widdle wonesome. The only way this could happen is if the opposing lawyers make every blunder possible... which they conveniently do. Along the way the law firm which tries to cheat our young hero mysteriously burns to the ground and a judge who is in cahoots with the insurance company's legal team suddenly dies the day before a vital ruling. I waited until the end of the book to find out who the kid's mysterious, immoral benefactor was... and there wasn't one. Nope. Just coincidence, the whole way.Along the way there are pointless subplots with a woman who claims to have millions in an Atlanta bank, a love story with an abuse victim, and the ethical dilemma of the need to be an ambulance chaser to make ends meet. WIll our young hero prevail? Who cares?"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Arrived within a reasonable amount of time.

I found the book was entertaining, fun to read nevertheless lacked of something, for example in the beginning of the book Rudy faces an event which later in the book is not even mentionned, he is pursued by the police for suspicion of having burnt down a building, this makes a big fuss in the start of the book but then is completely forgotten? What happened there I don't know? Did Mr. Grisham forget to continue that part of the story...? Also a similar thing happens with Mrs. Birdy, a woman who seems the center of attention quiet regularly throughout the book, as she is a ''millionaire'' and the young Lawyer advices her a lot about her will and how she should share her money after her death, towards the end of the book it seemed to me at some point that the author barely gave any attention to her story and merely disclosed the affair by saying that she was after all not a millionaire but thought she was and actually had barely any money.. I found that a bit strange as well.In the end the young Lawyer wins the case, but nothing much happens, he ends up leaving the town with the young girl he has met at the Hospital, the closing line being that he will not practice Law as a career but prefer to teach History (a simple life rather than a complicated one), ok fair enough but the decision seemed a bit sudden, and the final note of the book was also a bit suprising.Entertaining, but I had found it dissapointing and most of all surprising that so many people praise the book so much."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This book, I believe is Grishams major success. It is about a lawyer just out of law school, and the trials he faces. From going bankrupt to challenging a major insurance company."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham finds the perfect hungry young lawyer in Rudy Baylor. He's smart. He's quick. And he's enthical. Once you pick up this book you'll find it difficult to put down. I read it in two days. Every time I turned the page I would tell myself, &quot;ok, stop after this page,&quot; but it never happened.You'll be right by Rudy's side as he searches for his place in the legal world.

This is one thing that Grisham once did so well. He also tells an intriguing story, and along the way Rudy becomes our friend, and we become his confidants. I have little criticism except that Rudy seems to be presented with fewer obstacles in the court trial than one would expect. And--in spite of what the back cover says--I don't think his life is ever in danger.The Rainmaker typifies the early John Grisham: good story-telling, likeable characters, adequate characterization, no gratuitous sex or violence, and a minimum amount of profanity. Can anyone honestly question why he became so popular?"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"If you've ever had to live on a tight budget while trying to &quot;make it big,&quot; then you'll enjoy this book. Grisham's main character, Rudy Baylor, is on the verge of bankruptcy and his job situation is less than glamorous. But you can identify with everything and laugh at the similarities between Rudy's life and your own. Plus, the story line will keep you hooked page after page. Don't just shrug this book off as &quot;another lawyer book by Grisham&quot; or you'll miss out on an excellent novel."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham added a lot more humor to this book than his others. Had my attention every minute. Development of characters was very strong in this book. Thought the main character, Rudy, was very strong with a great first name."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Whilst I was aware of John Grisham's popularity and had seen some of the screen adaptations, I had never felt compelled to read one of his books. Then, by chance, one day I picked up a copy of \`The Rainmaker' from my university library and, after only a few pages found myself unable to put it down. From the very beginning the story is made personal and intriguing and as it continues you find yourself wanting to know how the story will progress and how it will ultimately be concluded. One of the great strengths of the book is the way that it introduces characters and returns to them in later plotlines, creating a very real world. The telling of the story in the first person format also enhances the personal aspect of the book, as you read you can hear Rudy Baylor's voice in your head and almost take the journey with him.It is essential that in a book that is over 560 pages long that the story is gripping throughout and that it maintains the reader's interest, and this reworking of the David and Goliath theme certainly manages this. With the author's legal background, the attention to detail is also impressive and the narrative is as effective in the courtroom as it is outside, maybe even more so.Even though I picked up this book with no expectations, I finished it a huge John Grisham fan. I am now mid way through my eighth Grisham novel and would certainly recommend \`The Rainmaker', as well as several others, to anyone in search of an entertaining story containing believably flawed characters."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read several of his books and I usually hang on every word. This one, however, drags for nearly half the book before it gets interesting. I think some people refer to this as a thriller and I'm not sure HOW that word can be used. Even the reviews on the cover are misleading. I guessed how the trial would turn out long before the ending(You will too). Even the ending was disappointing to me. I seem to be in the minority in my views on this book, however, so pick it up and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This book is a bit of a departure for Grisham from the usual part of the legal industry he uncovers. Rudy, our hero, is drawn kicking and screaming into the shader side of the law: even ambulance chasing. But then there's the shady side of what seems like high-class law, the kind of sleeze in big law firms that we saw in &quot;The Firm&quot;. You also had to feel drawn yourself into Rudy's world - including the world of the new lawyer trying to make his way. It would be unfair to tell you how it ends - let's just say the read is worth your time as always with Grisham's excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book. I agree that the movie was good, but the book is by far better. I wish they wouldn't have changed things around in the movie, but due to time, they sometimes have to. I think the book was very easy reading and a great story. I highly recommend this book if your are looking to just sit back relax and get engrossed in a good book."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I really liked this book. Even though it was really long it was exciting. I liked it when Rudy would help Kelly and Mrs. Birdie. It would have been hard to be a first time lawyer with a hard insurance case that could be worth millions of dollars. You should read the book it is good, I reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"There are some great reviews up top so I wont bother to repeat what others have said. This book was great with a lot of humor.The only thing it lacked was a good ending. I found the ending terrible. I dont want to explain why because I would give the whole book away.Conclusion: Rip out the last 20 pages. Grisham should have ended the book in the middle of Chapter 51.DAN"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"From the viewpoint of sheer enjoyment, this is probably my favorite of Grisham's books, except, perhaps, for The Testament. The plot is complex, the characters are quirky, and, after the first hundred pages are so, the writing is sharp, humorous, and impossible to put down.Rudy Baylor is a soon-to-graduate law school student to whom everything bad is happening. Even when you think he's hit bottom, things keep getting worse. He loses his girlfriend, his job prospects, his financial self-respect; he's rousted out of bed by cops and implicated in an arson, he's reduced to working for a sleazy law firm that chases ambulances and represents strip clubs, and even that job is shaky.While the book is thoroughly entertaining, it stretches the limits of credulity at times. The evil insurance company Rudy sues, and everyone who works for it, are totally devoid of any redeeming moral traits whatsoever; the judge is unbelievably sympathetic. As a rookie lawyer trying his first case, Rudy can do no wrong in the courtroom. Still, rooting for the good guys and hissing at the bad guys is part of the fun of the book.The book raises some sticky moral questions that are glossed over, such as Rudy's relationship with an attractive young married woman, her husband's violent death, and the subsequent cover-up. And there are some dangling loose ends I would have like to have seen cleared up, such as who actually committed the arson of which Rudy was suspected.The ending was unexpected, and yet exactly what it should have been. It left me slightly misty-eyed, and wishing that modern authors used that device of 19th-Century writers, telling us what became of their characters in the twenty years or so after the book. My guess . . . Rudy becomes a high-school history teacher in Laramie, Wyoming, he and Kelly have three kids, and they never set foot in a courthouse again. Read the book and see if you agree."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Grisham provides another gripping legal drama with an explosive pace, making this book hard to put down. The story has a little bit of everything; from the law student who finds himself in the role of David versus Goliath, the comical character played by Deck, there are the complimentary thugs and the token beautiful woman. Grisham weaves the story together magically and it makes for a very exciting read, building into a crescendo at the end with an unexpected twist. The only faux pas with this novel is that readers will invariably question whether the story could happen in real life. As a lawyer myself I seriously doubt it, but then real life tends not to be an interesting read. Apart from the fact that the story beggars belief, this makes for a definite purchase and comes close to the greatness of The Partner, but not quite."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Typical Grisham. His protagonist is an inexperienced lawyer/law student who gets overwhelmed trying to do the right thing. It even has the typical Grisham happy ending.With the exception of 'A Time to Kill' and 'The Firm', if you have read one Grisham, you have read them all. I am sure there are many Grisham faithful that will crucify me for that statement, but, in my opinion, Grisham is often a lot of hype."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Though I am not a fan of litigation, this is an awesome book. The courtroom scenes between beginner Rudy and the seasoned veteran; forget his name; were absolutely hilarious. The antics of Deck and Rudy are fun to read and make the book lots of fun.The other plotline is much more serious, but just as good. I won't say anything because it is better the first time. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I listened to this as an audio book. First let me say that the gentleman that reads this adds *so* much to the character of the story - he is able to portray the accents and attitudes of the characters very well.Now, on to the story - it starts out very slow - Rudy's college days just seem to drag. Once he's graduated, though, the pace picks up. He gets a job that leads him to possible trouble with the law, a sneaky helper who's dubbed himself a 'paralawyer', one case with a troubled elderly lady and another case that could make him millions. The lawyer Rudy is up against is terrifically stuffy and self confident, and the ways in which this fellow's ego is dashed to the ground had me chuckling out loud several times (thus earning some odd stares ;-). If you can stand the slow start, this book is a winner."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"Having read most of Grisham's work and having undergone a life-saving bone marrow transplant in 1993, I was more than eager to read the Rainmaker. As far as medical accuracy and the emotions that family members and those afflicted with life-threatening illnesses face (and the daily battles with Health Maintenace Organizations to ensure adequate treatment and Insurance coverage), I thought that Grisham did a fantastic job capturing real-life. However, Grisham's story line with respect to the Courtroom was not as convincing. I found myself smiling too much and feeling all &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; with the incredible success that the young (and inexperienced) attorney Rudy Baylor had at every level of his legal battle (from discovery to the Courtroom). It seemed that everyone from the judge to the Jury to the expert witnesses had an affection for Rudy and after a while it no longer seemed believable. Additionally, while I enjoyed the real David and Golliath motiff, I was disappointed to see Grisham treat Golliath like a bumbling idiot destined for predictable failure. Nonetheless, in typical Grisham style, the book is again a page-turner which pulls you in and hooks you like an illicit drug. In this respect, it is well worth the 500 plus page read but if you are looking for reality, you are much better off reading A Time to Kill or The Client."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I could not put the book down but the ending sounded like Mr Grisham was past his deadline and had to get the manuscript in. The ending (which I will not disclose) is a great dissappointment. He wraps up his loose ends in a most sloppy of manners. A good book with a bad ending makes this attempt at a novel mediocre at best"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"When people are diagnosed with deadly diseases it is only natural that the insurance company should cover the costs of the treatment. When the insurance company refuses to pay what do you do? In The Rainmaker the 6th book from best-selling author John Grisham a young idealistic attorney named Rudy Baylor who isn't yet licensed to practice law (He hasn't yet written his bar exam) takes on a case that seems simple enough but then explodes like a wildfire. Great White Insurance is a fraudulent company that preys on the poor and uneducated. They offer insurance for a minimal monthly fee and then refuse to pay the benefits. As Rudy tries the case with the help of an associate (who has failed the bar exam more then three times) they have no idea of knowing just what kind of corporation they are up against. Another story involving a battered wife that falls for Rudy is prominent in the story as is Rudy's relationship with the elderly woman who has rented him a room in her garage. Grisham has a way with making everything that happens in his book seem plausible and not mundane. He writes about interesting characters that you feel connected to. For this book Grisham is once again at the top of his form creating a thriller with a real moral plot as the main plot device."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham usually writes pretty decent books (A Time to Kill and The Firm are my favorites) but this was just BORING. It was just too easy for Rudy to win that case. It made me laugh when he tricked the defense after they bugged his phones, but his tricking the defense made it too easy. Most of the book was about his economic problems which weren't all THAT bad. Or maybe they were bad but Grisham didn't play up on them enough. This is not just my opinion. Two friends of mine have read the book and they both agree with me."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I have read and re-read the Rainmaker several times. Most reviewers overlook the best part of the book - the HUMOR! Rudy's acid sarcasm and the rich, eccentric characters that drive the story just cracked me up. Miss Birdie and her bark mulch (read the book for that tidbit) still make me chuckle. Rudy Baylor, Deck, Prince, and especially Miss Birdie are all wonderfully drawn characters.Sure, it's not life-changing, epic literature from the pen of Steinbeck or Faulkner. It just made me laugh, something that doesn't happen too often in other mainstream generic bestellers. Keep up the good work, Mr. Grisham."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"&quot;The Rainmaker&quot; kept me awake through the whole book. I read it in summer school as my free reading choice. Guess what? I just couldn't put it down. I read it everywhere---In my dorm, whenever I have a free time...

It's also a really great movie!"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I loved this book for the page-turner it was and also because it addressed insurance companies and portrayed the one featured in THE RAINMAKER as the often truly evil organizations that insurance companies can be: not caring about the patient, only about the premiums that the patient will bring in. But it also kept me gripped like Craig Furnas's novel THE SHAPE, and I read it with full attention. That Francis Ford Coppola chose to direct this novel as a movie shows it's pretty good right there."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I loved the Rainmaker. I was soo enthralled in it that I almost caused a couple of car accidents by reading and driving. I loved the characters and Donny Ray's death actually touched me.

The plot is too predictable and the characters are not fascinating as in &quot;Client&quot;. Maybe, as other readers suspected, Grisham is considering screenplay too much.

It was a good book but it didn't keep my interest for very long. It had a good plot but took to long to unfold. The characters were wierd but interesting. The ending was kind of unrealistic with the amount of 50 million bucks. One of the problems is that all the small stories inside were not finished as well as they could be. An example is Booker, Rudy's best law school friend. He really only was used as a connection to Judge Kipler. He could have been a better part of the storie. But with all of the reviews I have read I see that there are many views on this book. I found the book entertaining and fun to read. It had its boring parts but was worth wile just the same. if you have different views you can mail me at Firecandy@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is a classic David and Goliath story which pits a little known, beginner lawyer against a gigantic, well-financed insurance company. But this book is also many other stories many of which have untied loose ends and have too little to do with the main story to help it. For example whatever happened in regards to the building that Rudy is accused of blowing up? And I think that John Grisham could have done without the character of Kelly. Rudy's relationship with her is way too predictable, making it harder to sympathize with her. In short, what should have been just a good story about a lawyer going up against a bigger enemy almost becomes lost in the jungle of subplots."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker was very good but it didn't keep my interest up as much as The Client or The Chamber (the only other Grisham books I've read.)The characters were very memorable, especially Rudy Baylor. I also liked the way John Grisham told the book from Rudy's point of view. It was interesting to see how the case was viewed through the eyes of a young lawyer fresh out of law school. The Rainmaker is a thought provoking novel and is a great read, especially for Grisham fans! The book is much better than the movie, as usual."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"First of all, let me say that I am 16 years old and I really enjoyed this book. I originally decided to read this book because I wanted to watch the movie. I figured reading the book would give me an idea of what happens in the movie. I wasn't expecting much, and I thought I would be clueless since I know nothing about how the law works. &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; however, was quite easy to understand, and even humorous at times. I really liked it a lot. This book is hard to put down, and I will be reading more books by John Grisham in the future, for sure!

Overall, a captivating book that does John Grisham fans justice."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"The Rainmaker tells the story of Rudy Baylor, a poor law student, who is optimistic about his life. Then his possibility of getting a job disappears, he is forced to declare bankruptcy, and his girlfriend leaves him for a wealthy student. Grisham's sixth novel is much different than the first five. He tries out telling the story in the first person, a difficult thing to do, and pulls it off pretty well. The character of Rudy is a good accomplishment, but the ambulance-chasing Deck left a powerful impression, as did the dying Donny Ray. This is fine reading, but there are a couple of problems as I see it. First, there is absolutely no doubt that the jury will find for Rudy. The courtroom scenes, while humorous, were not quite as compelling as I had hoped. Second, Grisham breaks Mark Twain's rule about writing, &quot;Don't say the fat lady screamed. Bring her out and let her scream.&quot; This has always been a factor in his writing, but it seems more blatant here because it happens in courtroom scenes. I didn't like this. I also thought the ending was a bit of a disappointment. Overall, though, it was a fine book."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"This is the first book by John Grisham I have read. This book has well deveolped characters who are so easy to love and hate that it seems as if Grisham is writing from his own experience.You grow attached to them as if you they were close childhood friends. This novel also has a well formed plot. The setting in Memphis, Tennessee is so vividly described that I could feel the mid- July sun beating down on my neck. After finishing this book I ran out and bought &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; which also promises to be another work of art by Grisham. Over all this book is really worth the time spent reading it. I strongly recommend you buy this one it makes a great addition to any bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I'll admit I was drawn to this book because of the movie (which is one of my favorites).

However, I think that it is time that Grisham try something different..."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"John Grisham's first popular novel, The Firm, was an excellent book that revitalized the tired genre of law thrillers. Unfortunately, Grisham's novels quickly became formulaic to the point of being boring ... there was always the innocent protagonist being hunted/persecuted/stalked by the sinister underworld/corporate entity bent on keeping some kind of secret.In The Rainmaker, Grisham still loosely adheres to the same formula, but manages to craft an immersive plot around Rudy Baylor, a down-and-out law student who prosecutes a case against, you guessed it, a corrupt insurance company.One of the elements, however, that Grisham uses to freshen the stale formula is that of romance, namely between our hero and domestic-abuse victim Kelly. Usually the protagonist is too busy defending his/her life and protecting/revealing incriminating evidence against the bad guys to be much interested in sex or any semblance thereof, but Grisham's Rudy manages to cultivate a pretty decent relationship with Kelly in between court appearances.I suppose that, if I stuck to my guns, I could write this off as more Grisham schlock but, to tell the truth, I rather enjoyed the interplay between Rudy and the various other characters in the novel such as Miss Birdie, Deck and especially Kelly.Perhaps Grisham simply spent more time developing the characters in this novel. Whatever the reason, The Rainmaker stands out as one of the few books in my Grisham collection worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"In the four-tape abridgment I heard, Grisham still produces an attention-getting -- and attention-keeping -- novel, but I'm beginning to find the pattern of his books annoyingly similar. There's that point in the plot where you say, &quot;Whoops! One too many good breaks for our hero! Goodbye, believability!&quot; And that point further on, where you say, &quot;Well, obviously, everything will come out all right, or there goes the story.&quot; But the fun is in the detail -- with Grisham, getting there is half the fun."},{"Title":"The Rainmaker (John Grisham)","review":"I spent a total of three days reading this book, and they must have been the most fulfilling in a while. Of the many John Grisham books I have read, this one had to be the most exciting and interesting. Many things were going on in Rudy's life, and they just kept coming, which kept me interested in the book, and they were cleverly connected! I loved the plot, the characters, and the writig of this book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Grisham fan, or who just likes to read a good book."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"&quot;Comstock Lode&quot; is just fantastic! This book was written by the famous Western writer, Louis L'Amour. Louis L'Amour has written over a hundred books, including the famous Sackett novels. The setting of this story is in the mid-1800's, during the gold rush in America. The story is told in Virginia City, Nevada.The main character is Val Trevallion, a young man of twenty-four with a harsh past. Both of his parents were killed when he was young and he has taken it upon himself to have revenge on the killers. He is a quiet man but very strong because of his work in mines. Though he has not had the best education, he is very smart. Grita Redaway is Val's friend from his past. Her parents were also killed by the same people who killed Val's parents. She is a very beautiful and an intelligent actress. She is independent though with a streak of stubbornness in her. Al Hesketh is the villain of the story. He is a cruel and wicked man, only thinking of himself and how he can become rich.The story begins in Cornwall, England in the year 1859. Val is fourteen-years-old when his father and mother decide to move to America. His father wants to work his own mine in California. He saves enough money so they go to America by boat. When they reached Gunwalloe, the Trevallions decide to travel to California with another family, the Redaways. The Redaways have only one daughter, Grita, who is eight-years-old. A few days before they leave, Val's father goes to buy supplies a few miles away. Suddenly, drunken rustlers attack the wagons in which Val and Grita's mothers are in. The drifters kill the mothers then beat up Mr. Redaway. During the whole time, Val and Grita are hidden nearby; Val protecting Grita and shielding her from the sight. After they leave, killing Mr. Redaway, Val and Grita go find Mr. Trevallion. After the dead are buried, Mr. Trevallion, though heartbroken, decides to carry on to California with Val while Grita goes to live with her aunt. But on the way to California, Val's father is killed by the same men who had killed his mother. Val swears to have revenge on the murderers. Ten years go by, during which Val shoots two of the people who were involved in the murders. Val then realizes that he has wasted his life and decides to settle down and have his own mine in Virginia City, Nevada, where the Comstock Lode is. He gets good land and finds some silver in his mines. But trouble seems to follow him everywhere. He finds out that Grita is in big trouble, in which the remaining men who murdered his parents are involved.Love this book, and is one of my favorite L'Amour books. Louis L'Amour is the type of writer that, whatever he writes, you'll know before-hand that you'll love them. &quot;Comstock Lode&quot; is no exception. Some other of my favorite L'Amour books are:*North to the Rails**Sackett Series**Matagorda**Crossfire Trail*...and this list can go on and on and on!"},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"I'm in a high school modern novel class and HATE to read. That is, until I laid my hands on Louis L'amour! WOW! THIS STORY KEEPS YOU WANTING TO READ MORE. It starts out interesting and keeps getting better and better with the end being the best. You forget everything when your reading it and want to actually be back in those days and live their exciting lives."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"Louis L'Amour's Comstock Lode is a brilliant, fictional novel based on real events that will suck you in as soon as you start reading. I'm not one for westerns at ALL, but I was recommended this book and told myself, Why not? It sounds alright, nothing really better to read as of right now. I'll admit, the first few chapters started off a little dull, but then, you get deeper and deeper into the story and you can't put the book down. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure novels or Louis L'Amour in general.Val Trevallion was a son of Tom Trevallion and his wife Mary, who lived in England until finding a large amount of gold and, moves to the States. While in Louisiana, Val's mother and the mother of another girl named Grita Redaway are brutally murdered by a group of shadowy characters, one of which Val will never forget the eyes of. Val and his father set out for the Wild West, but on the way there, his father gets murdered as well. A name on a gun gives Val a clue as to the identity of one man from the group of men that murdered his father and possibly his mother. Val goes to the Comstock where he is known as the toughest, most feared man around. While there, he will remeet Grita, a beautiful, budding actress and the memories come rushing back. His main mission: to kill those who killed his parents. But not everyone seems to be who they are, and Val has to come face-to-face with the man whose eyes haunted him years earlier in this edge-of-your-seat thriller."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"This is my all-time favorite L'Amour book. I read it for the first time several years ago and have since read it many times over. Each time I have read it, I find something new that only adds to the story.I have read many L'Amour novels and this one stands out because of its detail of the charactures. L'Amour explains why his charactures act as they do while still containing all of the typical content of most of his novels. If you read one L'Amour novel, read this one!!"},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"This was my first L. L'Amour book and I loved it. It was relatively easy reading but very enjoyable. Mr. L'Amour is excellent at developing the characters and weaving them into the story. I had a hard time putting this book down at night before going to bed..I have already purchased several more of his books and am planning on collecting the entire set.You will definitely enjoy this book and this writer."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"Louis L'Amour's sudden stand-alone chapter on the main villian, Albert Hesketh, and his background, boyhood, and the way he became ruthless and amoral, is worth the price of the book. It breaks into the narrative abruptly towards the end, and although it's been years since I read &quot;Comstock Lode&quot;, that one interlude stands out in my mind, to this day. That sort of thing is what set L'Amour apart from the rest of the pack in the &quot;Western&quot; dime novel genre."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"My first Western, and first L'Amour. I found it so absorbing and satisfying I read Gale's short book on this author, and promptly ordered what looked like the dozen best of L'Amour's books: FLINT, BENDIGO..., LONESOIME GODS, WALKING DRUM, LAST OF BREED, SITKA, LAST STAND..., and 5 Sackett volumes. Three or four of these are not Westerns. Perhaps L'Amour will turn out to be like Shakespeare, Wodehouse, Cooper, Dostoyevsky, etc.--want to read them all. But according to Gale, many of his 100 or so books are repetitive and not equal to his many first-rate volumes.We need this clear attention to good & evil, individual responsibility, hard work, creativity, reward & punishment."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"Comstock Lode is classic Louis L'amour. This book is extremely enjoyable and fast-paced. If you are just starting out on Louis, this book will not steer you wrong, it is a perfect example of his genius."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"I really enjoyed Louis L'Amour's &quot;Comstock Lode.&quot; The story of Trevallian is probably not a terribly uncommon one for the California gold rush days. I especially like the way Mr. L'Amour incorporates historical fact in his books to make them not only entertaining, but educational as well. I have determined to read more books by this author."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I WAS COMPLETELY IN AWE OF MR.L'AMOUR WRITINGS. I WAS HOOKED AND READ AS MANY BOOKS BY HIM THAT I COULD GET MY HANDS ON. I DO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD COLLECTION OF HIS WRITINGS. HE IS ONE OF THE FEW AUTHORS THAT WHEN HE WRITES ABOUT A CAMPFIRE SCENE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SMELL THE BEANS, BACON AND BISCUITS COOKING. SO SAD WHEN HE PASSED ON."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"The author spins another fine tale of the west, with mining scenarios, good vs. evil, redemption and a bit of romance the central themes of this work. The hero, a youngster from England, is on a mission to avenge the murder of his parents and the killing of another family, and this quest for revenge consumes him well into his adult life when he decides to settle in Virginia City and concentrate on establishing a mining career when forces and people from his past converge on Comstock Lode in a high stakes game of life and death. The book has an authentic ring throughout, due in no small part to L'Amour's experiences in the west and knowledge of the mining industry, cowboys, gun fighters and an uncanny knack for understanding the quirks of human nature that make his books so realistic and enjoyable. This book is rated as one of his best by his legion of fans."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"In typical fashion for his work Louis L'Amour demonstrates his vast knowledge of the short but legendary era of the American cowboy. That knowledge lends a unique authenticity and tone to each of his novels and in Comstock Lode we not only have a fast paced story line with well developed characters; we have an authoritative exploration of the gold rush. L'Amour strips away the glamor usually associated with gold digging and shows us the back breaking, often disappointing labor it required. I enjoy L'Amour's vision and presentation of the old west even more than Zane Grey's."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"Comstock Lode, is one of the best adventure stories of the wild, wild, west. With amazing descriptions,you feel like you are in the book."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"All Louis's westerns are worth reading, but this one is longer than most, the character's actions are less probable than most, and it gets a little tedious."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"There are enough reviews here about \\"Comstock Lode\\" that you might think you know the story well enough to skip the book. But, if you like westerns at all, or even think you might, this book will turn you into a L'Amour fan.I picked it up after seeing it on a rack not too long after we had returned from a trip to Reno. While we were there, we visited Virginia City and discovered, much to our joy, that it looks and feels very nearly as it must have in the latter 1800's. It's located away from Reno and Carson City, up on a mountainside that looks out over miles of desert. It still has the old Victorian buildings and boardwalk main drag. There is virtually no structure that will remind you that it's not 1875 or so. The only difference between it and a Hollywood version is that it now sports a paved road through town. Move off the main drag just one street and you're likely to find yourself on an old mining claim or near a real working mining operation. So, if you decide to read the book, you might want to Google Earth Virginia City to get a sense of what it was like in context of the book.So, \\"Comstock Lode\\" was a particularly interesting story to read since I had such a complete mental picture of Virginia City going in. I could still taste the dust, feel the wind and remember what it felt like to sit in one of the the saloons. What really made it interesting though, were the stories about the history of Virginia City, it's businesses and characters that L'Amour no doubt modeled, at least in part, on real places, events and people that occurred and existed around that time in history.To date, I have read more than 28 L'Amour books since \\"Comstock Lode\\" and have four new ones already on hand. Every one has been total entertainment and I plan to reread \\"Comstock Lode\\" when my daughter and her family finishes it. I loved Larry McMurtry's \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and recently read one of Wm. W. Johnstone's books, \\"Screaming Eagles\\", but L'Amour is the master, IMO, and this has to be one of his best."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"I love this book but there are not to many of his books that I don't like,I recommend it for a fun western fantasy"},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"This is a classic Louis L'Amour and a must have in a collectors library.

A psychological profile of the murderer remarkably painted by Louis L'Amour. In further action on more than 400 pages.A great western. One of the best."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"takes you back as if you were there, very entertainin"},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"I just finished reading Comstock last week, when I happened to be up in the California gold country myself. I'm a garden writer, author of 5 published books, and I was in Placer County, speaking to the Auburn Garden Club. The town of Auburn, which sits in the middle of the gold rush's richest territory, is a neat place, one to visit if you get the chance. I noticed too that there is still a very busy mining supply store right on one of Auburn's main streets. There's still gold and silver being found up there!But I digress: All of us who read Louis L'Amour's Westerns have probably noticed that while all of them are fun to read, some are certainly better than others. I thought that Comstock was darn good, and certainly one of the best of his books set in California. If you enjoy a fast-paced, action packed Western, I expect you'll like Comstock. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"Louis L'Amour is not a literary genius. He's a fine author though, and he writes a compelling Western. Comstock Lode was the first of his novels that I read, well over ten years ago, and found it to be an enjoyable treat. His stories are rich in accurate historical detail, yet not overwhelming. His writing style isn't literary, but it's good. His characters are reasonably three dimensional, especially in comparison to other writers of Westerns. (I find Zane Grey nearly unreadable.) Most of all though, his books are fun.This book in particular recounts actions in and around the greatest single discovery of silver in the United States. Though the particular details of the plot have long since left me, during a recent visit to Virginia City, years after having read Comstock Lode, I was able to explain to my companions why the cemetery held the remains of so many from Cornwall, England. So I can say that at least some part of the book has remained with me over the years."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"I love Louis L'Amour. I have read every one of his books. If you like books where the good guy always wins and the bad guys lose, and if you like reading three pages describing a bare knuckle fight, then you'll like these books.It's great to read books where evil is stomped out by a good guy with a big heart who knows right from wrong...and he always wins the red haired woman."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"I like Louis L'Amour's books. The good guy goes through some struggles, has to choose to do things right and not try and cheat or be dishonest, and always wins in the end. Of course he gets the girl, too.

It has wonderful character development and a very complex plot with twists and turns that maintain the suspense, while winding together to a great climax."},{"Title":"Comstock Lode","review":"This story deals with situations that really could have happened. Some westerns have a hero who gets shot 87 times, beats up a couple hundred dudes, and passes out after saving the day only to wake weeks later with a beautiful woman caring for him. This book is about the struggle of a man with his past, who works hard and does well because of his persistence and good morals. It's a classic, one that will never go out of style, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Oh, Crapper!","review":"This novel about office politics in corporate America will likely have a familiar ring to it for anybody who works for a living. It relates what happens to employees when a new CEO is appointed to reorganize Crapper Companies, a manufacturing conglomerate. I had to keep reminding myself it is a work of fiction because Crapper sounds a lot like the company I work for. My husband read it and said it sounded like the company he works for! The author captures the drama and comedy of inside-corporate action. All of the characters, from officers at the top to the people trying to get there are totally believable. If you like business novels, this is a very good read."},{"Title":"Oh, Crapper!","review":"Yes, I used to work for the company (one of the divisions held by this holding group) this read is intended to be about.Although not particularly well-written (but what the heck do I know), the story is interesting enough regardless of how \\"one-sided\\" it seems to be written from. It is her book and she can tell the story how she chooses. Bully for her!The book is about a particular holding company/publicly-traded corporation and the executives who changed it upon their hiring. Regardless of how much we understand the motivations of individuals and companies in their quest for EVIL profits, we sometimes cringe at the effects on employees. It's human nature. This book cringes away at will.As much as we try to separate the workplace and economic pursuits from emotion, it cannot be done; even by those of us with non-specific muscle spasms where our heart should be.If you worked for this company or any other large corporation that you feel has changed from underneath you, you will likely enjoy.

Doesn't the balanced scorecard work in practice?David Niven is an expert on Balanced Scorecard and his first book was an easy-to-read, well-structured manual of how to make scorecards work: \\"Balanced scorecard - step-by-step\\" (2002). It bridged the gap between practice and theory - especially for newcomers to the concept.In this new book, Niven tries to bridge another emerging gap. It is the gap between those questioning the usefulness of balanced scorecard, based on the many unsuccessful implementation attempts, and what people like Niven (and I) believe to be reality: that the scorecard framework remains sound, but must be instituted with rigor and discipline if you expect to get results.Why aren't many scorecard users happy?Niven believes that the trouble lies in the methods used to implement the Balanced Scorecard. Many firms have been lured by the seductive simplicity of the scorecard model, believing it could be easily implemented and produce results with a minimum of care and feeding. According to Niven, troubled implementations stem from many sources, e.g.- A lack of executive sponsorship to reinforce the Scorecard's value within the organization,- Tired [lagging] metrics reflecting the past with no regard to the drivers of future success, and- Management systems that continue to reward unbalanced, largely financial, performanceHow do we solve it?Niven's approach is basically to put Kaplan and Norton's five principles of the \\"Strategy-Focused Organization\\" (2001) into a more practical approach. The messages, obviously, are the same. But Niven manages to make it easier to comprehend. And he challenges the reader throughout the book. The diagnostics dimension of the book is furthermore incorporated at the end of each of the nine chapters where we find self-assessment questions.This week I went to a conference in Copenhagen where Harvard-professor Robert Kaplan spoke about the balanced scorecard. Kaplan, being one of the inventors, acknowledged that too many balanced scorecards did not succeed. It is a paradox, since the balanced scorecard was incepted to overcome to problem that strategies weren't properly implemented. But if the system (or scorecard) to finally make the strategy implementation work doesn't work either, then we're in real trouble. So is the concept, of course.Kaplan's suggestion to make a successful implementation of the scorecard is - like Niven's - to view it as a change project. The change programme goes thru three phases: mobilization (unfreezing), alignment (change), and sustainment (re-freezing). Kaplan specified the details as described below:1st phase: MOBILIZATION (\\"the case for change\\"):Principle: #1 Mobilize change thru Executive leadershipLeadership objective: Achieve commitment at the top, build the executive team, and build the case for changeCore competency: The catalyst's role is to be a missionary. The action list includes to advocate, to educate, and to sell a new way of managing.Management role: Executive education (the need for strategic execution) via conferences, in-house workshops, and readings.2nd phase: ALIGNMENT (\\"early wins\\")Principle: #2 translate the strategy into action, #3 align the organization.Leadership objective: Define and clarify the strategy, specify long-term targets, and communicate to workforceCore competency: The project team's role is as consultant and change agent. The action list includes to design strategy maps, to design scorecards/targets, to create alignment/cascade, and to overcome resistance.Management role: Strategy maps, balanced scorecards, First Report, Link business and support groups to the strategy, and to rationalize initiatives3rd phase: SUSTAINMENT (\\"irreversible momentum\\")Principle: #4 Motivate the staff, #5 Govern the OrganizationLeadership objective: Reinforce strategic message: Employees follow the leader, Enforce a performance-based culture: get results, and Lead the new management meetingCore competency: The office of strategy management's role is to be the \\"chief of staff\\" (like in the military and government). The action list includes to install accountability, to shape the executive agenda, and to integrate governance.Management role: Scorecard reporting system, HR processes aligned, Accountability and rewards aligned, and meetings focused on scorecard objectives and measures.If you're interested in Balanced Scorecard, you should obviously read the original work by Kaplan and Norton. But I also recommend a very capable book by the Swedes Olve et al (2003) - \\"Making Scorecards Actionable: Balancing Strategy and Control\\" - that also focuses on why balanced scorecards go wrong - and what to do about it.If you're even more interested in performance measurement systems, then do also consider \\"Performance Prism\\" by Neely et al (2002) that takes performance systems to the next level. Personally, I don't believe they've designed balanced scorecard's successor, but they have many interesting perspectives on stakeholders, choice of measurements, and the relationship between cause and effect.Peter Leerskov,MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business"},{"Title":"A Handbook of Native American Herbs (Healing Arts)","review":"I really love this book.

Bazarov, the book's central character is a nihilist, he claims to depise art, social institutions of any kind and any sort of emotion. Turgenev illustrates his contempt for people prepared to embrace nihilism at this expense with bazarov's ultimate disillusionment and unhappiness; as such it is a very political book and it had him labeled a conservative by his contemporaries."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"\\"Fathers and Sons\\" might be Turgenev's most referred to piece of work. And it is an intelligent and well-written piece of literature, but there were a few things about the book I didn't like. Now naturally who am I to criticize the work of Turgenev. To me one of the greatest Russian authors.Before I read this book I thought it was about the generation gap between a father and son. Demonstrating the changes which evolve generation after generation. How the young challenge the social conventions of the times. And that is a theme that is played in the book. But, here's comes one of the faults I have with the book. While reading the beginning pages I began to notice who the book starts to revolve around. Mostly the characters Bazarov and Arkady. And the older characters namely Arkady's father Nikolai and his uncle Pavel are not used enough. And this creates a conflict. Throughout the book we read about the younger generations view of life. But we don't get to read about the older characters views enough. There can't be much of a conflict if we don't get to hear both sides. We mostly hear Bazarov's views but he is rarely \\"challenged\\" to defend them. One of the best chapters in the book has Bazarov and Arkady arguing with Nikolai and Pavel about where society is now and where it was.Another problem I had with the book deals with the characters Anna Sergeyevna and her sister Katya. At first both Bazarov and Arkady are both taken by Anna. But we come to know very little about her. We only see her through the eyes of both men. And since they are both in love with her it seems a very lovely portrait is made of her. But, is she really the person they both think she is? We are not given a strong back ground story about her past. The only thing concerning her past that is mentioned is her first marriage. Some detail is given about her father but nothing about her childhood. The same thing happens with Katya. And never once does Turgenev try to put us in both of these women shoes to see what they think of the men. That would of been interesting to know.And finally I didn't like the way the book ends. By telling us exactly what happens to each character. I thought it was too neat. He was trying too hard to carefully wrap everything up with a bow on top. I would of preferred some mystery. It gives the reader something to think about.I suppose many might feel I'm nit-picking. But, if it does seem that way it's only because over-all I did enjoy the book and became involved so naturally I would of liked to know more about some of the characters. And naturally I would of liked to read more about other characters.Turgenev does give the novel a certin poetic feel. Many chapters are touching and heartfelt. I enjoyed the chapter where Nikolai thinks about his first wife. It is so vividly described. It's full of emotion. Another chapter deals with Bazarov visiting his parents and then suddenly leaving. The parents are heartbroken and so are we.Though for all the touching moments in the book there was one chapter I found quite funny. It deals with Pavel challenging Bazarov to a duel. Pavel informs Bazarov that he \\"detest\\" him. They then start to discuss the formalities. Pavel suggest that they fight at six in the morning with pistols at a distance of ten paces. Bazarov says \\"At ten paces? That will do; we can detest one another at that distance.\\" Later Bazarov starts to get a bit nervous and declares \\"I risk having my brains blown out.\\" I could almost picture Woody Allen saying these lines with his stammer. It reminded me of his movie \\"Love and Death\\".\\"Fathers and Sons\\" is an enjoyable read. It has it's rewarding moments. And I do recommend it to all Turgenev fans and those who love Russian literature. Though I admit I do perfer his novel \\"First Love\\" and his play \\"A Month In The Country\\".*** 1\\\\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Poetic well-written piece of work by Turgenev. Has many touching moments are does create a nice mood throughout. Flawed but interesting."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This was required reading for my Russian literature class because it is considered a classic. My favorite part of this book is the fact that it gives the reader a glimpse of what life was like for the average nobleman of the day...(in the 1850's) It has some interesting descriptions of Russian family life, the life of the peasantry and how the younger generation interacted with the older generation (hence the title, &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; although the original Russian is called &quot;Fathers and Children&quot;). One of the main characters, Bazarov, is a self proclaimed nihilist who rejects all forms of authority, causing problems for the older generations (his parents &amp; his friend's parents), but attracting the attention of the people of his (the younger) generation. This book has no real plot...it is merely the story of how one man brings his nihilist ideas into other peoples' lives &amp; it gives accounts of everybody else's reactions to these nihilist ideas. It is an interesting book &amp; a pretty quick read, but it can drag in places...especially if the reader is waiting for something interesting to happen. All in all, I believe this book is worth reading, if just to get a taste of &quot;Old Russia&quot;, but if you are looking for an exciting &quot;can't-put-it-down-sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-page-turner&quot;, you won't find it in this book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Fathers and SonsFirst off, I love Russian literature.

As sons rebel against the ways of their fathers, the sons search for a better life. In 19th century, the conflict is only differentiated by its setting.The novel centers on the friendship of Bazarov and Arkady, who becomes friends at the university. In their travels, they on separate occassions stay with each other's families as well as a upper caste people. In these travels, Bazarov's thoughts on nihilism are put to the test. Often, he tears at the fabric of society. Though Arkady is somewhat naive, he struggles with his friends ideology.There is little doubt that Bazarov is an educated man as he explores medicine at each destination. Yet the beauty of the story lies in the fact that the simplest things elude him. Though his parents and Arkady's father are portrayed as being simple, they possess what Bararov lacks. The way the story leads into it makes the ending that much more appropriate.Even as history repeats itself, many will learn the lesson of this beautiful story before ever reading it. Some will never learn it.

Turgenev doesn't seem to carry the same heft as Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, but he is not in any sense inferior in his genius for writing. The story is tight and dramatic, and deals with the timeless issues of family, love, relationships, war and politics, with a good dash of Russian miracle. It describes the transformation of Russian society 250 years ago, but Turgenev does so in such a way, finding a common center in our experience, that he could be describing a 21st Century San Francisco family. My book buddy Marcia Makepeace describes the building anticipation in Fathers and Sons, which keeps the reader glued to the book, as expecting old fashioned chills and thrills on every next page.It is indeed one of those books that is hard to put down once you start. But it is a quick read, and therefore an easy introduction to the Russian classics."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"The way this story is told and the characters drawn is like watching a movie with a camera moving in and out of focus.

However, the comparison ends there...besides, Turgenev was a better writer than Hemingway. Very highly recommended for all lovers of Russian literature...belongs in your collection right next to Crime &amp; Punishment, Dead Souls, War &amp; Peace, etc."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Following a link from Hamsun to Gogol found Fathers and Sons. Like the manic haunted heroes of Hamsun's Mysteries and Hunger there is Turgenev's Bazarov - a nihilist passionate - a hero of a kind. Take the path from Turgenev to Lermontov then to Dostoyevsky or criss cross paths and return to Hamsun. For this reader Turgenev's beautiful Fathers and Sons is but one part of this world of inspiration and Bazarov but one example of the gift these authors had for characterisation. Turgenev's novel - the cause of furious debate in its day and long beyond - is a powerful, challenging, emotional, wonderful book. Read it. Read them all."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Like many of the laudable Pre-Revolution authors, Turgenev's writing poignantly depicts the emotional and political unrest of a nation tearing itself apart. The book focuses on the deterioration and restoration of the relationship between the nihilistic Bazarov and his father. However, this central family relationship also mirrors the larger themes of social movements and progressive ideas. Turgenev's work remains a classic not only because of its historical significance, but for its timelessness as well. Like most great literature, the themes pertain to our culture as well. The dialectic between the older and younger generations will always exist, but Turgenev leaves the reader with the eventual hope for a synthesis. . ."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"FATHERS AND SONS treats Nihilism far more succinctly than any book I can think of and brought the idea to the ordinary mind through true to life characters that we can relate to. It is important because the ideas and methods of the most notorious Nihilists-Nechayev is considered to be very important by Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.Bazarov who is the hero of the novel, is skeptical of people, institutions, ideas, and all the other trappings of civilization and does not hide his willingness to go about bringing down what he rejects.Friedrich Nietzsche put forward an argument that the corrosive effects of Nihilism would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history. Nihilistic themes such as epistemological failure, value destruction, and cosmic purposelessness--have preoccupied artists, social critics, and philosophers in the 20th century.The fact that patterns of nihilism were indeed a conspicuous feature of collapsing civilizations, means it should be taken seriously. Its resurgence had an effect in the collapse of states, especially in Eastern Europe. Overall, this poetically written and entertaining classical novel deserves the highest of respects. In addition to The Union Moujik, classic Russian Stories like Crime and Punishment, A hero of our times, are recommended reads that not only expose the depths of ideas, but also the effects they have on political minds."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Ivan Turgenev was the first of the Russian writers of the XIX Century to make a name for himself outside his country. His novels influenced many of the great writers of the first half of the next century, such as Conrad, Virginia Wolf, Galsworthy and Henry James, who admired the Russian writer deeply. In his most famous novel, \`Fathers and Sons', the writer focus on the never-ending clash between generations.Although it is set in the XIX Century Russia, the narrative has universal and timeless connotation. \\"Fathers and Sons\\" focus on the conflict between younger member of Russian society that longed for reforms, and old intellectuals who were committed to political and aesthetical ideals of Western civilization.Turgenev is known as one of the most objective writers ever, and it is clear in this text. However matter-of-fact, his narrative is meticulous e fulfilled with details and important background information of most characters. His choice of words is precise, and it is clear mostly in the dialogues.As it is known, Turgenev kept a journal as if it were written by one of his main characters, Bazarov. This character has become one of the most important heroes of literature and his figure has influenced many writers. He repudiates everything that cannot be scientifically explained, and personalizes the spirit of revolution. On the other hand, Pavel Petrovich is his contrast and very conservative.\\"Fathers and Sons\\" is a symptomatic novel exposing where Russia was being let to. As some characters know, the society had to change, and not become the same (like in \\"The Leopard\\"). Drastic changes were necessary and they came some years after Turgenev's novel. As we all know, this change is called Revolution."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Turgenev is a master story teller, whether it takes the form of a novel or his shorter stories. This book, however, takes on special significance. Not only is it well-written, displaying the craft of the novelist as it matured in the mid-nineteeth century, but like many of his fellow Russians, he captures the imagination, themes, ideas, and sensibilities of presence that make Turgenev a twentieth-century joy to read.This alone is sufficient warrant to read the book. But, there's equally important social reasons to read it. Turgenev is to the novel what Nietzsche is to philosophy, and that they were cotemporaneous is no mistake. &quot;Fathers and Children&quot; is a novel about nihilism, despair, and raw will to power in a vein too similar to Nietzsche to be ignored.What makes Turgenev singularly important is his writing one of the truly &quot;post-modern&quot; novels as far as his themes go, but writing within the classical tradition of a well-developed plot, story, characters, ideas, and psychology. In many ways, Turgenew anticipates Freud, Kierkegaard, Joyce, and Eliot, while retaining the style of Hawthorne, Austin, and de Balzac. It's a wonderful synthesis -- a masterful story with critically important ideas and themes."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Turgenev definitely writes with a lighter touch than Tolstoy or Dostoevsky--which is not to say he's lightweight, just that he doesn't dwell on the heavy (maybe ponderous) \\"God and Man\\" issues of the other two. Many Russians see Turgenev as more Western than other Russian writers, almost French, and his writing does have a certain elegance to it. There are social themes but it seemed to me the social issues were a backdrop for the inner lives of the characters. Bazarov is indeed a nihilist but that seems incidental to the nuances of his personality, which Turgenev develops masterfully. Each of the characters could easily lapse into typecasting but Turgenev has a fundamental sympathy for and awareness of their personalities, so the writing is good even if you have no particular interest in the historic dynamics of the dawn of post-serfdom Russia."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Like almost every Russian author on the planet Turgenev writes in a heavy, dense style, and, yes, you can expect to trip over a couple dozen names in the first few pages. But if you struggle through the first few chapters you'll find a truly good book.One thing many readers will like is its comparatively diminutive size: compared to some of Turgenev's later compatriots this is a very small book but like his fellow Russian authors there are elements of love, religion, philosophy, social commentary, and politics throughout the book.The book centers around the differences between progressives and conservatives in relation to the generation gaps between young and old and the new progressives (nihilists) find their logic and science fails in the light of love.I found the book to be very readable and accessible and a good story that still has relevance."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This book is about generational conflict in 19th century Russia, when the moderate liberals of the 1840s generation are confronted with their radical sons from the 1860s.Given the upheaval in Russia in the 19th century, this has the potential to be some very interesting reading. However the radical sons in this case are portrayed as being nihilists and to the best of my knowledge (and the publishers introduction confirms this) very few of those creatures actually existed in 19th century Russia. There were lots of Social Democrats, Socialists, and Anarchists of all shades among the Russian radicals, and all of them shared a common hatred of the establishment, but they all had detailed visions of what they wanted to put in its place.The young heroes of Turgenev's novel believe their duty is simply to destroy everything in front of them, and leave the new society up to the next generation. They repudiate the serfs and the peasants, the traditional heroes of the left, just as much as the church and the Tsar.In my opinion, since the philosophical basis of the story is so far removed from the actual reality, the novel looses a lot of its punch. I had a hard time swallowing the idea that these young men would seriously take nihilism as a philosophy. Of course the idea of nihilism itself isn't supposed to be central to the themes of generational conflict in the novel, but I found that was the stumbling block I couldn't get past.At the very least though, this novel is very short, compared to the epics of Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky. Less than 300 pages, and (about a third of that the publishers introduction) you could easily read this book in a week and then brag to your friends how you got another Russian classic under your belt.Speaking of the introduction...Like all republished classic books this contains a lengthy introduction, in this case about 1/3rd of the actual book. The edition I read was introduced by Isaiah Berlin (whose biography on Marx I just recently completed), and contains an interesting summary of Turgenev's own political views, and the big controversy this book caused when it was first published. According to Isaiah Berlin, one of the reasons the philosophy of this book is so muddled is because Turgenev was under pressure both from his radical friends and his conservative publisher. In some ways I found the introduction more interesting than the actual book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"I recently read the novel Fathers and Sons (underlined title) by Ivan Turgenev. Turgenev uses vivid imagery to accurately portray life in 19th century Russia, pre-emancipation of the serfs. At this time, people were tired of the tsarist rule and were demanding reform. As society was on the brink of change, many different political theories were emerging such as nihilism. The main character of the novel, Bazarov, is a nihilist who doesn't accept any principals or believes. Bazarov is just one example of many nihilists who existed in his time. They denied and wanted to destroy the government, yet offered no way to rebuild anything. It makes sense that Turgenev kills Bazarov at the end of the novel.Turgenev didn't see Bazarov as having any plans for the future so he had to be killed at the end.Turgenev shows the eternal conflict between the older generation (Bazarov's and Arkady's dad) and the younger generation (Bazarov and Arkady) and their clashing views on reform. Yet this book can be applied to any time period because there will always be different views between the older and younger generations. The famous Russian critic, Pisarev wrote, \\"Turgenev's novel, in addition to its artistic beauty, is remarkable for the fact that it stirs the mind, leads to reflection.\\" Turgenev does not assume a critical attitude and let's the reader come up with their own opinions and judgements. I recommend this novel to anyone who has their doubts about buying it."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Friedrich Nietzsche once said, \\"The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.\\" In the book Fathers and Sons, by Ivan Turgenev, two friends, Arkady and Bazarov, learn just this. At first the two are best friends, close as brothers, but by the end of the book, they go their separate ways. Reading along, it is surprising to see the initial love between the protagonists turn to distasteful resentment. Analyzing Arkady from the beginning of his relationship with Bazarov, through his period of doubt, and to his final hatred of Bazarov, Turgenev clearly depicts a significant change in his life.We see Arkady in fascination of his friend Bazarov at the beginning of the story. When describing him to his father, Nikolai, in a carriage on their way to his home, Arkady says, \\"Please, dad, make much of him. I can't tell you how I prize his friendship...he knows everything\\" (6). Bazarov studied medicine in college and is a firm believer in nihilism. Arkady idolizes these philosophical beliefs and takes them as his own. An interesting point to note is that in his conversation with his father we find out that Arkady had only met Bazarov recently, within the past few months. I'm sure everyone can recall a person who we met and instantly liked, accepting their beliefs and values without second thought, blinded by their charisma. Arkady was indeed blinded by Bazarov and quickly jumped into a close relationship with him.Bazarov and Arkady's belief in nothing causes friction when they get home. In a scene where the two young graduates are conversing with Arkady's father, Nikolai, and his Uncle, Pavel, there is immediate tension between generations. Naive persistence versus acquired maturity. Nikolai is an old farmer, and Pavel is a bonafide aristocrat, of whose kind Bazarov detests. Bazarov is quite alright with being rude to Pavel, and disrespectful towards Nikolai. Turgenev describes Bazarov in the conversation at the table as \\"not only not overawed, he gave abrupt and indifferent answers, and in the tone of his voice there was something churlish, almost insolent\\" (19). Even though Arkady subscribes to Bazarov's nihilistic beliefs, he still maintains respect for his family, despite their different beliefs. Arkady comments to his friend, \\"I must say...you weren't nice to him...you have hurt his feelings\\" (20). We see here that even though Arkady is following his friends lead, there are moments where we see the difference between the two. For instance, in a scene where Nikolai is heard playing the violoncello, Bazarov bursts out in laughter (due to his belief that art, literature, and music are irrelevant), yet Arkady does not feel the same. Bazarov simply thought it was foolish that Nikolai, the old farmer, would be playing music, and he \\"went on laughing; but much as he revered his master, this time Arkady did not even smile\\" (34).Bazarov and Arkady decided to travel to a certain town about twenty five miles distance from Arkady's home. While at the home of Sitnikov, Bazarov's old friend, we get some insight as to how Bazarov sees himself as godly. We hear it straight from Sitnikov when he is talking to Arkady and says, \\"I am an old acquaintance of Yevgeny Vassilyitch (Bazarov), and, I must say - his disciple. I am indebted to him for my regeneration....\\" (50). Arkady must have been starting to question his own value of Bazarov. While at a ball that the governor of town was holding, Arkady has further doubts, yet he can't verbalize them at this point in the story. Arkady is asked to introduce Bazarov to a woman named Madame Odintsov, a free thinking, independent woman. Bazarov describes her as having got \\"a pair of shoulders such as I've not set eyes on for a long while\\" (60). Arkady knew that Bazarov thought he could get any woman he wanted, and \\"was wounded by Bazarov's cynicism, but - as often happens - he reproached his friend not precisely for what he did not like in him...\\" (60). Arkady criticizes his friends low view of women, not his cynicism. This suggests that Arkady has serious doubts about his friend, but is somehow insecure in letting him know that. Arkady is continuing to realize that he does not hold to the exact beliefs as his friend.Their differences continue to be seen in their conversations with various people. Talking to Madame Odintsova at her house, \\"She turned the conversation upon music; but noticing that Bazarov did not appreciate art, she quietly brought it back to botany, even though Arkady was just launching into a discourse upon the significance of national melodies\\" (62). Arkady must have felt that he was but a shadow to his \\"friend\\". Why would he continue to be persecuted by beliefs he did not wholly accept to be true? It is painfully apparent that Arkady has a love for art. While at the home of Anna and Katya Sergyevna, two sisters they had the pleasure of meeting, Arkady was able to hear Katya, the younger sibling, play Mozart. Unlike how Bazarov would likely feel, Arkady has emotional ties to the music, for he \\"was particularly struck by the last part of the sonata\\" (69). Nihilists are not supposed to be \\"struck\\" by anything that has to do with music, art, literature, etc. Turgenev describes how Katya and Arkady would take walks together, how \\"Katya adored nature, and Arkady loved it , thought he did not dare to acknowledge it\\" (73). Needless to say, Arkady has a war going on inside of his soul. He is changing.A bit later in the book, Bazarov and Arkady travel to the former's house. In a scene where the two are resting on a haystack, we see some tension come out. We discover that it is not only Arkady who feels resentment. Bazarov outright insults Pavel in front on Arkady. He called him \\"very justly, an imbecile\\" (106). This infuriates Arkady, but he still tries to not have an argument, but Bazarov says, \\"let us quarrel for once in earnest\\" (106). Interestingly enough, it is Bazarov that wants to fight, he obviously feels hatred towards his \\"friend\\" when he says, \\"you'd be no match for me. I'd have you by the throat in a minute\\" (106). Turgenev actually describes Arkady as being afraid, after he heard this. Bazarov was so upset that \\"there was such menace in grim earnest in the smile that distorted his lips, and his glittering eyes\\" (106-107). Thankfully, Bazarov's father showed up rather unaware, just in time to announce that dinner was ready.Returning to his own home with Bazarov in tow, Arkady is troubled. Arkady changed. He was melancholic; \\"he actually was dull and longed to get away. He tried going long walks till he was tired, but that was no use\\" (115). Even in his own home, he felt disdain for life, for his relationship with Bazarov. Last time he brought Bazarov to his home, he couldn't stop singing his praises, yet now he sings a lament. So troubled Arkady travels to Nikolskoe, the town in which Anna and Katya reside, to ease his mind. He finally breaks free from Bazarov. He finds comfort with Katya, freedom from the chains of idolatry. He \\"looked more tranquil\\" (137). His peace is disturbed when Bazarov shows up to the house, and they quarrel again. Bazarov adequately puts it when he says, \\"a sentimentalist would say, \`I feel that our paths are beginning to part,' but I will simply say that we're tired of each other\\" (142).And how true Nietzsche's words are for these two comrades. They love one another as enemies, and hate each other as friends. Arkady started his journey with Bazarov on a positive note, idolizing him and his beliefs in every way. Slowly throughout the story there brews a war inside his soul. He begins to have doubt. He wants freedom from his cell, and that is what he gets in the end. He is finally able to overcome his fears and be honest with Bazarov. So in the end the two friends part ways, one ever naive in his cynicism, but one changed for the better."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Russian society has been prone to tremendous repudiations from all sides. There is a point in life at which intensity about certain things can shape the future, but woe to the character who falls in love with someone who has already become set in her ways. Nietzsche thought Socrates had more irony than we usually expect from philosophers because Socrates was married and sent the weeping women away when it was time to drink the hemlock. I sympathized with the characters in the novel Fathers and Sons, even at the point when one becomes incredibly fond of a woman he can't have. Expecting to change the world can stand in the way of having fun and prosperity.

It's a difficult read, no doubt, one that requires determination, perhaps equal to the determination of that protagonist Bazarov and his scientific determinism. As in any good novel, the weightier aspects of the story are gradually revealed, the more potent, effectual details saved for last. I found certain sections a bit winded, particularly some of the exchanges between the protagonist and his enamored disciple, and close friend Arcady. The copy I read is the Signet Classic, translated by Reavy. Russian literature is effective because it always seems to ruffle the feathers of the litterati elite.

It can be especially thrilling when you meet someone you consider to be a kindred spirit, a \\"bosom buddy\\" who shares your beliefs and ideals. In a mere matter of days, it is possible to feel as though you know everything about the other person and that there is nothing they can do to terminate the friendship. If, however, you take the next step in your friendship, and decide to live with the other person for a period of time, sharing living quarters beneficial or harmful to the established friendship. Such is the case for young Arkady in Ivan Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, who invites his college friend, Bazarov, to stay with him and his family for a period of time. Despite the close kinship and admiration Arkady feels for Bazarov at the opening of the novel, through living with him, Bazarov's poor relationship with Arkady's family, his arrogance, and ultimately, Bazarov's nihilist views, causes a rift in the two young men's friendship.At the commencement of the novel, Arkady is described as being young (14). Arkady's voice is even defined as being youthful (14). He calls his father, Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov, \\"daddy\\" when greeting him after arriving home from college, which also makes him seem a bit childish. He becomes \\"a little flurried and overcome with shyness\\" when introducing his friend, the \\"great Bazarov, about whom {he} has written so often\\" (14). Arkady's deportment is staunchly different from Bazarov's self-assured and intelligent demeanor (15).Shortly after Arkady arrives home, during dinner with his family and Bazarov, Arkady avoids calling his father daddy. He also tries to drink more. It seems that he does this because his family still regards him as a child, even though it seems that he clearly has now begun to regard himself as a man, despite the fact that he still does things that make him seem like a young child, like referring to his father as \\"daddy\\" (24). He does, however, seem to resort back to calling his father \\"daddy\\" when Bazarov is not present.The first disagreement Arkady has with Bazarov seems to occur shortly after the aforementioned dinner when Arkady tries to prove that he is no longer a child. Arkady does not share Bazarov's views on his uncle. Bazarov says that he finds his uncle, Pavel Petrovitch Kirsanov, \\"funny\\" but Arkady tells him that \\"he has a really good heart\\" (24).Throughout the novel, there continues to be more tension between Pavel and Bazarov. After discovering that Bazarov is a nihilist, Pavel makes a negative comment about Bazarov of which Arkady disapproves. However, when Bazarov and Pavel argue over art, Arkady seems to take his uncle's side. He tells Bazarov that he was \\"curt\\" with Pavel, and when Bazarov misunderstands something he says, he tells him to not be \\"so exasperating\\" (34). Arkady takes his uncle's side again when Bazarov speaks reproachfully about Russians. Arkady says that his uncle not far off when he accused Bazarov of having a low opinion of Russians (49). The second time Bazarov and Pavel have a heated discussion, Arkady even becomes embarrassed by some of Bazarov's remarks to his uncle (80). By the end of the novel, Bazarov and Arkady have a heated discussion regarding Pavel, and Bazarov expresses the desire to fight Arkady because of it.Bazarov and Arkady also differ on their views of Arkady's father. First, he disagrees with him on his father's relationship with Fenichka, who is Nikolai's housekeeper and mother of Nikolai's son. Arkady believes that his father should marry her because she is the mother of his child. Bazarov, being a nihilist, and not believe in marriage, does not agree. Bazarov even tells Arkady that he did not expect him to \\"attach some importance to the marriage tie\\" (49).The second point on which Arkady and Bazarov disagree regarding his Nikolai is on Nikolai's romanticism. Bazarov laugh at Nikolai for playing the cello, but Arkady does not share his amusement over the situation (50). Bazarov also says that Arkady's father is a \\"backnumber\\" and that his day is over (51). As he does with his uncle, Bazarov points out that Arkady does not truly know his father (51). The only point on which they agree when it comes to Nikolai is that he should read more intellectual books. Arkady even takes about his father's book, and gives him something more academic to read (52).The second factor that causes a rift in Bazarov's and Arkady's friendship is Bazarov's arrogance. Throughout the novel, Bazarov seems to make several comments that seem to suggest that he has an unflattering view of most people, but things rather highly of himself. He tells Arkady that he hates people (132). He tells also says to Arkady that attractive women have no need to understand their conversations, and seems to always be surprised when he finds himself in the company of a somewhat intelligent woman (74). The two women he seems to have high regards for are Madame Odintsova, who is a young widow whom he eventually falls in love with, and Fenichka.Bazarov also seems to believe that he is a god. While at Nicolskoye, Madame Odintsova's residence, Arkady expresses frustration over the fact that Bazarov's acquaintance, Viktor Sitnikov, came there unannounced and uninvited. Bazarov says that he is aware that Arkady is \\"still stupid\\" because he \\"needs such louts\\" because \\"it is not for the gods to glaze pottery\\" (112). This causes Arkady to question whether Bazarov considers him to be a god, also. When Arkady asks Bazarov, he merely says again that Arkady is \\"still stupid\\" (112). It is through this conversation that \\"the whole bottomless pit of Bazarov's arrogance is revealed to him\\" (112). Shortly after this, the two men leave Nicolskoye, and Arkady feels as if the 16 miles ride is actually like 30 (115).Finally, what truly causes the most major rift in Bazarov's and Arkady's relationship is one of the points on which they initially agreed. Bazarov is a nihilist, Arkady claims to be one also, but it is clear throughout the novel that he does not hold to the principles of nihilism as firmly as Bazarov. While at Nicolskoye, Arkady finds that he enjoys the company of Madame Odintsova's sister, Katya, even though he initially seems to express interest in Madame Odintsova. Katya plays the piano, and as a nihilist, Arkady should not enjoy listening to her play, but he does. Bazarov almost makes Arkady try when he accusing him of playing the piano, himself (104). This would have been a major slight to Arkady, because by accusing him of expressing interest in the arts, Bazarov was indicated that he did not really believe Arkady was a nihilist, and nihilism was the philosophy Bazarov conclude holds the most truth.Much to his chagrin, Bazarov finds that he has fallen in love with Madame Odintsova. Because of his views, however, he cannot truly allow himself to love her. He recognizes that he does not view her in the same manner as he does other women, but also knows that they do not align with his nihilism. Arkady, also has interest in Madame Odintsova, but by the end of the novel, realizes that he truly loves her sister, Katya (181).After Arkady announces his proposal of marriage to Katya, Bazarov and Arkady discuss the end of their friendship (186). As a nihilist, Bazarov cannot truly accept Arkady's marriage, but he does express that he believes that this is the best choice for Arkady. He says that he believes that Arkady is not really cut out for their nihilistic lifestyle (186).Despite their close relationship at the beginning of the novel, the two college friends, Arkady and Bazarov find themselves distant as the book closes. Bazarov passes away, and before his death can barely remember his friend, Arkady. Arkady marries Katya, and has a child with her. It is apparent by the end of their friendship, that Arkady and Bazarov are completely different men who cannot really relate to one another. The relationship between the two men could not withstand Bazarov's mockery of Arkady's family, arrogance and nihilism. Their relationship could not adapt, or bend, rather the men found that in the end, their relationship was broken."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Ivan Turgenev's &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; ranks with his &quot;Sketches from a Hunter's Album&quot; as one of the most perfectly written and deeply moving books I have ever read. It far surpasses most of Dostoyevsky's works and possibly, in my opinion, could outrank even Tolstoy. A reader with a good knowledge of Russia will not fail to appreciate &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; and will not at all regret the cost of this book. I was not able to put it down, not so much from being riveted to an adventurous plot, but from being captivated by the sublime, marvelous beauty of Turgenev's prose (and, of course, Rosemary Edmonds' wonderful translation). &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; is a very powerful book, eye-opening and profoundly sad, which every reader will appreciate."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Isn't it so true! -- and it always will be so, as it has in the past. Perhaps Baby Boomers reading this review will recall what their parents thought of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc. ... and what many of us, at the same time thought about the Nixonian \\"Establishment\\" *.* Who was right? I'll encourage you to answer this one.But, as to this book, it's one of the finest Russian Classics I've ever read (and I've read many -- see my listmania lists on Russian works). It's a MYTH that all Russian novels are dreary -- you can even find humor stowed away here and there in Dostoyevsky if you actually read him. You'll find this book especially upbeat, for the most part. It has its serious moments but it also conveys notable hilarity and absurdity as well, ergo, \\"the duel\\"!Two young educated men: 1) come into philosophical conflict with their respective elders, and, 2) fall in love with their respective female fancies. \\"It's as simple as that,\\" as Tolstoy would say!The ending is one of the most compelling closings I've ever encountered. It's quite moving and the Hallmark of a shrewd novelist. I think that the ending, in particular, makes this work as savoury for women as it is for men, perhaps even moreso. At 157 pages, it's a pretty fast read.Michael Katz, (Professor of Slavic Languages, University of Texas), did a fine job on this particular translation -- very fluid and smooth reading. There are also some very informative, but brief, footnotes in this edition which are imperative for the reader who is not much apprised of Russian culture of this period (it takes place just prior to the elimination of Russian serfdom which happened in the early 1860s).This work is also a good warm up prequel, as some have mentioned, to the Russian Mother of All Novels: \\"War and Peace\\" (Tolstoy). However, I will point out one chief difference between the writing styles of Tolstoy and Turgenev... Tolstoy is DEEP, psychologically speaking and exudes tons of sub-plots. Turgenev is straightforward and he writes directly that to which he has witnessed in life... nothing more. It's infinitely readable to all.This is a fine novel for anyone who enjoys peeking into the daily inner-workings and inevitable peccadillos of the average family.

Later, Fenitchka confesses discomfort around Pavel, due to Bazarov's romantic advances in the garden. Was I alone in seeing a bit of the ole wist of the bachelor (which is refered to several times in the novel, apropos of Pavel) in Pavel's appreciation of Fenitchka and babe?2. The duel between Pavel and Bazarov is masterfully and elegantly rendered. Piotr cringing behind a tree in my edition's woodcut was a bonus.3. The melancholy that pervades the entire book.

Turgenev comments on topics ranging from social conditions in the Russian Empire to the transitory nature of philosophical systems of belief. The tone of the book is gentle, even affectionate, toward its characters, hardly the tone that one expects from a highly controversial novel. I believe that its is what makes it so effective in communicating Turgenev's meaning. Perhaps it is this, in turn, that made it so controversial."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"The art involved in creating this novel is what makes it a truly amazing and valuable piece of literature. Each character has characteristics that are very human. The thoughts,ideas, and ideals of the very different characters are the entirety of the plot. Turgenev does such an implorable job of creating conflict, that he doesn't need to place the characters in any action in order to attract the reader. This is a must read for any fan of Russian literature!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"In this novel, Turgenev names, defines, and discusses the concept &quot;nihilism.&quot; This book belongs in the same league with Dostoyevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and Camus' &quot;The Stranger,&quot; as a masterpiece that successfully marries literature, philosophy, and valuable psychological insights. Through the character of Bazarov we also get a whiff of the character of the Russian society--and not just of the mid 19th century, but also of the Russian society today--a society chosen by history to be a place of drastic measures and extremes. It is no wonder that since Turgenev's time, Russian society and its intellectuals have oscillated between anarchy and tyranny, idealism and cynicism. Turgenev, who came from a wealthy family and never needed to write to make a living, nevertheless was a prolific author, and with this novel he made a significant contribution to Russian and world literature."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"It's easy to get lost in a sub-plot and believe that this book is about a sociopolitical clash between the old and the new, with the new being a nihilist forerunner of Russian revolution. But the book is extremely weak in the area of political discussion. As a political statement this book would be a dismal failure. Fortunately, the little bit of oversimplified politics that was tossed carelessly into the book is fairly irrelevant to the story.This book is as good as anything ever produced in Russian literature, in the class of Solzhenitsyn, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. It's good because it's emotional.For me, the main character is one who appears for a very short time and seems to be a minor character - Bazarov's father. His love of his son, and the relationship between Arkady and his father, are what the book is named after, and what it's about. I love the protest that Bazarov's father makes to God.Two school graduates, Arkady and Bazarov, return home to their families after years away at school. Nihilist Bazarov clashes with Arkady's traditionalist uncle, but don't all generations clash a little over something. That's part of the relationship. Both young men fall in love with local women. I think Arkady and Katia would be great together. She would treat him like a king and lead him by the nose, and he would adore her his whole life and do whatever she told him to do."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Henry James wrote of Turgenev, \\"No one has had a closer vision, or a hand at once more ironic and more tender, for the individual figure . . . all its particulars of weakness and strength, of ugliness and beauty, of oddity and charm.\\" This ability to create characters simultaneously flawed and admirable (or, to put it crassly, likeable and unlikeable), James correctly believed, helped Turgenev stay clear \\"from any peril of caricature.\\"The young intelligentsia who were Turgenev's contemporaries, however, failed to see beyond the barbed myopia of the two lead characters of the book, Arkady and especially his friend Bazarov. Unable to look past the zealous pretensions of the nihilists in the novel, Russian youth read it as a mockery. (That the older, liberal generation of the book doesn't come off any better seems to have been lost on them.) \\"I was struck by hands I wanted to clasp,\\" the author lamented; his sympathies had actually been with his younger characters.But the satire, both perceived and real, of the political and intellectual trends of the day are not what make \\"Fathers and Sons\\" so powerful. The struggle between the new ideas of the young and the status quo of their elders is eternal; Turgenev could substitute \\"nihilism\\" with virtually any philosophical or intellectual trend and still have a similar novel, different only in the details. Like Austen, he weaves his plot wholly from the relationships between his characters: the older Pavel's disdain for the two young nihilists, Arkady's love for Katya, Bazarov's thwarted overtures toward Madame Odintsova, the tensions of both young men between each other and with their parents. Each of these relationships generates its own power on the page; for example, the scene in which Bazarov leaves his parents, whose traditionalism and backwardness embarrass and aggravate the newly minted dilettante, is one of the most heartrending in literature, and Turgenev pulls it off without resorting to undue sentimentality.When I read the novel in my youth, I was fascinated (and distracted) by the Russian historical setting--the serfs and the landlords, the importation of Western culture into St. Petersburg society, the philosophical trends of the day. Although all those things are wonderful elements of the novel, I now realize that's a little like reading \\"Oedipus the King\\" and focusing on life in Thebes. A more recent second reading revealed to me the universality of Turgenev's story. As its title suggests, \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is a masterpiece not simply because it is a great novel about Russia, but because it is a great novel about families."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Every since the beginning of time there has been generational conflict but also love between parents and children. In his classic Russian masterpiece of 1861 the novelist Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883)illuminates these issues in a short book of 225 pages. We see different philosophies from the characters ranging from skepticism to pious Christian belief.The novel is set shortly before the emancipation of the Russian serfs in 1861. Arkady, a young graduate of the University of Petersburg, and his friend Barzhov, a medical student, arrive at his father Nikolai's small run down estate. Barzhov and Arkady are nihilists who wish to eschew every form of romanticism in life. They claim to disdain music and poetry believing in materialism and scientific progress. Barzhov is a pre-Bolshevist in his disdain of traditional religion, morals and Russian society. He is influenced by Hegel and urges revolution in Russia. Arkady is a shallower and weaker young man. He loves his father, his old roue of an uncle Pavel who lives on the estate and is a follower of Barzhov. The two former students learn Nikolai has a young mistress who has produced a child. They cast no scorn on Nikolai for this reality and wish the old man well. It is obvious that Arkady is a man who loves his father, mourns his mother and old nursemaid and enjoys the beauty and simplicity of the Russian countryside.Later in the novel there will be two romances. Barzhov feels attracted to the wealthy and beautiful Anna while Arkady falls for her younger sister. Barzov dies helping peasants during a typhoid epidemic while Arkady weds the young lady he has been courting. Father Nikolai weds the mistress and the couple live happily together on their estate.The novel is famous for its introduction of nihilism in Russian fiction. Barzhov is a fascinating and complex human being. He speaks against marriage and love but it is clear he is a man who loves and feels deeply. His deathbed scene is short but powerful. The picture of his weeping parents visiting his grave is a high emotional mountain in the land of literature. It is a scene not easily forgotten. This is a book calling out for a modern screen treatment.Turgenev is excellent in his lyrical descriptions of the Russian peasants, the changing seasons and the flora and fauna of the countryside. Despite several readings I always enjoy this powerful prose work of a master of the art. If you are just beginning to read Russian literature this is an excellent short work to begin your journey. The long introductory essay on the life and works of Turgenev and the liberal agenda in nineteenth century Tsarist Russia is also a classic deserving of your attention. Excellent and moving. This is a novel to be cherished!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev. Published by MobileReference (mobi).Everything in the novel testifies to Turgenev's faith in humanity, without ever seeming didactic or boring. All of the characters are sympathetic, and I could imagine actually traveling with them or engaging in conversation with them. Turgenev is a wonderful stylist - economical, precise, and lyrical when it befits his characters."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"In so much of Turgenev's finest fiction, love fades, slips away, vanishes before it can even flower; the mood of these stories is melancholy, nostalgic; the writing, delicate, precise, almost translucent. Turgenev was to be the only Russian writer with avowedly European outlook and sympathies.The objectivity of Turgenev as a chronicler of the Russian intelligentsia is apparent in his early novels. Unsympathetic though he may have been to some of the trends in the thinking of the younger, radical generation that emerged after the Crimean War, he endeavoured to portray the positive aspirations of these young men and women with scrupulous candour. Their attitude to him, particularly that of such leading figures as the radical critics Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov, was generally cold when it was not actively hostile. His own rather self-indulgent nature was challenged by the forcefulness of these younger contemporaries. He moved away from an emphasis on the fallibility of his heroes, who had been attacked as a type by Chernyshevsky. Instead, Turgenev focused on their youthful ardour and their sense of moral purpose. These attributes had obvious revolutionary implications that were not shared by Turgenev, whose liberalism could accept gradual change but opposed anything more radical, especially the idea of an insurgent peasantry.Turgenev's greatest novel, Fathers and Sons, grew from this sense of involvement and yet succeeded in illustrating, with remarkable balance and profundity, the issues that divided the generations. The hero, Bazarov, is the most powerful of Turgenev's creations. A nihilist, denying all laws save those of the natural sciences, uncouth and forthright in his opinions, he is nonetheless susceptible to love and by that token doomed to unhappiness. In sociopolitical terms he represents the victory of the nongentry revolutionary intelligentsia over the gentry intelligentsia to which Turgenev belonged. In artistic terms he is a triumphant example of objective portraiture, and in the poignancy of his death he approaches tragic stature. The miracle of the novel as a whole is Turgenev's superb mastery of his theme, despite his personal hostility toward Bazarov's anti-aestheticism, and his success in endowing all the characters with a quality of spontaneous life. Yet at the novel's first appearance the radical younger generation attacked it bitterly as a slander, and the conservatives condemned it as too lenient in its exposure of nihilism.Turgenev's novels are &quot;months in the country,&quot; which contain balanced contrasts such as those between youth and age, between the tragic ephemerality of love and the comic transience of ideas, between Hamlet's concern with self and the ineptitudes of the quixotic pursuit of altruism. Always touchy about his literary reputation, Turgenev reacted to the almost unanimously hostile reception given to Fathers and Sons by leaving Russia. He took up residence in Baden-Baden in southern Germany. Quarrels with Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky and his general estrangement from the Russian literary scene made him an exile in a very real sense. This book will give you the climate of Russia at the time, it's like a keg of powder waiting to explode!"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Read today and out of context Fathers and Sons hardly seems like a classic next to Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, etc... However, understood as a template for the greatness to come in Russian literature, Turgenev masterpiece must be appreciated for the complexity of its characters and its bravery in exposing Russian society. Beyond this, it is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Because there are several editions of this novel available to buy, and some much cheaper than this one, I first wanted to highlight that I believe this one is by far the best to date, for two reasons: the translator, Rosemary Edmonds' version, is elegant and smooth, and her own introduction is excellent - providing meaningful reflection and understanding not only of the novel, but Turgenev's talent, other works, and the political and literary times he lived through. The second major reason is because this edition (I think) is the only one that contains Isaiah Berlin's brilliant, insightful lecture on the novel that he first gave in 1970, and was included in this edition from 1975 onwards, and that offers much insight into the novel's historical context and background in terms of philosophy and politics in Russia during Turgenev's lifetime.While I also love the fiction of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, having read this, still Turgenev's most famous and popular novel, followed then by reading Edmonds' introduction, I was not surprised to learn from her that it was Turgenev who proved to be the most popular Russian novelist in Europe during the shared lifetimes of these three giant authors and, throughout the 1850s and 60s, Turgenev was likewise and the most famous and popular in Russia - while, fascinatingly, also being the most controversial - there was passionate debate both for and against Turgenev and this novel - that continued at least up until the 1950s! - despite having spent most of his life abroad, living in Paris, in particular (while always devoted to Russia and its people, he was definitely a passionate Europhile).Turgenev's greater popularity, compared with his two most famous counterparts, I feel, rests on the deeper humanity and, thereby, psychological and emotional complexity, he breathes into his principal characters from their first introduction; whereas with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, it seems to me that their own characters' complexity originates more from subsequent experiences of trauma, crisis and conflict in their lives.Of the characters themselves, there is much to enjoy, be engaged as well as challenged by. Bazarov and Arkady, university students, take a holiday together, visiting Arkady's landlord and liberal-minded, caring father (Nikolai) and uncle (Pavel), formerly a distinguished army captain, at Nikolia's farm and home, with whom Pavel also lives. The conflict between \`fathers and sons' is played out primarily in this holiday, arising because of Bazarov's deepseated nihilism and his insistent, relentlessly stern advocacy of his negative, annihilistic views as he expresses them towards Nikolai and Pavel.The story is worth reading just two characters alone: Bazarov himself, who is vividly infuriating and an anti-hero one will never forget on reading. He is supremely arrogant and contemptuous of others; recognising no rules of conduct or recognition of anything of value, save that which he himself defines and determines; is rude to his charming and much devoted friend, Arkady, who is himself in such awe of Bazarov and he can't help but give allegiance to him and his negative vision and attitude towards society, history, life in general (and particular). Even though this allegiance, along with Bazarov's comments, confound and upset Arkady's father - and frankly infuriate Pavel, ironically it is Bazarov's nihilistic own rejection of Arkady's friendship that brings Arkady to his senses, thereby explicitly reaffirming his humanism, empathy and love he always felt for both his father and uncle.While Nikolai and Arkady are also very well drawn, besides Bazarov, the other character who is memorable, amusing - with a caustic sense of humour and irony -superbly realised, and great fun to read about - is Pavel. He's a Russian who, while now elderly, remains as he was from his youth: distinguished, handsome, a reputation as a \`lady-killer', with an aristocratic flair, and besotted with English bespoke and colourful tailoring and fancy accoutrements (handkerchiefs, cufflinks, neckerchiefs). He's also deeply civilised, graceful, yet in no doubt of his views, with a strong and independent viewpoint and depth of character. He is also deeply generous and caring, having giving much of his money to Nikolai, to help him keep his farm and land.And the intense debates between Pavel (increasingly infuriated), and Bazarov (bored, steely, deeply rude and negative), are worth the price of the novel many times over."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Turgenev's Fathers and Sons is a rare classic novel that combines a story set in an era of social and political change in feudal Russia with a theme regarding generational conflict that has a timeless relevance to any age. His characters capture the tensions of youth filled with passion over new ideas clashing with the established ways of their elders.It is classically Russian in that the flow of the novel is driven by dialogue between the various characters rather than significant action on their part, although there is a romantic element to the story that fits perfectly as a subplot echoing the family tensions between the 2 young men and their fathers.Bazarov , whose introduction into the home of his friend Arcady sets the story in motion, is a self-proclaimed nihilist and his idealism and passion are the straw that stirs the drink of much that follows. Some of Turgenev's characters are reluctant to face the obvious changes taking place in their society and the resulting gap between modern and traditional beliefs and ways of life underly much of what drives these characters to act in the way they do.Fathers and Sons is a relatively easy book to read and enjoy when compared with the more challenging works of other Russian novelists but it is as extremely rewarding as it is accessible.

There is a lot going on here, reflective not only of how people interact with each other, but also of Russia at a certain period. The wordsmithing here is masterful, either a tribute to the author or the translator or both. But the real power of this novel is the classic story of the interaction between generations, between the sexes and between the classes.

While is presents a slice of life in Russia in the 1800s, the theme of the older generation's impatience and lack of understandng of that of the younger generation is timeless. It is peculiarly Russian, with much of the heated exchanges between the main characters being about the need for social change in the Russian aristocracy of the time. And, as is typical of youthful views, (or of change and revolution perhaps), the two positions are at extreme odds with each other. If you enjoy social and political history, families, and intellectual debate, this is a fine piece of literature."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"'Fathers and Sons' by Turgenev is no doubt a very importnat book - considered to be Turgenev best work, it features beautiful poetic descriptions, very sharp and wiity dialogues, poignant characters - some spiky and some very soft, and conflicts that will never die and remain relevant until today (like that of nihilism - the term which was coined by Turgenev in this book). It is very captivating and i found Bazarov to be a very interesting charcter (although it seems less original when you look on the literature of the last century. We must remember Bazarov was the Father of the Nihlisits to come. and the originality is his).

Ivan Turgenev's novel, Fathers and Sons is, in my view, such a book. Turgenev was not well liked in Russia in his lifetime and is not now, even, regarded as among the foremost of Russian novelists and for good reason. Turgenev scorned his mother country, spending much of this life in France living with the woman he loved and her husband. In the novel he also has a son (Arcady) gently remove from his father a book by Puskin he was reading, substituting for it a book by a German writer no less--high sacrilege even in 19th century Russia. More to the point, in the two young men who are the focal point of the story, Turgenev created characters who display a negative and even hostile view of Russia.The novel has three settings. The first is at the country estate of Nicholas Petrovich Kusimov whose son, Arcady has just graduated from the university and is returning home accompanied by his fellow graduate and mentor, Eugene Vassilich Bazarov. It is Bazarov who becomes the lighting rod and center of the plot. He instantly quarrels with Nicholas' brother, Paul, an aristocratic defender of the status quo. Arcady shares Eugene's nilistic view of life, but is clearly softer and less critical than his intense friend.After a time the pair go to town where they meet Madame Anna Sergeyevna Odinizov, a youngish (29) widow living in relative luxury with her younger sister, Katya. Both young men fall in love with the widow, Arcady with the sort of hopeless puppy love attraction for an older woman and Eugene without admitting it, in a more mature manner. Madame Odinizov is drawn to Eugene's mental acuities and intensity, but it is not clear that she loves him. Arcady, for his part, finds solace with the younger and more submissive Katya. Finally Bazarov blurts out his love for Madame Odinizov which she seemingly rejects and the two young men leave to visit Bazarov's parents.Vassily Ivanich Bazarov is a retired army doctor who now lives with his kind-hearted wife, Arina, on a farm. Both parents, especially, Arina, are thrilled that their son has returned home, but Eugene scorns them as he has all others. Finally after some days he says he is bored and wants to leave. The parents are heartbroken, but understand that their son has greatness in him and cannot be confined to living in obscurity. Arcady then returns to Madame Odinizov's and develops his relationship with Katya, while Eugene returns to the Kusimov estate to resume his biological experiments.The greatness of the book, where it leaves an indelible impression, comes in the last 50 pages. The tragedy that occurs comes suddenly and unexpectedly and touches the lives of all the characters. It will touch your life too and leave you with a greater appreciation for life in all its wonders and futility."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"I can't believe this is the best Turgenev could do for a nihilist character: a grumpy geek who loves frogs.

It is a desire that most find hard to resist and few are ultimately able to withstand. One can imagine all kinds of fads, including forms of entertainment and styles of dress. All of these things bring pleasure for a time, but eventually lose their luster and novelty. But there is another kind of fad that spreads among friends, and that fad is in following unusual philosophical beliefs. This trend was responsible for Arkady's temporary fascination with a friend named Bazarov. But, as hobbies tend to go, once Arkady began to see the disadvantages of following his friend's new philosophy, he gradually pulled away from Bazarov and turned back to his family. The key moments which altered Arkady's relationship with Bazarov - and nihilism - were Bazarov's insulting Arkady's family, his utter arrogance in thinking himself a god, and his disdain for love.In order to set the context for the story, it is important to take notice to Arkady's relationship with his family. From the very beginning of Fathers and Sons, it is made evident that Arkady has a deep love for them. As soon as he reunites with his father, the first words out of his mouth display his childlike love for his \\"daddy.\\" We begin to understand his simple love even more when we read that \\"he gaily responded to his father's caresses\\" (4) as they hugged. Again, as they load up their carriage for the ride home, Arkady \\"[turns] round quickly to his father, and [gives] him a sounding kiss on the cheek\\" (6). His love extends to his Uncle Pavel as well, and he soon asks about the man's well-being (5). Uncle Pavel also receives a hug from his nephew (16), and Arkady talks highly of him to Bazarov (6, 21-23, 25). The deep-seated affection of Arkady for his family is easy to identify.As with most college-age students, Arkady is at a point in his life where he is trying to figure out how to balance his love for family with his desire to be his own man. This task is especially burdensome to him in light of his admiration of Bazarov, whom they have invited to stay with them for a while. With Bazarov present, Arkady watches himself carefully in order to guard from looking too childish in the eyes of his friend (7). As Arkady himself says, he believes Bazarov to be a \\"great friend\\" (4) and \\"splendid fellow (5), who's friendship he prizes (6). But as time passes, Arkady slowly begins to recognize that his colleague is not as winsome as he once thought. With the stage set, let us look at the first instance when Arkady begins to part ways with Bazarov.After meeting the father and uncle, Bazarov declares to Arkady his less than agreeable impressions of them. He calls Uncle Pavel \\"a queer fish\\" and \\"an antique survival\\" (12). Obviously, he was not meaning to compliment him with these words. He goes on to put down Nikolai, the father, by saying \\"he wastes his time,\\" \\"doesn't know much,\\" and is \\"shy and nervous\\" (12, 13). Later, he gets into an argument with Pavel about his nihilistic views, and Arkady gently reprimands him afterward saying, \\"you weren't nice to him...you have hurt his feelings\\" (21). In an attempt to defend his uncle, Arkady tells Bazarov of his hard life, ending with rebuking him for judging his uncle unjustly, as well as telling him \\"it's a sin to despise [Pavel]\\" (25). But even his friend's remarks about his uncle do not offend him as much as his making fun of his father's playing the violoncello. It is at this point that Arkady first apprehends of his friend's objectionable personality (34). This is only the beginning of his steady drift from the unruly nihilist.As I said before, fads tend to fall out of vogue quickly, and Arkady's hasty admiration of Bazarov's nihilism is no exception. He has already seen how rude Bazarov was with his family, and he soon finds out why this lawless man finds it so easy to insult others. While staying at the home of two elegant female friends, Arkady and Bazarov's visit is cut short by the appearance of an unseemly and unannounced visitor named Sitnikov. Feeling the loss of a possibly significant relationship with Katya, one of the two women, Arkady starts to complain about the arrival of Sitnikov. Bazarov takes this as an opportunity to make a jab at Arkady, calling him a fool himself, and then describing his need for such fools because \\"it's not for the gods to bake bricks\\" (88). Obviously, this insults Arkady, but it also shows him \\"in a flash all the fathomless depths of Bazarov's conceit\\" (88). Upon asking for clarification, Arkady finds out that Bazarov truly does believe himself a god, but Arkady as only a \\"dolt\\" and a \\"fool\\" (88). I believe it is at this point that Arkady's most significant and substantial departure from his former friend takes place. He is deeply hurt, but also genuinely astounded at the extent of Bazarov's pompous and braggadocios estimation of himself. From this point forward, Arkady's relationship with Bazarov never fully recovers.With their relationship devastated by Bazarov's insults and detestable arrogance, it doesn't take long for Arkady to take his final steps away from this nihilist: not caring about Bazarov's opinions, and rejecting his philosophy. A little later in the story, Arkady returns to visit Katya and to declare his love for her (148), something of which the nihilist would surely disapprove. While talking to Katya, she tells him that she has noticed he is no longer under Bazarov's influence (137) and that he is \\"different from him\\" (138). Even Bazarov begins to see their lives diverging when he says, \\"A sentimentalist would say, \`I feel that our paths are beginning to part,' but I will simply say that we're tired of each other\\" (142). Before parting however, he takes one last shot at Arkady's new belief in love, saying it is \\"purely [an] imaginary feeling\\" (143). This does not affect Arkady, and by later that evening, with Katya by his side, he has already \\"completely forgot[ten] about his former teacher\\" (151).Arkady and Bazarov's relationship is crippled, and eventually made near non-existent by Bazarov's insults toward Arkady's family, his complete and utter arrogance, and his critical view on love. By the end of the story, we see Arkady has become a new man. He has seemingly rejected nihilism, embraced meaning in life, and begun to explore the joys of deeply loving another human being. With the dismissal of the philosophical fad of nihilism, Arkady has moved on to better and brighter things. In fact, his moving forward is actually moving back to the romantic ideals and traditions he was raised with. While nihilism may have brought a sense of pride and place in a type of exclusive club for philosophers, it was not worth giving up the things which were so dear to him. As he says goodbye to Bazarov, and to nihilism, truly he has been given a new chance at life."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"romantic russian literature, really interestinglovely cover picture in color of a red russian print scarf on entire page. beautiful, i saved it.liked the paper its printed on too, felt like antique paper, really nice"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Perhaps because it was originally written in Russian & translated to English, it was a little wordy.

They are not exaggerated or dramatic, their thoughts do not shift back and forth, and there is not alot of pondering. In the end, wherever the history takes, there is a sense of continuation of life, \\"However passionate, sinning, and rebellious the heart hidden in the tomb, the flowers growing over it peep serenely at us with their innocent eyes; they tell us not of eternal peace alone, of that great peace of \\"indifferent\\" nature; they tell us, too, of eternal reconciliation and of life without end."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"I read this book for a Russian history class, dreading it at first it came to be the book I most enjoyed out of the class.

It does start a little slow, esp by modern standards, but if you like to read great literature, and you haven't read this, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Turgenev's novels express a continual desire to find a new model for the Russian male, a hero for the time - idealistic and progressive, but also practical, his nature and strength still rooted in the very land itself. While some of these characteristics are evident in the heroes of Nest of the Gentry, On The Eve and Rudin, there's still something lacking, the Russian men still ruled by their hearts more than their minds, unable to break from the shackles of old society, old tradition and old ways of thinking.In Fathers and Sons (1862), Turgenev creates a character, a Nihilist, to overthrow these old values. Into Bazarov, Turgenev pours all the qualities that he believes the Russian man should have - stout-hearted, educated, intelligent, decent and self-sacrificing, yet ruthlessly contemptuous of old ways. He is no respecter of the \\"sacred tradition\\", the aristocracy, or indeed the lower classes, who still cling to the securities they knew under the old feudal system. Ironically, the nihilistic, revolutionary character of Bazarov would find favour with neither the old establishment nor the new regime, making life in Russia difficult for Turgenev (who had already been imprisoned for his support of Gogol), and later see him going into exile.Fathers and Sons however goes beyond the historical importance of the work, touching on sentiments in the father/son relationship that are still relevant today - the need to break with the past and overturn old ideals, and the sadness of the wedge that this places between parent and child, but the necessity of doing so in order to find a new and better expression in the evolving modern world. In many ways however, the world in Fathers and Sons still resembles that of Rudin, with the same kind of characters, landowners and aristocrats on country estates, with the same social divisions, having the same fruitless discussions about art, family and society - even if it is to condemn them here - while forming romantic attachments.Fathers and Sons however is certainly a much better constructed and balanced novel than Rudin, the characters actively pursuing revolution rather than merely talking about it, although perhaps because of their very nature, they still fail to make a significant impression on society. Turgenev's model of Bazarov as a character for the future of the new Russia therefore doesn't entirely succeed and there is still some romanticism both in the character and Turgenev's depiction of him. It would take better writers like Tolstoy and Chekhov to delve deeper into the Russian character - and human nature - and bring it out in all its complexities and contradictions. Bazarov then is very much a hero for his time, and Fathers and Sons, although perhaps Turgenev's best novel with much to admire in it, is also very much of its time, while Tolstoy and Chekhov are eternal."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Since I am studying Russian, I am now engaged in exploring many Russian classic novels and a few poems too (Pushkin mostly). I have had a hard time with \\"War & Peace\\" but enjoyed immensely Turgenev's \\"fathers and sons\\". It was written around 1861 I believe, but it is modern in the sense that generational conflicts are happening today as they did when the author lived. His descriptions of human nature are intuitive, detailed but not as lengthy and exhausting as you find them in some of Tolstoy's earlier works; (see above). The young nihilists then might have been replaced by other norm-busting attitudes of today's young generation, but it is obvious that old and young don't get along too well. Turgenev's style is fluid, creating amazing imageries, and to me at least, it provided me a deep insight into a Russian society which was on the brink of breaking with the past and delving into a tumultuous future as we now know."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Though not Russian fiction's father in Nikolai Gogol's sense of adapting the language and producing its first notable fictional works, Ivan Turgenev is the direct antecedent of the psychological characterization and philosophical dramatization that is most closely associated with it and thus arguably its true father. Fathers and Sons, his most famous work and masterpiece, was the first Russian novel to attract Western praise, particularly winning over Henry James, who hailed it as a masterwork and championed Turgenev over the Russian writers who soon overshadowed him. One can debate Turgenev's merits relative to giants like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy, but he certainly provides an interesting contrast, and Fathers and Sons has long had an indisputable place alongside their great works in the world canon.The book is of course most famous for Evgeny Vasilevich Bazarov, its protagonist, who is both painstakingly realistic and thoroughly symbolic. He typifies the young, European-influenced, middle-class liberal that Turgenev rightly thought was a rising Russian power. A self-proclaimed nihilist, he rejects religion, conventional morality, and nearly every other traditional Russian virtue. He claims to believe in nothing but has a great passion for science and seems to believe in a sort of self-reliance. Though influenced by archetypes like Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, he was an essentially original creation - Turgenev's most memorable and famous character. Anyone at all familiar with Russian literature can immediately see that he became a prototype, his most famous manifestation being Raskolnikov in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment a few years later. However, he is interesting enough in his own right, and his ambivalent depiction is fascinating. Though he is ostensibly a cautionary figure, a negative example, Turgenev was open-minded enough not to condemn him outright. His dark end is indeed a warning that pure nihilism is a dead end, but Turgenev at times seems as enthralled by Bazarov as anyone. This ambiguity was the main reason that the novel got very mixed reviews; it satisfied neither those who sympathized with Bazarov nor those who condemned him. Turgenev was stung and wrote less prolifically and enthusiastically from then on, but time has shown that the uncertain portrayal is exactly the book's greatest strength. Bazarov represents a path that Russia could have taken - or, if you will, one pole of human nature -, though admittedly an extreme one, and cannot be lauded or condemned outright. Turgenev was brave enough to give an honest portrayal, and the profoundly believable and insightful psychological portrait retains its power. Bazarov is one of the most interesting characters in a century full of great ones. He is hard to fully love or hate; he certainly has many despicable qualities, but only Pollyannas can deny some of his points, and the force with which he argues, in combination with his cynical apathy, has a certain perverse charm. We can debate him and what he stands for ad nauseum, but it is unlikely that anyone who reads the book will soon forget him.There is of course far more to the novel, not least its vivid dramatization of the title's implied generation gap. Turgenev saw an ever-widening chasm between the liberals of his generation and the Bazarovs, dramatizing it with striking verisimilitude and stunning philosophical and psychological depth. His generation is represented by the brothers Nikolai and Pavel Petrovich Kirsanov. They have also embraced Europeanization but in ways that Bazarov finds contemptibly superficial: speaking French, wearing foreign clothes, etc. More fundamental is their continued clinging to traditional morality and institutions. Their interactions with Bazarov make clear that, religion and morality aside, the generation gap was to a great extent a class issue. The Kirsanovs are aristocrats, and Pavel Petrovich in particular resents the upstart Bazarov. Their clash soon culminates in a highly symbolic duel suggesting, especially in its aftermath, that while the Bazarovs may initially gain the upper hand, there is much to be said for the older generation, which should not be written off so quickly. Nikolai Petrovich is more moderate, abandoning tradition to the extent of taking a lower-class woman as a mistress and even having a child with her, yet aware enough to constantly worry about offending his brother. He can sympathize with Bazarov and is even willing to listen to his ideas but above all simply wants harmony. His son Arkady is at yet another place on the spectrum, respecting the elders but so nave and joyous in his youthfulness that he becomes a Bazarov disciple almost without knowing.These conflicts play out in various ways but primarily through Arkady, the only character who really changes. It can be assumed that he was squarely in familial tradition before college, where he nearly became a Bazarov clone, and he finally takes solace in love's redemptive power. There is no doubt that Turgenev thinks this last the right path - that we are supposed to think, as Arkady finally does, that Bazarovism leads only to wasteful self-destructiveness, making true happiness impossible and keeping us from doing the world any good. Some will of course disagree, but Arkady's progression is very plausibly written; it is hard not to sympathize and be glad for his eventual peace and bliss. The novel is thus among other things an excellent bildungsroman.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the book is how Turgenev dramatizes all this - and even makes his point clear - without heavy-handedness. Novels tackling such weighty issues often let didacticism overwhelm story, but Fathers and Sons is never guilty of this nearly always fatal sin. He is also a master stylist; his often lyrical prose encompasses not only dense philosophical speculation but also much sublime beauty. The last paragraph in particular is unforgettable in its precise beauty and profoundly moving sentiment - so well-written that even those who cynically disagree with the conclusion, and thus the book's overall message, cannot deny its immense power. Most notable of all is that Turgenev manages to do all this in under 250 pages. This is the greatest difference between him and the more famous Russian masters known for their thick tomes. Turgenev eschews their great attention to detail, lengthy dialogue, and long philosophical asides. Those who, like James, detested such \\"loose, baggy monsters\\" may join him in preferring Turgenev, and the differences are substantial enough that even those who dislike Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and their ilk should not pass over Turgenev automatically on account of it. That said, he shares enough of their great elements - indeed, inspired many of them - that their fans should check him out. His remarkable conciseness is certainly less intimidating, and there are many benefits to reading the Russian greats chronologically. In short, the appeal of Fathers and Sons is so great and diverse that the book is a must for practically anyone who appreciates great literature."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This is the first fiction book I've read in a long time, and I have to say I'm not too disappointed. Fathers and Sons relates not only the generation gap in 19th century Russia, but also shows how fragile and fake the entire Russian system was in that time period. Every character symbolizes an important facet of Russian society. Paul Petrovich is the old slavophile nobility, convinced that Russians and their ways are the best in the world while they wear English clothing and speak and read in French. His brother Nicholas is the bridge between the old world and the new world, trying to fit in with the new ways while he only understands the old customs. Arcady, who represents those in society who outwardly follow the latest trendy beliefs but can't shake their emotions or their humanity. And Barazov, who represents youth, with its eternal promise of new ideas and ways, but who are blind to their own naive hypocrisy. Certainly there are other characters, but these major figures shape the plot of the book.Turgenev manages to leave no stone unturned, casting withering attacks on peasants, psuedo-intellectualism, government officials, corruption, and conventions. The book mentions that Turgenev alienated and angered many in Russia with this book, and the reader will quickly see why.Turgenev recognized the backwardness of Russia, and that it must change if it were to survive in a new world. The big question was how, and Turgenev shows that while idealists like Bazarov may have new ideas (Bazarov's idea was nihilism, a belief in nothing), those ideas mean nothing if not backed up with solutions to the problems.An excellent book, and very readable. The price is low enough that most people really don't have an excuse to give this one a shot."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"In Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, as in most of Chekhov, nothing much really happens. People talk a lot and that's about it. Should be dull, right? But it isn't. The talk, and the characters revealed, reflect the profound changes that were being felt in Russian society at the end of the 19th Century; changes that would set the stage for much of what was to happen in the 20th Century. But more important to a modern reader, the ideas and the real life implication of those ideas are as current and relevant as when Turgenev wrote. Bazarov, the young 'nihilist', sounds just like the typical student rebel of the 60's (or of the Seattle WTO protests just recently). He has the arrogance and the innocence of idealistic youth. He is as believeable, and as moving in his ultimate hurt, as any young person today might be confronted with the limitations of idealism and the fickle tyranny of personal passion.I loved this book when I first read it as a teenager and I enjoyed it even more on subsequent rereadings. It makes the world of 19th century Russia seem strangely familiar and it gives many a current political thread a grounding in meaningful history."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"The one factor that keeps being brought up in other reviews is the apparent lack of plot. A key point is not being brought in; the nature of Russian literature is to create a socially conscious society. While American and European authors can enter whatever realms they choose and write vivid, thrilling stories, Russian novelists enter a more subdued state. Their concern is not whether their readers are on the edge of their seats in suspense, their concern is that society be made aware of the changes and problems that are arising.'Fathers and Sons' achieves that very well, pitting old Muscovite traditions against the new Western ideas. It's not a page turner, because it isn't supposed to be.I thought it was a brilliant piece. Turgenev outlines quite clearly using only a handful of characters just how opposed the two sides of Russia are. And in the end, he makes very clear that one will have to give. The story is made better because Turgenev shows no favoritism. He carries out his job as an author to the letter: to present the problem, without offering the solution. That is for the reader to decide.And as the book draws to a close, the reader is left wondering, 'Which direction is better?'"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This is such a wonderful novel about two young men returning home from University - Arkady Kirsanov and his friend, Yevgeny who is known mostly as Basarov. Firstly they stop at Arkady's father's poor farm - but he is a landowner. Arkady's father's name is Nikolai and living with him is his brother Pavel. What contrasts we immediately meet - Nikolai whose wife has died (Arkady's mother) but who is living with one of the local peasant women (Fenitchka) and has a son by her, and Pavel whose playboy life collapsed when the princess he hoped to marry rejected him.So here we have two young men with all the potential of their living beings contrasted with Nikolai and Pavel and their strange life outcomes. What complicates the matter is that Basarov is a nihilist - someone called him the first 'angry young man'. He is cynical and argumentative - prepared to accept Nikolai's simple innocence and honesty in living, unprepared to tolerate Pavel's Anglophile airs and graces.The young men move on to Basarov's parent's place (simple folk living a traditional old age) but on the way meet Madame Odintsova - quickly called Odintsov (presumably because she is widowed). They spend some time with Odintsov and we learn her name is Anna Sergyevna. Anna lives with her younger sister Katya and and older aunt. The contrasts are once again evident. Anna has no feeling for Arkady at all and quickly Arkady and Katya become friends as Anna and Basarov fascinate each other. But Basarov is appalled at his romantic feelings - not what he expects a nihilist should experience! And when Odintsov's flirting causes him to express that love he has to flee to his parent's place horrified by what he has felt.But he is no more at home with his parents whose love and affection overwhelms him, so the young men return to the Kirsanov's farm, stopping briefly at Odintsov's country residence where they are not really welcomed. However Arkady, home again, is ill at ease and has to return to Odintsov, leaving Basarov behind. What happens at Odintsov's residence is perhaps not unexpected, what happens at the Kirsanov's farm - with Fenitchka and Pavel is remarkable. Eventually Basarov joins Arkady at Madame Odintsov's before returning home. The outcomes I will leave to Turgenev.As a mid-fifties person myself I can readily identify with Nikolai and Pavel who see themselves as old, although they too are only fiftyish. But we all have memories and I can see myself as Basarov and Arkady - in some ways each of them, but in no ways entirely either of them. While, as a young man, I too had ideals (anarchist rather than nihilist) that I used to obscure other things in my life, subsequent experiences in my life have lead me to regret that path my life took for a while. Turgenev's outcome for Basarov is entirely in accord with my view. But what then of Pavel?Perhaps the most extraordinary thing for me about this beautiful novel is that at the end - but not during the novel - I loved each and every one of the characters. The title of this review is a quote (p203 Konemann edition) and it is my feelings that are immensely positive from reading this book.Other recommended reading:For a non-Russian view of Russian people read 'Under Western Eyes' by Joseph Conrad"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This book is known mostly, perhaps, for the character of Bazarov, widely considered the vanguard of nihilism in literature, especially in Russia. Bazarov is a significant fact of fiction, a sketch of the young middle class intellegentsia developing in Russia in the second half of the 19th century. Brash, self-confident, iconoclastic, educated young men like Bazarov were popping up all over Russia. Turgenev finds a way to tie this into a rich tapestry of love, familial relationships, and simplicity that Arkady and Bazarov, the young men, succumb to. Even in his determination to change the world by destroying it so it can be rebuilt, Bazarov does not overcome the strong bonds of family. Love and family has the sort of redemptive power found so often in War and Peace, and indeed, Turgenev writes from a similar perspective and on a similar wavelength as Tolstoy. This book, while not big on plot, is to be appreciated for blending its simple prose with a poetic passion in showing how love between fathers and sons is ageless, and love between men and women occurs. I found the last passage very moving."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Turgenev's Fathers and Sons is a timeless novel. Set in mid-19th century Russia it follows a few weeks in the lives of two young men, Arkadi and Bazarov. Turgenev sets the characters beliefs against each other and against themselves.Fathers and Sons operates on many levels, a story of generation vs generation, of ideology vs love, new vs old and friend vs friend. Turgenev takes the pair on a journey through rural Russia. Each stop along the journey sets up the scenario for the tensions and revelations of the characters.The character of Bazarov is one of the most vivid characters in literature. The timeless representation of a brash bright young man ready to teach the world everything it's doing wrong.When Fathers and Sons was first published it caused outrage on both the right and the left in Russia. Both sides believed their characterizations were overdone and many never forgave him.Fathers and Sons is highly recommended. Easily one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Turgenev's novel is a poignant portrayal of life's transition: of young men and women entering adulthood, and parents entering old age and possible obscurity. The parents, like Nickolai and Vassily, seem to venerate their children like paupers to princes, seeing them as heirs to the world. The old Romantics seem lost in the new Nihilist world that Bazarov, Arcady, and even Sitnikov are preaching. The generations are at a crossroads: while the older generation tries to understand and leave the reigns for its descendants, the younger people feel invincibly wise and superior, and yet unknowing of what to do with their lives.Bazarov assumes too much. His arrogance is overwhelming and irritating. He talks to his hosts, including parents, like they are children, and yet takes every luxury and resource they offer him. He never fails to take all that is given. His father showers him with love and kindness, shelter and money, and yet Bazarov will not even allow his father to hold a conversation with him, and stops him each time his father wishes to express himself to his son in his own way. Even more aggravating is Bazarov's action toward Fenichka. Nickolai offers him a roof and room, food, comfort - all for a virtual stranger - without complaint, and yet Bazarov sees fit to seduce the mother of his child. His regret is short-lived, and pride follows.At this point most would tend to like the aristocratic character of Paul, who defends his brother's honor without anything to gain himself. While a duel is a rather foolish affair it nevertheless let Bazarov know that there are consequences to his unremorseful actions. And in the end, the reader can see the sincere kindness that Arcady had tried to convince Bazarov that Paul had, but that his mentor did not believe. Bazarov is certainly a force in the book, but Paul seems to be the most effective catalyst to the rest of the characters. I did not quite understand the reference in the book to Paul being a corpse at first, but I supposed it meant that he had changed forever, that he would never again see his aristocratic pretenses in the same way again.Arcady is another likable character in the book, although his maturation and break with Bazarov seemed frustratingly slow at times. He keeps to a truer degree an idea of equality among classes, while Bazarov says it but doesn't seem to really believe it, and talks to them more as an aristocrat at times than an equal. Yet at the same time, Arcady retains his father's Romantic nature, and is thus able to function more effectively throughout the book. Bazarov, in contrast, seems to feel the need to move on to a different place each time his strict belief system is compromised. It is no coincidence, I'm sure, that most of the Romantics seem to go on living extraordinary lives in the end while Bazarov does not and Sitnikov is miserable, and even Madame Odintzov, who was infatuated with and much like Bazarov, does not find true love or happiness. Indeed, it is the end of the novel, being Bazarov's fate, which gives the story its true emotional weight. It is a well-written tale of generations that is certainly worth the journey."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"I'm still a little disoriented at this Amazon site. I'm not sure if this is the Edmonds translation circa 1960s or not. That is when I first read this novel and it is the copy I still own. The Penguin Classics version is the one I am referring to. I've written other critiques, thinking I was talking about Penguins, only to subsequently discover I was on the wrong entry. If this is indeed the Edmonds-Penguin edition, let me first refer the reader to the eloquent and unsurpassed introduction by Isaiah Berlin. It runs for 50+ pages, but is the most precise, uncorrupted look at mid-19th century Russian literature that I have come across. If you want a supreme overview by a great thinker on a great subject, go directly to this introduction, do not pass go. If you have even indirectly perused The New York Review of Books, you know who Berlin is, and how revered a thinker he is. Here he sums up pre-revolutionary Russia in a few pithy phrases. He also speaks for me and for those of my particular generation who are caught between ideologies, as the &quot;liberals&quot; in Turgenev's time were. On Turgenev, the author: &quot;He went on believing - perhaps this was a relic of his Hegelian youth - that no issue was closed for ever, that every thesis must be weighed against its antithesis, that systems and absolutes of every kind - social aand political no less than religious - were a form of dangerous idolatry.&quot; This is a novel about a &quot;superfluous&quot; man who was trapped between ideologies in 19th centrury Russia, when the young &quot;nihilists&quot; were at odds with the old-line liberals. This is what makes the novel so relevant in any age. There are always going to be clashes between generations and between those who hope for the &quot;de-struction&quot; of an old edifice for an only partially imagined design for a new one. Turgenev presents us with perhaps the most truthful representation of this timeless, generational conflict. Russian literature is essentially a triumvirate : Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev. If I were a manager, I would probably have Turgenev bat leadoff. He gets his point across better than the other two, though he doesn't have the bat speed. Chekov or Pushkin (though not in the triumvirate) could bat second, depending on who was hot at the time. I would have a really difficult time deciding between Tolstoy or Dostoevsky for clean-up hitter. E-mail me for your votes. I would also like some reader feedaback as to the origin of the word &quot;nihilst&quot; or nihilism. I doubt sincerely whether Turgenev coined the term. It sounds more like Bakunin or Herzen to me. What are your thoughts on the subject?"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"I think the thing I enjoyed most about \\"Fathers and Sons\\" was that it was short. The great Russian classics we generally think of are \\"War and Peace\\", \\"Crime and Punishment\\", etc. These are all long, drawn out books. \\"Fathers and Sons\\", thankfully, is short(er), with fewer characters and less confusion as to which person is which, especially since few have similar last names. Confusion does arise between Nicholas Petrovich and Paul Petrovich, his brother. There it is important to remember who is who, but luckily, their personalities are very different and it becomes clear very soon.Another thing that is nice about \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is that it's different. It is not a book of great dramatic fighting (though there is one). It feels human and realistic. All the characters have both virtues and flaws that are easy to relate to. The ending is sad, but at the same time it is happy. It doesn't feel over-done, and I especially liked how the romance stuck in was sweet and not too out-there.The book also reflects the difficulties Russia had during that period of time. Things were changing and some didn't welcome the change as much as others. Things that had once been acceptable became strange, and the people who believed in the old things became outdated. This book shows the concept of a generation gap beautifully while maintaining an interesting plot and characters.I recommend it, partially because it's simply a good book, and partially because it shows that not all Russian classics must be long, drawn-out, and with lots of complicated names. Turgenev, who came before Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, will hopefully remain with them on the literary level for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (A Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev, who lived through 1818-83, is thought to be one of the finest Russian writers. He studied in Moscow, St Petersburg and Berlin, then became a strong advocate of Russia's westernization. Here we see his masterpiece \\"Fathers and Sons\\" which I personally came across through the recommendation of a close friend.Turgenev is a master of engaging the reader through the complexities of his characters. While you may initially feel contempt for some them, the more you learn of their contrasting personalities, you will eventually love them all in the end. If not for their beliefs and actions story-wise, then for how deep and well thought-out their various histories are. You may find yourself endlessly devouring page after page, wanting to know more about these fascinating people he's created.For me, reading this book was like opening my eyes to a world I long neglected. In the next few days, I will no doubt find myself hunting down more of his works. In \\"Fathers and Sons\\" he focuses on every character's humanity and principles, then lets it all play out with such craft and unmistakable skill. From their conflicts and influences with each other, every character develops and yet remains the same.Every scene he creates, is depicted vividly, with descriptions of subtle details in the backgrounds bringing his world to life. From the effortless way he lets the reader see his visions, we can easily grasp the character of his creations, their moods, their thoughts, and how we can relate to their emotions. It is certainly a crime for someone who's even remotely interested in novels not to read this book. And for those who aren't, they shouldn't neglect reading this either, they might just find something they will love."},{"Title":"The myths of Greece & Rome","review":"This book features a selection of Roman and Greek myths, in addition to several short summaries of stories such as the Iliad, the Alliad, and the Oddesy. In addition, it contains many passages from such poets as Homer, Shakespeare, and several others of a more modern origin. Written in fine, if rather flowery script, this book portrays its myths just as one would assume the ingenious writers and story tellers who created them would like them to be told. A vast accomplishment, this document has been printed and reprinted ever since it was first written over a hundred years ago. Every known god or goddess is allotted their tales, which include various versions, stating the details that differ from version to version. Colorful descriptions of each deity are accompanied by a complete list of their many different names. Both new and old versions of the book are still available. As an added bonus, it does not have a bias towards other religions, but approaches the subject in a slightly more scientific manner."},{"Title":"The myths of Greece & Rome","review":"The book description mentions that it includes ilustrations from recognized painters, but the book does not include anyone, only the one in the cover.

Herein lies some of the most superb classical poetry produced within the last half century, a testament to the superlative skill, intuition, and brilliance of the author.Seldom will one find such high calibre writing, particularly from the ranks of contemporary writers. Reminiscent of the gothic imagery of Edgar Allen Poe, this poet entwines classical style and mythological references with truly inspirational sentiment and theology. In the epic poem, The Serpent's Left Hand, one is truly horrified by the imagery of Hell, and yet, equally inspired by the sublime grandeur of Heaven. Concurrently, the lasting metaphors presented in The Siege at Caerphilly demonstrate the heights and depths of which the human spirit is capable.Obligatory reading for any individual who might truly understand the nature of man."},{"Title":"RUNAWAY SPACESHIP#30 (Choose Your Own Adventure)","review":"One of Edward Packard's attempts at writing a book for younger readers (2-3 grade) this one is more about illistration than actual writing.You have an uncle who works in the space program and have been invited for a tour of the area. Your bossy (and obviously disobedient) cousin drags you onto a rocket to get a closer look. After she fiddles around with some wires you're out in space! Well, you can either try to stop the ship or let it take you to mars. Both choices give you a completely different story line so you have some interesting possibilities. While it doesn't actually SAY you die during the course of the stroy some of the endings do end up that way (logically speaking).There is but one alien race in this particular story so if you're looking for a book that talks about another planet or space exploration forget it. You can only visit Earth, and Mars ...

The suffering of the Armenians during World War I are lesser known than that of the Bosnians in the mid-1990's. However, the story of the Vertreibung, until now, has been obscured by the German war-guilt following the Second World War.For centuries, ethnic Germans had migrated eastward in search of a better life. Hitler's corruption of this aspiration sounded their death knell. Upon the collapse of the Wehrmacht in the east, the resurgent governments of Eastern Europe took their revenge upon their German-speaking citizens, using methods and tactics no more civilized than their former Nazi masters. The ethnic Germans of Southeastern Europe, many of whom were innocent farming folk who had lived there for centuries, bore the brunt of this wrath.\\"A Pebble in My Shoe,\\" recounts the experiences of two such ethnic German families: the Hoegers and the Flotzes. This odyssey begins with a chronicle of the simple life they enjoyed as children growning up in the Batschka, the fertile basin of the Danube River in what was then Northern Yugoslavia and Hungary. It ends with salvation found in the promise of America. In between is a three-year tale of hardship, anguish and the ultimate victory of faith and perserverence over cruelty and vengeance.From the horrors of the concentration camp in Gakowa, Yugoslavia, to the impressment of ethnic Germans who were deported to forced labor camps in the Soviet Union, \\"A Pebble in My Shoe\\" is a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Katherine Flotz brings to life the untold story of those whose only sin was that they spoke the same language as the Nazi Regime.At a time when it is only too easy to generalize about racial and religious groups, \\"A Pebble in My Shoe\\" is a poignant reminder that the innocent should never be made to pay for the sins of the guilty."},{"Title":"A Pebble in My Shoe","review":"A great read for us who have tired of endless fiction.

But in Communist Eastern Europe all hell broke loose for millions of Ethnic Germans. Revenge was taken on young and old. Families were torn apart for no other reason then to obtain vengeance. Many people died. The majority of the victims who survived those brutal years still carry these memories in silence. Very few people have dared to go back and recall that time - let alone put down their memories on paper because the pain is to great.Childhood became none existing. Hunger, sorrow, fear and confusion was what children experienced in their daily lives. As one grows up sometimes that lost child within begs to be set free, to tell the world what it was like growing up during that time. Katherine Hoeger Flotz has listened to her inner child and set it free in A PEBBLE IN MY SHOE. She has taken the painful road back to revisit her childhood in Gagowa, Yugoslavia, and the long trail that finally led her to America. Next to Katherine's story we find her husbands story, running parallel to hers. Both stories come together in America and end when George and Katherine become a family.I applaud Katherine for having written A PEBBLE IN MY SHOE. We need more books like hers.
